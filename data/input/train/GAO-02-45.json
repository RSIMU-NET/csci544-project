these were never fully integrated. consequently, hud had never achieved operational efficiency, mission clarity or organizational unit. the \u201cstovepipes\u201d of hud\u2019s program offices, the office of housing (housing), public and indian housing (pih), fair housing and equal opportunity (fheo), and community planning and development (cpd), operated essentially independently. they often duplicated each others\u2019 efforts and at times worked at cross purposes, making it difficult for communities to effectively access hud\u2019s services. to eliminate the duplications and in anticipation of more downsizing, the plan reorganized hud by function. expected benefits included stronger management controls; improved program accountability; uniform standards for early detection of fraud, waste, and abuse; more expertise among staff; centralizing specialized work allowing field staff to focus on monitoring; greater flexibility; and greater efficiency.", "appendix ii: status
