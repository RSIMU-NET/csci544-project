council resolution 1160, condemning the excessive use of force by yugoslavian security forces against civilians in kosovo and also established an embargo against yugoslavia on arms and materials. the first meeting between yugoslavian president milosevic and dr. rugova, the leader of the shadow government in kosovo, to lay the groundwork for peace talks. north atlantic treaty organization (nato) alliance began planning for a phased air operation. u.s. european command established joint task force flexible anvil, a u.s. navy-led command, to plan and conduct a limited air response (quick strike, limited duration operation). u.s. european command activated joint task force sky anvil, an air force-led command, to plan for a phased air operation (gradually escalating military air operation, targeting yugoslavia\u2019s air defense system, command and control sites, fielded forces, and targets of military significance first in kosovo, then in the rest of yugoslavia). the united nations security council passed resolution 1199, which called for a cease fire in yugoslavia, the withdrawal of all yugoslavian security forces, the access for nongovernmental and humanitarian organizations, and the return home of refugees and internally displaced persons. nato defense ministers authorized an \u201cactivation warning\u201d for limited air strikes and a phased air campaign in kosovo. u.s. european command ordered both joint task forces to disband after they finalized u.s. planning in support of nato planning. nato\u2019s contingency planning efforts continued through march 1999. the united nations released a report critical of yugoslavia\u2019s compliance with the most recent security council resolution. based on an agreement between the organization for security and co-operation in europe and yugoslavia, a kosovo verification mission was established. the purpose of the kosovo verification mission was to verify yugoslavia\u2019s compliance with the united
