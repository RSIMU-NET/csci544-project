Breakpoints are a required part of an antibiotic\u0092s label and are used by providers to determine appropriate treatments. FDAAA provided a financial incentive for antibiotic innovation and required FDA to hold a public meeting on antibiotic incentives and innovation.

As of November 2011, FDA had not yet confirmed whether the breakpoints on the majority of reference-listed antibiotics labels were up to date. FDA contacted sponsors of 210 antibiotics in early 2008 to remind sponsors of the importance of maintaining their labels and requested that they assess whether the breakpoints on their drugs\u0092 labels were up to date. Sponsors were asked to submit evidence to FDA showing that the breakpoints were either current or needed revision. As of November 2011, over 3.5 years after FDA contacted sponsors, the agency had not yet confirmed whether the breakpoints on the labels of 70 percent, or 146 of the 210 antibiotics, were up to date.

For those submissions FDA has received, it has often taken over a year for FDA to complete its review. Officials attributed this delay to reviewers\u0092 workload, challenging scientific issues or difficulties in obtaining needed data, and incomplete submissions. FDA also issued guidance to clarify sponsors\u0092 responsibility to evaluate and maintain up-to-date breakpoints. The guidance reminded sponsors that they are required to maintain accurate labels and stated that certain sponsors should submit an evaluation of breakpoints on their antibiotic labels to FDA annually. However, FDA has not been systematically tracking whether sponsors are providing these annual updates.

Meanwhile, the number of new antibiotics has steadily decreased since  the 1980s. The limited number of antibiotics under development is a  matter of concern for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the  agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)  responsible for overseeing the safety and effectiveness of drugs  marketed in the United States.

Although sponsors are required to maintain up-to-date breakpoints on  their labels, FDA has acknowledged that many antibiotics are labeled with  outdated breakpoints. Outdated breakpoints can result in health care  providers unknowingly selecting ineffective treatments, which can also  contribute to additional bacterial resistance to antibiotics.", "Monitoring breakpoints on labels and keeping them up to date can be a  challenging process. The most accurate way to monitor and determine if  a breakpoint on a label is up to date is to conduct both clinical trials and  laboratory studies, but these can be difficult and expensive and may not  be appropriate in all circumstances. For example, clinical trials require the  enrollment of large numbers of patients, which may be difficult to achieve,  to ensure an understanding of a drug\u2019s safety and effectiveness against  specific bacteria. Enrollment may also be difficult for clinical trials  involving antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Unlike clinical trials for a new  cancer drug, for example, where researchers are able to target drugs to a  patient population with a specific type of cancer, this may not necessarily  be the case for antibacterial drugs. There are no rapid diagnostic tests  available to help a researcher identify patients with antibiotic-resistant  infections who would be eligible for such trials. Laboratory studies, such  as susceptibility testing, can be less costly than clinical trials; however,  they still require significant microbiology expertise.

According to FDA officials, it should take 1 to 3 months for  the agency to review such submissions when staff are available and the  submissions include all of the necessary information. However, it took  FDA longer than a year to review many of the submissions it received,  and as of November 2011, FDA still had a backlog of five submissions  from 2008. FDA officials identified four factors that have contributed to the  lengthy time between when the agency received a submission and when  it completed its review. First, FDA officials explained that the submissions  sent in response to the agency\u2019s 2008 letter generated a larger number of  supplements than normal, adding significantly to FDA\u2019s existing workload  of label supplements. Second, some of the submissions required  significantly more resources to review than typical label supplements,  because of challenging scientific issues or difficulties obtaining data.  Third, some of the sponsors\u2019 submissions were inaccurate or did not  include all necessary information. Fourth, FDA staff spent a significant  amount of time answering questions from sponsors, tracking responses,  and following up when needed.", "Some of the sponsors we obtained comments from expressed frustration  at how long it took FDA to review their submissions, especially given that  bacterial resistance to antibiotics is not static and breakpoints may  continue to change over time. Specifically, 3 of the 26 sponsors we  obtained comments from stated that they are concerned that the  breakpoints they submitted may be outdated by the time FDA completes  its review.

First,  nearly all of these 146 antibiotics are reference-listed drugs\u2014thus, in  addition to the labels of these drugs, the labels of the generic antibiotics  that follow the labels of the reference-listed antibiotics are also uncertain.  Second, because bacterial resistance to antibiotics is not static, some of  the breakpoints for the 64 antibiotics that FDA has confirmed through its  review as up to date may have since become out of date. Third, FDA\u2019s list  of 210 drugs did not include a complete list of all the antibiotics for which  sponsors are responsible for evaluating and maintaining the breakpoints  on their labels. For example, FDA did not include any brand-name drugs  that were discontinued at the time the agency compiled its list, and also  did not include some antibiotics that were reference-listed drugs at that  time. FDA officials were unsure how many antibiotics were omitted, but  estimated that the number was low. Given the uncertainty surrounding the  146 antibiotics whose breakpoints have not yet been confirmed as well as  the antibiotics omitted from FDA\u2019s 2008 request to sponsors, more than  two-thirds of reference-listed antibiotic labels may contain out-of-date  breakpoints."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA Issued Guidance on Sponsors\u2019 Responsibility to Evaluate and Maintain Up- to-Date Breakpoints, but Has Not Been Tracking Their Responses", "paragraphs": ["Another step FDA took to implement the FDAAA provision regarding  preserving the effectiveness of antibiotics was to issue guidance that  reminded sponsors of the requirement to maintain accurate labels, and  thus, their responsibility to keep information about breakpoints up to   FDA officials stated that in part because the agency received  date.questions in response to its 2008 letters, officials determined that it would  be useful to issue guidance.

Of these 15, 7 sponsors  expressed some form of confusion regarding their responsibility. Five of  these 7 sponsors stated that their strategy for ensuring that the  breakpoints on their generic antibiotic labels were up to date was to follow  the breakpoints on the label of the corresponding brand-name drug. Two  of the 5 were even more specific and added that their generic antibiotics  were only designated reference-listed drugs \u201cby default\u201d and that their  strategy was to follow the label of the brand-name drug\u2014even if the  brand-name drug was discontinued.

A seventh sponsor  understood the responsibilities associated with having a generic antibiotic  that was designated a reference-listed drug, but was under the  impression that its generic antibiotic was not a reference-listed drug.", "FDA officials told us that it is a sponsor\u2019s responsibility to routinely  monitor FDA\u2019s Orange Book to determine if any of its drugs become  designated a reference-listed drug. However, FDA\u2019s June 2009 guidance  is silent on sponsors\u2019 responsibility to consistently monitor the Orange  Book to determine if one of their drugs has become, or ceases to be, a  reference-listed drug. The officials acknowledged that there is no process  or mechanism for notifying sponsors when one of their drugs becomes, or  is no longer, a reference-listed drug. The guidance was also not explicit  about FDA\u2019s view that the responsibility described in the guidance also  applied to sponsors of discontinued brand-name antibiotics.", "The guidance also explained that FDA intended to comply with FDAAA\u2019s  requirement that it identify, periodically update, and make publicly  available up-to-date breakpoints by using two approaches. First, the  guidance explained that the agency would review breakpoints referenced  in the labeling of individual drug products and post any approved labels  on the Internet. FDA officials told us that this is the approach FDA has  thus far used to make up-to-date breakpoints publicly available. Second,  FDA\u2019s guidance also stated that it would, when appropriate, recognize  standards used to determine breakpoints from one or more standards-  FDA  setting organizations and publish these in the Federal Register.has not yet used this approach and did not mention a specific plan or  timetable to do so. FDA officials told us that publishing this information in  the Federal Register could make the review process quicker as sponsors  would then have ready access to standards already recognized by FDA.", "For example, publishing this information may be helpful for some  sponsors, such as those that do not have the microbiology expertise to  update their own breakpoints. While FDA officials said that they have  been making updated breakpoints publicly available, the agency\u2019s  guidance regarding these alternative approaches may be causing  confusion among some sponsors that are anticipating the publication of  breakpoints from standards-setting organizations in the Federal Register.

FDA officials noted that  because it is a narrowly targeted provision, they are unsure if any existing  racemic drug could qualify. None of the drug sponsors from which we  obtained comments said that this FDAAA provision provided a sufficient  incentive to develop a new antibiotic of this type.", "FDA officials stated that it was unlikely that this provision would have an  impact on antibiotic innovation. The officials stated that the requirement  that the single enantiomer of the approved drug be in a separate  therapeutic category would be challenging for antibiotic sponsors to meet.  The officials noted that this market exclusivity was not limited to  antibiotics. One drug sponsor we spoke with stated that it is pursuing this  market exclusivity for a drug that is not an antibiotic.", "The lack of NDAs for antibiotics submitted in response to this FDAAA  provision is consistent with the overall trend in the approval of innovative  antibiotic NDAs. The number of annual approvals of antibiotic NMEs from  2001 through 2010 has not changed significantly since the passage of  FDAAA. Specifically, the annual number of antibiotic NME approvals was  two or less for the years prior to, and one or less for the years following,  the enactment of FDAAA. Because drug development is a lengthy  process\u2014sponsors spend, on average, 15 years developing a new  drug\u2014it may be too early to ascertain the full impact of FDAAA on  antibiotic innovation.

The meeting provided an  opportunity to gather input from stakeholders and address their concerns.  However, although potential new incentives and changes to current ones  were suggested at the meeting, many of these suggestions\u2014such as tax  incentives and extended market exclusivities\u2014would require a statutory  change.", "One of the discussion topics at the public meeting related to the  circumstances under which antibiotics could qualify for incentives  provided under the Orphan Drug Act, which is intended to stimulate the  development of drugs for rare diseases\u2014conditions that affect fewer than  200,000 people in the United States. Following the public meeting, FDA  responded in writing to an inquiry from one stakeholder to clarify that an  antibiotic could qualify for an orphan drug designation when the drug\u2019s  use is restricted to the treatment of a small population of patients with an  infection caused by a specific pathogen. Our examination of FDA data  suggests that orphan drug designation is not common for antibiotics.  These data show that the annual number of antibiotics that received an  orphan drug designation from 2001 to 2007\u2014when FDAAA was  enacted\u2014was three drugs or fewer each year. The number of antibiotics  that received orphan drug designation following FDAAA\u2019s enactment in  2007 has remained constant at this rate through 2010. Additionally, not all  antibiotics that have been awarded orphan drug designation have been or  will apply to be approved for marketing.

Although  FDAAA contained a provision to encourage the development of certain  antibiotics, no sponsor has submitted an application for a new drug that  meets the law\u2019s specific criteria. FDAAA also recognized that up-to-date  breakpoints are vital to preserving the effectiveness of antibiotics.  Antibiotic labels containing out-of-date breakpoints can lead clinicians to  choose less effective treatments and provide additional opportunities for  bacteria to develop resistance. Out-of-date breakpoints on labels of  reference-listed antibiotics also have a ripple effect on the accuracy of the  labels of other antibiotics because other sponsors must match the labels  of the corresponding reference-listed drugs. However, more than 4 years  after FDAAA\u2019s enactment, there continues to be uncertainty about the  accuracy of the labels of more than two thirds of reference-listed  antibiotics, as well as those of the generic antibiotics that are required to  follow these drugs\u2019 labels.", "The steps FDA has taken since the enactment of FDAAA have been  insufficient to ensure that all antibiotics have up-to-date breakpoints on  their labels. The agency has acted with neither decisiveness nor a sense  of urgency. First, FDA has not yet completed reviewing the submissions it  received in response to its 2008 request and many sponsors still have not  provided FDA with needed information. Further, FDA officials told us that  they sent letters to sponsors of 210 antibiotics. These sponsors were  responsible for evaluating and maintaining, and if necessary, updating the  breakpoints on their labels; however, FDA\u2019s request was not made to all  the antibiotic sponsors that held this responsibility. While the agency did  follow up with sponsors, this was not done in a timely manner. FDA\u2019s  review of sponsors\u2019 submissions has also been time-consuming; given  that sponsors are expected to provide information on the effectiveness of  these breakpoints annually. It is unclear how the agency plans to keep up  with this workload if sponsors\u2019 fulfillment of this responsibility improves.", "Second, FDA\u2019s issuance of guidance to specify the responsibilities of  antibiotics\u2019 sponsors to evaluate breakpoints appears to have been  unsuccessful at encouraging all sponsors to fulfill these responsibilities.  The comments we received from drug sponsors indicate that some  antibiotic sponsors remain confused about this responsibility\u2014either  because they did not know that their antibiotics were reference-listed  drugs or because they interpreted the June 2009 FDA guidance  differently than FDA intended. Without formal notification that their  antibiotics have been designated as reference-listed drugs and a  clarification of their responsibilities, sponsors may continue to be unaware  of, or have differing interpretations of a responsibility that ultimately helps  preserve antibiotic effectiveness.", "The pace of FDA\u2019s actions\u2014many of which remain incomplete\u2014means  that the majority of antibiotics we examined may have out-of-date  breakpoints on their labels that could result in the prescription of  ineffective treatments by health care providers and further contribute to  antibiotic resistance.

HHS summarized the approach FDA used to address the provision in  FDAAA related to antibiotic effectiveness and highlighted the challenges  sponsors face in obtaining currently relevant and adequate scientific data  to assess antibiotic breakpoints.
