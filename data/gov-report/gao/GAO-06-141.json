GAO developed a red, yellow, green assessment framework to (1) assess the condition of 30 selected equipment items from across the four military services, and (2) determine the extent to which DOD has identified near- and long-term program strategies and funding plans to ensure that these items can meet defense requirements. GAO selected these items based on input from the military services, congressional committees, and our prior work. These 30 equipment items included 18 items that were first assessed in GAO's 2003 report."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While the fleet-wide condition of the 30 equipment items GAO selected for review varied, GAO's analysis showed that reported readiness rates declined between fiscal years 1999 and 2004 for most of these items. The decline in readiness, which occurred more markedly in fiscal years 2003 and 2004, generally resulted from (1) the continued high use of equipment to support current operations and (2) maintenance issues caused by the advancing ages and complexity of the systems. Key equipment items--such as Army and Marine Corps trucks, combat vehicles, and rotary wing aircraft--have been used well beyond normal peacetime use during deployments in support of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. DOD is currently performing its Quadrennial Defense Review, which will examine defense programs and policies for meeting future requirements. Until the department completes this review and ensures that condition issues for key equipment are addressed, DOD risks a continued decline in readiness trends, which could threaten its ability to continue meeting mission requirements. The military services have not fully identified near- and long-term program strategies and funding plans to ensure that all of the 30 selected equipment items can meet defense requirements. GAO found that, in some cases, the services' near-term program strategies have gaps in that they do not address capability shortfalls, funding is not included in DOD's 2006 budget request, or there are supply and maintenance issues that may affect near-term readiness. Additionally, the long-term program strategies and funding plans are incomplete for some of the equipment items GAO reviewed in that future requirements are not identified, studies are not completed, funding for maintenance and upgrades was limited, or replacement systems were delayed or not yet identified. Title 10 U.S.C. 2437 requires the military services to develop sustainment plans for equipment items when their replacement programs begin development, unless they will reach initial operating capability before October 2008. However, most of the systems that GAO assessed as red had issues severe enough to warrant immediate attention because of long-term strategy and funding issues, and were not covered by this law. As a result, DOD is not required to report sustainment plans for these critical items. For the next several years, funding to sustain or modernize aging equipment will have to compete with other DOD priorities, such as current operations, force structure changes, and replacement system acquisitions. Without developing complete sustainment and modernization plans and identifying funding needs for all priority equipment items, DOD may be unable to meet future requirements for defense capabilities. Furthermore, until DOD develops these plans, Congress will be unable to ensure that DOD's budget decisions address deficiencies related to key military equipment."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) is spending billions of dollars sustaining  and transforming the current military force structure while it is heavily  involved in operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. All of the military services  have been utilizing selected equipment items for operations in Iraq and  Afghanistan and must plan to sustain, recapitalize, or replace their existing  equipment, while concurrently planning to spend billions of dollars to  develop and procure new systems that will transform DOD\u2019s war-fighting  capabilities.", "In December 2003, we reported that the condition of 25 selected military  equipment items varied from very good to very poor and that, although the  services had program strategies for sustaining, modernizing, or replacing  most of the items reviewed, there were some gaps in those strategies. The  report further stated that for 15 of the items reviewed, the funding  requested by DOD did not appear to match the services\u2019 program strategies  to sustain or replace the items. In that report, we recommended that the  Secretary of Defense reassess the program strategies and funding priorities  for key equipment items to ensure that the equipment items are sustained  until replacement items are fielded. We also recommended that DOD  highlight for Congress the risks involved in not fully funding the  sustainment of these equipment items and the steps the department is  taking to address those risks. Congress included a provision in the Ronald  W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 that  amends Title 10 of the U.S. code to require that, whenever a new major  defense acquisition program begins development, the defense acquisition  authority responsible for that program shall develop a sustainment plan for  the existing system until the system under development replaces that  system.", "Since our December 2003 report, DOD\u2019s continued operations in Iraq and  Afghanistan have resulted in additional wear and tear on military  equipment. In fiscal years 2004 and 2005, the President requested, and  Congress appropriated, supplemental funds for ongoing military activities  in Iraq and Afghanistan that included funds to refurbish and replace  vehicles, weapons, and equipment used in the operations. In February  2005, the President presented Congress with his fiscal year 2006 budget  request and out-year projections that contained changes in DOD spending  plans and delayed the fielding of some equipment replacement systems, as  documented in DOD\u2019s Program Budget Decision 753. Congress is currently  considering this request as well as over $40 billion in additional fiscal year  2005 supplemental appropriations to include in the fiscal year 2006 regular  defense appropriation. The military services have also begun developing  the justification to request additional 2006 supplemental appropriations.  While supplemental funds may enable DOD to meet near-term war-related  equipment needs, the toll of continuing operations has raised concerns  about the ability of DOD\u2019s long-term programming and funding strategies to  meet equipment needs.", "DOD recognizes that additional wear and tear is being put on equipment  used to support ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and has  conducted a study to measure the effects of the sustained use of equipment  at levels beyond normal peacetime use and in operations outside of the  equipment\u2019s normal operating parameters. According to this study,  equipment is being used at much higher rates in combat operations than it  is in routine peacetime missions. In Iraq and Afghanistan, usage rates have  run two to eight times higher than comparable peacetime rates. In Iraq, for  example, Army Bradley Fighting Vehicles have been used at six times their  peacetime rates. Moreover, equipment is also employed in harsher  environments and in more demanding ways in these combat operations.  Although initial results of this study and related costs have been released,  DOD is continuing to assess the effects of high operating rates and harsh  conditions on equipment.", "Since congressional interest in the wear and tear being placed on military  equipment and the funding needed to reconstitute this equipment remains,  we conducted an analysis of 30 selected military equipment items,  including 18 items from our December 2003 report, to update your  committees on which key equipment items warrant attention by DOD  and/or Congress. The specific objectives of this review were to (1) assess  the fleet-wide condition of selected key equipment items and (2) determine  the extent to which DOD has identified near- and long-term program  strategies and funding plans to ensure that selected key equipment items  can meet requirements. Our assessments apply only to the 30 equipment  items we reviewed; therefore, the results cannot be projected to the entire  inventory of DOD equipment.", "We selected the 30 equipment items based upon input from the military  services, congressional committees, and our prior work. To assess the  condition of these equipment items, we obtained fleet-wide data on  equipment age, expected service life, and other specific service  performance indicators such as mission capable rates, utilization rates,  and various other metrics for fiscal years 1999 through 2004. Our  observations and assessments were made across the military services\u2014 Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps\u2014for both the active duty  inventory as well as equipment in the National Guard and reserve forces. In  assessing fleet-wide equipment condition, we also considered the extent to  which each equipment item was used for operations in Iraq or Afghanistan  and its associated performance indicators while deployed. Our review of  DOD\u2019s near- and long-term program strategies for these equipment items  focused on the extent to which the services have developed or updated  their plans to sustain, modernize, or replace the equipment items in order  to meet mission requirements. Our review of near- and long-term funding  plans focused on the extent to which the funding for the strategies is  projected in the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP). According to DOD  officials, the FYDP takes the services\u2019 priorities into consideration, while  balancing future investment and risk. We defined the near term as fiscal  years 2005, 2006, and 2007, and the long term as fiscal years 2008 and  beyond.", "To determine which equipment items require additional attention by the  department, the military services, and/or Congress, we developed an  assessment framework based on three criteria: (1) the extent of the  existence of a problem or issue, (2) the severity of the problem or issue,  and (3) how soon the problem or issue needs to be addressed. To indicate  the existence, severity, or urgency of problems identified for the 30  selected equipment items, we used a traffic light approach\u2014red, yellow, or  green\u2014as follows:  Red indicates a problem or issue that is prevalent and severe  enough to warrant immediate attention by DOD, the military services,  and/or Congress.", "Yellow indicates the existence of a problem or issue that warrants  attention by DOD, the military services, and/or Congress, and if left  unattended may worsen.", "Green indicates that we did not identify any specific problems or  issues at the time of our review or that any existing problems or issues  we identified are either not severe enough in nature to warrant  additional action or are already being addressed by DOD, the military  services, and/or Congress.", "While we attempted to obtain consistent metrics for each of the three  categories across all four of the military services, data availability varied  significantly by service and type of equipment. Our assessments, therefore,  are based on the data available from multiple sources; however, we did not  independently verify the data provided by these sources. Our assessments  also represent the problems and issues we identified at the specific point in  time that we conducted our work, and can change quickly given current  events. Although our assessments for each of the three categories\u2014 condition, near-term program strategies and funding plans, and long-term  program strategies and funding plans\u2014are largely qualitative in nature and  are derived from consensus judgments, our analyses are based on data  provided by the military services and discussions with military service  officials and program managers for the individual equipment items. We  assessed the reliability of the services\u2019 equipment readiness data by (1) comparing key data elements to our observations of equipment items at  selected units, (2) reviewing relevant documents, and (3) interviewing  knowledgeable officials. We determined that the data obtained from DOD,  the military services, and the combatant commands were sufficiently  reliable for our use. For a complete description of our methodology, see  appendix I. Appendix II contains our detailed assessments for each of the  30 equipment items. We performed our review from July 2004 through July  2005 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The September 2001 Quadrennial Defense Review outlined a strategy to  sustain and transform the military force structure that had been in place  since the mid-1990s. In that review, DOD committed to selectively  recapitalize older equipment items, which the department recognized as  being neglected for too long, to meet near-term challenges and to improve  near-term readiness. DOD is currently conducting a new Quadrennial  Defense Review, with the report scheduled to be issued in February 2006.  The results of this Quadrennial Defense Review could identify changes to  DOD\u2019s future force structure and capabilities, thereby impacting the  funding needed for both current and replacement systems.", "Based on DOD guidance, the services develop a Program Objective  Memorandum that details the specific programs and funding needed to  meet DOD requirements as determined by the Quadrennial Defense  Review. As part of this process, the services analyze alternative force  structure, weapons systems, and support systems together with their  multiyear resource implications and evaluate various trade-off options.  Basically, it is a process for balancing and integrating resources among the  various programs according to service and DOD priorities.", "The annual FYDP contains DOD\u2019s estimates of future funding needs for  programs and priorities. Through the FYDP, DOD projects costs for each  element of those programs through a period of either 5 or 6 years on the  basis of proposals made by each of the military services. The Office of the  Secretary of Defense considers the service proposals and the policy  choices made by the current administration and, where needed, makes  adjustments. For example, in preparing its 2006 budget, DOD made a  number of significant changes in its long-term acquisition plans to meet  budget targets established by the White House, as documented in Program  Budget Decision 753. The 2005 FYDP extended from fiscal year 2005 to  fiscal year 2009 and the 2006 FYDP extended from fiscal year 2006 to fiscal  year 2011."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Condition of Some Selected Equipment Has Been Degraded by the High Pace of Operations and the Advanced Age or Complexity of the Systems", "paragraphs": ["While the condition of the 30 equipment items we reviewed varied, we  found that average fleet-wide readiness rates for most of these items  declined between fiscal years 1999 and 2004. The decline in readiness  generally resulted from the high pace of recent operations and the  advanced age or complexity of the equipment systems. Therefore, we rated  the fleet-wide condition of 22 of the selected equipment items as red or  yellow. However, 8 of the 30 items\u2014including several tactical fighter  aircraft and some newer equipment items such as the Marine Corps\u2019  Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement\u2014were assessed as green (see fig. 1),  indicating that we found no specific problems that warrant additional  attention by DOD, the services, or Congress or that problems were already  being addressed. DOD is currently conducting a Quadrennial Defense  Review that will examine defense programs and policies and may change  some equipment requirements.", "Eighteen of the equipment items we reviewed for this report were also  included in our December 2003 report, and 12 of these equipment items  received the same condition assessment in both analyses. For example,  the surface ships examined in this study, the Navy\u2019s DDG-51 Arleigh Burke  Class Destroyer, the FFG-7 Oliver Hazard Perry Class Frigate, and the LPD- 4 Amphibious Transport Dock Ship received yellow condition ratings in  both studies, as did the Air Force\u2019s B-2 Spirit Bomber, the C-5 Galaxy  Transport Aircraft, and the KC-135 Stratotanker Aircraft. However, for 6 of  the items, the assessment changed\u20143 systems\u2019 fleet-wide condition  improved, 2 going from red to yellow and 1 from yellow to green, and 3  systems\u2019 condition degraded, going from green to yellow. The condition  assessments for the Marine Corps\u2019 CH-46E helicopter and the Navy\u2019s F/A-18  aircraft and Standard Missile-2 improved due, in part, to additional  maintenance efforts and improvements that appear to address the  condition concerns noted in our previous report. The condition  assessments for the Army\u2019s Abrams tank and Heavy Expanded Mobility  Tactical Truck and the Marine Corps\u2019 Light Armored Vehicle went from  green to yellow largely as a result of increased use in ongoing operations  overseas."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Some Selected Equipment Items Have Significant Condition Issues that Warrant Additional Attention by DOD, the Military Services, and/or Congress", "paragraphs": ["For many of the equipment items included in our assessment, average fleet- wide readiness rates have declined, generally due to the high pace of recent  operations or the advanced age or complexity of the systems. We assessed  the fleet-wide condition of 3 equipment items as red, indicating that  immediate attention is warranted by DOD, the services, and/or Congress to  address problems or issues. In addition, we assessed the fleet-wide  condition of 19 items as yellow, indicating that attention is warranted to  address existing problems that, if left unattended, may worsen. Table 1  below shows the primary reasons used to rate selected equipment items\u2019  condition and our assessment of those items as either red or yellow.", "Although selected equipment items have been able to meet wartime  requirements, the high pace of recent operations appears to be taking a toll  on selected equipment items and fleet-wide mission capable rates have  been below service targets, particularly in the Army and Marine Corps.  Further, according to officials, the full extent of the equipment items\u2019  degradation will not be known until a complete inspection of deployed  equipment is performed. Elevated flying hours in Iraq and Afghanistan,  coupled with the harsh desert environment, have negatively impacted  helicopters. For example, our assessment of the Army\u2019s CH-47D/F Chinook  helicopter\u2019s condition as red reflects this platform\u2019s mission capable rates,  which were consistently below service goals. Officials stated that the  aircraft is currently being flown in Iraq and Afghanistan at three times more  than planned peacetime rates. This usage has increased the amount of  maintenance and number of parts needed to sustain the aircraft, which in  turn has negatively impacted overall readiness. Ground equipment has also  been affected by high wartime usage. For example, the Marine Corps\u2019 M1A1  Abrams tank fleet, also rated as red for condition, is being negatively  impacted by operations in Iraq and a shortage of equipment maintainers  due to transfers of personnel to units that are deploying. This system failed  to meet its service readiness goals and recent trends indicate a steady  decline away from these targets.", "Several heavily used equipment items included in our review did not have  mission capable rates below their target; however, these rates have  recently declined, primarily due to the high wartime usage. For example,  while the Army\u2019s Abrams Tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicles met or  exceeded the Army mission capable goals, they are both on a downward  trend due to a shortage of spare parts and trained technicians. The shortage  of spare parts is driven by the number of vehicles either deployed or being  reset to a predeployment condition and the shortage of trained technicians  is primarily due to the number of deployed National Guard military  technicians. Both of these tracked vehicles have experienced high use in  operations overseas in the past and will likely do so in the future. Similarly,  while the readiness rates of the Marine Corps\u2019 Assault Amphibian Vehicle  varied by vehicle type in recent years, the gap between mission capable  rates and service goals increased, indicating a decline in the material  condition of this equipment."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Maintenance Issues Resulting from the Advancing Ages and Complexity of the Equipment Items", "paragraphs": ["While not all of the equipment included in our review has been heavily used  in recent overseas operations, in some cases, the advanced age or  complexity of the equipment items have contributed to readiness declines.  Many of the selected systems have either a fleet-wide average age of more  than 20 years, such as the Navy\u2019s LPD-4 Amphibious Transport Dock Ship,  or entered the inventory prior to the 1980s, such as the Air Force\u2019s KC-135  Stratotanker aircraft. These systems are likely to reach the end of their  useful lives in this decade unless major modernizations, some of which are  planned or underway, are made. Some of the problems degrading the fleet- wide condition of these aging systems include maintenance problems due  to parts shortages or obsolescence, shortages of trained maintenance  personnel, corrosion, deferred maintenance, and airframe fatigue. For  example, the Navy\u2019s P-3 Orion aircraft, while not as heavily tasked as Army  and Marine Corps helicopters, have played an important role in overseas  operations as a reconnaissance and surveillance asset despite consistently  missing their mission capable goals by a significant percentage. The  condition of the P-3 fleet, which has an average age of over 24 years, has  been primarily degraded by the effects of structural fatigue on its airframe  and the obsolescence of communication, navigation, and primary war- fighting systems in this aircraft.", "Some Air Force equipment also has age-related condition issues that  warrant attention and therefore received yellow ratings. For example,  mission capable rates for the C-5 Galaxy Transport Aircraft were  consistently below Air Force goals between fiscal years 1999 and 2004.  Officials stated that the size and age of the C-5 aircraft make it maintenance  intensive, and that component items on the aircraft are older, making it  difficult to find manufacturing sources for some parts, particularly avionics  and engine components. In addition, the KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft has  not met its mission capable goals due to issues associated with age and  corrosion, such as problems with the landing gear\u2019s steel brakes.", "Similarly, Navy surface ships examined in this study had a number of issues  related to condition and these vessels also received yellow ratings. The  Navy is challenged to maintain surface ships that are, in reality, a system of  systems. The failure of any one of these complex systems affects the entire  ship. For example, the DDG-51 Arleigh Burke Class Destroyer, the FFG-7  Oliver Hazard Perry Class Frigate and the LPD-4 Amphibious Transport  Dock Ship all had problematic subsystems, for example, operating with  limited communication ability or bandwidth, which affects their day-to-day  operations such as on-line training and personnel activities. Older ships,  such as the FFG-7 class which is, on average, almost 21 years old and the  LPD-4 class with an average age of 37 years, may be more challenging  because as the ships age, more maintenance will be required. Other older  Navy equipment also had condition issues in need of attention. For  example, the EA-6B Prowler consistently missed the Navy\u2019s mission  capable goal due to problems with communications equipment and wings."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Some Selected Equipment Items Are in Favorable Condition", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis showed that the fleet-wide condition of over one quarter of the  equipment items included in our review was generally favorable, and  consequently, we assessed the condition of 8 of the 30 selected military  equipment items as green, as shown in figure 1. Not all equipment has been  heavily used for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and for some items,  use has not increased significantly from that of planned peacetime  operations. This was the case for several tactical fighter aircraft. In our  assessment, all three selected aircraft that provide this capability, the Air  Force\u2019s F-15 Eagle/Strike Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon, and the Navy\u2019s  F/A-18 Hornet/Super Hornet, were at or near- service mission capable rate  goals.", "Moreover, we found that new equipment that has been heavily tasked in  recent operations appears to be performing well. For example, the Family  of Medium Tactical Vehicles has exceeded the Army\u2019s fully mission capable  rate goals despite operating overseas at a rate that is nine times higher than  in peacetime. In addition, the Marine Corps\u2019 Medium Tactical Vehicle  Replacement vehicles are being aggressively used in support of operations  in Iraq, but also met their mission capable goals for fiscal years 2003 and  2004. These trucks are both relatively new; the Family of Medium Tactical  Vehicles is on average 6 years old and the Medium Tactical Vehicle  Replacement is on average 3 years old.", "In addition, we assessed the fleet-wide condition of some older equipment  items favorably. For example, the average age of the Army\u2019s OH-58D Kiowa  is about 13 years with a life expectancy of 20 years; however, these  reconnaissance helicopters have met or exceeded their mission capable  goals from 1999 through 2004 while exceeding their planned flight hours in  recent operations. With an average age of almost 16 years, the M113  Armored Personnel Carrier has not experienced a significant decline in  mission readiness as a result of recent operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The Army\u2019s High Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWV) are  experiencing usage (i.e., operational tempo) that is six times their normal  peacetime rate.

One of the items that will  not be covered by this statute, the Marine Corps\u2019 CH-46E Sea Knight  helicopter, was the only item we assessed as red for its near-term program  strategy and funding plan because it may be unable to meet its near-term  requirements. We assessed the near-term program strategies and funding  plans of 19 of the 30 equipment items in our review as yellow because the  services\u2019 program strategies for sustaining equipment lack sufficient  planning or full funding to meet near-term requirements. Alternatively, the  services have planned program and funding strategies to correct equipment  deficiencies or improve equipment capabilities and safety for 10 of the 30  equipment items in our review so that the equipment items can meet near- term requirements, so we assessed their near-term program strategies and  funding plans as green as shown in figure 1.

Although the Navy has a plan to correct serious LPD-4  Amphibious Transport Dock ship class deficiencies, those ships that are within 5 years of decommissioning can, by law, only receive safety  modifications, resulting in a wide variance in the condition of ships in the  class. Furthermore, while the Navy is making structural inspections and  repairs to ensure that there will be sufficient P-3 Orion aircraft to meet day- to-day requirements next year, they have not funded some improvements to  communications and defense systems, which will continue to degrade the  ability of this aircraft to fulfill all of its missions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Some Near-Term Strategies Are Not Fully Funded in DOD\u2019s Fiscal Year 2006 Budget Request", "paragraphs": ["The full funding requirements for nine of the Marine Corps and Army near- term strategies we reviewed were not included in DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2006  budget request; therefore, we rated these equipment items as yellow as  shown in table 2.

Of the 30 equipment items we reviewed, the Marine Corps\u2019 CH-46E Sea  Knight helicopter received a red rating for its near-term program strategy  and funding plan because the service may be unable to meet its near-term  requirements due to potential aircraft and repair parts shortages caused by  the age of the aircraft. Because of fielding delays of its replacement  aircraft, the MV-22, the CH-46E will not be retired as originally scheduled,  which may lead to additional repair parts shortages. The uncertainty in  whether the near-term program strategy addresses existing parts shortages  is also a concern for items such as the Navy\u2019s F/A-18 Hornet/Super Hornet  aircraft and resulted in a yellow rating.

Continued high use of these equipment items to support  current operations and the advancing ages of the systems suggest that DOD  will be challenged in meeting future equipment requirements without  significant upgrades to its inventory. Furthermore, because activities to  refurbish and replace vehicles, weapons, and equipment used for  operations in Iraq and Afghanistan are being funded primarily through  supplemental appropriations as opposed to being programmed in DOD\u2019s  Future Years Defense Program, future funding is uncertain. Moreover, DOD  faces challenges to sustain and modernize its current equipment while  continuing these operations and transforming to a new force structure.  DOD is currently conducting its Quadrennial Defense Review, which could  change the future requirements for some military equipment. In light of  these challenges, it is increasingly important that DOD focus its resources  on the equipment items that are key to meeting future defense  requirements. Without a more focused investment strategy, DOD runs the  risk of a continued decline in future equipment readiness. While DOD is  required to provide sustainment plans, including time frames and projected  budgetary requirements, for some military equipment in accordance with  10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2437, this statute does not apply to many key military equipment  items we reviewed. For example, those equipment items that do not have a  replacement system in development are not covered by this statute. In fact,  most of the equipment items that we assessed as red because of long-term  strategy and funding issues were not covered by this statute. Without  developing complete sustainment and modernization plans and identifying  funding needs for all priority equipment items, including those not already  covered by law through the end of their expected useful lives, DOD risks  not being able to meet some future equipment requirements.

Officials stated that the most significant  factor affecting the F-16 is cracks, which occur mostly on older aircraft and  because of the stress caused by repeatedly landing without dropping its  two 2,000 pound bombs. Despite these concerns, the Air Force has plans to  address cracking. Further, although the rates for all variants are below the  goals, officials stated the F-16 was able to meet operational requirements.", "We assessed the near-term program strategy for the F-16 as green because  the Air Force has developed and funded a strategy to address known  problems. As we noted in our December 2003 report, structural issues  related to age and use are affecting the F-16. To address these concerns, the  Air Force began a structural augmentation program that strengthens the  airframe in areas prone to cracking, namely the wings and fuselage. The  structural augmentation program is expected to affect over 1200 of the  aircraft and be completed by 2013. Other near-term initiatives that are  being implemented to improve combat capabilities include the common  configuration implementation program, which incorporates improvements  to targeting, communications, and computer systems, and improvements to  radar, avionics, and targeting systems.

Parts shortages were identified as a  reason keeping rates below goals, and officials identified generators,  automatic pilot controllers, and various pump and hydraulic systems as the  items that were most often in short supply. After consolidation of the B-1  fleet in fiscal year 2002, the numbers of parts in the supply system  increased as parts were taken from retired B-1 aircraft. To compensate for  the smaller fleet size, the Air Force increased the mission capable goals  from 67 percent in fiscal year 2002 to 76 percent in fiscal year 2003. The  increase in the goal occurred as B-1 usage to support operations in Iraq and  Afghanistan increased.

The fluctuations in the fleet size, coupled with the increase in  usage for operations overseas, caused instability in the supply chain and  increased the difficulty in efficient planning of maintenance cycles. For the  near term, the Air Force has addressed this concern by increasing the  number of forecasted flight hours for fiscal year 2005, which increases the  funding for supply and maintenance activities and is expected to correct  the disparity.
