Field offices have significantly curtailed the actions they take during on-site monitoring.", "Instead, monitoring under the Grants Management System targets the specific aspects of grants administration in which the grantee needs improvement. For example, one field office focused its monitoring visits only on the grantees\u2019 monitoring of subrecipients. Of the five offices that we visited, only one office had conducted a comprehensive on-site monitoring of a grantee in 1998. According to the field office director, the field office no longer routinely conducts comprehensive on-site monitoring, but did so in this instance in response to a citizen\u2019s allegation of fraud in the use of federal funds.", "The lack of specific monitoring guidance thus allows for significant variation in the way HUD field offices oversee almost $6 billion in formula grant funds. While one field office we visited focused its half-day monitoring visits only on the grantees\u2019 monitoring files for subrecipients, another office conducts complete multiday reviews of one of a grantee\u2019s programs. In a third field office, the complete fiscal year 1998 on-site monitoring for one grantee that receives $28 million annually in CPD formula allocations consisted of a one-day visit to one HOME project by a single HUD employee, who had never before conducted a monitoring visit.", "According to HUD, the Grants Management Policy Notebook will be revised to provide detailed guidance to field offices on ensuring compliance with program laws and regulations.

These other tools do not provide the detailed information that field offices need to effectively monitor program performance, according to the directors. As we discuss in chapter 3, we found during our visits to field offices that grantees were not always entering complete and accurate information into IDIS and that the system cannot provide timely and accurate information on grantees\u2019 performance. In addition, some CPD representatives were not using IDIS to retrieve information on grantees\u2019 performance. Furthermore, field offices\u2019 consultations with grantees are primarily geared to providing local officials with an evaluation of the grantees\u2019 performance and to identifying technical assistance needs and resources, rather than reviewing projects and activities and documentation supporting those activities. Similarly, technical assistance visits are made to provide the grantees with information to help them operate their programs more effectively. One director acknowledged that field office staff can make observations on grantees\u2019 financial and performance matters during these visits, but the visits\u2019 primary purpose is not monitoring.

The Grants Management Policy Notebook, which describes how to manage a grantee\u2019s performance, provides only general criteria for evaluating this performance. These criteria include the adequacy of the grantee\u2019s consolidated plan and the grantee\u2019s efforts to (1) address the continuing needs of the homeless population, (2) provide affordable housing to all populations and income groups, (3) increase economic opportunity, (4) provide a suitable living environment for its recipients, and (5) meet program requirements. The policy notebook leaves it to the individual field office to determine which of these factors to weigh more heavily in targeting grantees for review. On the basis of these criteria, the field office is to determine which grantees are performing exceptionally well, performing adequately, or needing more oversight or assistance.", "While these criteria include an important focus on results in the community, they do not provide assurance that field offices will consistently emphasize the factors that will target grantees on the basis of compliance with internal controls designed to protect against fraud or abuse. According to two field office directors, in determining which grantees need to be monitored more closely in the coming year, the Grants Management System shifted the focus from the factors that could result in the inappropriate use of federal funds to the more performance-based factors presented in the Grants Management Policy Handbook. Furthermore, in reviewing the Community Development Block Grant Program, an independent accounting firm noted the need to identify at-risk grantees by using more traditional risk factors, such as unresolved audit or monitoring findings, the number of subgrantees and subrecipients receiving funds, the amount of program income, the size of the grant, the last date of monitoring, and staff turnover. In response to this report, on September 29, 1998, HUD promulgated risk analysis guidance that included most of these risk factors."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Reviews Have Identified Significant Financial and Performance Problems at Grantees", "paragraphs": ["Our visits to 11 grantees and 11 reports by HUD\u2019s Inspector General, while not generalizable to all block grant programs, identified significant problems that could have been identified if field offices were conducting comprehensive on-site monitoring. Specifically, at several grantees, we found problems in the monitoring of subrecipients that ranged from a lack of records showing that such monitoring had been done, although the grantees said monitoring had occurred, to an acknowledgement by one grantee that no monitoring had occurred during the 1998 program year. Without subrecipient monitoring, HUD has no assurance that subrecipients are complying with program requirements and are achieving their intended objectives.", "For other grantees, in examining the project files, we found inadequate documentation to support payments to contractors, payment vouchers that were unrelated to the project, and a lack of documentation to justify project overruns. For example, at one grantee, the project files were missing so much information that we could not determine if we had identified all of the problems. This grantee had incomplete or missing information\u2014on such key data as the qualifications of recipients served, such as certifications that recipients are of low or moderate-income, statements of work, and contracts\u2014in the nine project files we reviewed. Although this grantee received a monitoring visit in the 1998 program year, the monitoring was targeted to specific program areas, and the monitoring report did not disclose the problems we identified. For example, for one project budgeted for $30,000, the file included two contracts indicating that it had received $40,000 and then another $60,000. We were told that the latter $60,000 contract was cancelled, but the file included no documentation of this. For another project budgeted for $135,000, the file included weekly progress reports, but payment vouchers (justifying the payments made to contractors) and other important documents, such as a statement of work, were missing. And for still another project, the file indicated that the project was budgeted at $145,000 and internal accounting records indicated that over $300,000 was spent, but neither of these figures could be reconciled with the withdrawal of approximately $240,000 that was recorded in IDIS. The file did not include any justification or support for the discrepancies and the overrun. This grantee was not alone in poorly accounting for its use of funds. For example, at another grantee, we could not reconcile payment vouchers with project totals for a street-paving project that cost $259,200.", "Our reviews also showed problems with reporting accomplishments and determining whether grantees were following regulations. For example, at another grantee, we observed the double-counting of accomplishments from one project. In particular, the project file supported only half as many demolitions as were reported in IDIS.", "In 11 reports based on reviews of some grantees, HUD\u2019s Inspector General found that grantees are not complying with financial and performance requirements and consequently has questioned the expenditure of about $26 million in grant funds since HUD began using the Grants Management System. For example, the Inspector General reported that a grantee had improperly charged over $2 million in administrative costs to prior program years. Since the costs were transferred before the end of the program year, the grantee did not disclose these costs in its annual performance report. Without on-site validation of the information in the report, the CPD field office could not determine that improper transfers had been made. According to the CPD representative who was responsible for this grantee, the limited monitoring that was done during this period could not have identified the conditions the Inspector General had uncovered.", "In another audit, the Inspector General found significant weaknesses in a grantee\u2019s internal controls for its housing rehabilitation program under its Community Development Block Grant Program. For example, the Inspector General identified 11 houses that had recently been rehabilitated, inspected, and approved by the grantees\u2019 inspectors. However, the Inspector General\u2019s inspectors said these houses should not have passed inspection. According to the Inspector General\u2019s report, the deficiencies identified by the Inspector General\u2019s inspectors had been allowed to go uncorrected because the grantee\u2019s inspectors were not specifically trained to perform inspections and were pressured to perform cursory inspections in order to meet production goals. In addition, the Inspector General reported that because the grantee did not have any procedures for collecting payments on rehabilitation loans, the grantee had a delinquent loan balance of over $100,000. Some of these loans had been delinquent for over 8 years. The Inspector General reported that this audit was initiated by the grantee, not CPD, following up on an audit conducted by an independent accounting firm.", "HUD\u2019s Inspector General has also specifically faulted CPD\u2019s monitoring of grantees. For example, in its audit of HUD\u2019s fiscal year 1997 financial statement, the Inspector General focused on whether the Grants Management System had been implemented and whether the system was providing adequate oversight of grantees. For some of the grantees, the Inspector General could not determine the extent of CPD\u2019s monitoring of grantees\u2019 performance because it could not find documentation of monitoring in CPD\u2019s files. It also found that CPD had not done annual community assessments for some grantees. Though these required assessments are needed in order to reach an opinion on the grantees\u2019 performance for the year, CPD officials explained that staff shortages resulting from HUD\u2019s downsizing during fiscal year 1997 had prevented them from conducting the assessments. The Inspector General concluded that CPD could not ensure that all grantees were expending funds only on eligible activities and individuals.", "In addition, the independent accounting firm assigned to the verification review of CPD\u2019s actions to correct material weaknesses in the Community Development Block Grant Program faulted CPD\u2019s practices for monitoring grantees.

When they do visit, headquarters staff do not have to formally report their findings. These limited visits to field offices reflect a change in headquarters\u2019 oversight in recent years. One desk officer told us that headquarters had moved away from field office monitoring in an attempt to improve relationships with the field offices\u2014headquarters believed that these visits antagonized the field offices. However, he believed that monitoring visits helped bring headquarters closer to the problems and realities that the field offices faced. In the past, he explained, these visits always generated findings, and the field offices welcomed the feedback and suggestions for improvement that resulted. But now, he stated, he does not have enough information to assess the field offices\u2019 performance.", "In addition, the desk officers\u2019 primary monitoring tool\u2014the Grants Management Process information system\u2014yields incomplete and inconsistent data. Consequently, headquarters staff do not know if field offices are fulfilling their program responsibilities. Our review of a Grant Management Process report on the field offices\u2019 compliance with the time requirement for approving or disapproving grantees\u2019 annual action plans showed that the field offices are interpreting the requirement differently and consequently entering different, sometimes misleading, approval dates into the system. For example, one field office we visited believed that the approval date was the day the CPD representative approved the plan; another, that it was the date the field office director approved the plan; and a third, that it was the date the local Congressman notified the grantee that the grant had been approved. Moreover, the desk officer responsible for one of these offices could not explain an apparently significant number of late approvals. However, in our visit to this field office, we learned that, for many of the plans reviewed, field office staff had either incorrectly entered the data or had found deficiencies in the plans but failed to reject them while they waited a resolution of the deficiencies. On-site monitoring, or even more questioning of the field offices, would have identified this problem and allowed the headquarters staff to resolve it.", "Finally, while the Grant Management Process\u2019s information system is supposed to be the headquarters staff\u2019s principal monitoring tool, it has not been useful for recording information about field offices\u2019 monitoring of grantees. At the time of our review, it did not contain a clear data entry point for field offices to record the results of their monitoring activities in the database. Therefore, field offices entered these results in different locations in the system. In order to determine where field offices were recording this information, HUD hired a contractor to peruse the system and identify all recorded information that appeared to be related to monitoring. The contractor\u2019s report\u2014covering the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 1997\u2014showed that the field offices were entering monitoring data in three of the system\u2019s eight data entry points, and no monitoring information was entered for more than 75 percent of the grantees that were scheduled for on-site monitoring. Without a specific area in which field offices can record monitoring activities, headquarters staff cannot be assured that they have access to all pertinent monitoring information to oversee field offices\u2019 operations.", "We were told by HUD that a process for tracking on-site monitoring activities was implemented.

The field offices we visited are conducting limited on-site monitoring of grantees, although such monitoring is all the more important because of the shortcomings of IDIS. And when on-site monitoring does occur, it does not focus on the grantees who are the poorest performers, and it is not uniform or comprehensive. These problems are caused in part by a lack of uniform criteria on how to assess the level of performance for each grantee and the lack of specificity in the broad criteria that do exist to determine grantees\u2019 compliance with program requirements, although such requirements are intended to encourage the safeguarding of funds. According to the directors of the field offices, the level of on-site monitoring is also lower because of a combination of a lack of staff resources and travel funds and increased responsibilities.", "While we found these problems with field offices\u2019 monitoring of grantees, we also found that the headquarters staff\u2019s oversight of the field offices was problematic.

Nevertheless, the system is so cumbersome that grantees, even though trained on IDIS, find it difficult to use to set up project and activity accounts and to maintain those accounts. For most of the grantees we visited, grantees had to enter data two or more times, found accessing and using IDIS to be time consuming, and had to work through a complicated series of steps to enter or retrieve information.", "To set up project and activity accounts, grantees have to enter much of the same information into two separate HUD information systems\u2014IDIS and HUD\u2019s Community 2020 system (or its precursor, Consolidated Planning Software). These systems are not automatically linked so that entering data into one system would automatically update both systems. In addition to the errors that grantees could make simply because they have to enter the data twice, other types of errors could occur that reduce the quality of the information produced by these systems. For example, one grantee we visited numbered projects differently between the two systems; consequently, it was difficult to compare the grantees\u2019 project plan with the actual use of grant funds. While this initial set of double data entries is time-consuming and cumbersome, IDIS\u2019 design provides yet another opportunity for redundancy. For example, for some projects grantees must enter nearly exactly the same information a third time to describe the projects\u2019 activity. In one field office, the IDIS focal point told us that for 98 percent of the office\u2019s projects, data had to be entered three times.", "Redundant data entry problems also occurred for most of the grantees we visited because they must enter activity information into their own automated accounting systems, as well as HUD\u2019s systems, to comply with their city\u2019s requirements. At the time of our review, CPD had not developed a reliable method to electronically transfer data between grantees\u2019 systems and IDIS. This problem is especially troublesome for states that must enter data for all small cities under their program. For example, Texas\u2014which at the time of our review had not yet started using IDIS\u2014has the largest state community development program\u2014287 subrecipient cities for which it must enter data. According to HUD, as of mid-February 1999, grantees had access to a batch file transfer process, referred to as Electronic Data Interchange, which allows grantees to automatically extract data from their own information systems and pass it to IDIS.", "Another difficulty for grantees is simply the amount of time it can take to access and use IDIS. Each time grantees enter information into IDIS, they use their desktop computers to link to a communications system, dial into IDIS, and enter a user identification number and password to obtain access to IDIS at authorized levels. We observed that it took up to 40 minutes to obtain access to IDIS. Remaining connected to IDIS is also difficult. One grantee estimates that it loses its connection to IDIS prematurely 50 percent of the time.", "Once they have obtained access, IDIS\u2019 design forces grantees to work through a complicated series of steps to enter or retrieve information. The grantees must use designated function keys on the computer keyboard to take required actions at various points in this process, but the meaning of the function keys sometimes changes from screen to screen, causing some confusion and missteps for the grantees and prolonging the time it takes to enter data. In addition, a grantee must work through and exit two separate series of screens in order to enter both financial and performance data for the same activity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Opportunities for Significant Data Entry Errors Exist, and Corrections Are Not Always Possible", "paragraphs": ["When grantees enter incorrect data, IDIS does not easily allow them to rectify the errors. Five of the 11 grantees we visited reported having multiple, significant errors in IDIS data entries that they could not readily correct. To address these problems, the IDIS technical assistance staff instructed grantees to open accounts for nonexistent activities (\u201cdummy accounts\u201d) in some instances, which in effect reverse the incorrect data. In one case, a grantee had incorrectly entered program income funds and had to open multiple dummy activity accounts and charge false amounts against them to rectify its error. Some grantees we spoke to were reluctant to create dummy accounts because these accounts would appear inaccurate or fraudulent to outside observers.", "Some of these problems were so severe that they made CPD\u2019s monitoring activities through IDIS impossible. For example, one grantee had incorrectly entered all of its 1997 program year activities as occurring in the 1996 program year, thereby mixing activities for both years. To further complicate matters, this grantee had not expended all grant funds for 1996. As a result, CPD field and headquarters officials could not determine the amount of funds drawn down or the performance of program activities for either year without actually auditing the grantee\u2019s documents. We brought this matter to CPD\u2019s and the grantee\u2019s attention in October 1998, and as of January 1999, it had still not been resolved.", "At 8 of the 11 grantees we visited, we compared data shown in IDIS with the information in the grantee\u2019s files on the same activities. Although we only looked at a small number of randomly selected activities, we found a wide variety of significant data problems, ranging from a complete lack of performance data at one grantee to double-counting of accomplishments at another. For example, one grantee set up an activity to cover five types of services for senior citizens, ranging from home maintenance to transportation to a recreational center. The grantee then lumped all accomplishment data for these widely varying services together as one total number of elderly people served, even though individuals might participate in more than one of the services or be multiple users of the same service. These types of problems would not only make reports on individual grantees inaccurate but also make reports that combined data at a regional or national level meaningless or misleading."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IDIS\u2019 Flaws Preclude the Tracking of Program Income From Revolving Funds", "paragraphs": ["In addition to its overall design problems, IDIS also does not enable grantees to link program income\u2014income produced by projects they have funded or repayments into revolving loan accounts\u2014to the activity that generated it, such as economic development loans.", "HUD has instructed formula grantees not to enter program income from revolving fund programs into IDIS when they are received, as is done with other types of program income. This is because the design of IDIS does not allow grantees to segregate revolving fund income from other types of program income. IDIS operates on the assumption that all program income is depleted before grant funds are used, regardless of the type of grant activity being funded. Handling program revenues in this manner does not create a problem unless the income is associated with a revolving fund. However, CPD regulations provide grantees with specific permission to reserve program income from revolving fund programs for re-use exclusively in the revolving fund. According to a HUD official, 3,230 revolving funds were created in the Community Development Block Grant Program in 1994.", "To ensure that the program income from revolving funds is recycled into the revolving fund, HUD instructs grantees to only enter the income in IDIS at the moment they redistribute the money. However, HUD\u2019s recommended remedy is flawed. It requires grantees to keep two sets of books: the actual amount of the revolving fund and the amount entered into IDIS. Entering program income only when it is needed for another loan shields the true amount from CPD representatives that monitor the project remotely through IDIS. It also makes it very difficult to ensure that the grantee is meeting its regulatory requirements. For example, because CPD cannot use IDIS to determine how much program income is being generated from revolving funds and therefore what a grantee\u2019s total program income is, CPD cannot use IDIS to determine if a grantee is meeting a requirement to spend grant money in a timely manner. In addition, interest produced by revolving funds should not be recycled into the revolving fund for future use but should instead be returned to CPD, which is responsible for overseeing interest repayments\u2014and forwarding the interest to the U.S. Treasury. Given the lack of information about revolving fund balances in IDIS, CPD will have trouble determining if a grantee is repaying interest as required. One regional CPD office, for example, received large interest repayment checks that resulted from revolving fund balances, but the office had not expected these repayments because it had been unaware of the balances. One grantee sent a check for $10,728.03 for interest earned by a revolving fund balance during a 13-month period."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IDIS Does Not Provide Timely and Accurate Information and Makes It Difficult to Produce Reports on Grantees\u2019 Use of Funds and Performance", "paragraphs": ["While IDIS was intended to allow CPD to track grantees\u2019 performance on a real-time basis, it does not do so for several reasons. First, a grantee can withdraw all funds for an activity without entering any performance information for that activity, as was often the case with the grantees we visited. Most did not enter any performance data until the end of the program year, when such data were required to complete annual reports. Second, three grantees that did try to enter performance data were hindered from doing so because IDIS requires grantees to enter financial and performance data separately. Third, even when grantees enter information more frequently, the information may not be useful for tracking performance because IDIS does not identify when the performance data were entered. IDIS has only one entry field for entering performance data for the year, so that additional data entries erase previous entries.", "In addition to these overall problems, IDIS does not enable grantees to always record exact information on the outcomes of activities. Specifically, IDIS provides 12 choices for describing benefits, such as the number of youth, households, or businesses benefiting from projects. However, this list is not comprehensive enough to cover the wide range of benefits that occur in program activities. For example, one grantee had demolished four blighted buildings and to record this information in IDIS had to describe the work as four \u201cpublic facilities\u201d because there was no better option. At the field office level, then, real-time inquiries to IDIS for information on grantees\u2019 performance are unreliable.", "Equally important, creating reports at the end of the program year or at any time is difficult. To create and print a report, the user\u2014either the grantee or field office staff\u2014must work through a series of IDIS screens\u2014as many as 70 at one field office we visited\u2014to begin to create a report. Problems can occur during this process. For example, at one field office, the staff could not produce any of the reports we had requested for 3 days because the IDIS software for producing reports was not functioning. In another field office, the staff could create reports for only one grantee\u2014the first on the list of choices\u2014and it took 24 hours to correct the problem. Furthermore, IDIS\u2019 error messages can be difficult to decipher, making the task of fixing the problem even more time-consuming. Once the report is produced in IDIS\u2019 mainframe computer, the user still has to transfer it to a desktop computer and edit it before it can be printed. Because of these difficulties, many of the grantees we visited did not produce any more reports from IDIS than were necessary for the end of program year reporting to HUD. In addition, at the time of our review, CPD had removed the function for the consolidated annual performance and evaluation report\u2014a report all grantees must submit to HUD at the end of the program year\u2014because IDIS was generating reports with errors. For example, we found that one grantee had entered correct information into IDIS, but the system produced a report with incorrect information. Besides reporting to HUD, grantees use the end of the year report to communicate information about the use of block grant funds to their citizens. This problem also frustrated the ability of CPD field office staff to provide headquarters with some progress reports. In January 1999, HUD was still attempting to correct the reporting capability within IDIS."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Security Controls Do Not Provide Assurance That IDIS Is Safe From Fraud and Abuse", "paragraphs": ["Although grantees use IDIS to initiate the transfer of approximately $6 billion a year in grant funds, CPD has not established a secure method for setting up and maintaining access rights for using IDIS. While HUD cannot select which grantee staff should have access rights\u2014that is the grantee\u2019s responsibility\u2014it can take actions to ensure that designated grantee staff have appropriate levels of access and that staff who leave the grantee\u2019s employment do not retain access. To provide security against the inappropriate use of funds, for example, grantee staff should have limited, or segregated, access to the computer system. In such a case, the individual who could establish activity accounts would not also be able to approve the withdrawal of funds for those activities. However, HUD has not taken these actions to safeguard federal grants, either at headquarters or in the field offices.", "Furthermore, according to the HUD official responsible for IDIS security, at a basic level the staff resources devoted to this task are strained. He explained that the thousands of requests for new user accounts, reinstatement of expired user accounts, and revocation of accounts are handled only by himself, an assistant, and one contract employee. As a result, assigning access rights to a new user takes a month or more and there are no staff to catalogue the forms requesting access, making it difficult to review original access rights or retrieve forms when necessary.", "Additionally, neither the security official nor his staff review these requests for appropriateness, to determine whether the requested access rights are necessary to perform the duties assigned to the user or whether access rights ensure segregation of tasks such as setting up activities and approval of drawdowns. Instead, their main function has been to assign access rights to IDIS or to reinstate rights when passwords have expired. Even when notified by grantees that IDIS access rights should be revoked because the person with those rights is no longer employed by the grantee, the security official told us that removing the person\u2019s rights is not a high priority. Once IDIS accounts have been established, grantees have the authority to change access levels for their staff without any level of oversight by CPD. At the time of our review, CPD did not periodically produce any reports for the grantees\u2019 IDIS focal points or field office staff that showed the current access rights of the grantees\u2019 staff.", "Not surprisingly, given this absence of oversight, we found multiple problems with access rights at five of the eight grantees with whom we discussed access rights. Specifically: \u2022 Duties among authorized users were not adequately segregated at three of the grantees, so these users could both set up activity accounts and draw down funds for those activities. Consequently, one individual could control key aspects of grant funding, increasing the opportunities for undetected error or fraud. IDIS user accounts for terminated employees or those on extended leave had not been revoked at two grantees. Furthermore, at one grantee, the terminated former IDIS system administrator continued to have all rights to the system, including the right to change access rights for other users. \u2022 HUD had erroneously assigned three individuals who had never been employees of one grantee a variety of access rights to the grantee\u2019s data. In combination, the access rights for these individuals would have allowed them to set up activities as well as approve and draw funds. \u2022 Accounts were shared or used by individuals other than the authorized individual at two grantees.", "We also found a key control\u2014passwords that cannot be easily replicated\u2014was not in place to ensure that access to grantees\u2019 IDIS resources is restricted to authorized users. Authorized access rights are circumvented when an authorized user\u2019s account is used by another individual. We found that the combination of user account identifications and passwords to gain access to IDIS could be easily duplicated by knowledgeable users, making it hard to detect error, fraud, and abuse\u2014including malicious tampering.", "The security official\u2019s lack of basic knowledge about computer security generally, and security for IDIS in particular, presents another problem. The security officer told us that, although he is familiar with networks and desktop computers, his background does not include any security work, and he has not had any training in security methods for information systems since becoming a security officer for IDIS. He also does not have a working knowledge of the security software that contractors use to grant access and therefore cannot properly oversee them. Moreover, it is unclear whether CPD expects this official to oversee the contractor staff and what the scope of his duties should be in general. The officer could not provide us with a clearly defined position description that included his specific IDIS duties. Finally, he explained he views himself more as an \u201caccess facilitator\u201d than a security person.", "HUD\u2019s Inspector General\u2019s report on HUD\u2019s fiscal year 1998 consolidated financial statements also noted the need to improve IDIS\u2019 security. The HUD Inspector General expressed concern that until the software for access controls is fully implemented, the mainframe system on which IDIS resides will not be protected against accidental or intentional damage. The Inspector General also reported that there is no consistent method of controlling changes in HUD\u2019s applications system software, of which IDIS is a part. This creates an unnecessary risk to the software integrity of HUD\u2019s mainframe application systems, according to HUD\u2019s Inspector General."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD Plans Major Changes", "paragraphs": ["HUD officials told us they are in the process of developing a new Department-wide information system that manages all of its 51 grant programs. In September 1998, HUD completed a feasibility study on using existing information systems, such as IDIS, as the basis for that system. The study, performed by two HUD officials and a group of contractors, included interviews with a variety of HUD officials and other federal government officials, but none with users of IDIS. The study recommended that HUD develop a new system, called the Departmental Grants Management System, modeled on IDIS and the Grants Administration Tracking and Evaluation System, a grants management system being developed by the Department of Health and Human Services. The Grants Administration Tracking and Evaluation System, which uses a Windows environment, would provide the user interface for the Departmental Grants Management System. IDIS, converted for use in the new environment, would be used as the basis for withdrawing grant funds and reporting performance.", "On the basis of this recommendation, HUD is proceeding with development of the Departmental Grants Management System, which will rely on Windows and therefore be more user-friendly than the system we reviewed. In November 1998, HUD informed us that it is moving forward with the project, and HUD plans to have a pilot test of the converted IDIS in September 1999."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["With billions of dollars and the needs of millions of people at stake in the formula grant programs, HUD has recognized that it needs effective systems for overseeing the handling of program funds and the achievement of program objectives. While we agree that a tool providing timely and accurate data about grantees\u2019 financial activities and performance would be greatly beneficial in overseeing the grant programs, the current system, IDIS, is not capable of serving as such a tool. IDIS has not provided the complete, accurate, and timely information field offices need for such monitoring. IDIS\u2019 design makes grantees\u2019 efforts unnecessarily difficult; affords multiple opportunities for incorrect data entry that grantees cannot then readily rectify; does not provide grantees with a straightforward method for managing program income from revolving funds, which results in an inaccurate portrayal of grantees\u2019 financial activities; and does not require grantees to provide performance information when they draw down funds. In addition, without adequate security controls to prevent unauthorized access to the system, CPD cannot ensure that information in the system is reliable and that funds are safeguarded.", "Although HUD is in the process of developing the Departmental Grants Management System, it plans to convert IDIS and use it as a basis for the new system, which is to be used by all 51 of HUD\u2019s grant programs. We agree that a more user-friendly system would be an improvement; but given the extent and nature of problems with IDIS, we question the use of IDIS as a model for the Department-wide system. To address the problems we identified, IDIS will need to be modified extensively or replaced, whichever is more cost effective. Of immediate concern, IDIS is not secure, and while it continues to be insecure, federal funds will not be protected appropriately."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development", "paragraphs": ["Because IDIS has not proven to be a useful tool in managing grantees, we recommend that the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development direct the Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development to consider whether it is more cost-effective to modify IDIS or replace it. After this determination is made and before IDIS is used as the base for developing the new grants management information system for all of HUD\u2019s 51 grant programs, the problems we identified with IDIS should be corrected. HUD should ensure that the new system does not require redundant data entry, reduces the time needed to enter information, readily allows timely corrections of data, provides a straightforward method of accounting for program income from revolving funds, provides timely and accurate information on grantees\u2019 performance, and readily produces reports.", "We also recommend that the Secretary\u2014regardless of the decision on the future of IDIS\u2014immediately take steps to ensure that access to IDIS is limited to authorized users and that those users have access levels appropriate to the duties they perform. Steps should also be taken to ensure that the security officer for IDIS is fully aware of the responsibilities that must be carried out and has the appropriate training and staff for those responsibilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["While HUD did not comment on our recommendations, it commented that our assessment of IDIS fails to consider recent efforts to improve IDIS. HUD commented that several of the weaknesses we identified did not take into account compensating factors. For instance, HUD commented that our assessment of IDIS\u2019 inability to accurately track program income from revolving funds did not account for the quarterly Federal Cash Transaction Report (SF 272), which includes information on program income. Similarly, HUD commented that limitations in IDIS security are less important because accounts automatically expire after a period of nonuse. For other weaknesses we identified, HUD pointed out recent or planned changes to IDIS that it believed will correct the problems we identified.", "We continue to believe that IDIS\u2019 untimely, inaccurate, and incomplete data, as well as its inability to track program income, hinder HUD\u2019s ability to remotely monitor its grantees. While the Federal Transaction Report provides quarterly information on program income, as does IDIS, that information can be used only to track program income from nonrevolving funds. Furthermore, HUD is right that automatic account expirations resulting from nonuse have a security benefit, but the system is still vulnerable to unauthorized access until the account expires, and the account will not expire if someone continues to access the system inappropriately. We believe that HUD\u2019s recent and planned changes could, if properly implemented, improve the integrity of IDIS. Training the IDIS security officer and providing periodic reports to field offices that show the current access rights of the grantees\u2019 staff will improve security. Additionally, the data quality review effort could improve the quality of the data currently in IDIS, but future data quality may be impaired by the unresolved system design problems we noted. We also believe that the numerous additional problems in usability, accuracy, and security detailed in our report still compromise HUD\u2019s ability to ensure the integrity of the four formula block grant programs. Therefore, we did not make any changes to the recommendations."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
