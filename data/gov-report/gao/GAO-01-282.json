It also manages the subsurface  mineral resources underlying another 300 million acres of land  administered by other government agencies or owned by private interests.  The bureau has 189 offices that maintain over 1 billion paper documents,  including land surveys and surveyor notes, records of land ownership,  mining claims, and oil and gas leases. According to BLM, most of the paper  documents are deteriorating and are becoming increasingly difficult to  read.", "In the mid-1980s BLM began planning to acquire a land and mineral case  processing system to keep up with its increasing workload and automate  its manual records and case processing activities. By 1993, BLM decided on  the scope and functionality of the project, called the  ALMRS/Modernization. The project consisted of three major components:  the ALMRS IOC, a geographic information system, and the modernization  of BLM\u2019s computer and telecommunications infrastructure and rehost of  selected management and administrative systems.

The bureau subsequently stopped the ALMRS project. At  the time the project was terminated, BLM estimated that from 1983 through  1998 it had obligated about $411 million for the ALMRS/Modernization  project, of which over $67 million was spent to develop ALMRS IOC  software.", "In 1999, we testified on the long-standing project weaknesses at BLM that  threatened the ALMRS/Modernization and increased the risks that future  efforts would result in a similar outcome. We recommended that BLM  assess the usefulness of ALMRS IOC and other alternatives to meeting the  bureau\u2019s business needs, and strengthen its investment management  processes and systems acquisition capabilities.

We pointed out that this analysis should be part of  an overall effort to identify and assess all alternatives, including  (1) modifying the ALMRS IOC software, (2) modifying existing land and  recordation systems, (3) acquiring commercial, off-the-shelf software, or  (4) developing new systems.

For  example, the ITIB reviews ongoing projects at major project milestones or  when additional funding is needed, while our guidance recommends and  best practices suggest that in the control phase, information should be  continually collected, updated, and provided to decisionmakers so they can  identify projects that are at risk and act early to mitigate those risks or  terminate the project. The ITIB also has not yet developed criteria for the  evaluation phase that would measure actual versus projected performance  and identify benefits that were achieved by an IT investment. Without  identifying control and evaluation criteria and implementing such  processes, BLM does not yet have in place all the elements necessary to  properly manage its IT investments.

While these actions are not  yet complete, the changes made thus far should help to improve the  acquisition and management of IT investments. The bureau has begun to  improve the selection and management of its IT investments and develop  more mature systems development and acquisition capabilities. The bureau  is also developing a plan and schedule to integrate its improvement actions,  developing plans and actions to properly control ongoing and evaluate  completed IT projects, and establishing an enterprise architecture.  However, more needs to be done to fully address our recommendations.  BLM recognizes this and said it will continue to work diligently on these  areas.", "BLM has also taken steps to acquire a component of a major information  system before completing improvement actions to its investment control  processes. Without sufficient management controls in place, BLM is  increasing the risk that this new system effort will fail to meet the bureau\u2019s  needs or will not be delivered as planned."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of the Interior direct BLM to take the  following actions to help mitigate risks associated with moving forward  with the GeoCommunicator acquisition:  Adopt procedures to ensure proper management and control over the  GeoCommunicator project. The procedures should include (1)  consistent project monitoring by senior managers to ensure that cost  and schedule are being controlled, benefits are being accomplished,  risks are being managed, and strategic bureau needs are being met and  (2) comparison of interim results against project estimates through each  stage to ensure that the project is progressing as expected and to  indicate when actions should be taken as problems arise, including  modifying, canceling, continuing, or accelerating the project.", "Determine the additional workload and other impacts that  implementing the GeoCommunicator module will have on BLM\u2019s  current computing environment.

The key corrective actions include (1) filling  several important positions in the next 6 months, (2) continuing the efforts  to complete its IT investment management processes, (3) instituting a  review of NILS to more accurately identify the risks, mitigation measures,  and advisability of continuing with the projects as currently planned, and  (4) applying new control and assessment criteria to the GeoCommunicator  project.

We also interviewed bureau officials to determine BLM\u2019s plans to conduct  further analyses.", "To meet our second objective, we reviewed BLM\u2019s draft IT management  plans, including its capital asset and strategic IRM plans, and compared the  plans to OMB\u2019s and our guidance for developing such plans. To assess the  composition and actions of BLM\u2019s ITIB, we compared the board\u2019s charter to  our investment management guidance, attended ITIB meetings at BLM, and  reviewed the results of the ITIB meetings to determine the extent to which  BLM has implemented a sound investment management process. We also  reviewed BLM\u2019s draft investment management process document and  compared the bureau\u2019s draft process to our information technology  investment management guidance. We reviewed the bureau\u2019s IRM  reorganization and staffing assessment, and compared it with the Clinger- Cohen Act\u2019s requirement that agency CIOs assess the extent to which  personnel meet the agencies\u2019 organizational IRM requirements. To assess  BLM\u2019s architecture, we analyzed the bureau\u2019s architectural models and  data, and the methodology used to develop the architecture, and compared  them to OMB\u2019s guidance for developing and documenting enterprise  architectures. We interviewed BLM officials, including the CIO and Deputy  CIO, acting lead architect, and NILS project manager to identify BLM\u2019s  planned and ongoing actions to strengthen its investment management  processes.", "To address our third objective, we analyzed BLM\u2019s plan to strengthen its  investment management capabilities and compared the plan to the SEI\u2019s  Software and Software Acquisition CMM criteria. We also interviewed  bureau officials to determine what actions BLM has taken and plans to take  to strengthen its systems acquisition capabilities.", "To address our fourth objective, we analyzed BLM\u2019s integrated plan and  schedule for managing all of its investment management and systems  acquisition improvement projects to determine whether the plan fully  integrated these projects and to assess the reliability of the schedule. We  also interviewed bureau officials to determine BLM\u2019s plans for further  integrating these projects and establishing a reliable project schedule.", "To address our final objective, we analyzed NILS and GeoCommunicator  project plans and documents, and interviewed project and contractor  officials.
