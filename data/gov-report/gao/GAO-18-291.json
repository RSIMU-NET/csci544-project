States set capitation rates based on cost data\u2014 historical utilization and spending\u2014that MCOs submit to the state  Medicaid agencies, but the PERM does not consider these data. Unless  removed from these cost data, unidentified overpayments and  unallowable costs would likely inflate the MCO cost data that states use  to set capitation rates. (See fig. 1.)

As we previously reported, these focused reviews are narrower in scope  than the prior reviews conducted by CMS, but they still involve on-site  visits to states.", "In its focused reviews of managed care, CMS found that several states  had incomplete oversight of MCO payments to providers, even though the  agency relies on states to verify reported MCO overpayments and to  ensure the overpayments are excluded from the data used to set  capitation rates. In the 27 focused reviews of managed care from 2014 to  2017, CMS found that MCOs in 17 states reported fewer overpayments to  their state Medicaid agencies than CMS would expect. For example,  MCOs in at least 5 states reported that overpayments were less than 0.1  percent of their total managed care expenditures; while CMS noted in 1  focused review that overpayments typically equal 1 to 10 percent of total  expenditures in managed care. CMS also found that 5 of the 27 states did  not verify that MCOs excluded overpayments from these data, and 1 state  did not exclude overpayments from the capitation rate setting. This is  consistent with our March 2017 report in which we noted that CMS  commonly found that MCOs reported low amounts of recovered  overpayments and conducted few reviews to identify overpayments.  Also, officials from three of the five states we interviewed for that report  said the focused reviews gave them leverage in dealing with MCOs or led  MCOs to focus more on program integrity. We also reported that CMS  officials recommended states take steps to improve their oversight of  MCOs, based on the focused review findings.", "The findings from CMS\u2019s focused reviews of managed care also highlight  the need for greater federal oversight of states. Without these reviews, it  is unclear if states would independently identify MCOs\u2019 reporting of  overpayments or work to strengthen MCO reporting. Yet, CMS has not  yet published the focused reviews of managed care in 13 states, and it  may only conduct a focused review in a state once every three or more  years. Given CMS\u2019s timeline for the focused reviews, it may take years to  determine if corrective actions result in improved program integrity in  services delivered through managed care.", "Collaborative audits.

Only the audit of Trusted Healthcare, an MCO  in the District of Columbia, has been published. That audit identified  $129,000 in overpayments in a sample of MCO payments to providers,  which, if generalized to all of the MCO\u2019s payments over 6 months, would  equate to over $4 million in overpayments. According to CMS, three  additional states\u2014Louisiana, Nebraska, and New Hampshire\u2014have  shown interest in collaborative audits of their MCOs, although such audits  require states to prepare data files for the federal contractor and commit  staff time. In our March 2017 report, we found that states\u2019 participation in  FFS collaborative audits varied and some states reported barriers to their  participation. Expanding collaborative audits in managed care will  require commitment from and coordination with states.", "State monitoring of overpayments in managed care.

However, based on the  responses of the program integrity officials in 13 of the 16 states we  contacted, most officials were unable to define the magnitude of  overpayments in their managed care programs, which may signify a need  for greater federal oversight or coordination. Specifically, officials in 7 of  the 13 states could not or did not identify the share of total reported  Medicaid overpayments that occurred in managed care. In 11 of the 13  states, officials responded that they did not directly monitor MCO  payments to providers.

In addition, HHS asserted that including such  a review would diminish the value of PERM reporting\u2014because it would  require significant assumptions about the amount of federal share in MCO  payments to providers. Further, HHS maintained that such a review also  would result in a measurement that was not comparable to other  programs or agencies, which would diminish the value of government- wide improper payment rate reporting. We acknowledge that the current  PERM methodology has been approved by OMB. However, we maintain  that the PERM likely underestimates program integrity risks in Medicaid  managed care. To ensure the appropriate targeting of program integrity  activities, CMS needs better information about these risks. Given the size  of the Medicaid program, its vulnerability to improper payments, and the  growth in managed care, it is critical to have a full accounting of program  integrity risks in managed care in order to best ensure the integrity of the  whole Medicaid program.", "In its written comments, HHS also summarized several activities it uses to  oversee and support states\u2019 Medicaid program integrity efforts, including  state program integrity reviews; collaborative audits conducted by federal  contractors; Medicaid Integrity Institute training for state employees; and  the Medicaid Provider Enrollment Compendium.  HHS also provided  technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. HHS\u2019s  comments are reprinted in appendix II.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

As the findings below show, the  audits and investigations represent a limited number of reviews that, in  many cases, focused on individual states and individual providers or  MCOs within that state. Given the limited scope and number of states  reviewed, the amount of the overpayments and unallowable costs  occurring nationwide is unknown.", "These audits and investigations show  cases of MCO overpayments to providers or unallowable costs, which  are not accounted for by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services\u2019 Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) ; errors in capitated payments (e.g., capitated payments made for  deceased individuals), which are accounted for in the PERM; and gaps in managed care oversight.", "When reporting overpayments and unallowable costs identified in the  audits and investigations, we only include amounts specifically attributed  to MCOs in our total. This total does not include the following: overpayments and unallowable costs identified in those audits and  investigations that did not distinguish between the amounts  attributable to MCOs, Medicaid fee-for-service, or Medicare; overpayments and unallowable costs identified in criminal  proceedings that are not yet resolved; and errors in capitated payments, as those payments would be reviewed  by the PERM.", "As a result, the total amount of overpayments and unallowable costs and  capitated payment errors in this appendix exceed what we report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Leslie V.

We found that the estimation does not fully account for key risks such as overpayments and unallowable costs.", "We recommended that CMS take steps to mitigate such risks."]}
