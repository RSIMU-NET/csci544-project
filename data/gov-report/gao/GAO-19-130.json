To obtain this official  response, the student can write or call the Selective Service System with  a detailed description of the circumstances he believed prevented him  from registering at the required time. The individual would then provide  the official written response from the Selective Service System to his  school financial aid office, which would evaluate whether his failure to  register was knowing or willful. Officials from 7 of the 12 schools we  interviewed said the process to obtain documentation from the Selective  Service System was difficult or time-consuming.", "Student Loan Default. Applicants are generally ineligible for Pell grants if  they have a prior federal student loan in default status. Education data  showed that about 10 percent of FAFSAs in the first year of the pilot were submitted by applicants with an existing federal student loan in default  status. In comparison, about 2 percent of FAFSAs in the overall  population were submitted by applicants with an existing loan in default  status. Officials from all 12 schools we interviewed said at least some of  their incarcerated applicants had existing federal student loans in default  status. There are options, however, for individuals to remove default  status from their loans, potentially regaining eligibility for Pell grants. For  example, borrowers may rehabilitate their student loans by entering into  and completing a written agreement that requires the borrower to make  nine on-time monthly payments within 10 consecutive months. These  income-driven payments can be as low as $5 per month.", "According to school officials, however, removing default status from loans  can be challenging for incarcerated individuals. For example, officials  from one school we interviewed said applicants generally cannot make  phone calls to set up loan repayment plans and instead have to rely on  postal mail for completing the necessary paperwork. Also, officials from  another school we interviewed said that for applicants who must rely on  family members outside the prison to make the required payments, there  is no guarantee that the family will do so. Additionally, borrowers may  rehabilitate a loan only once. Despite these challenges, officials from  five schools said they had applicants who were working to rehabilitate  their loans, such as by paying from wages earned through prison work or  by having family members make payments on their behalf.

Communication  between the applicant, the applicant\u2019s family, and the school\u2019s financial  aid office is limited by virtue of the applicant\u2019s confinement. For example,  incarcerated applicants were typically unable to be reached via phone or  email to answer questions, according to school officials we interviewed,  and completing verification paperwork sometimes required multiple trips  to the prison, which in some cases was more than an hour away. Further,  incarcerated applicants sometimes did not have access to their personal  files or records and faced difficulties obtaining documentation, such as  copies of high school transcripts and tax records, which may be required  for financial aid officers in the event the applicant is chosen for  verification. Education guidance indicates that under certain  circumstances, the school may accept alternate forms of documentation  from the correctional facility if that documentation provides the information  the school has requested. For example, the school may accept  documentation from the correctional facility that shows an individual was  incarcerated for the entire corresponding tax year, rather than requiring  the applicant to obtain a letter of non-filing from the Internal Revenue  Service.", "School officials said that some dependent and married students had  trouble providing the school financial aid office with income  documentation for others, such as a parent or spouse. According to  Education data, approximately 2 percent of incarcerated applicants in the  first year of the pilot were dependent, and nearly 11 percent were  married. If an applicant selected for verification is dependent or married,  he or she is required to provide the school with documentation to verify  household income. Officials from 7 of the 12 schools we interviewed said  that sometimes an applicant had trouble securing required documents  from a parent or spouse. If an applicant cannot provide the required  documentation of the income and assets of his parent or spouse, the  school cannot verify the individual\u2019s FAFSA information and cannot award  a Pell grant.", "School officials indicated that these challenges were compounded by the  selection of a high percentage of Second Chance Pell FAFSAs for  verification. Education uses a number of criteria to select FAFSAs for  verification, which the department does not share publicly. However,  Education officials said that being eligible for a Pell grant and reporting no  income are two such criteria.

Education officials reported  that they will follow up with schools that are not reporting data to  determine if the school either has no data to report or needs further  assistance from the department.", "As part of its annual survey to schools, Education asks officials to  describe any challenges their schools faced when implementing the pilot,  such as the roles and responsibilities of schools and corrections partners  for helping incarcerated applicants complete FAFSAs, as well as how  academic programs were determined. In addition, Education asks schools  to share examples of any challenges their schools faced when  implementing the pilot. Education sent its first annual survey to Second  Chance Pell schools in August 2018, in which it asked school officials to  reflect on the pilot\u2019s first year (2016-2017 school year). Education officials  reported that all schools had completed the required reporting for the first  year of the pilot (2016-2017) and that as of November 2018, 47 schools  had completed their reporting for the second year of the pilot (2017- 2018).

Further, the department is directed  to make recommendations for amendments to improve and streamline  the Higher Education Act, which includes the delivery of federal student  financial aid, based on the results of the experiments. However,  Education has not established how it intends to evaluate Second Chance  Pell or measure the pilot\u2019s performance against its objectives.", "During the course of our review, Education officials provided us with  several reasons as to why they were not planning to evaluate the pilot.  First, officials said there was no dedicated funding set aside for an  external evaluation of the pilot. Second, Education officials said they did  not intend to make recommendations regarding changes to federal  student financial aid eligibility based on the results of the pilot. Rather  than conducting an evaluation, they explained, Education intends to  report descriptive information on the pilot, such as the number of students  served and the amount of aid disbursed, as it has done in prior reports on  its experimental sites. In Education\u2019s most recent report on the  experimental sites (of the 2010-2011 school year), the department  reported that it aggregated outcome measures (such as numbers of  students in each experiment) and reviewed comments submitted by  participating schools. However, the report noted that this type of  anecdotal information could not be used to determine whether  experiments were ultimately successful.", "The purpose of a pilot is generally to inform a decision on whether and  how to implement a new approach in a broader setting. In this context,  leading practices for effective pilot design state that agencies should  evaluate the final results of a pilot in order to draw conclusions on  whether, how, and when to integrate pilot activities into overall efforts.  As noted above, Education is required to review and evaluate  experiments under the Experimental Sites Initiative and make subsequent  recommendations, as appropriate, for amendments to improve and  streamline the Higher Education Act, which includes the delivery of  federal student financial aid. In this context, we inquired about steps  Education could take now, should an evaluation of Second Chance Pell  be pursued (including an evaluation limited to an internal effort using  existing resources). Education officials agreed that even without funding  for an external evaluation, they could use the data they are already  collecting to internally evaluate the pilot. In its comments on the draft  report, Education stated that it was now planning to evaluate the pilot,  consistent with the objectives set out in the Federal Register, and  described a number of steps it was taking to do so.

These impacts may  be consistent with past research, which suggests possible benefits to  formerly-incarcerated individuals, prisons, and local communities.

To ensure the reliability of these data, we reviewed agency  documentation about the data and the system that produced them and  interviewed officials from Education responsible for collecting and  validating the data. We found the data to be sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. To further identify the actions taken, we reviewed Education\u2019s  published guidance on implementing the Second Chance Pell pilot,  including the department\u2019s webinars, action plans, and Frequently Asked  Questions document. Additionally, we interviewed officials from the  Department of Justice, as well as Education\u2019s Office of Federal Student  Aid, on the actions taken to prepare for the pilot and the guidance and  support provided to participants, among other topics. We also interviewed  representatives from three research groups\u2014the Urban Institute, the Vera  Institute of Justice (Vera), and New America\u2014in order to gain additional  insight on the effects of postsecondary correctional education as well as  the design and implementation of the Second Chance Pell pilot.", "To further identify what actions schools and correctional facilities took to  implement the pilot, we interviewed officials from a non-generalizable  sample of 12 schools participating in the pilot. We also interviewed  officials from seven correctional facilities who partnered with the  participating schools. We used a sampling procedure in which we  selected participating schools with particular characteristics to capture  both common experiences and important variations among those with  differing characteristics. We selected schools to represent a range of  characteristics, including public and private nonprofit schools; schools  with existing postsecondary correctional education programs and those  with programs launched for the pilot; and schools with a varying number  of correctional institution partners (ranging from 1 to 18 partners). We  selected schools that offered bachelor\u2019s degrees to students participating  in the pilot as well as those that offered certificates and associate\u2019s  degrees. We included one school serving a women\u2019s prison, one school  that is classified as one of the Historically Black Colleges and  Universities, and four schools that are classified as Hispanic Serving  Institutions in our sample. Results from nonprobability samples cannot be  used to make inferences about a population. Although our findings cannot  be generalized to all schools that are participating in the pilot, they do  provide useful insight into the experiences of pilot participants.", "To describe the experiences that participating schools are having as they  implement the Second Chance Pell pilot, we interviewed officials from the  non-generalizable sample of schools (and correctional partners) we  described above. Additionally, we visited three prisons (Jessup  Correctional Institution in Maryland, Mission Creek Corrections Center for  Women in Washington State, and Sing Sing Correctional Facility in New  York) and one school campus (City University of New York) in order to  observe classrooms and student resources such as libraries and study  spaces and to talk with selected individuals about their experiences  participating in the pilot. Specifically, one of the prisons for men that we  visited identified five Second Chance Pell students for us to interview.  Each interview was conducted in a private classroom setting with one  student and two of our staff members. Each interview lasted between 5  and 10 minutes. Each student was asked the same set of questions about  his experience applying for and participating in the Second Chance Pell  Pilot Program. Although these interviews were only conducted at one site  and are therefore not generalizable to all students participating in the pilot  program, they provide insight about the students\u2019 experiences. We also  observed a pilot-funded class in session at that prison. On one college  campus, we interviewed a student who participated in the pilot while he  was incarcerated and who was now released and continuing his  education on campus. These sites were selected for variation in  experience delivering college classes in prisons, number of students  served, and to allow us to observe both men\u2019s and women\u2019s prison  facilities. To further understand schools\u2019 experiences as they implement  the pilot, in June 2018 we attended the third-annual convening of Second  Chance Pell partners, which was a 2-day conference for participating  schools, their correctional partners, and other stakeholders, hosted by  Vera.", "To assess how Education is monitoring and evaluating the pilot, and what  opportunities, if any, exist for improvement, we reviewed Education\u2019s  documentation on the pilot\u2019s objectives (including any evaluation  objectives), and analyzed the data collection instruments Education uses  to monitor the pilot.

In  2013, RAND Corporation published a meta-analysis of 58 studies and  found that inmates who participated in correctional education had 43  percent lower odds of recidivating than non-participants, and 13 percent  higher odds of obtaining employment. Many studies we reviewed that  tested impacts on one or more measures of recidivism have also found  that incarcerated students who participated in a postsecondary program  or earned a postsecondary degree while in prison were less likely to be  re-arrested or re-incarcerated than those who did not participate. Some  research, however, has found that program completion may lead to  positive effects more than participation alone. For example, in one study,  researchers found completion of a postsecondary program while in prison  was associated with significantly and substantively lower odds of  returning to prison for either a new crime or a parole violation, but  participation in a postsecondary program without completion offered no  benefit relative to not having participated at all. Additionally, not all  researchers have observed positive effects in all study settings. In one  three-state study, researchers found that those who participated in a correctional education program were less likely to be re-arrested, re- convicted, and re-incarcerated in two states; in the third state, there were  no significant differences between participants and non-participants.", "Additionally, some research suggests incarcerated students who  participated in a postsecondary program while in prison were more likely  to find employment after release, work more hours, or earn higher wages  than those who did not participate, but this was not always found. For  example, in one study, earning a postsecondary credential while  incarcerated was associated with an increase in total hours worked and  total wages earned in the first 2 years after release; however, it was not  associated with an increase in the odds of finding employment.  Additionally, one study of inmates in three states found no statistically  significant difference in post-release employment in the 3-year follow-up  among participants in a correctional education program compared to non- participants.", "Several studies found that correctional education had positive outcomes  for taxpayers due to lower re-incarceration costs. For example, the RAND  Corporation estimated that for every dollar spent on correctional  education, five dollars are saved on three-year re-incarceration costs.  Another cost analysis in Washington State found that correctional  education had a return-on-investment of $19.62 for participants and  taxpayers for each dollar spent, and vocational education in prison had a  return-on-investment of $13.21 for each dollar spent.", "A few studies focused on outcomes for participants while they were still in  prison, and these generally suggest positive effects. For example, one  qualitative study found that participants in a postsecondary correctional  education program reported experiencing increased self-esteem and  motivation to reach their goals. A few other studies suggested that  participation in education programming reduced misconduct. In one  study, participants in college programs (but not other education  programs) reported receiving fewer tickets for misconduct.

First, the identified studies often measure dependent and  independent variables in a variety of ways, which makes comparison of  outcomes across studies difficult. For example, some studies define  \u201crecidivism\u201d as rearrest within 3 years, while others measure it as re- arrest or reincarceration within 1 year. Another example is that many  studies define \u201cparticipation in education\u201d as participation in a vocational,  secondary, or postsecondary program, while others define it as  participation specifically in a postsecondary program. Second, of the  studies we reviewed all but one include a small, geographically limited, or  otherwise non-generalizable sample. Third, many of the studies we  reviewed do not examine whether and how characteristics of facilities or  implementation procedures may have influenced\u2014negatively or  positively\u2014outcomes among participants. We identified nine articles that  specifically discuss implementation and facility characteristics; however,  none employ robust methodologies to test whether and how these  characteristics lead to better outcomes among participants. A fourth  limitation is selection bias, which is the possibility that incarcerated  students who choose to take classes are meaningfully different from  those who choose not to enroll, and that difference is the underlying  cause of their positive outcomes. For example, it is possible that  incarcerated people who take educational classes are already at the  lowest risk of recidivating and have the highest motivation to succeed  after release. If this is the case, then lower rates of recidivism and higher  rates of employment may be an effect of these characteristics rather than  an effect of taking classes while incarcerated.
