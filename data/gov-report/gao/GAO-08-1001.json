LANL has implemented a network security system that is capable of detecting potential intrusions. However, GAO found vulnerabilities in several critical areas, including (1) identifying and authenticating users, (2) encrypting sensitive information, and (3) monitoring and auditing compliance with security policies. For example, LANL had implemented strong authentication measures for accessing the network. However, once gaining this access, a user could create a simple password that would allow alternative access to certain sensitive information. Furthermore, LANL did not use encryption for authentication to certain internal services, which increased the risk that sensitive information transmitted over the unclassified network could be compromised. A key reason for the information security weaknesses is that the laboratory has not implemented an information security program to ensure that controls are effectively established and maintained. For example, LANL did not adequately assess information security risks or develop effective policies and procedures to govern the security of its computing environment. LANL's most recent risk assessment for the unclassified network generally identified and analyzed vulnerabilities, but did not account for risks identified by internal vulnerability testing. Deficiencies in LANL's policies and procedures have been the subject of reports by the Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Independent Oversight and the Los Alamos Site Office, including foreign nationals' access to the unclassified network. GAO found that, as of May 2008, 301 (or 44 percent) of 688 foreign nationals, who had access to the unclassified network, were from countries classified as sensitive by DOE, such as China, India, and Russia. In addition, a significant number of foreign nationals from sensitive countries were authorized remote access to LANL's unclassified network. The number of foreign nationals with access has raised concerns among laboratory and NNSA officials because of the sensitive information contained on the unclassified network. In response, the laboratory has taken some measures to limit foreign nationals' access. From fiscal years 2001 through 2007, LANL spent approximately $51.4 million to protect its unclassified network. LANL cyber security officials told us that funding has been inadequate to address some of their security concerns. Specifically, there was a risk that unclassified network users would no longer receive cyber security training and that the laboratory would not be able to ensure that data containing sensitive unclassified information would be properly sanitized or destroyed. However, NNSA officials asserted that LANL has not adequately justified its requests for additional funds.

The laboratory Directors emphasized that  the inevitable effect of cuts in cyber security funding would be to forgo  improvements in the classified network while also reducing support for  the unclassified network. The lack of funding would be particularly  harmful to the unclassified network because it is essential to productivity,  a key factor in transforming the nuclear weapons complex, and is clearly a  target for external attack.

In addition,  there was a risk that unclassified network users could not receive cyber  security training, which creates serious potential for user-introduced  vulnerabilities to the unclassified network.

NNSA also stated that LANL is currently  responding to a DOE Secretarial Compliance Order requiring the  laboratory contractor to take comprehensive steps to ensure that it  identifies and addresses, among other things, critical cyber security  deficiencies. The July 2007 Compliance Order was issued after a  subcontractor employee removed classified information from LANL  without authorization. The Order requires LANL to submit an integrated  corrective action plan to address critical security issues. These steps must  be completed by December 2008, and violations of the Compliance Order  would subject the laboratory\u2019s contractor to civil penalties of up to  $100,000 per violation per day until compliance is reached.", "NNSA noted that responding to the issues identified in this report\u2014as well  as more technical issues included in a limited official use only version of  this report\u2014will extend beyond the completion of the Compliance Order  since the actions we recommend are sufficiently more complex. We would  expect that our recommendations, when implemented, would complement  and be consistent with other remedial actions taken to improve LANL\u2019s  cyber security posture as part of the Secretarial Compliance Order.   Furthermore, NNSA stated that it will exercise the leadership necessary to  correct the deficiencies identified in our report and will implement  controls and processes complex-wide to demonstrate that it is  successfully managing risk. NNSA\u2019s comments on our draft report are  presented in appendix II.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

Our evaluation was based on our Federal Information System  Controls Audit Manual (FISCAM), which provides guidance for reviewing  information system controls that affect the confidentiality, integrity, and  availability of computerized information.", "Using National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards  and guidance, and Department of Energy (DOE) and National Nuclear  Security Administration (NNSA) policies, procedures, practices, and  standards, we    developed an accurate understanding of the overall network architecture  and examined routers, network management servers, switches, and  firewalls;   analyzed the effectiveness of controls used to establish individual  accountability and control network access;    observed methods for providing secure data transmissions across the  unclassified network to determine whether sensitive data was being  encrypted;   evaluated controls intended to limit, detect, and monitor electronic access  to sensitive computing resources and the effectiveness of these controls in  protecting computing resources from unauthorized disclosure and  modification;    evaluated control configurations of selected servers and database  management systems to assess the management of security features for  network components; and   observed and tested physical access controls to determine if computer  facilities and resources were being protected from espionage, sabotage,  damage, and theft; In addition, we obtained views and documentation on these issues from  security officials at DOE, NNSA, the Los Alamos Site Office (LASO), and  LANL.", "To assess whether LANL had fully implemented an information security  program to ensure that controls were established and maintained for its  unclassified computer network, we used the requirements identified by  FISMA, which establishes key elements for an effective information  security program. We    examined training records for personnel with significant security  responsibilities to determine if they received training commensurate with  those responsibilities; reviewed LANL\u2019s risk assessment process and risk assessments for the  unclassified network to determine whether risks and threats were  documented consistent with federal guidance;   analyzed LANL\u2019s policies, procedures, practices, and standards to  determine their effectiveness in providing guidance to personnel  responsible for securing information and information systems;    analyzed security plans to determine if management, operational, and  technical controls were in place or planned and that security plans were  updated;    analyzed security testing and evaluation results for the unclassified  network to determine whether management, operational, and technical  controls were tested at least annually and based on risk;   examined remedial action plans to determine whether they addressed  vulnerabilities identified in LANL\u2019s security testing and evaluations; and   examined contingency plans for the unclassified network to determine  whether those plans had been tested or updated.", "We also discussed with key security representatives and officials  responsible for information security management at DOE, NNSA, LASO,  and LANL, whether information security controls were in place,  adequately designed, and operating effectively. In addition, we met with  officials from DOE\u2019s Office of Independent Oversight and its Office of  Inspector General, regarding any related prior, ongoing, or planned work  in these areas.", "To determine the amount of funds LANL spent to protect its unclassified  network from fiscal years 2001 to 2007, we obtained and analyzed  documentation on the LANL cyber security program and budget, such as  the LANL Cyber Security Program Office Roles and Responsibilities;  LASO\u2019s Annual Cyber Survey Report Activity for fiscal year 2007; National  Nuclear Security Administration\u2019s cyber security policies; and LANL risk  assessments. We also obtained and analyzed financial data on LANL\u2019s  cyber security program and unclassified network from fiscal years 2001 to  2007. In addition, we met with cyber security officials from NNSA, LASO,  and LANL. To assess the reliability of funding data, we (1) reviewed  quality control procedures used to report funding information; (2)  interviewed knowledgeable officials; and (3) based on document reviews,  ensured that we had received all available information. We determined  that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2007 to September 2008 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.
