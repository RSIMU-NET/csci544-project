Time-directed requirements include those that are periodic in nature and are based on elapsed time or recurrent operations. Condition-based requirements, which are based on the physical condition of the ship, are usually identified by the ship\u2019s crew or inspection teams.", "Lastly, modernization requirements include changes that either add new capability or improve reliability and maintainability of existing systems.", "Officials of the Shipbuilders Council of America, the South Tidewater Association of Ship Repairers, private shipyards, and ship repair companies in the Norfolk area have expressed concern that the Navy\u2019s implementation of its policies and procedures favored the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, contributing to the private sectors\u2019 declining ship maintenance workload in the Norfolk area during fiscal year 1998."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Navy Policies and Procedures for Allocating Ship Maintenance Work in the Norfolk Area", "paragraphs": ["The Navy\u2019s allocation of ship maintenance workload in the Norfolk, Virginia, area is guided by legislative requirements and established Navy policy objectives, such as (1) retaining a certain level of public sector capability, (2) allowing sailors to remain at their home ports when shorter repairs are being done, and (3) achieving economic and efficient public depot maintenance operations.", "Historically, large ship dry-dockings and nuclear ship maintenance projects in the Norfolk, Virginia, area are usually allocated to either Newport News or the Norfolk Naval Shipyard and maintenance projects for conventional surface ships are usually contracted with private ship repair companies or allocated to Norfolk Naval Shipyard.

This requirement is for the whole Navy and applies to all types of depot maintenance at all locations. The 50-50 requirement excludes funds obligated for the (1) procurement of major modifications or upgrades of weapon systems that are designed to improve performance or (2) nuclear refueling of an aircraft carrier. To more fully identify all sources of funding for ship maintenance and repair work in the Norfolk area, we included obligated funds for these activities in our analysis for this report.", "The Navy\u2019s home port policy is to, where possible, do ship repair and maintenance work of 6 months or less at the ship\u2019s home port, thus improving the ship crew\u2019s quality of life by reducing time away from home. If the estimated project is to take 6 months or less, the Navy solicits proposals for maintenance contracts from private shipyards and ship repair companies located near the ship\u2019s home port.

(See table 1.)", "Table 1 also shows that reported obligations for fiscal year 1998 were much higher than previous years, with the largest percentage obligated to private shipyards and repair companies. Most of the 1998 obligations went to Newport News to fund a complex overhaul and nuclear refueling of the U.S.S. Nimitz. In the years in which Newport News has such a large workload, major funding spikes occur. In contrast, there was no similar workload assigned to Newport News in fiscal year 1996. Navy officials told us that funding to Newport News was smaller in 1996 because (1) there was less nuclear ship maintenance work\u2014work historically allocated to either Newport News or Norfolk Naval Shipyard and (2) Newport News was already operating near full capacity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Distribution of Reported Obligations Among Private Shipyards and Repair Companies", "paragraphs": ["Newport News is a large nuclear-capable yard and is capable of doing ship repair work that other smaller shipyards and repair companies in the Norfolk area are not. Smaller private shipyards and repair companies in the area do repair work on conventional ships and are not qualified to do nuclear-related work. Therefore, to make our private sector analysis more meaningful, we separated the Navy\u2019s reported obligations according to whether they were provided to Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Newport News, or other smaller shipyards and repair companies. As shown in table 2, Newport News received the largest obligations in all but 1 year between fiscal year 1994 and 1998.", "Table 2 also shows that the smaller private shipyards and repair companies received a much lower percentage of the total obligations in fiscal year 1998 than in other years. There was less conventional ship maintenance work\u2014work historically allocated to smaller shipyards and repair companies or to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. For example, the Navy reported that the total number of ships in the Atlantic Fleet decreased from 191 in fiscal year 1994 to 165 in fiscal year 1998. Similarly, the reported number of conventional steam-powered ships, maintenance-intensive ships that smaller ship repair companies have historically worked on, decreased in the Atlantic Fleet from 38 to 26 between fiscal year 1994 and 1997, and was projected to decrease to  23 ships during fiscal year 1998. According to Navy officials, conventional steam-powered ships require more maintenance than other ships because they are older and contain more mechanical parts than newer ships, which have more reliable component systems that are easier to remove, replace with new component systems, and repair elsewhere."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Private Shipyards and Repair Companies Received Less CNO Maintenance Work Than Initially Scheduled in Fiscal Year 1998", "paragraphs": ["During fiscal year 1998, the Navy provided the smaller private shipyards and repair companies in the Norfolk area less conventional maintenance work than initially scheduled in its private sector planning report dated September 23, 1996. This change occurred largely for operational reasons and requirement changes and because four conventional maintenance projects originally scheduled to go to the private sector were reassigned to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard to meet workload targets established for the public shipyard under the Navy\u2019s guaranteed manday policy. Appendix III details the final distribution of the CNO projects scheduled for fiscal year 1998.", "In September 1996, Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) issued the Navy\u2019s private sector depot-level planning report for fiscal years 1997 and 1998. The report contained CNO conventional maintenance projects that were not yet funded but were tentatively planned for allocation to the private shipyards and repair companies in the Norfolk area in fiscal years 1997 and 1998. Navy officials told us that the unfunded schedule was recognized as being subject to change and changes did subsequently occur. Nonetheless, some private shipyards and repair companies expected to receive larger amounts of work than they ultimately obtained because of the information in the report.", "In fiscal year 1998, the Navy reduced the size of the maintenance package for seven CNO maintenance projects and deferred one CNO project to fiscal year 1999 because several ships scheduled for maintenance needed less maintenance than expected and other Atlantic Fleet ships needed more maintenance than scheduled, requiring the Navy to transfer additional ship maintenance funds to those projects. In addition, the Navy canceled three scheduled projects: the U.S.S. Roberts project was canceled because the ship needed less maintenance than expected, the U.S.S. Radford project was canceled because the ship had operational commitments, and the U.S.S. Guam project was canceled because the ship was decommissioned in August 1998.", "During fiscal year 1998, the Navy also assigned the Norfolk Naval Shipyard four CNO maintenance projects, initially scheduled for competition in the private sector. This was done to meet workload targets established for Norfolk Naval Shipyard under the Navy\u2019s guaranteed manday policy. The objective of the Navy\u2019s guaranteed manday policy is to match the workload to Norfolk Naval Shipyard\u2019s workforce during the budget execution year since the shipyard\u2019s workforce figures and related costs have already been committed in the Navy\u2019s budget and workload reductions would result in losses. Based on previous work, we believe that the guaranteed manday policy is generally sound from a cost and operational standpoint because, without it, the Norfolk Naval Shipyard would lose money as a result of having work below the level required to support its budgeted workforce.", "Prior to fiscal year 1995, the Navy\u2019s shipyards reported significant operating losses. These losses were partly due to (1) fleet and system commanders\u2019 operational and administrative decisions that resulted in less work being assigned to the public shipyards than was projected and budgeted for and (2) the Navy\u2019s lack of flexibility to quickly deviate from the budgeted workforce because of Federal Civil Service requirements that require workers be notified before they can be separated. To minimize future departures from the budgeted workload, the Navy implemented the guaranteed manday program. When it is determined that the number of mandays originally budgeted for the Norfolk Naval Shipyard will not be utilized, officials of CNO, NAVSEA, the Atlantic Fleet, and Norfolk Naval Shipyard work together to identify alternatives for realigning the maintenance workload to better utilize the Norfolk Naval Shipyard budgeted workforce. These alternatives include adjusting the scope of work for selected maintenance projects, shifting funding from other Navy programs to ship maintenance, and moving planned workload from private shipyards and repair companies to Norfolk Naval Shipyard. We believe these initiatives are consistent with Navy policies and without them the Norfolk Naval Shipyard would lose money as a result of having work below the level required to support its budgeted workforce."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Movement of Funds Had Relatively Little Effect on the Atlantic Fleet\u2019s Ship Depot Maintenance Program", "paragraphs": ["During fiscal years 1994 through 1998, the Navy transferred or reprogrammed appropriated funds into and out of its ship depot maintenance program. However, the amounts transferred or reprogrammed out of the Navy-wide ship depot maintenance program generally did not adversely affect the Atlantic Fleet\u2019s ship depot maintenance program, where more funds were transferred or reprogrammed into the program than were moved out.", "During fiscal years 1994 through 1998, the Navy transferred or reprogrammed about $1.2 billion (about 10 percent of the total) appropriated for its ship depot maintenance program to other Navy programs. The majority of the transfers or reprogrammings were due to one-time adjustments\u2014changes that reflected the Navy\u2019s decisions to move funds to and from various Navy accounts based on emerging or unforeseen requirements. The Navy made these adjustments because of (1) force structure reductions, (2) operations tempo increases, (3) increased recruiting goals, and (4) administrative support needs.", "Although there was a Navy-wide reduction in appropriated ship depot maintenance funds due to program transfers or reprogrammings, the reverse occurred in the Atlantic Fleet. During fiscal years 1994 through 1998, these transfers produced a net increase in the Atlantic Fleet\u2019s ship maintenance funding. An analysis of the Fleet\u2019s data by fiscal year shows only 1 year where a net decrease to the program occurred\u2014during fiscal year 1998 when the Navy moved $7.1 million (less than 1 percent) of the Atlantic Fleet\u2019s ship maintenance funds to other programs.

The greatest change occurred in fiscal year 1998, when these smaller companies received less than in other years and less than the Navy initially scheduled. This was largely because the conventional workload that traditionally goes to these companies is declining, scheduled maintenance and operational requirements changed during fiscal year 1998, and four conventional maintenance projects originally scheduled to go to the private sector were reassigned to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard to stabilize and achieve more efficient operations at the public shipyard.

First, we determined and analyzed reported obligations for ship maintenance work allocated to Norfolk Naval Shipyard and the private sector during fiscal years 1994 through 1998. Second, we separated reported obligations for Newport News from the other smaller shipyards and repair companies in the Norfolk area because Newport News, specializing in nuclear refueling and major overhauls, performs larger and different types of maintenance projects than the other shipyards and repair companies. For the purposes of this review, this separation provided a more meaningful comparison of maintenance workloads allocated to Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Newport News, and other smaller private shipyards and repair companies during fiscal years 1994 through 1998.
