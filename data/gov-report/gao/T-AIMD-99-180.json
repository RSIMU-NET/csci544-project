Last year, we testified that significant risks  remained to the department's student financial aid delivery systems, risks  that involved systems testing, exchanging data with internal and external  partners, and developing business continuity and contingency plans.  We  also testified on the status of Education's mission-important and mission- supportive systems.  After providing some background information, my  statement today will briefly recap our prior findings and the actions that  were needed for reducing risk, progress by the department since then, and  future tasks facing Education.  We performed our work from March  through May 1999, in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background: Systems for Delivering Student Financial Aid", "paragraphs": ["Student financial aid programs are administered by Education's Office of  Student Financial Aid Programs under title IV of the Higher Education Act  of 1965, as amended.  The four major programs providing student aid  currently in use are the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP),  the Federal Direct Loan Program (FDLP), the Federal Pell Grant Program,  and campus-based programs.  These programs together will make  available over $50 billion to about 9 million students during the 1999-2000  academic year.", "FFELP and FDLP are the two largest postsecondary student loan  programs, and Pell is the largest postsecondary grant program.  FFELP  provides student loans through private lending institutions; these loans are guaranteed against default by some 36 guaranty agencies and insured by  the federal government.  FDLP provides student loans directly from the  federal government, while Pell provides grants to economically  disadvantaged students.", "In many ways, Education's student financial aid delivery system is similar  to functions performed in the banking industry, such as making loans,  reporting account status, and collecting payments.  The department  currently maintains 11 major systems for administering student financial  aid programs.  These systems were developed independently over time by  multiple contractors in response to new programs or mandates.  They have  resulted in a complex, highly heterogeneous systems environment.  The  systems range from legacy mainframes, several originally developed over  15 years ago, to recently developed client-server environments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Last Year, Education Faced Major Challenges in Addressing Year 2000 Activities", "paragraphs": ["Information systems are at the heart of the department's ability to carry out  its mission.  According to its own assessments, the student financial aid  delivery process could experience major problems if the systems upon  which it relies are not fully Year 2000 (Y2K) compliant in time.  Such risks  include delays in disbursements; reduction in Education's ability to  transfer payments, process applications, or monitor program operations;  and the potential inability of postsecondary education students to verify  the status of their loans or grants.", "Last September, the department had reported to the Office of Management  and Budget (OMB) that of its 14 mission-critical systems (11 involving  student financial aid), 4 had been implemented and were operating as Y2K  compliant.  Education, along with other executive branch agencies, faced a  March 31, 1999, OMB deadline for implementation of Y2K-compliant  mission-critical systems.  Given the situation at the time, we saw three key  issues that threatened the department's ability to carry out its mission:   systems testing, data exchanges, and business continuity and contingency  planning.", "Thorough Y2K testing is essential to providing reasonable assurance that  systems process dates correctly and will not jeopardize an organization's  ability to perform core business operations.  Agencies must test not only  the Y2K compliance of individual applications, but also the complex  interactions among numerous converted or replaced computer platforms,  operating systems, utilities, applications, databases, and interfaces.   Because of Education's late start and the compression of its schedule to  meet the March 31 deadline, the time available for key testing activities of  mission-critical systems was limited.", "We pointed out that Education needed to mitigate critical risks that  affected its ability to award and track billions of dollars in student financial  aid by ensuring adequate testing of its systems.  We said that maintaining  testing and implementation schedules while ensuring testing adequacy  would be essential.  Effectively addressing testing reduces the risk that the  department's ability to deliver financial aid to students could be  compromised.", "Data exchange\u2014the transfer of information across systems\u2014is the second  area of risk we identified at Education last September.  Conflicting formats  or data processed on noncompliant systems could spread errors from  system to system, compromising not only data but also the systems  themselves.  To mitigate this risk, organizations need to inventory and  assess their data exchanges, reach agreements with exchange partners on  formats and protocols, and develop contingency plans in the event of  failure.", "Education's student financial aid environment is very large and complex; it  includes over 7,000 schools, 6,500 lenders, and 36 loan guaranty agencies\u2014 not to mention other federal agencies.  Figure 1 is a simplified graphic  representation of that environment.  As we reported in September, to  address its data exchanges with schools, lenders, and guaranty agencies,  Education dictated how the data that these institutions provide to the  department should be formatted.  The department handles this in one of  two ways:  it either provides software to institutions, such as EDExpress,  or it provides the technical specifications for the institution to use in  developing the necessary interface.", "As of last fall, the department had been active in coordinating with its data  exchange partners.  Beyond this, however, we pointed out that Education  needed to engage in end-to-end testing of its mission-critical business  processes, including data exchanges.  Further complicating data exchange  compliance is the need to ensure that data are not only formatted  consistently but are accurate.  As we have previously reported, Education  has experienced serious data integrity problems in the past.", "As Education reported last September, its own surveys showed that many  of its data exchange partners had a long way to go.  For example, in the  summer of 1998, the department and the American Association of  Community Colleges conducted surveys of the Y2K readiness of  postsecondary schools.  They found that up to one-third of the schools did  not have a compliance plan in place.", "The third area we discussed last September as critical for Education was  business continuity and contingency planning.  Some problems are  inevitable as any organization enters the next century.  It is vital, then, that  realistic contingency plans be developed to ensure the continuity of core  business operations in the event of Y2K-induced failures.  And as our  testimony pointed out, continuity and contingency plans must focus on  more than agency systems alone; they must likewise address data provided  by their business partners and the public infrastructure.  One weak link  anywhere in the chain of critical dependencies can cause major disruption.", "The department has been committed to developing business continuity and  contingency plans for each mission-critical business process and its  supporting systems.  It initiated contingency planning in February 1998,  and appointed a senior executive to manage the development and testing of  continuity and contingency plans for all student financial aid operations.   Completion of such plans was targeted for March 31, 1999."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Progress Has Been Made", "paragraphs": ["As of March 31, 1999, the Department of Education reported that all of its  14 mission-critical systems\u2014including the 11 student financial aid delivery  systems\u2014were Y2K compliant and in operation.  Our review of three of  these systems found adequate test documentation.  However, the  department has not yet closed out four of its systems as completing the  Y2K compliance process in accordance with Education-specific guidance;  other systems issues also remain outstanding, although they are generally  considered low-risk.

The final step of the department's close out process includes a Year 2000  System Closeout form that is signed by the system manager, principal  office coordinator, Year 2000 project management team liaison, and either  the independent verification and validation (IV&V) contractor or a  representative of the Year 2000 Program Office support contractor.  The  signatures certify that the system has completed the Y2K compliance  process, consisting of successfully passing appropriate Y2K validation tests  (including IV&V), and identifying and testing data exchanges.  As of May 9,  the department had not closed out 4 of its 14 mission-critical systems,  including 2 student financial aid systems.  Education expects to close out  three of the remaining four systems by the end of this month but has not yet  received final concurrence from IV&V contractors, who are waiting to  review documentation pending from the department.  According to  Education officials, the fourth system Education\u2019s Local Area Network  (EDNET) requires additional funding for Y2K interoperability.  Education  has requested these funds as part of a supplemental budget request to OMB  for Y2K emergency funding.", "In addition to closing out the remaining 4 systems, 7 of the other 10  mission-critical systems have remaining tasks (excluding data exchange  testing) that still need to be completed.  For example, the Campus Based  System's computing environment was converted in February 1999 to  another operating system; however, the contractor for the data center has  not provided the IV&V contractor with an updated inventory of its  hardware and system-related software (e.g., operating system, system  utilities, compilers, etc.).  The inventory is due to the IV&V contractor in  mid-May for review.  Another example of an open item is a noncompliant  software product used by the Direct Loan Origination System.  The  software product was upgraded in April, but the IV&V contractor is still  waiting for documentation.", "According to Education officials and the IV&V contractors, these open  issues are considered low-risk items and are in the process of being  resolved.  With the exception of data exchange testing (discussed below),  Education expects to resolve these issues over the next few months.  The  department needs to be diligent in making sure that these issues are indeed  resolved expeditiously.", "The department is also currently in the process of developing a new  mission-critical system\u2014the Recipient Financial Management System\u2014to  replace the current Pell Grant Recipient Financial Management System.   The first two phases of the Recipient Financial Management System are  expected to be implemented on May 26, 1999, with the third phase  following on June 25, 1999, and the final phase scheduled for  implementation on August 13, 1999.
