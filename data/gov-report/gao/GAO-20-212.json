However, ensuring that manufacturers are not subject to both discounts requires coordination within HHS, and between covered entities and states. GAO was asked to provide information on the prevention of duplicate discounts. Among other things, this report examines HHS's efforts to ensure compliance with the prohibition on duplicate discounts.

However, federal law prohibits subjecting manufacturers to \u201cduplicate discounts\u201d in which drugs provided to Medicaid beneficiaries are subject to both 340B Program discounted prices (i.e., are 340B drugs) and Medicaid rebates. To prevent duplicate discounts, state Medicaid programs must know when covered entities dispense 340B drugs to Medicaid beneficiaries, so the state programs can exclude those drugs from their Medicaid rebate requests.", "GAO found that limitations in the Department of Health and Human Services's (HHS) oversight of the 340B and Medicaid Drug Rebate Programs may increase the risk that duplicate discounts occur.", "HHS's Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) conducts limited oversight of state Medicaid programs' efforts to prevent duplicate discounts. CMS does not track or review states' policies or procedures for preventing duplicate discounts, and GAO found that the procedures states used to exclude 340B drugs are not always documented or effective at identifying these drugs. As a result, CMS does not have the information needed to effectively ensure that states exclude 340B drugs from Medicaid rebate requests. CMS also does not have a reasonable assurance that states are seeking rebates for all eligible drugs, potentially increasing costs to state and federal governments due to forgone rebates.", "HHS's Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA) audits of covered entities do not include reviews of states' policies and procedures for the use and identification of 340B drugs. As a result, the audits are unable to determine whether covered entities are following state requirements, and taking the necessary steps to comply with the prohibition on subjecting manufacturers to duplicate discounts.", "GAO reported in 2018 that HRSA had not issued guidance on, and did not audit for, duplicate discounts in Medicaid managed care and recommended the agency do so as the majority of Medicaid enrollees, prescriptions, and spending for drugs are in managed care. HRSA is working to determine next steps to address these recommendations. In this report, GAO found that, unlike Medicaid fee-for-service, when duplicate discounts in Medicaid managed care claims are identified, HRSA does not require covered entities to address them or work with manufacturers to repay them. As a result, manufacturers may be subject to duplicate discounts for drugs provided under managed care.", "Given these limitations in federal oversight, HHS does not have reasonable assurance that states and covered entities are complying with the prohibition on duplicate discounts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making three recommendations, namely that: 1) CMS ensure that state Medicaid programs have written policies and procedures that are designed to prevent duplicate discounts and forgone rebates; and that HRSA 2) incorporate covered entities' compliance with state policies into its audits, and 3) require covered entities to work with manufacturers regarding repayment of identified duplicate discounts in managed care.

The discounts, which HRSA estimates to be 25 to 50 percent of the cost  of the drugs, are comparable to the rebates made available to state  Medicaid programs through the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program,  overseen by HHS\u2019s Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).  While both covered entities and state Medicaid programs are eligible for  these discounts, federal law prohibits subjecting drug manufacturers to  duplicate discounts in which drugs provided to Medicaid beneficiaries are  subject to both the 340B Program discounted price and a Medicaid  rebate.", "To prevent duplicate discounts, covered entities and states must work  together to identify when covered entities provide drugs purchased at  discounted prices through the 340B Program to Medicaid beneficiaries so  states can exclude those purchases from rebate requests sent to drug  manufacturers. (In this report, we refer to the discounted price through the  340B Program as the 340B price, and to drugs purchased by covered  entities at that price as 340B drugs.) States also need to know when the  drugs provided to Medicaid beneficiaries by covered entities were not  purchased at 340B prices, so they do not forgo rebates for which they are  legally entitled, which may increase their costs, as well as that of federal  taxpayers.", "In recent years, the potential for duplicate discounts has increased due to  substantial growth in the 340B Program and the expansion of the  Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Specifically, from 2010 to 2019, the  number of covered entities participating in the 340B Program increased  from nearly 9,700 to nearly 13,000. In addition, since a change in HRSA  guidance allowed covered entities to have an unlimited number of  contract pharmacies, there also has been a large increase in the number  of contract pharmacies\u2014outside pharmacies that covered entities  contract with and pay to dispense 340B drugs on their behalf.  Specifically, the number of contract pharmacies increased from about  1,300 at the beginning of 2010 to around 23,000 in 2019. Furthermore,  while the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program had historically been limited to  drugs provided under Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS), in 2010, the Patient  Protection and Affordable Care Act expanded the program by also  requiring drug manufacturers to provide rebates for drugs provided under  Medicaid managed care. Since that time, total Medicaid drug rebates  more than doubled from about $15 billion in fiscal year 2011 to more than  $36 billion in fiscal year 2018.", "In recent years, the HHS Office of Inspector General and others have  identified challenges covered entities and states face in identifying 340B  drugs provided to Medicaid beneficiaries, and thus in preventing duplicate  discounts. In addition, in a June 2018 report, we identified weaknesses  in HRSA\u2019s oversight that impede its ability to ensure compliance with  340B Program requirements, including the prohibition on duplicate  discounts. We reported that HRSA had not issued guidance as to how  covered entities should prevent duplicate discounts in Medicaid managed  care and thus, did not include reviews of covered entities\u2019 processes to  prevent duplicate discounts for drugs dispensed through Medicaid  managed care in its audits of the entities. As a result, we found that drug  manufacturers were at risk of providing duplicate discounts. We  recommended that HRSA address these issues. HRSA concurred with  our recommendations, and as of October 2019, reported that it was  continuing to work to determine next steps to address them.", "You asked us to examine stakeholders\u2019 efforts to prevent duplicate  discounts under the 340B and Medicaid Drug Rebate Programs.

The data collection instrument requested the states\u2019 policies  related to the use and identification of 340B drugs in both Medicaid FFS  and managed care for three different methods in which outpatient drugs  can be dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries. We received responses  from all states, and reviewed their available policies to determine whether  they allowed covered entities to provide 340B drugs to beneficiaries  covered under Medicaid FFS or managed care for each dispensing  method, and how the state identified and excluded 340B drugs provided  to such beneficiaries from rebate requests sent to drug manufacturers.  For states that indicated they did not have written policies or procedures  for using or identifying 340B drugs, we asked for a description of how  they prevented duplicate discounts in practice.", "In order to gain a more in-depth understanding of how states worked with  covered entities to implement policies and procedures to prevent  duplicate discounts, we also interviewed Medicaid officials from a  nongeneralizable sample of four states. We selected the four states\u2014 Michigan, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Texas\u2014to obtain variation in  factors such as the amount of Medicaid expenditures and rebates on  outpatient drugs under both Medicaid FFS and managed care, and  geographic location. In addition, we interviewed officials from a  nongeneralizable sample of four covered entities located in each of the  four selected states (for a total of 16 covered entities) about their  understanding of their individual states\u2019 policies and the covered entities\u2019  actions to prevent duplicate discounts.

In addition, we interviewed CMS and HRSA officials responsible for  overseeing and administering the Medicaid Drug Rebate and 340B  Programs, respectively, about their oversight of duplicate discounts, and  any potential actions or initiatives the agencies were undertaking, such as  updating or clarifying guidance for covered entities, states, and  manufacturers. Additionally, as part of the interviews with the states and  covered entities described earlier, we asked officials for their perspectives  on federal guidance related to preventing duplicate discounts, and  whether they believed any clarifications were needed. We also contacted  and obtained information about federal oversight, including CMS\u2019s and  HRSA\u2019s efforts to resolve disputes about duplicate discounts, from three  drug manufacturers that had high 340B Program participation based on  either total 340B drug sales in dollars or in units sold, as well as  consultants that research duplicate discount issues on behalf of  manufacturers, and a trade organization that represents drug  manufacturers.

State Medicaid programs  generally must cover all of the drugs of manufacturers that participate in  the rebate program. Originally, rebates were available only for drugs paid  for by the state on a FFS basis, but the Patient Protection and Affordable  Care Act extended the program to outpatient drugs paid for under  Medicaid managed care; there are more Medicaid enrollees,  prescriptions, and spending for drugs under managed care than FFS.  The rebates received for both FFS and managed care are shared by the  federal government and states.", "The amount of Medicaid rebates for a drug is based on a statutory  formula. Using that formula CMS calculates a unit rebate amount for  each drug and provides that amount to states so they can determine the  amount of rebates to request. Every quarter, each state multiplies the  number of units of each drug it either paid for on a FFS basis or provided  through its managed care plans by the CMS-provided unit rebate amount.  For drugs provided under FFS, the state calculates the number of units  based on drug claims it reimbursed, while states use drug utilization data  provided by managed care plans to determine the number of units of  each drug that were provided by the plans to Medicaid beneficiaries.

In addition, covered entities can generate revenue to the  extent that they can purchase 340B drugs for eligible patients whose  insurance reimbursement exceeds the price paid. Incentives for  participation by drug manufacturers are strong because they must  participate in the 340B Program to receive Medicaid reimbursement for  their drugs.", "Covered entities generally become eligible for the 340B Program by  qualifying as certain federal grantees or as one of six specified types of  hospitals. Eligible federal grantees include federally qualified health  centers, which provide comprehensive community-based primary and  preventive care services to medically underserved populations, as well as  certain other federal grantees, such as family planning clinics and Ryan  White HIV/AIDS program grantees, among others.

Once their  eligibility is approved by HRSA, covered entities can begin purchasing  drugs from manufacturers at the 340B discounted prices. Covered entities  may provide drugs, including 340B drugs, to patients through one or more  dispensing methods. Specifically, covered entities may dispense these  drugs through pharmacies\u2014either through in-house pharmacies they  own; through the use of contract pharmacy arrangements, in which they  contract with outside pharmacies and pay them to dispense drugs on their  behalf; or both. In addition, providers who work at covered entities, such  as doctors and nurses, may administer 340B drugs to patients directly,  such as during office visits. These are known as provider-administered  drugs.", "As a condition of participating in the 340B Program, covered entities must  follow certain requirements.

In contrast, if a  state mistakenly believes the entity used 340B drugs when it did not, it  might exclude those drugs from its rebate requests and would forgo  eligible rebates.", "To help prevent duplicate discounts, in 1993, HRSA and CMS  collaborated to establish the Medicaid Exclusion File (MEF) as a  mechanism to assist in the identification of 340B drugs provided to  Medicaid FFS beneficiaries. The MEF lists the covered entities that  reported to HRSA that they choose to use or \u201ccarve in\u201d 340B drugs for  their Medicaid FFS patients. Specifically, HRSA requires that covered  entities that decide to carve in these drugs for Medicaid provide the  agency with the provider number or numbers that the entities use to bill  the state for those drugs. The entity and the provider number or  numbers it specifies are then listed on the MEF. HRSA guidance specifies  that all drugs billed with the provider numbers listed on the MEF should  be 340B drugs so a state that choses to use the MEF knows the drugs  should be excluded from rebate requests; there is no requirement for  states to use the MEF to identify 340B drugs. If a covered entity wants its  contract pharmacy to dispense 340B drugs to patients covered under  Medicaid FFS, HRSA guidance requires the covered entity, the contract  pharmacy, and the state Medicaid program to have an arrangement to  prevent duplicate discounts; any such arrangement must be reported to  HRSA.", "When the MEF was created, Medicaid drug rebates were only required  for drugs provided under FFS. As such, in a 2014 policy release, HRSA  clarified that the MEF is only intended for use for Medicaid FFS, that is,  only covered entities that elect to carve in 340B drugs for Medicaid FFS  are required to provide the provider numbers used for billing Medicaid  FFS for inclusion on the MEF. The MEF is not intended to capture  whether covered entities have decided to carve in 340B drugs for  Medicaid managed care and, if so, what provider numbers they use for  billing for those drugs. HRSA has not created a mechanism for covered  entities to use to identify 340B drugs provided to Medicaid managed care  beneficiaries, but encourages covered entities to work with states to  develop strategies to prevent duplicate discounts for drugs reimbursed  through managed care.", "While HRSA requires covered entities to use the MEF, there is no similar  requirement for state Medicaid programs. CMS provides states the  flexibility to determine procedures for identifying and excluding 340B  drugs from their Medicaid rebate requests. Under a May 2016 final rule,  states\u2019 contracts with Medicaid managed care plans that provide  coverage of outpatient drugs must require the plans to provide the states  with drug utilization data that is necessary for the states to claim Medicaid  rebates.

HRSA audits include covered entities that are randomly selected based  on risk-based criteria (approximately 90 percent of all audits conducted  each year), or targeted based on information from stakeholders such as  drug manufacturers about potential noncompliance (10 percent of the  audits conducted).

Under HRSA\u2019s audit procedures, a covered  entity with audit findings is required to 1) submit a corrective action plan  to HRSA that indicates it will determine the full scope of any  noncompliance (beyond the sample of prescriptions reviewed during an  audit) and 2) outline the steps it plans to take to correct findings of  noncompliance, including any necessary repayments to manufacturers,  among other things. If the HRSA audit shows that duplicate discounts  may have occurred, the covered entity must, as part of its corrective  action plan, contact the state Medicaid program to determine whether  duplicate discounts actually occurred\u2014namely, whether the state  requested a rebate on the claims in question, and if so, contact the drug  manufacturer to offer repayment. HRSA closes the audit when a covered  entity submits a letter attesting that its corrective action plan, including its  assessment of the full scope of noncompliance, has been implemented  and any necessary repayments to manufacturers have been resolved.

The procedures states used varied between Medicaid FFS  and managed care, and among dispensing methods. For example, states  were more likely to use HRSA\u2019s MEF to identify and exclude provider- administered drugs in both Medicaid FFS and Medicaid managed care  and to use a 340B claim identifier to identify and exclude drugs dispensed  at in-house pharmacies. Some states used a combination of procedures  or created their own state-specific procedures.

Without written policies, covered  entities in those states may not be aware of requirements for dispensing  and identifying 340B drugs, increasing the risk of duplicate discounts.  Specifically, we found that nine states did not have written policies or  procedures on the use or identification of 340B drugs for all dispensing  methods. Seven of the nine states had policies or procedures regarding  the use and identification of 340B drugs that were used in practice, but  these policies and procedures were not always documented.

Additionally, while the state had a  written policy for identifying and excluding 340B drugs administered  by providers at hospitals, officials told us that they had no policy or  exclusion procedures for drugs administered by providers at other  types of covered entities.", "In addition, we found that states\u2019 policies may not prevent duplicate  discounts. For example, some states used the MEF to identify and  exclude 340B drugs from their rebate requests in a manner contrary to  the MEF\u2019s purpose as set forth by HRSA. As noted previously, HRSA  guidance specifies that the MEF is not intended to be used to identify and  exclude 340B drugs provided to Medicaid managed care beneficiaries  from Medicaid drug rebate requests. Covered entities are only required to  be listed on the MEF if they carve in 340B drugs for Medicaid FFS. Since  the MEF may not accurately reflect covered entities\u2019 use of 340B drugs  for Medicaid managed care, states\u2019 use of the MEF in this instance may  increase the risk of duplicate discounts or forgone rebates unless states  require covered entities to make the same decisions on the use of 340B  drugs for FFS and managed care. For example, as shown in figure 2, a  state\u2019s use of the MEF for managed care would likely result in a duplicate  discount if covered entities carve out 340B drugs for Medicaid FFS, but  carve in these drugs for managed care, as those entities would not be  listed on the MEF. Consequently, the state would not know to exclude  drugs provided by those entities from the managed care plans\u2019 utilization  data that are used for requesting rebates. If covered entities did the  opposite\u2014carved in for FFS and carved out for Medicaid managed  care\u2014then the state would likely forgo Medicaid rebates as it would  exclude drugs from its rebate request that were not purchased through  the 340B Program.", "Seven of the 13 states that used the MEF exclusively to identify and  exclude Medicaid managed care drugs from rebate requests for at least  one dispensing method did not require covered entities to make the same  carve-in decisions for both FFS and managed care. Additionally, while the  six remaining states required covered entities to make the same decision  regarding use of 340B drugs in FFS and managed care, that requirement  was not always clearly explained in the states\u2019 policies. For example, an  official from Arkansas, which used the MEF for identifying and excluding  340B drugs from rebate requests, told us that covered entities are  required to make the same carve-in decisions for both Medicaid FFS and  managed care. However, it is unclear how covered entities would be  aware of that requirement, as it was not documented in the state\u2019s policy  manuals at the time of our information request.", "Finally, states that rely on the MEF or state-developed lists of providers  carving in 340B drugs for Medicaid beneficiaries may not be able to  identify instances where covered entities are unable to purchase drugs at  the 340B Program discounted price, and instead need to purchase drugs  outside of the 340B Program. For example, orphan drugs are excluded  from the discounted 340B Program price for some covered entities. In  these situations, states that rely on the MEF or other state-developed lists  of providers may be forgoing rebates. For example, if covered entities do  not have a separate provider number for billing Medicaid for these non- 340B drugs, the states would be excluding both 340B and non-340B  drugs from their rebate requests. State Medicaid officials in Oregon and  Pennsylvania acknowledged that their states were likely forgoing rebates  when covered entities listed on the MEF were unable to purchase drugs  at the 340B Program price. While these state officials indicated that they  did not consider the lost rebates financially significant, the loss of these  rebates would also increase federal Medicaid expenditures, since rebates  are shared between the state and the federal government."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limitations in HHS Oversight Increase the Risk of Duplicate Discounts CMS Oversight of State Medicaid Programs\u2019 Efforts to Prevent Duplicate Discounts Is Limited", "paragraphs": ["CMS oversight of state Medicaid programs\u2019 efforts to prevent duplicate  discounts is limited. States have the flexibility to select the procedures  used for identifying and excluding 340B drugs from rebate requests.  Although CMS collaborated with HRSA to establish the MEF as a tool for  identifying 340B drugs in Medicaid FFS, CMS does not require states to  use the MEF in their duplicate discount prevention efforts. Instead, CMS  has provided states with options of procedures they could consider for  identifying and excluding 340B drugs from rebate requests. For example,  CMS\u2019s February 2016 final rule on covered outpatient drugs, which  detailed requirements for Medicaid reimbursement of covered outpatient  drugs, included in its preamble examples of procedures that states could  use to identify and exclude 340B drugs in FFS without prescribing any  specific required procedure. Additionally, as noted earlier, the final rule  CMS issued in May 2016 on Medicaid managed care included a provision  relating to duplicate discounts for Medicaid managed care drugs.  Specifically, it mandated that state Medicaid programs\u2019 contracts with managed care plans that provide outpatient drugs require the plans to  establish procedures for excluding 340B drugs from utilization data  provided to states for use in seeking rebates, but did not specify what  procedures plans should use. Most recently, in January 2020, CMS  released a bulletin to state Medicaid programs on best practices for  preventing duplicate discounts.", "CMS has some visibility into state Medicaid programs\u2019 340B-related  policies and procedures through its oversight activities, but these  activities are not intended to, and do not enable CMS to, assess  compliance with the duplicate discount prohibition. For example, CMS  has a system in place that reviews copies of states\u2019 quarterly Medicaid  drug rebate requests; however, CMS officials told us that these requests  do not contain detailed, claim-level information that could be used to  determine if specific drugs purchased through the 340B Program were  incorrectly included. Additionally, CMS reviews states\u2019 contracts with  Medicaid managed care plans to ensure that they include language  requiring the plans to have procedures to exclude 340B drugs from  Medicaid rebate data provided to states, but CMS officials told us that the  contract language does not have to specify or describe those  mechanisms, limiting the information available regarding duplicate  discount prevention efforts. CMS also required states to submit their  plans for reimbursing covered entities for 340B drugs provided under  Medicaid FFS to ensure that the states\u2019 payment methodologies complied  with federal requirements, but these reviews were not focused on  ensuring that such drugs were excluded from rebate requests.", "CMS officials told us that they do not track which procedures states use  to prevent duplicate discounts; review states\u2019 policies or procedures for  identifying and excluding 340B drugs from rebate requests for  deficiencies or to ensure effectiveness; or audit states\u2019 compliance with  the prohibition on duplicate discounts. This is problematic because, as  noted previously, we found that not all state Medicaid programs have  written policies and procedures that specify the extent to which covered  entities can use 340B drugs for Medicaid beneficiaries, or how they are to  identify these drugs so the state can exclude them from Medicaid rebate  requests. If states do not have written policies, covered entities may not  be aware of whether, or under what circumstances, they are permitted to  provide 340B drugs to Medicaid beneficiaries or how to properly inform  the state of their use, which could result in errors that lead to duplicate  discounts and forgone rebates. We found some evidence of confusion  from covered entities about state policies. For example, officials from  Apexus, which manages HRSA\u2019s 340B Prime Vendor Program, told us  that Apexus\u2019s call center, which fields questions from covered entities and  other stakeholders about the 340B Program, most frequently receives  questions related to clarifying states\u2019 duplicate discount-related policies.  These inquiries about state requirements indicate that there is currently  confusion among covered entities.", "CMS\u2019s limited oversight of state Medicaid programs\u2019 efforts to prevent  duplicate discounts is also problematic because we found that states\u2019  policies and procedures were not always effective at preventing duplicate  discounts, or in line with federal guidance. For example, the MEF is only  intended to be used for Medicaid FFS. CMS officials told us that, while  the agency was not aware of any states using the MEF for Medicaid  managed care, such use would be concerning because it is not an  accurate tool for that purpose. However, as previously shown in table 2,  we found that eight states relied on the MEF to identify and exclude  Medicaid managed care drugs dispensed at in-house pharmacies from  rebate requests and 13 states used the MEF to identify and exclude  managed care drugs administered by providers.", "The lack of CMS oversight of state Medicaid programs\u2019 policies and  procedures related to duplicate discount prevention is inconsistent with  federal standards for internal control for information and communication,  which state that management should obtain relevant data from reliable  internal and external sources in a timely manner based on the identified  information requirements so that data can be used for effective monitoring. Without reviewing states\u2019 policies and procedures, CMS  does not have the information needed to effectively oversee states\u2019  compliance with the Medicaid drug rebate statute, which exempts 340B  drugs from Medicaid rebate requirements, and ensure that states have  effective policies and procedures for preventing duplicate discounts. The  lack of oversight of states\u2019 policies and procedures also results in CMS  not having reasonable assurance that states are seeking rebates for all  eligible drugs, and since Medicaid rebates are shared by the states and  the federal government, forgoing rebates increases Medicaid costs for  both states and the federal government."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Oversight Weaknesses Impede HRSA\u2019s Ability to Ensure That Duplicate Discounts Are Prevented or Remedied", "paragraphs": ["We identified several areas of weaknesses in HRSA\u2019s oversight  processes that impede its ability to ensure that duplicate discounts are  prevented or remedied:  Covered entities\u2019 compliance with state policies and procedures is  not assessed. HRSA\u2019s auditors are instructed to look for the potential for  duplicate discounts in Medicaid FFS by assessing whether the covered  entity\u2019s information on the MEF is correct; whether the entity is following  its policies and procedures to prevent duplicate discounts; and whether a  sample of claims reveals any noncompliance. Auditors are also  instructed to use information provided by the covered entity to determine  if the covered entity is following state policies. However, HRSA officials  told us that its auditors are not expected to independently identify or verify  state Medicaid programs\u2019 policies to determine whether the covered entity  is actually following what the state requires. Instead, HRSA officials  stated that it is a best practice for covered entities to include a description  of state Medicaid programs\u2019 policies related to the 340B Program, such  as how relevant drugs are to be identified, in their policy and procedure  manuals. In addition, HRSA told us that its auditors interview covered  entity staff about the controls in place to prevent duplicate discounts, and  may discuss state requirements during these interviews. The auditor is  then required to use this information to determine whether the covered  entity is following state policy. For example, if the covered entity says that  the state requires a 340B claim identifier, the auditor is to look to see if  the covered entity used that identifier in the sample of claims that are  reviewed. However, the auditor is not expected to determine if the state  actually requires a claim identifier, or allows covered entities to use 340B  drugs.", "The fact that HRSA does not assess whether covered entities are actually  following state policies and procedures regarding the use and  identification of 340B drugs for Medicaid beneficiaries is inconsistent with  federal standards for internal control related to information and  communication. Those standards state that management should obtain  relevant data from reliable internal and external sources in a timely  manner based on the identified information requirements and evaluate  both internal and external sources of data for reliability so that it can be  used for effective monitoring.", "This lack of HRSA oversight is especially concerning because we found  that the covered entities we interviewed did not always have a correct  understanding of their states\u2019 policies. For example, officials from two of  the four Pennsylvania covered entities we spoke with told us they were  dispensing 340B drugs to Medicaid managed care beneficiaries at  contract pharmacies, despite state officials telling us the state does not  allow that practice. As a result of this confusion, duplicate discounts may  have occurred as the state was not excluding drugs dispensed by  contract pharmacies from its Medicaid rebate requests. Additionally, of  the 13 covered entity policy and procedure manuals we reviewed, only  four had descriptions of their states\u2019 policies and two of those descriptions  were incorrect. If HRSA were to audit the majority of those 13 covered  entities, its auditors would likely be unable to appropriately assess the  entities\u2019 compliance with state requirements. Without fully assessing compliance with state policy, HRSA\u2019s audits do not provide the agency  with reasonable assurance that covered entities are taking the necessary  steps to prevent duplicate discounts. As a result, drug manufacturers are  at risk of being required to erroneously provide duplicate discounts for  Medicaid drugs.", "Not all identified duplicate discounts are repaid. HRSA officials told us  that covered entities\u2019 obligations for preventing duplicate discounts are  the same for Medicaid FFS and managed care. However, as we reported  in 2018, HRSA audits do not assess for the potential for duplicate  discounts in Medicaid managed care despite the fact that the potential for  duplicate discounts related to Medicaid managed care has existed since  2010, when manufacturers were required to begin paying Medicaid  rebates under managed care in addition to FFS. As we noted in 2018,  HRSA indicated that it does not audit for duplicate discounts in managed  care because the agency has not issued guidance on how covered  entities should prevent this. As a result, we recommended that HRSA  issue guidance to covered entities on the prevention of duplicate  discounts under Medicaid managed care and incorporate into its audit  process an assessment of covered entities\u2019 compliance with the  prohibition on duplicate discounts as it relates to Medicaid managed care  claims. HHS concurred with these recommendations and, as of October  2019, HRSA reported that it was working to determine next steps related  to these recommendations. However, HRSA has noted that the agency  lacks explicit general regulatory authority to issue regulations on most  aspects of the 340B Program, and also told us, in October 2019, that  guidance does not provide the agency with appropriate enforcement  capability. As a result, HRSA requested authority in the President\u2019s  budget request for fiscal year 2020 to issue regulations on all aspects of  the 340B Program, as the agency believes that binding and enforceable  regulations would provide it with the ability to more clearly define and  enforce policy. In addition, the agency is not pursuing additional guidance  under the 340B Program at this time. We note, however, that the law  prohibits the payment of duplicate discounts and requires HRSA to issue  guidance to covered entities describing methodologies and options for  avoiding duplicate discounts. In the absence of federal guidance, HRSA  instructs covered entities to work with their states on duplicate discount  prevention.", "HRSA requires covered entities to work with affected drug manufacturers  regarding the repayment of duplicate discounts in FFS that are identified  through HRSA or manufacturer audits. However, HRSA officials told us  that the agency does not require covered entities to take the same  actions to address duplicate discounts for managed care claims that  HRSA learns about through its audits or other means. For example,  HRSA officials told us that they did not follow up on a letter from a state  that confirmed a duplicate discount occurred on a Medicaid managed  care claim, because the agency did not yet have guidance for covered  entities related to Medicaid managed care claims. Additionally, HRSA  officials told us they would not require a covered entity to develop a  corrective action plan or make offers of repayment to a manufacturer if a  drug manufacturer\u2019s audit of that covered entity identified a duplicate  discount in managed care. Although HRSA officials told us that they  expect covered entities to work in good faith with all parties involved to  resolve potential duplicate discounts in managed care, HRSA does not  require these actions if a duplicate discount is identified in managed care,  as it does in FFS. This is particularly problematic as the majority of  Medicaid enrollees, prescriptions, and spending for drugs are in managed  care, and the drug manufacturers we contacted believe that duplicate  discounts are more prevalent in Medicaid managed care than FFS.", "HRSA expecting but not requiring covered entities to address identified  duplicate discounts related to Medicaid managed care is contrary to  federal law, which provides that covered entities are liable to drug  manufacturers for duplicate discounts that are identified through HRSA or  manufacturer audits. It is also inconsistent with federal internal control  standards related to monitoring, which state that management should  oversee the prompt remediation of deficiencies and the audit resolution  process, which begins when the results of an audit or other review are  reported to management, and is completed only after action has been  taken that corrects identified deficiencies.

As a result, it is unable to proactively identify and correct problematic  policies and procedures, and prevent duplicate discounts and forgone  rebates. Additionally, without knowing state Medicaid programs\u2019 340B  policies, HRSA is unable to perform a comprehensive review of whether  covered entities are taking the necessary actions to prevent duplicate  discounts. In addition, HRSA\u2019s audits are not assessing compliance with  the prohibition against duplicate discounts in managed care because the  agency has yet to put forth guidance on this issue. While HRSA is not  currently pursuing 340B-related guidance, the agency continues to work  on determining next steps to respond to our 2018 recommendations on  the issue. In the meantime, however, HRSA still must ensure that covered  entities are complying with 340B Program requirements, including the  prohibition on duplicate discounts in managed care.

HHS stated that  HRSA does not have authority to determine whether state Medicaid  policies and procedures are \u201caccurate and appropriate.\u201d We agree that  HRSA is not the appropriate party for reviewing and assessing state  Medicaid programs\u2019 policies and procedures, which is why we  recommended that CMS, not HRSA, strengthen its oversight of states\u2019  340B-related policies and procedures, a recommendation with which HHS  concurred. We recommended that HRSA update its 340B Program audits  to include assessments of whether covered entities are following state  Medicaid programs\u2019 policies and procedures regarding the use and  identification of 340B drugs. HHS stated that HRSA does not have  authority to enforce covered entities\u2019 compliance with state Medicaid  programs\u2019 policies and procedures and that doing so would be \u201cbeyond  the scope of the 340B Program\u201d and would require additional training for  HRSA auditors, who currently \u201cdo not have this level of expertise.\u201d While  we understand that HRSA does not have authority to enforce compliance  with state Medicaid programs\u2019 policies and procedures, covered entities\u2019  compliance with state Medicaid programs\u2019 policies and procedures is  fundamental to preventing duplicate discounts and assessing compliance  with state policies and procedures is essential to ensuring covered  entities\u2019 compliance with the 340B Program\u2019s prohibition on duplicate  discounts.", "Further, HRSA already audits for compliance with certain aspects of  states\u2019 340B-related Medicaid policies for preventing duplicate discounts.  Specifically, HHS states that covered entities are expected to include a  description of state policy in their policy and procedure manuals. If such  descriptions exist, HRSA auditors are required to review those  descriptions and determine if covered entities are following them. Thus,  HRSA auditors already interpret state Medicaid policies and procedures  when performing audits and the agency already enforces compliance with  state policies by issuing audit findings when covered entities are not  following them. However, as noted in our report, HRSA does not require  its auditors to review state Medicaid programs\u2019 actual policies and  procedures. Instead, the auditors currently rely on covered entities\u2019  descriptions of those policies and procedures, which we found were not  always accurate. Additionally, knowledge of state policies would allow  HRSA to incorporate an assessment of compliance into all audits as  opposed to only those of covered entities that have such descriptions in  their manuals. Finally, without considering states\u2019 actual policies and  procedures and ensuring that covered entities are following them,  HRSA\u2019s audits cannot effectively identify the potential for duplicate  discounts. For example, simply checking covered entities\u2019 actions against  information on the MEF does not provide useful information if the covered  entities are in one of the many states that do not use the MEF and  instead direct entities to identify 340B drugs dispensed to Medicaid  beneficiaries via a different mechanism, such as 340B identifiers.", "HHS states that implementing this recommendation would be  burdensome and difficult to operationalize because HRSA would need to  be notified of any changes to states\u2019 policies and procedures. We  understand that the lack of knowledge of state Medicaid programs\u2019  policies related to duplicate discount prevention at the federal level  complicates the ability of HRSA and its auditors to determine what state- level requirements exist and to apply them to audits. This is, in part, why  we recommended that CMS ensure that state Medicaid programs\u2019  policies are publicly available\u2014a recommendation that, as noted above,  HHS concurred with\u2014and that HRSA work with CMS to obtain these  policies as needed. Though we understand that this creates an additional  step in HRSA\u2019s audit process, we continue to believe that including an  assessment of covered entities\u2019 compliance with state Medicaid  programs\u2019 policies and procedures related to 340B drugs is necessary to  identify potential duplicate discounts and to ensure covered entities\u2019  compliance with 340B Program requirements.", "HHS also did not concur with our recommendation that HRSA should  require covered entities to work with affected drug manufacturers  regarding repayment of identified duplicate discounts in Medicaid  managed care. In its response, HHS noted that because HRSA does not  have guidance related to preventing duplicate discounts in Medicaid  managed care, \u201cit is difficult to assess compliance in this area.\u201d However,  our recommendation is not asking HRSA to assess compliance related to  duplicate discounts in Medicaid managed care; instead, we are  recommending that, when actual duplicate discounts have been  identified, HRSA require covered entities to remedy those duplicate  discounts. As noted in the report, actual duplicate discounts may be  identified and confirmed by state Medicaid agencies through audits or  other means. Given that HRSA officials told us that covered entities\u2019  obligations for preventing duplicate discounts are the same for Medicaid  FFS and managed care, the steps for addressing identified  noncompliance should be similar, and thus, the agency should require  and not just \u201cencourage\u201d covered entities to work with manufacturers to  remedy any duplicate discounts related to managed care as they do for  those related to FFS.", "Additionally, the potential for duplicate discounts related to Medicaid  managed care has existed since 2010, when manufacturers were  required to begin paying Medicaid rebates under managed care in  addition to FFS. Ten years later, HRSA still has not issued guidance on  how covered entities should prevent duplicate discounts in Medicaid  managed care and has indicated that it is not pursuing new guidance at  this time.

For  example, officials from drug manufacturers told us that state Medicaid  programs do not always provide data on the individual claims for which  they were requesting rebates. Specifically, to obtain rebates, states  submit requests to participating manufacturers for all drug purchases  made that quarter; these requests contain the total quarterly amount  owed for each of the manufacturers\u2019 drugs, but not information detailing  each claim for which rebates are being sought. Although the Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) encourages states to respond to  reasonable manufacturer requests for claim-level data, the provision of  such data is not required. Without this claim-level data, manufacturers  reported that it is difficult to determine if rebate requests include claims for  drugs purchased at the 340B discounted price. Additionally,  manufacturers lack complete information on the extent to which covered  entities use 340B drugs for Medicaid beneficiaries. This is because the  Medicaid Exclusion File (MEF), a list maintained by the Health Resources  and Services Administration (HRSA) to assist in the prevention of  duplicate discounts, is only required to reflect the provider numbers used  by covered entities that choose to use (carve in) 340B drugs provided  directly by the covered entity to Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS)  beneficiaries. The MEF does not include information on whether covered  entities are using 340B drugs for Medicaid managed care beneficiaries  and may not include information on contract pharmacies that are  dispensing these drugs to Medicaid beneficiaries on covered entities\u2019  behalf.", "Despite these limitations, the drug manufacturers we contacted reported  that when claim-level data is available they review that data to detect  potential duplicate discounts before they issue rebate payments. For  example, officials from one drug manufacturer told us that they compare  the provider numbers on the claim-level data obtained from states with  the information on the MEF and dispute rebate requests for any claims  from a provider number listed on the MEF. However, officials from some  drug manufacturers told us that this approach is ineffective for preventing  duplicate discounts for drugs dispensed at contract pharmacies because,  as noted above, the MEF may not include information on contract  pharmacies, and the claim-level data may only list the provider number  for the dispensing pharmacy, not the prescribing covered entity.", "The drug manufacturers we contacted also reported trying to identify  duplicate discounts after rebates have been paid by looking at 340B  purchasing patterns. For example, officials from one drug manufacturer  told us they look at covered entities\u2019 purchases and assess whether the  proportion of 340B purchases is consistent with their carve-in status.  Specifically, these officials explained that if a covered entity is not listed  on the MEF, then the entity should not be using 340B drugs for Medicaid  FFS patients. Therefore, if all or nearly all of the purchases made by that  covered entity were at the discounted price, it could indicate the presence  of duplicate discounts. While the MEF is only intended to indicate covered  entities that are using 340B drugs for Medicaid FFS beneficiaries, officials  reported that drug manufacturers also rely on the MEF as a proxy for  covered entities\u2019 carve-in practices for Medicaid managed care since  there is no equivalent data source.", "If there are concerns that duplicate discounts occurred, officials from the  drug manufacturers we contacted indicated that they may conduct what is  referred to as a \u201cgood faith inquiry,\u201d in which the manufacturer, or a  consultant working on the manufacturer\u2019s behalf, requests data from  covered entities on a specific set of drug claims for which they have paid  rebates to determine if those claims involved 340B drugs. If drug  manufacturers confirm that a duplicate discount did occur, officials  reported that they may work to negotiate a repayment from the state or  covered entity, depending on which party was responsible for the error.  Additionally, one official who works on behalf of manufacturers told us  that manufacturers also will work with covered entities to remedy the  cause of the duplicate discount to prevent future occurrences. Drug  manufacturers told us that it is not always clear whether states or covered  entities are responsible for duplicate discounts, and thus, which party  should be contacted regarding repayment. Additionally, drug  manufacturers reported that some states refer them directly to covered  entities to resolve all inquiries. Medicaid program officials in Michigan and  Texas, for example, said that their states refer manufacturers to the  covered entities because they believe that the covered entities would  most likely be responsible for any duplicate discounts that occurred due  to a failure to correctly apply the required claim identifiers.", "If drug manufacturers need assistance resolving their concerns or  obtaining repayment for duplicate discounts, they can access options  made available by HRSA and CMS. Specifically, drug manufacturers can  request approval from HRSA to audit a covered entity to investigate  suspicions of duplicate discounts in both Medicaid FFS and managed  care. To receive approval from HRSA to conduct an audit, a drug  manufacturer must document reasonable cause and provide an audit  plan. In addition, HRSA requires the drug manufacturer to use an  independent auditor who follows government auditing standards.  According to HRSA, from October 2011 through August 2019, 45 audits  were requested by drug manufacturers and 26 requests were approved.  Of the 26 audits approved by HRSA, the agency received 13 final audit  reports, six of which had duplicate discount-related findings. However,  while audits can be a tool for identifying duplicate discounts and obtaining  repayment, some drug manufacturers we spoke with indicated that the  cost of audits may outweigh the benefits received in the form of  repayments. Additionally, as noted previously, HRSA does not require  covered entities to repay manufacturers for duplicate discounts that occur  in managed care. Drug manufacturers also may use the state hearing  process or pursue a dispute resolution in conjunction with states through  CMS if their issues with state Medicaid programs cannot be resolved  through inquires. According to CMS officials, through the dispute  resolution process, the agency provides drug manufacturers and states  with guidance to assist in determining responsibilities and identifying next  steps to work through conflicts.
