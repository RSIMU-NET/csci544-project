Besides better authentication of the identities of people accessing buildings and computer systems, smart cards offer a number of potential benefits and uses, such as creating electronic passenger lists for deploying military personnel, and tracking immunization and other medical records. Earlier this year, GAO reported on the use of smart cards across the federal government (GAO-03-144). GAO was asked to testify on the results of this work, including the challenges to successful adoption of smart cards throughout the federal government, as well as the government's progress in promoting this smart card adoption."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["To successfully implement smart card systems, agency managers have faced a number of substantial challenges: sustaining executive-level commitment in the face of organizational resistance and cost concerns; obtaining adequate resources for projects that can require extensive modifications to technical infrastructures and software; integrating security practices across agencies, a task requiring collaboration among separate and dissimilar internal organizations; achieving smart card interoperability across the government; and maintaining the security of smart card systems and the privacy of personal information. These difficulties may be less formidable as management concerns about facility and information system security increase and as technical advances improve smart card capabilities and reduce costs. However, such challenges, which have slowed the adoption of this technology in the past, continue to be factors in smart card projects. Given the significant management and technical challenges associated with successful adoption of smart cards, a series of initiatives has been undertaken to facilitate the adoption of the technology. As the federal government's designated promoter of smart card technology, GSA assists agencies in assessing the potential of smart cards and in implementation. GSA has set up a governmentwide, standards-based contracting vehicle and has established interagency groups to work on procedures, standards, and guidelines. As the government's policymaker, OMB is beginning to develop a framework of policy guidance for governmentwide smart card adoption. In a July 2003 memorandum, OMB described a three-part initiative on authentication and identity management in the government, consisting of (1) developing common policy and technical guidance; (2) executing a governmentwide acquisition of authentication technology, including smart cards; and (3) selecting shared service providers for smart card technology. These efforts address the need for consistent, up-to-date standards and policy on smart cards, but both GSA and OMB still have much work to do before common credentialing systems can be successfully implemented across government agencies."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to participate in the Subcommittee\u2019s hearing  regarding the benefits of, and challenges to, the successful adoption of  smart cards across the federal government. Smart cards are plastic  devices\u2014about the size of a credit card\u2014that use integrated circuit chips  to store and process data, much like a computer. This processing  capability distinguishes these cards from traditional magnetic stripe cards,  which cannot interact with automated information systems. In January of  this year, we reported that smart cards offer a variety of benefits to the  federal government, such as better authentication of cardholders\u2019  identities, increased security over buildings, more effective safeguards of  computer systems and data, and more accurate and efficient financial and  nonfinancial transactions. However, challenges to the successful adoption  of smart cards throughout the federal government need to be addressed  before the benefits of their use can be fully realized.", "As requested, in my remarks today, I will discuss the potential benefits  that the use of smart cards can offer, the challenges to successful adoption  of smart cards throughout the federal government, and the progress of the  General Services Administration (GSA), the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB), and other agencies in overcoming these challenges and  promoting governmentwide adoption of smart cards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["As you know, technology plays an important role in helping the federal  government provide security for its many physical and information assets.  Today, federal employees are issued a wide variety of identification (ID)  cards, which are used to access federal buildings and facilities, sometimes  solely on the basis of visual inspection by security personnel. These cards  often cannot be used for other important identification purposes\u2014such as  gaining access to an agency\u2019s computer systems\u2014and many can be easily  forged or stolen and altered to permit access by unauthorized individuals.  In general, the ease with which traditional ID cards\u2014including credit  cards\u2014can be forged has contributed to increases in identity theft and  related security and financial problems for both individuals and  organizations.", "Smart cards can readily be tailored to meet the varying needs of federal  agencies or to accommodate previously installed systems. For example,  other media\u2014such as magnetic stripes, bar codes, and optical memory  (laser-readable) stripes\u2014can be added to smart cards to support  interactions with existing systems and services or to provide additional  storage capacity. An agency that has been using magnetic stripe cards for  access to certain facilities could migrate to smart cards that would work  with both its existing magnetic stripe readers as well as new smart card  readers. Of course, the functions provided by the card\u2019s magnetic stripe,  which cannot process transactions, would be much more limited than  those supported by the card\u2019s integrated circuit chip. Optical memory  stripes (which are similar to the technology used in commercial compact  discs) can be used to equip a card with a large memory capacity for storing  more extensive data\u2014such as color photos, multiple fingerprint images, or  other digitized images\u2014and for making that card and its stored data very  difficult to counterfeit. Figure 1 shows a typical example of a smart card.", "Smart cards are grouped into two major classes: contact cards and  \u201ccontactless\u201d cards. Contact cards have gold-plated contacts that connect  directly with the read/write heads of a smart card reader when the card is  inserted into the device. Contactless cards contain an embedded antenna  and work when the card is waved within the magnetic field of a card  reader or terminal. Contactless cards are better suited for environments  where quick interaction between the card and reader is required, such as  high-volume physical access. For example, the Washington Metropolitan  Area Transit Authority has deployed an automated fare collection system  using contactless smart cards as a way of speeding patrons\u2019 access to the  Washington, D.C., subway system. Smart cards can be configured to  include both contact and contactless capabilities, but two separate  interfaces are needed, because standards for the technologies are very  different.", "Since the 1990s, the federal government has considered the use of smart  card technology as one option for electronically improving security over  buildings and computer systems. In 1996, OMB tasked GSA with taking the  lead in facilitating a coordinated interagency management approach for  the adoption of multiapplication smart cards across government. At the  time, OMB envisioned broad adoption of smart card technology  throughout the government, as evidenced by the President\u2019s budget for  fiscal year 1998, which set a goal of enabling every federal employee  ultimately to be able to use one smart card for a wide range of purposes,  including travel, small purchases, and building access. In January 1998, the  President\u2019s Management Council and the Electronic Processing Initiatives  Committee (EPIC) established an implementation plan for smart cards  that called for a governmentwide, multiapplication card that would  support a range of functions\u2014including controlling access to government  buildings\u2014and operate as part of a standardized system. More recently,  the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 called  for enhancing national security and counterterrorism efforts by using  technologies such as smart cards that could provide biometric comparison  and authentication to better identify individuals entering the country.", "In developing this testimony, our objectives were to explain the potential  benefits of smart cards, to discuss the challenges to successful adoption of  smart cards, and to discuss the steps that federal agencies have taken to  address those challenges. To address these objectives, we obtained  relevant documentation and interviewed officials from GSA and the  Department of the Interior. We also analyzed agencies\u2019 accomplishments  and planned activities to promote smart cards in light of the challenges to  smart card adoption across the federal government that we identified in  our January report.

For example, the process of verifying the identity of people  accessing federal buildings and computer systems, especially when used in  combination with other technologies, such as biometrics, is significantly  enhanced with the use of smart cards. Since 1998, multiple smart card  projects have been launched in the federal government, addressing an  array of capabilities and providing many tangible and intangible benefits,  including enhancing security over buildings and other facilities,  safeguarding computer systems and data, and conducting financial and  nonfinancial transactions more accurately and efficiently. Other potential  benefits and uses include creating electronic passenger lists for deploying  military personnel and tracking immunization and other medical records.", "The advantage of smart cards\u2014as opposed to cards with simpler  technology, such as magnetic stripes or bar codes\u2014is that smart cards can  exchange data with other systems and process information rather than  simply serving as static data repositories. By securely exchanging  information, a smart card can help authenticate the identity of the  individual possessing the card in a far more rigorous way than is possible  with simpler, traditional ID cards.", "Even stronger authentication can be achieved if smart cards are used in  conjunction with biometrics. Smart cards can be configured to store  biometric information (such as fingerprints or iris scans) in electronic  records that can be retrieved and compared with an individual\u2019s live  biometric scan as a means of verifying that person\u2019s identity in a way that  is difficult to circumvent. A system requiring users to present a smart card,  enter a password, and verify a biometric scan provides what security  experts call \u201cthree-factor\u201d authentication, the three factors being  \u201csomething you possess\u201d (the smart card), \u201csomething you know\u201d (the  password), and \u201csomething you are\u201d (the biometric).

TSA\u2019s goal is to create a  standardized, universally recognized and accepted credential for the  transportation industry. According to agency officials, the card is being  designed to address a minimum set of requirements, but it will remain  flexible enough to support additional requirements as needed. According  to TSA\u2019s plans, local authorities will use the card to verify the identity and  security level of the cardholder and will grant access to facilities in  accordance with local security policies.", "In addition to Homeland Security, a number of other agencies have  undertaken pilot projects to test the capabilities of smart cards. The  Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management, for example,  launched a pilot to provide smart cards to about 1,100 employees to be  used for personal identification at the bureau\u2019s facilities and to serve as an  example to communicate the benefits of smart cards to employees  throughout the bureau. According to bureau officials, the project has been  a success, and the bureau plans to continue the rollout of smart cards to  its remaining employees.

A  user wishing to log on to a computer system or network with controlled  access must \u201cprove\u201d his or her identity to the system\u2014a process called  authentication. Many systems authenticate users by merely requiring them  to enter secret passwords, which provide only modest security because  they can be easily compromised. Substantially better user authentication  can be achieved by supplementing passwords with smart cards. To gain  access under this scenario, a user is prompted to insert a smart card into a  reader attached to the computer as well as type in a password. This  authentication process is significantly harder to circumvent, because an  intruder would need not only to guess a user\u2019s password but also to  possess the same user\u2019s smart card.", "Smart cards can also be used in conjunction with public key infrastructure  (PKI) technology to better secure electronic messages and transactions. A  properly implemented and maintained PKI can offer several important  security services, including assurance that (1) the parties to an electronic  transaction are really whom they claim to be, (2) the information has not  been altered or shared with any unauthorized entity, and (3) neither party  will be able to wrongfully deny taking part in the transaction. An essential  component is the use of special pairs of encryption codes, called \u201cpublic  keys\u201d and \u201cprivate keys,\u201d that are unique to each user. The private keys  must be kept secret and secure; however, storing and using private keys  on a computer leaves them susceptible to attack, because a hacker who  gains control of that computer may then be able to use the private key  stored in it to fraudulently sign messages and conduct electronic  transactions. In contrast, if the private key is stored on a user\u2019s smart card,  it may be significantly less vulnerable to attack and compromise. Security  experts generally agree that PKI technology is most effective when  deployed in conjunction with smart cards.", "The largest smart card program currently in the implementation phase is  the Department of Defense\u2019s Common Access Card, which is being used  initially for logical access to automated systems and networks. Rollout  began in October 2000 with a goal of distributing cards to approximately  4 million individuals across the department by October 2003. In addition to  enabling access to specific Defense systems, the card is also used to better  ensure that electronic messages are accessible only by designated  recipients. The card includes a set of PKI credentials, including an  encryption key, signing key, and digital certificate, which contains the  user\u2019s public key. Defense plans to add biometrics to the Common Access  Card in the future\u2014which may include fingerprints, palm prints, iris scans,  or facial features\u2014and to enable users to digitally sign travel vouchers  using the digital certificates on their cards.

The Deputy Secretary also assigned roles and  responsibilities to the military services and agencies and established a  deadline for defining smart card requirements. Defense officials noted that  without such executive-level support and clear direction, the smart card  initiative likely would have encountered organizational resistance and  concerns about cost that could have led to significant delays or  cancellation.", "Treasury and TSA officials also indicated that sustained high-level support  had been crucial in launching smart card initiatives within their  organizations and that without this support, funding for such initiatives  probably would not have been available. In contrast, other federal smart  card pilot projects have been cancelled due to lack of executive-level  support. Officials at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) indicated  that their pilot VA Express smart card project, which issued cards to  veterans for use in registering at VA hospitals, would probably not be  expanded to full-scale implementation, largely because executive-level  priorities had changed, and support for a wide-scale smart card project  had not been sustained."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recognizing Resource Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Smart card implementation costs can be high, particularly if significant  infrastructure modifications are required, or other technologies, such as  biometrics and PKI, are being implemented in tandem with the cards. Key  implementation activities that can be costly include managing contractors  and card suppliers, developing systems and interfaces with existing  personnel or credentialing systems, installing equipment and systems to  distribute the cards, and training personnel to issue and use smart cards.  As a result, agency officials have found that obtaining adequate resources  is critical to implementing a major government smart card system.", "For example, at least $4.2 million was required to design, develop, and  implement the Western Governors Association\u2019s Health Passport Project  to service up to 30,000 customers of health care services in several  western states. A report on that project acknowledged that it was  complicated and costly to manage card issuance activities. The report  further indicated that help-desk services were difficult to manage because  of the number of organizations and outside retailers, as well as different  systems and hardware involved in the project. Project officials said they  expect costs to decrease as more clients are provided with smart cards  and the technology becomes more familiar to users; they also believe that  smart card benefits will exceed costs over the long term.", "The full cost of a smart card system can also be greater than originally  anticipated because of the costs of related technologies, such as PKI. For  example, Defense initially budgeted about $78 million for the Common  Access Card program in 2000 and 2001 and expected to provide the device  to about 4 million military, civilian, and contract employees by October  2003. It now expects to expend over $250 million by 2003\u2014more than  double the original estimate\u2014and likely will not have all cards distributed  until 2004. Many of the increases in Common Access Card program costs  were attributed by Defense officials to underestimating the costs of  upgrading and managing legacy systems and processes for card issuance.  According to Defense program officials, the department will likely expend  over $1 billion for its smart cards and PKI capabilities by 2005. In addition  to the costs mentioned above, the military services and defense agencies  were required to fund the purchase of over 2.5 million card readers and  the middleware to make them work with existing computer applications,  at a cost likely to exceed $93 million. The military services and defense  agencies are also expected to provide funding to enable applications to  interoperate with the PKI certificates loaded on the cards.

As it is being rolled out, the card is primarily being used for  logical access\u2014for helping to authenticate cardholders accessing systems  and networks and for digitally signing electronic transactions using PKI.  Officials have only recently begun to consider ways to use the Common  Access Card across the department to better control physical access over  military facilities. Few Defense facilities are currently using the card for  this purpose. Defense officials said it had been difficult to persuade  personnel responsible for the physical security of military facilities to  establish new processes for smart cards and biometrics and to make  significant changes to existing badge systems.", "In addition to the gap between physical and logical security organizations,  the sheer number of separate and incompatible existing systems also adds  to the challenge to establishing an integrated agencywide smart card  system. One Treasury official, for example, noted that departmentwide  initiatives, such as its planned smart card project, require the support of 14  different bureaus and services. Each of these entities has different systems  and processes in place to control access to buildings, automated systems,  and electronic transactions.

The  value of a smart card is greatly enhanced if it can be used with multiple  systems at different agencies, and GSA has reported that virtually all  agencies agree that interoperability at some level is critical to widespread  adoption of smart cards across the government. However, achieving  interoperability has been difficult, because smart card products and  systems developed in the past have generally been incompatible in all but  very rudimentary ways. With varying products available from many  vendors, there has been no obvious choice for an interoperability  standard.", "GSA considered the achievement of interoperability across card systems  to be one of its main priorities in developing its Smart Access Common ID  Card contract, which is intended to serve as a governmentwide vehicle for  obtaining commercial smart card products and services. Accordingly, GSA  designed the contract to require awardees to work with GSA and the  National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to develop a  government interoperability specification. The resulting specification  defines a uniform set of command and response messages for smart cards  to use in communicating with card readers. Vendors can meet the  specification by writing software for their cards that translates their  unique command and response formats to the government standard. Such  a specification previously had not been available.", "According to NIST officials, the first version of the interoperability  specification, completed in August 2000, did not include sufficient detail to  establish interoperability among vendors\u2019 disparate smart card products.  The officials stated that this occurred because representatives from NIST,  the contractors, and other federal agencies had only a very limited time to  develop the first version. The current version, version 2.1, released in July  2003, is a significant improvement, providing better definitions of many  details, such as how smart cards should exchange information with  software applications and card readers, as well as a specification for  contactless cards and accommodations for the future use of biometrics.

Although smart card systems are generally  much harder to attack than traditional ID cards and password-protected  systems, they are not invulnerable. In order to obtain the improved  security services that smart cards offer, care must be taken to ensure that  the cards and their supporting systems do not pose unacceptable security  risks.", "Smart card systems generally are designed with a variety of features  designed to thwart attack. For example, cards are assigned unique serial  numbers to counter unauthorized duplication and contain integrated  circuit chips that are resistant to tampering so that their information  cannot be easily extracted and used. However, security experts point out  that because a smart-card\u2013based system involves many different discrete  elements that cannot be physically controlled at all times by an  organization\u2019s security personnel, there is at least a theoretically greater  opportunity for malfeasance than would exist for a more self-contained  system.", "In fact, a smart-card\u2013based system involves many parties (the cardholders,  data owner, computing devices, card issuer, card manufacturer, and  software manufacturer) that potentially could pose threats to the system.  For example, researchers have found ways to circumvent security  measures and extract information from smart cards, and an individual  cardholder could be motivated to attack his or her card in order to access  and modify the stored data on the card\u2014perhaps to change personal  information or increase the cash value that may be stored on the card.  Further, smart cards are connected to computing devices (such as agency  networks, desktop and laptop computers, and automatic teller machines)  through card readers that control the flow of data to and from the smart  card. Attacks mounted on either the card readers or any of the attached  computing systems could compromise the safeguards that are the goals of  implementing a smart card system.", "Smart cards used to support multiple applications may introduce  additional risks to the system. For example, if adequate care is not taken  in designing and testing each software application, loading new  applications onto existing cards could compromise the security of the  other applications already stored on the cards. In general, guaranteeing  the security of a multiapplication card can be more difficult because of the  difficulty of determining which application is running inside a  multiapplication smart card at any given time. If an application runs at an  unauthorized time, it could gain unauthorized access to data intended only  for other applications.", "In addition to security, protecting the privacy of personal information is a  growing concern and must be addressed with regard to the personal  information contained on smart cards. Once in place, smart-card\u2013based  systems designed simply to control access to facilities and systems could  also be used to track the day-to-day activities of individuals, potentially  compromising their privacy. Further, smart-card\u2013based systems could be  used to aggregate sensitive information about individuals for purposes  other than those prompting the initial collection of the information, which  could compromise privacy. The Privacy Act of 1974 requires the federal  government to restrict the disclosure of personally identifiable records  maintained by federal agencies, while permitting individuals access to  their own records and the right to seek amendment of agency records that  are inaccurate, irrelevant, untimely, or incomplete. Further, the E- Government Act of 2002 requires that agencies conduct privacy impact  assessments before developing or procuring information technology that  collects, maintains, or disseminates personally identifiable information.  Accordingly, agency officials need to assess and plan for appropriate  privacy measures when implementing smart-card\u2013based systems and  ensure that privacy impact assessments are conducted when required.", "GSA, NIST, and other agency officials indicated that security and privacy  issues are challenging, because governmentwide policies have not yet  been established, and widespread use of the technology has not yet  occurred.

As I discussed  earlier, NIST recently issued version 2.1 of the specification, which  includes as an appendix a specification for contactless cards, as well as  accommodations for the future use of biometrics. NIST officials said they  intend to continue working to improve the specification and plan to  actively participate in the newly established Federal Identity and  Credentialing Committee.", "Another potential difficulty in achieving OMB\u2019s vision of streamlined  federal credentialing could be the need to reach consensus on policies for  using smart-card\u2013based systems. In our January report, we recommended  that OMB issue governmentwide policy guidance regarding adoption of  smart cards for secure access to physical and logical assets, and to do so  in conjunction with federal agencies that have experience with smart card  technology. According to the chair of the Federal Identity and  Credentialing Committee, basic policy guidance on developing smart- card\u2013based systems is being readied, based on work done at the  Department of Homeland Security. However, additional guidance will also  be needed to define minimum standards for the process of verifying  individuals\u2019 identities when credentials are issued to them. According to  the committee chair, it is likely that agencies currently have in place a  wide variety of ways of performing identity verification, and it will be  challenging to achieve consistency in how this is done across government.  Without such consistency, agencies might not be able to rely on  credentials issued by other agencies, because they would not know what  level of assurance was met in issuing those credentials.", "In summary, the federal government has made progress in promoting the  adoption of smart cards, which have clear benefits in enhancing security  over access to buildings and other facilities as well as computer systems  and networks. However, agencies continue to face a number of challenges  in implementing smart-card\u2013based systems, including sustaining executive  level commitment, recognizing resource requirements, integrating physical  and logical security practices, achieving interoperability, and maintaining  system security and privacy of personal information. In July 2003, OMB  took an important step in addressing these challenges by issuing new  policy for streamlining authentication and identity management in the  federal government. However, much work still needs to be done before  credentialing systems that are interoperable and achieve consistent levels  of assurance are commonplace across government agencies.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.
