These factors are:", "Availability of marketplace information : Market research is a key component that informs commercial item and price reasonableness determinations. However, GAO found that obtaining market-related information can be challenging because the products DOD requires may not be widely available in the commercial marketplace.", "Ability to obtain contractor data : When adequate market information is not available, DOD officials turn to the contractor for information to support the commercial item determination or data to make a price reasonableness determination. In the case studies GAO reviewed, most contractors provided relevant information, but not without delays and challenges. For example, while pricing data is key to DOD's ability to determine price reasonableness, several contracting officers reported that contractors were less willing to provide this data once an item was determined commercial.", "Extent of modifications to an item : When a commercial item must be modified to meet DOD's requirements, DOD officials may have to take additional steps, such as completing a comparative analysis of commercial items to the modified item. For example, in one case, a commercial navigation system had to be modified to withstand an explosion. To make the commercial item determination DOD officials had to make an on-site visit to the manufacturer to gain in-depth understanding of the services provided and to ensure they met DOD requirements.", "Reliability of prior commercial item determinations : Contracting officers may presume that an item is commercial if a DOD component had previously made that determination. However, GAO found that, in some cases, contracting officers reviewing a prior determination discovered that it was based on inaccurate information.", "DOD has taken steps to share more information across the department to inform these determinations, but efforts are in early stages of development or informal. No comprehensive information sharing strategy exists. In 2016, DOD established the Commercial Item Group within the Defense Contract Management Agency to provide recommendations on commercial item determinations. This group created a publicly available database to centralize commercial item information across DOD. However, this effort is incomplete. Also, according to DOD officials, they have not yet established who is responsible for the funding and upkeep of the information. Additionally, GAO case studies included instances where informal information sharing resulted in better outcomes, such as a lower price.

In fiscal year 2017, the  department spent $53 billion on commercial item contracts plus an  unknown amount through subcontracts. Generally, items are considered  commercial if they\u2014or something similar\u2014already exist in the  marketplace or require few modifications to meet DOD\u2019s specific needs.  Purchasing commercial items enables DOD to take advantage of market  innovations, increase its supplier base, and reduce acquisition costs.  Contractors also prefer to sell products and services as commercial items  because there are fewer government-specific contractual requirements,  reduced costs and risks associated with government-unique  specifications, and fewer auditing requirements than for other types of  procurements.", "The process to purchase commercial items can be relatively  straightforward when the item or service procured is clearly commercial  and a robust market of competitors exists, such as when buying a  computer. However, some commercial item procurements can be more  involved, such as buying a computer that has a case ruggedized for use  in harsh conditions. This report focuses on these more complex  procurements, and the issues that arise with them. Contractors and DOD  have noted that in some cases, for instance when the item must be  modified for DOD\u2019s use and is not competitively procured, the acquisition  process has presented challenges. As we found in July 2017, companies  that have not traditionally done business with DOD view DOD\u2019s workforce  as inexperienced in making commercial item and price reasonableness  determinations and view this as a challenge to entering the DOD arena.  The DOD Office of Inspector General has reviewed the process of  determining a fair and reasonable price on selected sole-source  commercial spare parts contracts and found that on these contracts  contracting officers accepted the contractors\u2019 pricing without performing a  sufficient price analysis.", "You asked us to review DOD\u2019s process for acquiring commercial items.

These contracts represent both products  and services, and were selected because they had been previously  identified as contracts that involved difficulties in making commercial item  determinations by one or more of the following entities: the military  services, the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA),  contractors, or through previous GAO work.

For example, legislation passed in 2015 included a  provision stating DOD contracting officers may presume that previously  established commercial item determinations shall serve as determinations  for future procurements of an item. The law further stipulated that if a  prior determination is not used for an item previously determined to be  commercial, the contracting officer must request a review by the head of  the contracting activity to either confirm that it is still valid or issue a  revised determination.", "In January 2018, DOD revised its regulations and corresponding  procedures, guidance, and information related to the procurement of  commercial items to reflect recent legislative changes. The DFARS was  updated to provide guidance to contracting officers for making price  reasonableness determinations, promote consistency in making  commercial item determinations (including updating guidance regarding  the use of prior determinations), and expand opportunities for  nontraditional defense contractors to do business with DOD. The  department also updated its Guidebook for Acquiring Commercial Items,  which includes information on how to define, determine, and price  commercial items, to reflect the regulatory changes.

The guidebook establishes that market research should be  an ongoing effort throughout the commercial item procurement process  to: (1) identify the industry and market for capabilities or technologies; (2)  identify prices at which the capabilities or technologies have been sold or  offered for sale; and, (3) continuously capture market information at  different points to ensure the best acquisition. When determining a fair  and reasonable price, market research should be conducted in order to  compare the proposed price to market pricing. Figure 1 illustrates the  process contracting officers generally follow to make commercial item and  price reasonableness determinations for more complex procurements.", "The contracting officer is ultimately responsible for making these  determinations, but, as appropriate, he or she may seek the assistance of  the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), military service  organizations such as the Navy Price Fighters or the Air Force Pricing  Center of Excellence, or the DCMA Commercial Item Group.", "The DCMA Commercial Item Group, which became operational in 2016,  provides recommendations on commercial item determinations within  DOD.

The contractor said the services were commercial,  but when the contracting officer conducted market research to determine  the commerciality of the services, she found no similar services available  in the commercial market. According to a contracting official, the Army\u2019s  particular units had to be nuclear hardened to withstand an explosion and  needed some functional interfaces added, which made finding a similar  commercial service difficult.

This difficulty occurred for a number of  reasons, including the contractor\u2019s own challenges in obtaining  information from their subcontractors. While several of the contracts we  reviewed showed that either the prime contractor or subcontractor  eventually provided sufficient information, obtaining this information was  not without difficulties. For example:  In a $1.7 billion Army sole-source contract for helicopter engines, the  prime contractor asserted that two small engine parts\u2014provided by a  subcontractor\u2014were commercial, but did not provide any documents  to support its assertion. After several requests for information on  commercial sales data, the prime contractor provided invoices for a  commercial engine that contained similar engine parts. The prime  contractor representative told us the reason it took so long to provide  the requested information was because the subcontractor would not  provide commercial sales data. As a result, the prime contractor  needed to research commercial engines that used similar parts in  order to support the commerciality assertion.", "In an $873 million Air Force sole-source contract for aircraft engines,  the contracting officer had difficulty obtaining commercial sales data  through market research for engine castings. The prime contractor did  not initially provide support for its assertion that the castings were  commercial, stating that it had difficulty obtaining supporting  information from its subcontractor. Air Force officials visited the  subcontractor\u2019s facility to determine that the item was a modified  version of a commercial item and was therefore commercial.", "In a $53 million Navy sole-source contract for KC-130J aircraft  propeller engineering and sustainment services, the contracting officer  told us she had difficulty determining if the proposed prices for these  commercial services were fair and reasonable because the contractor  provided invoices with the prices redacted. After several months of  back and forth, the contractor provided unredacted invoices for similar  services, which the contracting officer used to determine price  reasonableness. A contractor representative told us that the  contractor initially provided the redacted invoices in order to quickly  respond to the Navy\u2019s request for information, but that additional time  was needed to evaluate if releasing the unredacted price information  would violate a contractual agreement the contractor had with its  suppliers.", "In other cases, the contractor provided information or data that the  contracting officer considered insufficient to support a commercial item or  price reasonableness determination. For example:  In an F-15 aircraft production contract, Air Force contracting officials  had difficulty determining whether the prices of oil bypass valves were  fair and reasonable due to redactions in data the subcontractor  provided. The subcontractor\u2019s proposed price was four times more  than it had previously charged the government for the same item,  according to contracting officials. To support its prices, the  subcontractor provided a commercial price list and customer invoices  with redacted customer information, which the subcontractor  considered to be proprietary. According to contracting officials, the  redacted invoices did not provide enough detail to confirm whether  non-governmental end users were paying a price similar to the  proposed price in the Air Force contract. The subcontractor  subsequently provided a customer list associated with the redacted  invoices. Also, while the subcontractor showed that its proposed price  was lower than its commercial price list, contracting officers did not  consider subcontractor-provided support sufficient to explain why the  proposed price was higher than what the government had previously  paid. According to contracting officials, the prime contractor absorbed  the price difference between the subcontractor\u2019s proposed price and  what the Air Force paid for the valves.", "On a $2 million Army task order for navigation software upgrades on  Global Positioning System (GPS) units used in missiles, the DCMA  Commercial Item Group obtained redacted invoices and quotes from  a subcontractor to determine commerciality. But this information did  not provide enough detail to substantiate the commerciality  determination. A subcontractor representative told us that the  company provided redacted information to the government because  contractual agreements with its customers required them to not reveal  the customer name. After evaluating multiple factors, the DCMA  Commercial Item Group concluded that the GPS units did not match  the form, fit, or function of the commercial ones, and recommended  that this service and item were not commercial.", "Contractor representatives cited multiple reasons why they were unable  to provide data (see text box).", "Examples of Reasons Contractors Cited for Not Providing Data:", "One prime contractor told us that some subcontractors are  unwilling to provide information, such as unredacted invoices, to  them and therefore prime contractors cannot provide this  information to the government.", "Some subcontractors we interviewed explained that certain  information, such as customer names and prices paid in invoices,  is considered proprietary data.", "One subcontractor representative said that while the company  cannot provide unredacted invoices to a prime contractor, it is  willing to provide this information directly to the government, such  as the DCMA Commercial Item Group, which can verify the  content of the invoices at the contractors\u2019 facilities.", "Additionally, one contractor representative told us that when a previously  determined commercial item is later determined noncommercial, specific  cost or pricing data can be difficult to gather for companies that operate  primarily in the commercial market. This is because these companies  were not previously required to collect and provide this cost or pricing  data to the government. For example, the subcontractor that produces an  item for the Army told us that this item had been previously purchased by  the government on a commercial basis under an agreement that was later  canceled in 2014. When the government later determined this item was  noncommercial, the subcontractor had difficulty providing detailed cost  data for the government\u2019s units because they are procured on the same  manufacturing line as their commercial units. According to contractor  officials, the costs for subcomponents and labor hours for engineers that  work on these units are pooled together with cost for the commercial  business.", "A contracting officer\u2019s ability to obtain data is further affected once an  item has been deemed commercial. Several contracting officers told us  that once an item is determined commercial, contractors are less willing  to provide any pricing data. While certified cost and pricing data cannot  be required, the government can request uncertified data if needed to  make a price reasonableness determination. As previously noted, we  found cases in which contractor-provided information included redacted  invoices as evidence that an item was commercial. When the government  later requested uncertified cost and pricing data to determine price  reasonableness\u2014after exhausting government and public market  research resources\u2014the contractors were not willing or able to provide  the data.

The prime  contractor for an Army sole-source contract procuring modified fuel  systems to meet military safety, crashworthiness, and ballistic  tolerance requirements for Blackhawk helicopters claimed that its  modified fuel system was a commercial item. However the contracting  officer found no commercial market existed for this item so the  contracting officer had to take additional steps. To make a  commerciality determination, the contracting officer sought assistance  from the DCMA Commercial Item Group, which recommended that  the fuel system was not commercial.

In the prior determination the radio was compared to another radio  considered noncommercial. As part of his review for the new  determination, the contracting officer consulted with Air Force officials  because they procure the same radio for some of their aircraft  programs. The contracting officer ultimately determined that the radio  was, in fact, commercial by comparing it\u2014at the suggestion of the Air  Force\u2014to a different radio with similar features that is sold  commercially to the public.

While the Air Force contracting team relied on  uncertified cost and pricing data provided by the subcontractor, a  contracting official told us that the team also relied on information  shared by Air Force officials in other programs that were procuring  similar commercial items at the same time. The contracting team  discovered that another contracting official obtained a lower price for a  similar commercial item, and as a result, used this information to  negotiate a lower price.", "In the procurement for radios used in a variety of aircraft, as  discussed earlier, Navy contracting officials used informal information  sharing to make a commercial item determination. The Navy obtained  information from the Air Force, which was procuring the same radio  and which had performed a review in January 2017 that it shared with  the Navy. The review noted that other similar commercial radios  existed and that a comparison of this radio to these other commercial  radios could help determine that the radio is commercial. Navy  contracting officials, using the Air Force\u2019s review as well as their own  technical analysis, determined the radios were a modified commercial  item.", "Despite the creation of the database and the informal information sharing  that occurs, contracting officers still face challenges in obtaining adequate  information to make informed commercial item and price reasonableness  determinations. Specifically, DOD lacks a strategy for improving the  sharing of commercial item and price reasonableness information across  the department, such as efforts like the DCMA Commercial Item Group\u2019s  database. Internal control standards promote effective sharing of  information to ensure managers have the information they need to make  informed decisions. In addition, internal control standards state that  management should communicate information internally and assign  responsibilities for key roles while also considering the cost necessary to  communicate the information. In an environment where information is  difficult to obtain from the contractor, as we have outlined in this report,  the ability for contracting officers to have easy access to all necessary  commerciality and pricing information within DOD is critical. If DOD does  not have such information easily available, contracting officers will  continue to struggle with obtaining all the information they need to make  informed and efficient commercial item and price reasonableness  determinations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["When dealing with a limited marketplace and price data, determining  commerciality and price reasonableness can be challenging for DOD\u2019s  contracting staff. Ultimately, the effectiveness of determining  commerciality and fair and reasonable prices will depend on what  meaningful information the government successfully obtains to conduct its  analysis. Therefore, information sharing within the department is critical in  helping DOD\u2019s contracting officers determine commerciality and  reasonable prices on DOD\u2019s acquisitions. As our findings show, DOD has  made some efforts to facilitate the sharing of information, such as  establishing the DCMA Commercial Item Group. This group, in turn, set  up a database to increase the accessibility and utility of commercial and  pricing data. But the database is not yet robust enough to eliminate the  need for more sharing of information\u2014formal or informal\u2014across the  department. Enhancing information sharing efforts could address some of  the challenges we identified.

Due to limitations of the Federal Procurement Data System-Next  Generation (FPDS-NG) we could not identify all DOD commercial item  acquisitions in the data system, specifically contracts that had been  coded as having used procedures other than FAR Part 12, Acquisition of  Commercial Items. Additionally, contracts which had issues in making  commercial item or price reasonableness determinations would not be  identifiable in FPDS-NG. Due to these limitations, we requested that three  DOD services \u2013 Air Force, Army, and Navy \u2013 and the Defense Logistics  Agency (DLA) each provide us with five contracts that had points of  contention with the commercial item determination or the price  reasonableness determination, either at the prime contract or subcontract  level. We also identified contracts by asking officials at the Defense  Contract Management Agency (DCMA) Commercial Item Group and the  Navy Price Fighters for contracts as well as identified contracts through  previous GAO work. Additionally, we asked contractors to identify  contracts they believed had issues in determining commerciality and/or  price reasonableness. One contractor identified two contracts, which we  reviewed, but did not find to have any issues concerning commerciality or  price reasonableness.

We reviewed documentation including commercial item  determinations, price negotiation memorandums, market research, and  DCMA Commercial Item Group and Defense Contract Audit Agency  reports. We also interviewed contracting officials and contractors to obtain  perspectives on how an item was determined to be commercial and then  subsequently, determined to be offered at a fair and reasonable price. We  interviewed contracting officers to obtain their views on the effect the new  Guidebook for Acquiring Commercial Items and recently passed  legislation would have on these challenges, and how they might affect  contracts in the future. We interviewed officials from the DCMA  Commercial Item Group to understand how they assist contracting  officers in making determinations, and about the publicly available  database that centralizes commercial item information. We also reviewed  this database to understand what types of information it contained.
