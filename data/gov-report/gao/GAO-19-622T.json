The Trust Fund borrowed from the Department of the Treasury's (Treasury) general fund and hence from the taxpayer almost every year since 1979, its first complete fiscal year, causing debt and interest to accumulate. Federal law does not limit the amount the Trust Fund may borrow as needed to cover its expenditures. Trust Fund revenue will be further limited by the coal tax rate decrease of about 55 percent that took effect in 2019, and declining coal production, according to GAO's simulation. Specifically, Trust Fund revenue may not be sufficient to cover beneficiary payments and administrative costs, from fiscal years 2020 through 2050. Therefore, the Trust Fund could need to continue borrowing to cover its expenditures\u2014including the repayment of past debt and interest\u2014and the Trust Fund's simulated outstanding debt could exceed $15 billion by 2050 (see figure). However, as GAO reported in 2018, various options, such as adjusting the coal tax and forgiving debt, could improve the Trust Fund's financial position.", "GAO's preliminary observations indicate that Trust Fund finances will be further strained by coal operator bankruptcies. Since 2014, an estimated black lung benefit liability of over $310 million has been transferred to the Trust Fund from insolvent self-insured coal mine operators, according to DOL data. Federal law generally requires that operators secure their black lung benefit liability. To do so, operators can self-insure if they meet certain DOL conditions. As of June 2019, there are 22 operators that are self-insured and actively mining coal, according to DOL officials. GAO's preliminary analysis indicates that DOL did not regularly review these operators so that it could adjust collateral as needed to protect the Trust Fund. As a result, the amount of collateral DOL required from some of these operators is tens of millions less than their most recent estimated black lung benefit liability."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO will be considering recommendations, as appropriate, when ongoing work is finished."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to highlight GAO\u2019s prior and ongoing work  on Black Lung Disability Trust Fund (Trust Fund) solvency, and the  Department of Labor\u2019s (DOL) oversight of coal mine operator insurance  given recent operator bankruptcies.", "The Black Lung Benefits Program provides medical and cash assistance  to certain coal miners who have been totally disabled due to  pneumoconiosis, also known as black lung disease. Their surviving  dependents may also receive assistance. Black lung benefits are  generally to be paid by liable coal mine operators. However, the Trust  Fund pays benefits in certain circumstances including in cases where no  responsible mine operator could be identified or when the liable mine  operator does not pay. The Trust Fund is financed primarily by a tax on  coal produced and sold domestically, which we refer to in this statement  as the coal tax.", "In 2018, we reported that the Trust Fund faced financial challenges and  borrowed about $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2017 from the Department of the  Treasury\u2019s (Treasury) general fund to cover its expenditures.

The Trust Fund may also be affected by  declining future coal production, as we reported in 2018. With less  revenue from the coal tax, increased federal funding will likely be needed.  Under federal law the Trust Fund borrows from Treasury\u2019s general fund  when necessary to cover its expenditures. Federal law does not limit the  amount the Trust Fund may borrow from Treasury\u2019s general fund\u2014and  hence from the taxpayer\u2014as needed to cover its relevant expenditures.  However, various options, such as adjusting the coal tax and forgiving  interest or debt, could reduce future borrowing and improve the Trust  Fund\u2019s financial position (see GAO-18-351).", "In my testimony today, I will (1) discuss the future solvency of the Trust  Fund given the coal tax rate decrease and declining coal production, and  (2) provide preliminary observations based on ongoing work for this  committee regarding DOL\u2019s oversight of coal mine operator insurance  given recent operator bankruptcies.", "To address our first objective we drew directly from our 2018 report. In  that report we simulated, among other things, how Trust Fund debt may  change through 2050 given the coal tax rate decrease and declining coal  production. Our simulations were based on various assumptions and  simulated Trust Fund revenues and expenditures from fiscal years 2016  through 2050. To develop these simulations, we used actual and  projection data from (1) DOL for fiscal years 2015 through 2040; (2)  Treasury\u2019s Office of Tax Analysis for fiscal years 2011 through 2015; (3)  the Department of Energy\u2019s Energy Information Administration (EIA) for  calendar years 2015 through 2050; and (4) the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) for fiscal year 2017. We ran each simulation multiple times  using different sets of assumptions about the number of future black lung  beneficiaries and future coal production. Doing so provided a range of  estimates about the Trust Fund\u2019s future borrowing needs and provided  insight on the sensitivity of its overall financial position relative to its  revenues and expenditures. In this testimony, as we did in our report, we  generally present the results of a moderate set of assumptions for each  simulation. We assessed the reliability of the data used to develop our  simulations by interviewing knowledgeable agency officials and reviewing  relevant supporting documentation describing the inputs and assumptions  used, if applicable. We also reviewed DOL, Treasury, EIA, and OMB data  for outliers, obvious errors, or missing data. We determined that the data  were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our report.", "Our preliminary observations regarding DOL\u2019s oversight of coal mine  operator insurance given recent operator bankruptcies are based on  ongoing work for this committee.

An April 2015 DOL Inspector General (IG) report  followed up on DOL\u2019s progress on our recommendations and found  continuing problems and raised new concerns about the black lung claims  and appeals process. For instance, the IG reported that OALJ needed  to address staff shortages, improve communication between its  headquarters and district offices, and upgrade the training provided to  judges and law clerks. To further expedite claim adjudication, the IG  recommended, among other things, that OALJ begin hearing more cases  remotely using video or telephone hearings to reduce judges\u2019 travel costs  and time.

Our simulation, which incorporated EIA data on  future expected coal production, also showed that annual Trust Fund  revenue would likely continue to decrease beyond fiscal year 2019 due, in  part, to declining coal production. Domestic coal production declined from  about 1.2 billion tons in 2008 to about 775 million tons in 2017, according  to EIA.

Specifically, revenue may not  be sufficient to cover beneficiary payments and administrative costs from  fiscal years 2020 through 2050 (see fig. 2). For instance, in fiscal year  2029, simulated benefit payments and administrative costs would likely  exceed simulated revenue by about $99 million. These annual deficits  could decrease over time to about $4 million by fiscal year 2050 due, in  part, to the assumed continued net decline in total black lung  beneficiaries.", "If Trust Fund spending on benefit payments and administrative costs  continues to exceed revenues each year, then the Trust Fund would need  to continue borrowing from Treasury\u2019s general fund to cover those costs,  as well as borrowing to cover debt repayment. Our moderate simulation  suggested that the Trust Fund\u2019s outstanding debt could increase from  about $4.2 billion in fiscal year 2019 to about $15.4 billion in fiscal year  2050 (see fig. 3).

Even if the Congress were to completely eliminate  black lung benefits as of fiscal year 2019, the Trust Fund\u2019s outstanding  debt in fiscal year 2050 could still exceed $6.4 billion, according to our  simulation. Eliminating black lung benefits, however, would generally  mean that coal tax revenue would be collected solely to fund the  repayment of Trust Fund debt.

Operators can purchase commercial insurance for this  purpose or may self-insure if they meet certain DOL conditions. For  example, self-insurers must obtain collateral in the form of an indemnity  bond, deposit or trust, or letter of credit in an amount deemed necessary  and sufficient by DOL to secure their liability.", "DOL officials said that the collateral they required from the five self- insured operators that filed for bankruptcy between 2014 and 2016 was  inadequate to cover their benefit liabilities. For example, the collateral  DOL required from Alpha Natural Resources was about 6 percent of its  estimated benefit liability. As a result, approximately $185 million of  estimated benefit liability was transferred to the Trust Fund, according to  DOL data. We reviewed DOL documentation related to the five operator  bankruptcies. Table 1 shows the bankrupt operators; the amount of  collateral each operator had at the time of bankruptcy; estimated benefit  liability at the time of bankruptcy; and estimated benefit liability and  number of beneficiaries that transferred to the Trust Fund, if applicable.  Overall, three of these bankruptcies affected the Trust Fund, and two did  not according to DOL. DOL officials told us that the bankruptcies of Arch  Coal and Peabody Energy did not affect the Trust Fund because their  benefit liabilities were assumed by the reorganized companies after  emerging from bankruptcy.", "As of June 2019, there are 22 operators that are self-insured and actively  mining coal, according to DOL officials. To ensure that the collateral  they required from these operators was adequate to protect the Trust  Fund, DOL officials said that they periodically reauthorized them which  entailed, among other things, reviewing their most recent audited financial  statements and claims information. DOL officials said that they prepared  memos documenting these reviews and communicated with coal  operators about whether their financial circumstances warranted  increasing or decreasing their collateral. Table 2 provides information on  the 22 self-insured operators including the date of each operator\u2019s most  recent DOL reauthorization; the amount of DOL required collateral; and  the operator\u2019s most recent estimated black lung benefit liability. Should  any of these operators file for bankruptcy, they could also affect the Trust  Fund because the amount of an operators\u2019 benefit liability that is not  covered by collateral could also become the responsibility of the Trust  Fund.", "Preliminary analysis from our ongoing work indicates that DOL did not  regularly monitor self-insured operators. Agency regulations state that  DOL may adjust the amount of collateral required from self-insured  operators when experience or changed conditions warrant. We reviewed  DOL\u2019s most recent reauthorization memos for each of the 22 operators.  While some of these operators had been reauthorized more recently, we  found that others had not been reauthorized by DOL in decades. One  operator in particular had not been reauthorized by DOL since 1988.  Additionally, for most of these operators, DOL either did not have  estimates of their benefit liabilities, or the estimates were out of date (see  table 2).", "Beginning in summer 2015, DOL officials said that they stopped  permitting any new coal mine operators to self-insure as the agency  worked with auditors, economists, and actuaries to develop new  procedures for self-insurance. At the same time, DOL generally stopped  reauthorizing the 22 self-insured operators. Earlier this year, two of  these operators have filed for bankruptcy\u2014Westmoreland Coal Company  and Cloud Peak Energy\u2014according to DOL officials. Additionally, due to  deteriorating financial conditions, DOL recommended revoking another  operator\u2019s self-insurance authority (Murray Energy).
