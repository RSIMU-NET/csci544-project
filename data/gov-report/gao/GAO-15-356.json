This report examines: (1) the percentage and characteristics of participants that would be affected; (2) the impact, if any, on the crop insurance program; and (3) how USDA could implement a reduction in premium subsidies for the highest income participants. GAO analyzed RMA crop insurance data and FSA data on compliance with income limits from 2009 through 2013 (most recent year of available data), analyzed RMA data to examine the impact on the program and calculate potential savings, reviewed agency guidance and industry and academic publications, and interviewed USDA officials and stakeholders."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["About 1 percent of crop insurance participants would have been affected if premium subsidies had been reduced for the highest income participants from 2009 through 2013, based on GAO's analysis of data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Risk Management Agency (RMA) and Farm Service Agency (FSA). The highest income participants were those with incomes that exceeded limits in place for farm and conservation programs. In terms of characteristics, the highest income participants insured more farmland and had more premium subsidies provided on their behalf than other participants from 2009 through 2013. However, all crop insurance participants generally insured major crops, such as corn, soybeans, and wheat, while the highest income participants were more likely to insure specialty crops such as fruits, vegetables, and nursery crops. The highest income participants also made similar choices as other participants in terms of the type of crop insurance and the levels of coverage they chose.", "Reducing crop insurance subsidies for the highest income participants would have a minimal effect on the program and save millions of dollars. RMA is directed by law to adopt rates and coverages that will improve the actuarial soundness of the crop insurance program. Actuarial soundness under the program means that premiums are adequate to cover expected claims and a reasonable reserve. Based on GAO's analysis of agency data, participants' premiums generally corresponded to their likelihood of collecting claims payments, regardless of their income level. Also, the highest income participants account for only about 1 percent of the premiums in the program. As a result, their decisions to stay in or leave the program would likely not affect the crop insurance program's actuarial soundness at the national level. If premium subsidies had been reduced by 15 percentage points for the highest income participants from 2009 through 2013, the federal government would have saved more than $70 million over the 5-year period, according to GAO's analysis of agency data. The current income limit, enacted in 2014 for farm and conservation programs, would likely affect fewer crop insurance participants than did the previous limit. Consequently, the savings would be smaller.", "USDA could use existing procedures to implement a reduction in subsidies for the highest income participants. FSA has procedures to verify participants' compliance with income limits applicable to some farm and conservation programs. About two-thirds of crop insurance participants, on average, participated in programs that had income limits from 2009 through 2013 and would not need to provide additional information. Opportunities exist for RMA to access FSA's eligibility data system and work with insurance companies to apply the reduction in premium subsidies for the highest income participants. According to RMA officials, administering a provision that would reduce premium subsidies for the highest income participants would pose some challenges. For example, RMA and FSA would need to reconcile certain data on participants that are subject to the income limit. However, USDA is developing procedures to administer conservation compliance requirements in the Agricultural Act of 2014 that could help administer a premium subsidy reduction for the highest income crop insurance participants."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To reduce the cost of the crop insurance program and achieve budgetary savings for deficit reduction or other purposes, Congress should consider reducing premium subsidies for the highest income participants.

Under the federal  crop insurance program, participants can insure against losses caused by  poor crop yields resulting from natural causes, declines in crop prices, or  both, for each insurable crop they produce. The U.S. Department of  Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Risk Management Agency (RMA) has overall  responsibility for administering the crop insurance program. RMA partners  with 19 private insurance companies that sell and service the insurance  policies and share a percentage of the risk of loss and opportunity for  gain associated with each policy. The federal government pays for (1)  part of participants\u2019 crop insurance premiums, which averaged about 62  percent of total premiums in 2014, and (2) administrative and operating  expenses to insurance companies to cover the expense of selling and  servicing crop insurance policies.", "In recent years, the government\u2019s costs for the federal crop insurance  program have increased substantially. Federal costs for the program  averaged $3.8 billion annually for fiscal years 2004 through 2008 and  increased to $8.5 billion annually for fiscal years 2009 through 2014.  Those costs are expected to average $8.9 billion per year for fiscal years  2015 through 2024, according to the Congressional Budget Office.same time, farm income has been high. According to USDA\u2019s Economic   At the  Research Service, net farm income reached a high of $129 billion in  2013, and although it is forecast to fall from that record beginning in 2014,  it remains above the average of the 2001 to 2010 decade. Further, other  measures of financial well-being for the farm sector have been strong. For  example, farm real estate values increased by 83 percent from 2005  through 2014, and farm debt, relative to equity and assets, has  decreased, to some of the lowest levels since the 1950s, according to  USDA. With increasing constraints on the federal budget, the cost to the  federal government of the crop insurance program has come under  scrutiny. In an October 2013 review of the federal government\u2019s long-term  fiscal outlook, we concluded that current fiscal policy is unsustainable  over the long term and that addressing future fiscal challenges will require  looking at the entire range of federal activities and making difficult choices  in setting priorities. In 2012 and 2013 reports, we suggested that  Congress should consider reducing crop insurance costs by limiting the  amount of premium subsidies that an individual participant can receive  each year, reducing premium subsidy rates for all farmers, or using some  combination of limiting and reducing these subsidies. In August 2014, we  suggested that Congress should consider reducing the level of federal  premium subsidies for revenue crop insurance policies, and in February  2015, we recommended that RMA increase its adjustments of premium  rates in areas with higher crop production risks.", "The federal crop insurance program provides the same level of premium  subsidies to participants regardless of their income. In contrast, since  2003, benefits from farm and conservation programs administered by  USDA\u2019s Farm Service Agency (FSA) and the Natural Resources  Conservation Service (NRCS) were not available to individuals or legal  entities with incomes exceeding certain limits. Under the 2014 farm bill,  participants in those programs are not eligible for farm and conservation  payments if their 3-year average adjusted gross income (AGI) exceeds  $900,000. This income limit also applies to participants in the  Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program, which provides  insurance-like protection for crops that are not covered by the federal  crop insurance program. During the debate leading up to passage of the  Agricultural Act of 2014 (the 2014 farm bill), which shifted emphasis and  funding from traditional farm programs to the crop insurance program,  various proposals were offered that would have reduced premium  subsidies for crop insurance participants with incomes exceeding a  certain limit. However, none were included in the final version of the  2014 farm bill. Some stakeholders expressed concern that high-income  participants represent less risk than the other participants, and that they  would drop out of the program if their premium subsidies were reduced,  threatening the financial soundness and viability of the entire program.  They also said that these proposals could be difficult for USDA to  implement, particularly for entities that had multiple members, all of which  would have been subject to income limits under the proposals. However,  other stakeholders said that the proposals would have saved the federal  government money and not adversely affected the program or its  participants.", "You asked us to examine the potential effects of a provision that would  reduce premium subsidies for crop insurance participants with incomes  exceeding a certain limit.

To address the  first objective, we matched RMA data on crop insurance participants\u2019  characteristics and FSA data on participants\u2019 compliance with income  limits for farm and conservation programs from 2009 through 2013, the  most recent years available. We used the FSA data because they were  the most complete data available on participants\u2019 general income levels.  In matching the two datasets, we identified crop insurance participants  that were in both datasets and determined the percentage of participants  whose incomes exceeded limits in effect under the 2008 farm bill. For  this group, which included about two-thirds of crop insurance participants,  we also analyzed RMA data to identify other characteristics of the  participants, including their location, the crops they insured, and the  insurance plans they selected. Because we did not have FSA data for   we supplemented our  about one-third of crop insurance participants,analysis with USDA\u2019s annual survey data about the income and other  characteristics of a sample of U.S. farm operations from 2009 through  2012, the most recent years available.", "To address the second objective, we identified potential effects on the  financial soundness of the program and calculated potential government  savings. To identify any effects on the financial soundness of the crop  insurance program, we analyzed RMA data on loss experiences of, and  premiums paid for, (1) participants with the highest incomes, those whose  incomes exceeded limits under the 2008 farm bill, and (2) other  participants, from 2004 through 2013. We chose this time period to  capture variability in weather and other factors that change over time,  such as crop prices. To determine potential savings, we analyzed RMA  and FSA data to estimate the amount of subsidies paid on behalf of  participants with incomes that exceeded the limits from 2009 through  2013, and we calculated the savings that would have resulted if these  subsidies were reduced by 15 percentage points (the amount proposed in  a Senate-passed bill) or eliminated. We chose this time period because  recent years more closely reflect current program provisions and  participation levels. In addition, we reviewed USDA and other studies and  interviewed RMA officials, actuarial professionals, and academics  regarding the potential effects of reducing premium subsidies for the  highest income participants and the costs of the crop insurance program.", "To address the third objective, we reviewed USDA regulations, guidance,  and other documents and prior GAO reports for information on how FSA  implements income limits for farm and conservation programs and how  RMA, FSA, and NRCS are implementing other provisions for crop  insurance participants. We also interviewed RMA, FSA, and NRCS  officials regarding the implementation of income limits and other  provisions.

Through the federal crop insurance program,  participants can insure against losses on more than 100 crops. These  crops include five major crops (corn, cotton, grain sorghum, soybeans,  and wheat), which accounted for 86 percent of the program premiums in  2013, minor crops (field crops other than major crops and livestock), and  specialty crops (fruits, vegetables, nursery crops, and tree nuts). Crop  insurance participants may be individuals or legal entities\u2014such as trusts,  partnerships, and corporations\u2014and members of an entity may share  ownership of an insurance policy.", "Participants can generally select various types of crop insurance policies,  including yield-based plans, which protect against declines in production,  and revenue-based plans, which protect against declines in production,  price, or both. Some plans, however, are not available for all crops or in  all locations. Participants may also choose between two types of  coverage: (1) catastrophic coverage, which insures 50 percent of normal  yield and 55 percent of the estimated market price of the crop, and (2)  additional or \u201cbuy-up\u201d coverage, which insures 50 percent to 85 percent of  normal yield and up to 100 percent of the estimated market price of the  crop. Beginning in 2015, participants have the option of buying insurance  policies designed to reimburse \u201cshallow losses,\u201d to cover the portion of  losses that is applied toward meeting a plan\u2019s deductible. In addition,  participants may choose what type of units (certain number of acres for a  specific crop) to insure. Basic units cover all plantings of a crop in a single  county with the same tenant and landlord; optional units are basic units  divided into smaller units by township section; and enterprise units cover  all plantings of a single crop in a county, regardless of the tenant and  landlord structure. Enterprise units are generally more geographically  diverse, so this type of unit is less risky and is charged a lower premium.", "The federal government has played an active role in helping to mitigate  the effects of production risks on farm income by promoting the use of  crop insurance through subsidies of premiums. The federal government\u2019s  premium and administrative expense subsidies for crop insurance policies  are not payments to participants, but they can be considered a financial  benefit to participants. Without a premium subsidy, crop insurance  participants would have to pay the full amount of the policy premium. And,  without an administrative expense subsidy, premiums would likely be  higher because insurance companies would have to reflect the full cost of  administering the policies in those premiums. The federal government  provides crop insurance premium subsidies in part to achieve high  participation and coverage levels. High participation and coverage levels  may reduce or eliminate the need for congressionally authorized ad hoc  disaster programs to help farmers recover from natural disasters, which  can be costly. For example, under three separate ad hoc disaster  programs, USDA provided $7 billion in payments to farmers whose crops  were damaged or destroyed by natural disasters from 2001 to 2007. In  2012, Congress did not enact ad hoc disaster assistance legislation  despite a major drought affecting a large portion of the United States.", "Congress sets premium subsidy rates, meaning the percentage of the  premium paid by the government. Premium subsidy rates vary by the  level of insurance coverage, the type of units covered by the policy, and  the geographic diversity of crops insured. For most policies, the statutory  subsidy rates range from 38 percent to 80 percent of the premiums. On  average, premium subsidy rates were 62 percent in 2014 for these  policies. The two new shallow loss insurance plans have premium  subsidy rates of 80 percent and 65 percent. For catastrophic coverage,  the federal government pays 100 percent of premiums, and participants  pay a $300 administrative fee for each crop that they insure in each  county. Administrative expense subsidies, which are paid to insurance  companies, are determined as a percentage of total premiums and vary  by policy type.", "Unlike the crop insurance program, for more than a decade, USDA\u2019s farm  and conservation programs have had statutory income limits setting the  maximum amount of income that participants can earn and still remain  eligible for program payments. Participants subject to the income limits  are individuals, entities, and members of entities.

These limits varied by program and changed over time but, in  general, they specified that participants in farm programs could not  receive payments if their nonfarm income exceeded $500,000 or if their  farm income exceeded $750,000. Participants in conservation programs  generally could not receive benefits if their nonfarm income exceeded $1  million, unless at least two-thirds of their total AGI was farm income. The  2014 farm bill established a single income limit of $900,000 for farm and  conservation programs.

However, according to our  analysis, the difference could be explained by the participants\u2019 choices in  insurance plans, suggesting that the highest income participants do not  represent a lower risk to the program. Specifically, from 2004 through  2013, the average loss cost ratio was about 6.3 percent for the highest  income participants and 8.5 percent for other participants. The lower loss  cost ratio for the highest income participants reflects, in part, that they  chose yield, rather than revenue, insurance more often than did other  participants. With yield insurance, which covers losses resulting from  declines in production, participants have a lower likelihood of making a  claim than with revenue insurance. Revenue insurance, which covers  losses resulting from declines in production, price, or both, was picked  more frequently by other participants. The highest income participants  also chose lower coverage levels, including catastrophic coverage, more  often than did other participants and, with lower coverage levels  participants are less likely to make claims under crop insurance policies.", "One other measure that reflects risk, the premium rate, was about 7.5  percent charged to highest income participants compared with 10.5  percent charged to other participants. As with the loss cost ratio, this  difference is in part a reflection of participants\u2019 choices in insurance plans.  Also, the lower premium rate for the highest income participants  corresponds to their lower likelihood of filing claims (which results in part  from their choices in insurance plans), so the portion of premiums  designated for losses for the highest income participants nationwide  would not be likely to surpass the amount of money needed to cover their  claims. Table 3 summarizes data on loss ratio, loss cost ratio, and  premium rates for the highest income and other participants from 2004  through 2013.", "Second, we determined that the highest income participants would be  unlikely to leave the program in response to a reduction in subsidies. A  reduction in subsidies would require participants to pay more of their  premiums, but the effect on their overall costs would be limited because,  as we found in August 2014, premium subsidies generally represent a   Given their income  small fraction of average production costs per acre.levels, participants in the highest income category would likely be able to  afford this small increase in costs. Also, academic literature and  government information suggest that participants would not likely leave  the program because of their heavy reliance on crop insurance and the  increasing importance of crop insurance. Further, several incentives  encourage participants to retain crop insurance, such as some lenders\u2019  requirement that farmers have crop insurance in order to obtain loans.  Rather than leaving the program in response to a reduction in subsidies, it  is more likely that participants would select lower levels of policy  coverage than they currently have, according to an RMA analysis.", "Third, if all of the highest income participants left the crop insurance  program, the actuarial soundness of the program would not likely be  affected because the highest income participants represent only about 1  percent of all participants and about 1 percent of premiums in the  program. In addition, since their premiums generally correspond to their  likelihood of collecting claims payments, their decisions to stay in or leave  the program would not affect its actuarial soundness at the national level.  Consequently, RMA would not generally need to raise premium rates for  participants remaining in the pool."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reducing Subsidies for the Highest Income Participants Would Have Saved Millions from 2009 through 2013", "paragraphs": ["If crop insurance premium subsidies had been reduced by 15 percentage  points for the highest income participants that applied to farm and  conservation programs with income limits each year from 2009 through  2013, the federal government would have saved more than $70 million  over the 5-year period, according to our analysis of FSA and RMA data.  If premium subsidies had been eliminated altogether for this group of  highest income participants, the federal government would have saved  about $290 million over the 5-year period. However, these estimates may  understate what the actual savings would have been because, as  mentioned earlier, our analysis does not cover all crop insurance  participants.

The savings estimate we  discuss in this report is one of several such estimates we have calculated  in reports on the crop insurance program; these estimates are  summarized in appendix V.", "Other factors, such as participants\u2019 choices about insurance protection,  could also affect the amount of savings. For example, if some of the  highest income participants selected less expensive insurance plans or  lower coverage levels, or if they left the program in response to a  reduction in subsidies, the potential savings would be greater because  the total amount of federal premium subsidies would decrease.  Participants\u2019 decisions could be influenced by multiple factors, including  the availability of other risk management tools to protect against crop and  revenue losses. For example, some risk management tools\u2014such as  forward contracts that lock in a price to be paid on a future date\u2014are not  generally available for all crops. Other risk management tools for  participants include producing a diverse range of crops and livestock,  working in off-farm occupations, or accruing enough savings to self- insure, according to some agricultural economists.", "In addition to participants\u2019 choices, several other factors could influence  federal government savings, such as crop prices, participants\u2019 income, or  policy provisions. If crop prices changed, savings could be smaller or  larger because premiums are affected by crop prices and, as the value of  the crops being insured goes up or down, so do crop insurance  premiums. Since premium subsidies are a set percentage of the  premiums, these subsidy amounts would rise or fall along with premium  amounts. If participants\u2019 incomes changed, the number of participants  with incomes exceeding a given threshold could also change, affecting  the amount of federal government savings. Policy provisions could also  influence savings by specifying an income threshold or reduction in  subsidies that differs from the ones used in our analysis. For example, the  $900,000 income limit for individuals that went into effect for farm  programs in 2014 affected less than one-half of 1 percent of farm  program participants, according to preliminary FSA data. If this limit  applied to crop insurance participants, and one-half of 1 percent of these  participants had their premium subsidies reduced by 15 percentage  points, assuming other factors did not change, the federal government  would save about $35 million over 5 years."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "USDA Could Use Existing Procedures to Reduce Crop Insurance Subsidies for the Highest Income Participants", "paragraphs": ["USDA could use existing procedures without adding requirements for a  majority of crop insurance participants if a statutory provision were  enacted directing USDA to reduce premium subsidies for the highest  income participants.

FSA officials told us that these procedures could  be used to identify the highest income participants in the crop insurance  program, if required. As we reported in August 2013, FSA and the IRS  implemented an income verification process in 2009. As part of this  process, applicants certify whether their income is above or below the  limits and provide consent for the IRS to disclose certain tax-related  information to FSA. Entities that participate in farm and conservation  programs identify their members and the percentage share they comprise  in the entity because individuals, entities, and all members of those  entities are subject to income limits.

About two-thirds of crop insurance  participants, on average, also participated in farm and conservation  programs that have income limits. In order to be eligible for these  programs, participants complete forms certifying their compliance with the  limits. This information could be used for the crop insurance program if a  similar provision were enacted. The approximately one-third of crop  insurance participants that do not already provide information to FSA  would need to complete a form certifying that their income was below the  limits and authorizing FSA to verify this information. Entities also would  need to provide FSA with information about their entity structure and their  members if they do not already provide that information. As we found, in  September 2013, participants in certain farm programs have had to  submit this information and update it as needed.

This would allow RMA to identify  crop insurance participants with the highest income. Administering the  reduction of premium subsidies would involve  informing crop insurance participants and insurance companies of the  requirements, including when participants need to certify their income  and provide other needed information to FSA, and  calculating the appropriate premium subsidy amount for each crop  insurance participant.", "RMA officials told us that administering a provision that would reduce  premium subsidies for the highest income participants would pose some  challenges, but these could be addressed through discussions with FSA  and the insurance companies. For example, RMA and FSA would need to  reconcile their data on entities because members of entities\u2014which are  subject to income limits\u2014may be reported differently for crop insurance  and farm and conservation programs, according to RMA officials.  Additionally, RMA officials said crop insurance participants\u2019 income status  would need to be known in advance of the application for or renewal of  crop insurance policies, to allow insurance companies to quote accurate  premiums and participants to make informed decisions about their  insurance protection.", "RMA has existing procedures to administer the eligibility requirements of  the crop insurance program and to reduce benefits, including premium  subsidies, under certain conditions. Some of these procedures may be  similar to those that would be needed to reduce premium subsidies for  the highest income participants. For example, RMA\u2019s regulations and  guidance direct insurance companies to proportionally or fully reduce  coverage in policies where some or all members of an entity are ineligible  for crop insurance. In addition, RMA revised its procedures to comply  with a modification in the 2014 farm bill that calls for reducing program  benefits, including premium subsidies, for some crop insurance  participants that newly till land in certain states.insurance companies are responsible for reporting when a crop insurance  participant tills land covered in the provision, according to RMA officials.", "RMA, FSA, and NRCS are also developing procedures to administer the  conservation compliance requirements in the 2014 farm bill that may help  administer premium subsidy reductions for the highest income crop  insurance participants.

Under the 2014 farm bill, participants are prohibited from receiving  premium subsidies if they produce agricultural commodities on land that  is prone to erosion without implementing an approved conservation plan  or obtaining an exemption or if they convert a wetland to grow agricultural  commodities. All crop insurance participants must certify their compliance  with conservation requirements by submitting a one-time form to FSA.  Some participants may also need to take additional steps, such as  developing and implementing a conservation plan that has been reviewed  and approved by the NRCS.

The federal  government has promoted the use of crop insurance through premium  subsidies in part to achieve high participation and coverage levels.  However, as budgetary pressures persist, it is crucial that federal  resources are targeted as effectively as possible. Reducing premium  subsidies for the highest income crop insurance participants presents an  opportunity to save millions of taxpayer dollars with minimal effect on  participants and the program. From 2009 through 2013, if the income  thresholds in effect for farm and conservation programs had applied to  crop insurance, we estimate that about 1 percent of crop insurance  participants would have exceeded the thresholds and had their subsidies  reduced. These participants would still have access to crop insurance  and, given their income level, they would be able to afford the higher  premiums if their subsidies were reduced.

We used the FSA data because the agency had data on participants\u2019  compliance with income limits for farm and conservation programs. We  chose this time frame because FSA had implemented procedures to  verify the income of program participants starting in 2009, and 2013 was  the most recent year available.", "We identified crop insurance participants that were in both the RMA and  FSA datasets, either directly or through an entity, to determine whether  they exceeded income limits in effect for farm and conservation  programs. For this group, which included about two-thirds of crop  insurance participants, we determined the percentage of participants  whose incomes exceeded limits in the Food, Conservation, and Energy  Act of 2008. Specifically, these limits included, depending on the  program, average adjusted gross farm income of $750,000; average  adjusted gross nonfarm income of $500,000; or average adjusted gross  nonfarm income of $1 million, unless at least two-thirds of the average  adjusted gross income was average adjusted gross farm income. For  2012 and 2013 only, there was an additional limit of average adjusted  gross income of $1 million, including both farm income and nonfarm  income, applied for certain farm payments. We identified the number of  participants that FSA determined to be ineligible because their incomes  exceeded statutory limits, and we considered those the \u201chighest income  participants.\u201d We did not determine, for each statutory limit, the number of  participants with incomes exceeding it because some participants were  subject to multiple income limits, and FSA data did not always specify  which limit or limits had been exceeded by a given participant. We  included in our estimates of the number of highest income participants  those that had catastrophic coverage policies. We also used a second  analytical approach in which we assumed participants that exceeded  income limits in at least 1 year, exceeded the limits during all 5 years.  This approach allowed us to include some of the highest income  participants that may have left farm and conservation programs because  they were identified as exceeding income limits. We considered this to be  an upper estimate because some of these participants may have left for  other reasons.", "We analyzed RMA data to identify the characteristics of these and other  participants for which we had income information, including the states  listed on their policies, the crops they insured, and the insurance plans  and coverage they selected. Some crop insurance participants had  shares in multiple policies in more than one state. In those cases, when  determining the number and percentage of participants in each state, we  used the state on the crop insurance policy closest to the address in  FSA\u2019s records. The address in the FSA records is generally the  participant\u2019s residence or business address, according to an FSA official.  We used premiums as the basis of our analysis for the crops and  insurance plans and coverage, and we assigned the dollars proportionally  based on the share of the policy or policies insured by the participants.  For example, if a policy had two individuals listed as policyholders, we  assigned 50 percent of the premium for that policy to each one. If a single  individual had shares in multiple policies, we added up his or her shares  to determine the total premiums attributed to that individual.

Because about one-third of crop insurance participants did not  participate in farm and conservation programs, we did not have FSA data  on their income. To learn about the income and characteristics of the  entire population of crop insurance participants, we therefore analyzed  USDA survey data of a sample of U.S. farm operations from 2009 through  2012, the latest year available. Specifically, we reviewed data for U.S.  farm operations that had crop insurance expenditures. Of these farm  operations, we compared operations that reported exceeding any of the  income limits in effect for farm and conservation programs with those that  reported exceeding none of them. We analyzed RMA program  information such as RMA\u2019s summary of business reports and crop policy  provisions to determine the extent to which different insurance options  were available for certain crops. For illustrative examples of the highest  income crop insurance participants, we used publicly available sources of  information such as company web sites.

Specifically, we analyzed data on three measures that  reflect risk (loss ratio, loss cost ratio, and premium rate) to determine  whether the highest income participants represented a lower risk to the  program than other participants. We reviewed USDA and other studies  and interviewed agency officials, academics, and actuarial professionals  to consider whether the highest income participants would be likely to  leave the crop insurance program if their subsidies were reduced, and we  used our findings about the percentage of crop insurance participants  who would be affected to assess the potential effects on the program if  the highest income participants did leave.", "We chose the 10-year time frame to capture the effects of factors that can  change from year to year, such as crop prices, and others that are  infrequent, such as extreme weather. There are trade-offs in choosing the  number of years of data to examine. A group of actuarial experts told us  that using 5 years of data is not enough to cover the weather cycle, while  using older data is less relevant because the crop insurance program has  changed, and that at least 10 years of data are needed. Also, RMA, in its  most recent study of its methodology for setting premium rates in 2010,  found that its methodology was sound but concluded that the agency  should place more weight on loss experience from more recent years to  better account for current risks faced by farmers. Because we did not  have complete income information for 10 years, we assumed that  participants that had incomes that exceeded the limits in 1 or more years  from 2009 through 2013 were highest income for the entire period. This  method assumes that any participant identified as highest income from  2009 through 2013 was highest income from 2004 through 2013. This  does not take into account that some of these participants may not have  been highest income in each of those years.

In October 2008, we recommended  that the Farm Service Agency (FSA) work with the Internal Revenue  Service (IRS) to develop a system for verifying income eligibility for all  recipients of farm payments. FSA, in cooperation with IRS, implemented  procedures for verifying whether farm and conservation program  participants\u2019 incomes exceeded statutory limits starting in 2009. In 2014,  FSA made changes to incorporate income limits applicable to farm and  conservation programs in the Agricultural Act of 2014 (2014 farm bill), and  made other adjustments to its procedures.", "Under the 2008 farm bill, income limits for farm and conservation  programs were based on adjusted gross income (AGI) limits averaged  over the 3 most recent tax years.

Further, for 2012 and 2013  only, a $1 million average limit on total AGI, both farm and nonfarm,  applied for certain farm payments. Because these income limits applied to  individuals, under certain conditions, a married couple could collectively  earn up to $2 million in average AGI and be eligible for certain farm  payments in 2012 and 2013. The 2008 farm bill also allowed the U.S.  Department of Agriculture (USDA) to waive the income limit for  conservation payments in cases involving environmentally sensitive land  of special significance.", "FSA developed procedures to apply the income limits to program  participants, as we found in August 2013. Starting in 2009, all applicants  to farm and conservation programs have had to both (1) certify their  compliance with income limits and (2) provide written consent for the IRS  to release certain information to FSA to verify their income. In 2009 and  2010, participants provided the certification and consent in two separate  forms; starting in 2011, they could use a single form. Participants that  chose not to submit a consent form were ineligible for farm and  conservation programs subject to income limits and had to refund all  payments received under these programs. For participants that provided  consent, IRS used its tax database to estimate farm income and nonfarm  income according to USDA instructions. IRS computer programs  compared these income estimates against the 2008 farm bill\u2019s income  limits to identify participants that may have exceeded these limits, and  IRS provided the resulting list to FSA. FSA then notified potentially  ineligible participants to give them the opportunity to provide  documentation, such as tax returns, if they believed their income did not  exceed the eligibility limits. FSA state offices were to review the  information provided and determine whether participants had income  exceeding the limits. FSA also deemed participants to be noncompliant  with the limits if they (1) provided an acknowledgment that their incomes  exceeded the limits or (2) did not respond at all. FSA state offices  informed their state-level Natural Resources Conservation Service  (NRCS) counterparts of participants that were determined to have  exceeded income limits for conservation programs, so that NRCS could  recover any overpayments made to participants in its programs.", "Under the 2008 farm bill, FSA also established procedures to apply  income limits to entities, members of entities, and couples who filed joint  returns, according to FSA\u2019s regulations and handbook on payment  eligibility, payment limitations, and average AGI. Entities had to provide a  form including information about the entity, its members, and the  percentage ownership share of each member, and update it as needed.  FSA required this information to verify entities\u2019 compliance with provisions  other than income limits that are applicable to farm programs.  Compliance with income limits was tracked through four levels of legal  entity ownership. If some individuals or entities within the four levels did  not comply with the income limits, payments were reduced by an amount  commensurate with the ineligible share. For married couples who filed  joint tax returns, FSA considered the joint income levels to make eligibility  determinations, unless a certified public accountant or attorney provided a  statement of what each individual\u2019s income would have been had the  couple filed separate tax returns.", "FSA is revising its procedures to incorporate the income limit enacted in  the 2014 farm bill and to help improve its operation, although the  procedures established to implement the limits under the 2008 farm bill  will generally remain in place. FSA is updating its forms, handbook, and  eligibility data system to reflect the revised procedures. These changes  were made because the 2014 farm bill now includes an average AGI limit  of $900,000, calculated over the 3 most recent tax years, rather than  multiple limits, and makes no distinction between farm and nonfarm  income. According to FSA officials, this limit is expected to simplify the  administration of income limits. FSA is also making changes aimed at  improving its operation.
