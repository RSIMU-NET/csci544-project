However, concerns have been raised about its social and economic impacts. In light of recent recommendations by a Congressionally appointed commission, which advocated restricting Internet gambling within the United States, GAO was asked to examine the U.S. payments system, particularly credit cards, as it relates to interactive on-line gaming. We examined (1) the legal framework for Internet gambling domestically and abroad; (2) the credit card industry's policies regarding the use of credit cards to pay for Internet gambling and actions taken to restrict such usage; and (3) the views of law enforcement, banking regulators, and the credit card and gaming industries on the vulnerability of Internet gambling to money laundering. We issued an interim report on these issues in September 2002. GAO makes no recommendations in this report."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The global legal framework for Internet gambling is a complicated mix of laws and regulations. In the United States, both federal and state statutes apply. Gambling is generally regulated at the state level, with federal law supporting state laws and regulations to ensure that interstate and foreign commerce do not circumvent them. The Wire Act, which prohibits gambling businesses from using interstate or international telecommunications wires to knowingly transmit or receive bets, is the main federal statute used to prosecute such activity. Foreign countries and jurisdictions have taken a variety of approaches to regulating on-line gaming, including legalizing some forms, seeking effective regulatory approaches, and prohibiting it entirely. The major participants in the credit card industry have tried to restrict the use of their cards for Internet gambling by prohibiting cardholders from using the cards to gamble on line and developing transaction codes that banks can use to block payments at their discretion. Many large U.S. credit card issuers also use codes to deny authorization for Internet gambling transactions, and U.S.-based banks do not accept gambling Web sites as merchants. Despite attempts to circumvent these efforts by using improper coding, the success of these restrictions has caused gaming analysts to lower their 2003 revenue projections for the on-line gaming industry. Representatives of law enforcement agencies told us that Internet gambling could be used to launder money, but others viewed the threat as less serious. Law enforcement representatives said that the anonymity and jurisdictional issues characteristic of Internet gambling make on-line gaming a potentially powerful tool for money launderers. They noted that few money laundering cases involving Internet gambling had been prosecuted but attributed the small number of cases primarily to a lack of regulation and oversight. However, regulatory agencies and officials from the credit card and gaming industries did not believe that Internet gambling was any more susceptible to money laundering than other forms of e-commerce."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Internet gambling is a growing industry. Since the mid-1990s, Internet gambling operators have established approximately 1,800 e-gaming Web sites in locations outside the United States, and global revenues from Internet gaming in 2003 are projected to be $5.0 billion dollars. In 1996, Congress created the National Gambling Impact Study Commission to examine the social and economic impacts of gambling, including Internet gambling, by conducting a comprehensive legal and factual study. In its 1999 report, the commission recommended (1) that the federal government prohibit any Internet gambling not already authorized and encourage foreign governments not to harbor Internet gambling organizations, and (2) that Congress pass legislation prohibiting the collection of credit card debt for Internet gambling. The social and economic concerns about Internet gambling raised in the report included underage gambling, pathological gambling, lack of consumer protections, and criminal abuse. In response to these concerns, numerous bills were introduced in Congress to prohibit Internet gambling.", "To assist with your continuing deliberations on Internet gambling, you asked that we review the use of the U.S. payments system, particularly credit cards, to restrict illegal Internet gambling. Specifically, our objectives were to:   examine the legal framework for Internet gambling activities, primarily in the United States, but also in selected foreign countries;   describe the nature and scope of the policies and procedures the credit card industry has implemented to restrict the use of credit cards as a form of payment for Internet gambling; and   obtain views on the vulnerability of Internet gambling to money laundering.", "We issued an interim report on these issues in September 2002 and are now issuing our final report .

We also spoke with representatives of the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the offices of the attorneys general for selected states. For the international legal framework, we contacted gaming and government officials and gaming lawyers in selected countries and researched secondary sources that describe their laws. To obtain information on the credit card industry\u2019s efforts to deal with Internet gambling, we interviewed officials of the four major credit card organizations, some large issuing and acquiring member banks, several third-party processors, and a number of banking trade associations. We conducted an electronic survey of 202 Internet gambling sites, which is a representative sample of the approximately 1,800 Internet gambling sites. We used the survey to gather information on, among other things, payment acceptance policies for Internet gambling Web sites.

However, with the emergence of the Internet in the mid-1990s, a new form of gambling appeared\u2014on-line gaming casinos and sports wagering. Internet gambling can take place on any electronic device that offers Internet access anywhere on the globe. In 2001, some gaming analysts were projecting that gross revenues from Internet gambling would exceed $6 billion by 2003. However, analysts lowered revenue estimates for a number of reasons, including increased pressure from U.S. lawmakers and the blocking of Internet gambling transactions by many large U.S. credit card issuers. (U.S. customers are reported to constitute anywhere from 50 to 70 percent of total operator revenues from Internet gambling.) And, despite the recent revenue reduction, the e-gaming industry continues to grow. In a recent report, gaming analysts estimate that in 2003 revenues from Internet gambling industrywide will be $5.0 billion, or approximately 4.3 percent of the total $116 billion in business- to-consumer global e-commerce. In the view of gaming analysts, the international markets (non-U.S. customers) represent the future of the industry\u2019s growth.", "Currently, individuals wishing to gamble via the Internet can choose from several types of payment options other than credit cards. These include: VISA and MasterCard debit cards (also called check cards): These cards, which carry the logo of one of the two largest credit card associations, are tied directly to the cardholder\u2019s bank account. Funds for all transactions are deducted directly from the cardholder\u2019s bank account, but cardholders can make credit card-type transactions that do not require a personal identification number. A personal identification number is not required to use this card on line, for example, since the transactions are processed through the VISA and MasterCard systems. Check card gaming transactions carry the same gaming merchant code as credit card transactions and thus can also be blocked.", "Private-label debit cards: These cards are similar to the check cards described above but are issued by private companies rather than credit card associations.", "On-line payment providers (also known as payment aggregators): These companies send and receive funds electronically for such uses as on-line auctions and purchases.", "Wire transfers: Some gaming Web sites promote this method of payment, which allows Internet gaming customers to wire money directly from a bank account to a gaming Web site. In some instances, bank wire information is posted on individual gaming sites, and gaming operators frequently use wire transfers to pay customers. \u201cE-cash\u201d or digital cash: This method of payment is a digital representation of real money that can be placed on a computer hard drive, smart card,other devices with memory, (including cellular phones and other electronic communication devices), or in an on-line repository. Consumers purchase e-cash from an authorized provider. These funds can then be transferred among vendors and individuals using compatible electronic systems, in some cases without resorting to banks or other financial intermediaries. When customers spend the e-cash, it is credited to the retailer\u2019s e-cash account and later transferred to the retailer\u2019s regular bank account.", "Internet gambling sites also offer money orders; traveler\u2019s checks; bank drafts; cashier\u2019s, certified, and personal checks; and a number of other electronic banking systems or processors as payment options.", "The House of Representatives recently passed the Leach-LaFalce Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (H.R. 556) to further limit opportunities for gambling over the Internet in the United States.

If H.R. 556 is enacted, it will prohibit any person engaged in the business of gambling from knowingly accepting bank instruments such as credit cards, electronic fund transfers, or checks for illegal Internet gambling. Additionally, the Comprehensive Internet Gambling Prohibition Act of 2002 (S. 3006), introduced in the Senate in late September 2002, would, if enacted, amend certain sections of the Wire Act to include the use of all interstate or international communication facilities transmitting to or from the United States and expand the prohibited gambling activities covered by the act.

To date, the Wire Act is the federal statute that has been used to prosecute federal Internet gambling cases, although courts sometimes disagree on the applicability of certain provisions of the statute. In addition, the Travel Act and the Illegal Gambling Business Act have been used to prosecute gambling entities that take interstate or international bets over the telephone and would likely be applicable to Internet gambling activity. Some states have taken specific legislative actions to address Internet gambling, in some cases criminalizing it and in others relying on existing gambling laws to bring actions against entities engaging in or facilitating Internet gambling.

A recent case addressed some of the issues and raised the question of whether Internet gambling takes place on tribal lands when bettors who are not on tribal lands use their home computers to access Internet lotteries via computer servers that are. The case involved the question of whether the state of Missouri could prevent a Native American tribe in Idaho from accepting money from Missouri residents via a lottery Internet site.

An interstate off-track wager is defined as \u201ca legal wager placed or accepted in one State with respect to the outcome of a horse race taking place in another State.\u201d Pari- mutuel wagers fall into this category if they are legal in both of the states, are made by telephone or other electronic device, and are accepted by an off-track betting system in any state, as well as the combination of any pari-mutuel wagering interstate pools.

The results of our survey of Internet gambling Web sites showed that most do not promote full-service credit card companies, although the cards were advertised as a possible form of payment on 8 of the 162 we reviewed. Appendix IV provides additional information on our survey.", "In spite of these efforts, credit card company officials recognize that some Internet gambling sites that attempt to secure credit card payments may still go unidentified. Thus, as part of their overall efforts to monitor fraud, both companies have also implemented procedures to monitor transactions for patterns that might indicate that credit cards are being used for Internet gambling activity. However, like issuing bank officials, credit card company officials acknowledged that identifying Internet gambling transactions after the fact is difficult. They also agreed that on- line payment providers present a challenge to credit card companies that are trying to restrict the use of their cards for Internet gambling. Officials for both companies stated that they had reached an agreement with one major on-line provider stipulating that the provider would block Internet transactions using the companies\u2019 technology and were working on similar agreements with other on-line payment providers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Credit Card Associations Have Focused on Enabling Members to Block Payments", "paragraphs": ["Neither VISA nor MasterCard has issued policies to its members that restrict the use of the association\u2019s credit cards for Internet gambling. Instead, both associations have developed procedures that enable member banks wanting to block Internet gambling transactions to do so. Officials from both associations explained that reaching a consensus on a blanket policy among members around the world would likely be difficult. Some members are located in countries where Internet gambling is legal and, according to one official, represents an expanding business market. Policy decisions to restrict the use of credit cards for Internet gambling are therefore left to the discretion of individual member institutions. Association officials note, however, that their members agree with operating regulations for both VISA and MasterCard stipulating that only legal transactions may be introduced into the systems.", "VISA and MasterCard have each developed a system of coding that allows member institutions, at their discretion, to block Internet gambling transactions. Both associations have had a long-standing uniform coding system designed to facilitate the processing and authorization of credit card payments for member banks. About 4 years ago, the associations refined their systems to include a cross-indexed scheme of merchant and commerce codes so that Internet gambling transactions could be identified. Internet gambling merchants that accept VISA or MasterCard payments are required to use a combination of a gaming merchant category code and an electronic commerce indicator code. These two codes, which are transmitted through the credit card network to the card issuer as part of the requested authorization message, inform the card issuer that the transaction is an Internet gambling transaction. The issuer can then deny authorization.", "Officials explained that the coding system informs card issuers that the transaction is an Internet gambling transaction but cannot signal whether the particular transaction is legal or illegal. The existing coding system does not capture enough information to distinguish between legal and illegal Internet gambling transactions. Moreover, an official pointed out that the distinction between legal and illegal transactions is difficult to make because of the complexities involved in determining which laws govern any particular Internet transaction and the practical limitations of determining where a cardholder may actually be when engaging in the transaction. As a result, a member bank\u2019s decision to block Internet gambling transactions may result in blocking all properly coded Internet gambling transactions\u2014both in jurisdictions where on-line gaming is legal and illegal. For example, a U.S. cardholder may visit a country where Internet gambling is legal and, while there, attempt to use a credit card to pay for on-line gambling transactions. If the credit card issuer has chosen to block Internet gambling transactions and the transaction has been properly coded, authorization for payment will be denied.", "Although the credit card issuer is responsible for making the policy decision on whether to deny authorization for Internet gambling transactions, actual blocking of transactions can occur at different points in the credit card transaction process. In some cases, the issuer has asked the association to block the transactions on its behalf. Other issuers do the blocking themselves, while still others instruct their third-party processors to do the blocking (fig. 2).", "Information on the number of member institutions belonging to credit card associations that have opted to systematically block Internet gambling transactions is not readily available. However, association officials noted that many of the largest U.S. credit card issuers have chosen to follow this course of action. Officials from the eight large U.S.- based issuing member banks we reviewed, which represent more than 80 percent of the purchase volume of cards issued by VISA and MasterCard in the United States, all indicated that they had implemented policies to deny payment authorization for Internet gambling transactions coming through their automated systems. Officials of a trade association for community banks and the processor of its members\u2019 credit card transactions stated that most, if not all, of the small community bank issuers had also chosen to block Internet gambling transactions. However, some association members\u2014primarily those in foreign jurisdictions where Internet gambling may be legal\u2014continued to acquire Internet gambling sites as merchants.", "The eight issuing banks in our review implemented their blocking policies between the early months of 2000 and June 2002. Internet gambling transactions can be blocked in two ways: either the issuer blocks the payment directly, or another party, such as a third-party processor or an association, does it instead. Five of the eight issuers told us that they blocked Internet gambling transactions themselves; the other three relied on a major third-party processor or an association to block on their behalf. Issuers that do their own blocking stated that by doing the blocking themselves, they were able to maintain control over transactions. For example, they were able to perform their own risk management of these transactions or contact their customers to discuss the transactions. Officials at two issuing banks told us they believed that authorizing or denying all transactions themselves gave them a better chance of catching Internet gambling merchants seeking to disguise the transactions. Although denials of payment for Internet gambling had decreased significantly since the company began blocking Internet gambling transactions, an issuing bank official noted that, in the previous quarter, their system had identified eight merchants that were conducting inappropriate activities, including disguising Internet gambling transactions.", "One of the major reasons some issuers gave for their decision to block Internet gambling transactions was their belief that Internet gambling is a high-risk industry, vulnerable to fraud and other illegal activities. Most of the issuing banks explained that they blocked Internet gambling transactions primarily because of on-line gambling\u2019s unclear legal status, which they believed could cause them to unknowingly facilitate illegal Internet gambling, and because of the financial impact (for example, potential legal costs and charge-offs) that could result if the customers refused to pay their gambling charges. Since the legality of Internet gambling is questionable, debts incurred through such activities may be unenforceable. Using this argument, some bettors have refused to pay their gambling debts, claiming that the issuing banks facilitated the \u201cillegal\u201d activities. In addition, in a number of lawsuits in U.S. courts, bettors have claimed that the credit card issuer is liable for allowing bettors to use its services for an illegal activity under state law. In one case, the bank that had issued the credit card sued the bettor when the bettor refused to pay the credit card bills for her gambling losses. In a countersuit, the bettor claimed that the bank was liable for letting the bettor gamble with the credit card when such gambling activity was illegal in her state. The case was settled before the trial. One of the provisions of the settlement required the Internet gaming sites to pay the bettor\u2019s Internet gambling debts to the banks that issued the credit cards. Half of the issuing banks in our review told us that they have explicit disclosures in their cardholder agreements stating that their cards cannot be used for Internet gambling and two of these banks said they had added the explicit reference only recently because of these lawsuits. Other issuing banks said that their cardholder agreements state that their cards cannot be used for illegal activities but do not specifically mention Internet gambling.", "According to gaming analysts, issuing banks\u2019 efforts to block Internet gambling transactions could reduce the projected growth of the Internet gaming industry from 43 to 20 percent.

Issuing bank officials emphasized the difficulty of identifying attempts to conceal Internet gambling transactions, regardless of any proactive efforts to find instances of miscoding. One official noted that some disguised Internet gambling transactions are identified only by chance, if at all. Most of the issuers acknowledged that Internet gambling merchants have circumvented the coding system primarily by submitting improperly coded transactions that do not represent Internet gambling or by failing to use the electronic commerce code. In some cases, a merchant engaged in more than one business has a secondary merchant code available and uses it to code what is really an Internet gambling transaction. In other cases, a merchant moves into Internet gambling after having been accepted by the acquirer as a different type of business. Unless the acquirer monitors the merchant, it will not know that the merchant is actually processing Internet gambling transactions.", "Two issuers noted that Internet merchants are able to circumvent the coding system by engaging in factoring. According to the issuers, factoring occurs when a merchant, possibly one engaged in Internet gambling, submits credit card transactions through another merchant\u2019s terminal using that merchant\u2019s identification number and merchant category code, and pays that merchant a percentage of the submitted transactions. Officials from both associations agreed that factoring as described by the issuers can be used to circumvent the coding system and violates the associations\u2019 rules. They also noted that this type of factoring is distinguishable from legitimate factoring.

The issuers indicated that while on-line payment providers did not circumvent the coding system, most aggregators\u2019 transactions were not coded to reflect the purpose or type of transaction such as Internet gambling. Because credit card transaction codes can be obscured as the transactions pass through such intermediaries, issuing banks cannot determine whether credit card funds are being used for Internet gambling. Nevertheless, most of the issuers said they would continue to accept credit card transactions from payment aggregators because they believed that these transactions were mostly legitimate or because the transactions represented a very small percentage of their total volume of credit sales. Officials from one major U.S. payment aggregator told us, recognizing the potential for abuse, that they had established policies in accordance with the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Suspicious Activity Reporting requirements and file reports weekly.

An official from one association explained that the association had a policy of not doing business with on-line payment providers without reaching an understanding about Internet gambling with the provider\u2019s acquirer. The acquirer would have to agree that any funds the provider obtained through the association\u2019s systems would not be used for Internet gambling unless the transaction was properly coded, so the issuing bank could deny the charge at its discretion. The official cited an example in which such an understanding could not be reached. The provider stopped accepting cards bearing the association\u2019s brand name rather than comply with the coding requirements.", "Officials of the other association noted that on-line payment providers are responsible for ensuring that credit cards are not used to pay for Internet gambling activities unless the funds transfer is explicitly coded as an Internet gambling transaction at the time of the authorization.

Finally, we spoke with private attorneys who specialize in gaming law and with representatives of the gaming commission from Nevada and New Jersey. To develop information on the legal framework in selected foreign countries, we contacted gaming and government officials in those countries and researched secondary sources describing their laws. We reviewed various reports, including the Internet Gambling Report, policy papers, and other publications describing the laws of Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, and the United Kingdom to determine the approaches these countries and jurisdictions take to regulating Internet gambling. We contacted the supreme audit institution in each country or jurisdiction to determine whether any work had been done on Internet gambling there. In addition, we researched the Web sites of selected foreign regulators and reviewed available documentation on their Internet gambling regulations, policies, and guidelines. Information was collected solely from secondary sources and does not reflect our independent legal analysis.", "To obtain an understanding of the nature and extent of policies and procedures implemented by the credit card industry to restrict the use of credit cards as a form of payment for Internet gambling, we interviewed officials from the four major credit card organizations, some large issuing and acquiring member banks, third-party processors, on-line payment providers, bank regulators, and banking trade associations. The criteria we used to select the entities for our review included the level of responsibility for significant credit card activity in domestic and foreign markets and oversight by the various federal banking regulators. Seven of the 8 issuing banks we selected rank among the top 10 issuers in the United States, and together with the credit card companies are responsible for over 71 percent of the credit cards issued by U.S. card issuers in 2001, according to The Nilson Report. Five of the 6 acquiring banks we selected were among the top 10 acquirers in the United States in 2001 and were affiliated with the issuing banks in our review. These acquiring banks have nearly 2 million merchant clients, representing over 40 percent of the outlets in the United States for 2001, according to The Nilson Report. We selected four major credit card processors in the United States, including three that provided services for issuers in our review. We requested documentation on Internet gambling policies and procedures from industry representatives; however, only three entities provided us with any written documentation. The others described their policies and procedures but were unwilling to provide documentation to support their descriptions because of concern about the confidentiality of proprietary policies.", "In addition, we conducted an electronic survey of Internet gambling Web sites to gather data about payment options customers can use to make deposits to gamble, payment acceptance policies, and other topics.

Both federal and state laws govern this activity. In 1978, Congress passed the Interstate Horseracing Act (IHA) to regulate interstate commerce with respect to pari-mutuel wagering on horse races. The intent of the statute was not only to give states primary responsibility for determining what forms of gambling can legally take place within their borders, but also to \u201cfurther the horseracing and legal off-track betting industries in the United States\u201d by regulating interstate wagering activities.", "Pari-mutuel horse racing has been conducted in the United States under state authority for over 75 years. In states that allow wagering on horse racing, a state agency\u2014usually a racing commission\u2014regulates the betting, licenses the participants (including the track and horse owners, trainers, jockeys, and drivers), and promulgates and enforces regulations. Under the IHA, wagers may be placed or accepted in one state on a race taking place in another state. However, the IHA stipulates that no entity can accept an interstate, off-track wager without the consent of the track where the live race takes place (the host racing association), the entity regulating the host racing association (the host racing commission), the entity regulating the establishment that takes the bets, and all race tracks operating within 60 miles of the location where the wager is accepted.", "The IHA also imposes limits on the commission that interstate off-track betting systems can charge. The IHA is a civil statute, meaning that under its terms, the host state, the host racing association, or a neighboring race track may file a civil action against establishments that violate the law. These suits may seek to keep such establishments from accepting wagers for races at the host track without the required consent, and for damages resulting from such conduct. Because the IHA is not a criminal statute, the U.S. government cannot bring a criminal action against off-track establishments that violate the law.", "Originally, an interstate off-track wager was defined as \u201ca legal wager placed or accepted in one State with respect to the outcome of a horserace taking place in another State.\u201d The definition of an interstate off-track wager was expanded in December 2000 with amendments to the IHA to include \u201cpari-mutuel wagers, where lawful in each State involved, placed or transmitted by an individual in one State via telephone or other electronic media and accepted by an off-track betting system in the same or another State, as well as the combination of any pari-mutuel wagering pools.\u201d This provision appears to explicitly extend the provisions of IHA to the Internet medium. Indeed, in opposing this amendment to the IHA, Congressman Wolf of Virginia stated that it \u201cwould legalize interstate pari- mutuel gambling over the Internet.\u201d However, in a March 2000 hearing before the House Subcommittee on Crime of the Committee on the Judiciary, in connection with a bill attempting to prohibit Internet gambling, an official from DOJ testified that despite the IHA, gambling businesses offering bets on horse racing over the Internet were violating the Wire Act (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1084). However, this hearing took place before the December 2000 amendments to the IHA, and we were unable to obtain DOJ\u2019s current position on the legality of interstate wagering on state- licensed horse races over the Internet. But in explaining the rationale of DOJ\u2019s testimony to us, DOJ officials stated that since IHA is a civil statue and the United States would not be a party to any action brought under it, IHA could not override the Wire Act, which is an existing criminal statute.", "Many industry participants disagreed with the positions set forth in DOJ\u2019s March 2000 testimony. For example, the Chairman of the Oregon Racing Commission testified at that hearing that DOJ\u2019s interpretation disregards the purpose behind the Wire Act, which is to combat organized crime. He noted that the Wire Act was not intended to make activities licensed and regulated by the states illegal and that the IHA was enacted for the express purposes of ensuring proper regulation of interstate off-track betting and furthering the horse racing and legal off-track betting industries in the United States. He concluded that DOJ\u2019s interpretation apparently disregards Congress\u2019s intent in enacting the IHA and noted that DOJ has never brought an action against a state-licensed entity offering pari-mutuel wagering on horse races over the Internet.", "Industry participants have stated that the industry has made efforts to monitor Internet-based pari-mutuel wagering on horse races.  An official from the Oregon Racing Commission told us that such wagering is generally conducted on a closed-loop, subscriber-based system designed to circumvent the \u201copen nature\u201d of the Internet, to ensure adherence to state laws, and to ensure that bettors are of legal age and qualified to participate.  Such systems operate through Internet Web sites that are protected by passwords and are not available to the general public.  Only registered members may sign on to use a site\u2019s services, and those wishing to register must provide notarized verification of age, a photo identification, and proof of residency.  To prevent identity theft, a letter requesting verification of the information is sent to the address used to open the account.", "Despite these protections and the view that pari-mutuel wagering on horses via the Internet is legal, officials from the National Thoroughbred Racing Association (NTRA) told us that entities offering online pari-mutuel wagering have encountered difficulty with banks, which increasingly refuse to accept credit card transactions for this type of betting. Apparently, many banks use the same coding for pari-mutuel wagering on horses over the Internet and for other types of on-line gambling, such as online casinos and sports betting. According to NTRA officials, this problem is the result of current limitations in credit card coding programs. NTRA officials have stated that they are working with credit card issuers to create a unique transaction code for lawful domestic pari-mutuel wagers that will distinguish them from other forms of on-line gambling. A unique transaction code would still allow the credit card issuers to reject payment for unlawful on-line gambling activities, while accepting Internet wagers on horse races."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Internet Gambling Regulation in Foreign Jurisdictions", "paragraphs": ["The regulation of Internet gambling in foreign countries and jurisdictions varies widely, with some countries permitting it, others banning it, and others taking a mixed approach by prohibiting some forms of Internet gambling and regulating other forms.

The Authority is empowered to implement a complaints-based regime aimed at further preventing interactive gambling service providers from targeting Australian customers. The Authority can initiate investigations of interactive gambling activities and can also accept complaints from the public. Violations are referred to the police.

Under the Criminal Code, only provincial governments are permitted to offer a lottery scheme on or through a computer and they may not license others to conduct one. Further, any lottery would have to be restricted to residents of the province operating it. In order to offer on-line gambling in Canada then, a provincial government would not only have to operate the sites itself but also ensure that residents from other provinces did not participate unless cooperative agreements between the provinces were in place. In addition, commercial land-based betting on single sporting events is prohibited in Canada and therefore would not be permitted over the Internet. A recent case from the Prince Edward Island Supreme Court (Appeal Division) held that an Internet lottery ticket Web site licensed by the Province of Prince Edward Island would not be conducted and managed in the province as required by the Criminal Code. The court found that even though the server was located in the province, the lottery would violate the Criminal Code by offering gambling to a worldwide market.
