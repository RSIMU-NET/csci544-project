DOD, however, continued to rely primarily on the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) for the inventory for most defense components other than the Army. As such, DOD acknowledged a number of factors that limited the utility, accuracy, and completeness of the inventory data. For example, FPDS-NG does not identify more than one type of service purchased for each contract action, provide the number of contractor full-time equivalent personnel, or identify the requiring activity. As before, the Army used its Contractor Manpower Reporting Application to compile its fiscal year 2010 inventory. This system collects data reported by contractors on services performed at the contract line item level, including information on labor hours and the function and mission performed. DOD officials noted that the Army\u0092s current process complies with legislative requirements. In January 2011, GAO recommended that DOD develop a plan with time frames and the necessary resources to facilitate its efforts to collect contractor manpower data and address other limitations in its approach to meeting inventory requirements. DOD concurred with these recommendations. In November 2011, DOD submitted to Congress a plan to collect contractor manpower data. DOD officials noted that developing a common data system to collect and house these data would be challenging given the different requirements from the military departments and components. Consequently, DOD does not expect to fully collect contractor manpower data until fiscal year 2016. DOD\u0092s plan, however, does not establish milestones or specify how it will meet the legislative requirement to identify the requiring activity and the function and missions performed by the contractor.", "Military departments\u0092 required reviews of their fiscal year 2009 inventories of contracted services were incomplete. Navy headquarters officials had no assurance that their commands conducted the required reviews, and GAO found no evidence at the commands it contacted that the required reviews were conducted. Army and Air Force inventory reviews identified 1,935 and 91 instances, respectively, in which contractors were performing inherently governmental functions, though this variation may reflect differences in the departments\u0092 approaches to conducting the reviews. In 8 of the 12 Army and Air Force cases GAO reviewed, contractors continued to perform functions the military departments identified as inherently governmental. The absence of guidance that provided for clear lines of responsibility for conducting, documenting, and addressing the results of the reviews contributed to these outcomes. Further, Army officials cited difficulty in hiring DOD civilians caused by DOD\u0092s decision to freeze civilian full-time equivalents at fiscal year 2010 levels. DOD issued guidance in December 2011 that will require the military departments and components to certify that they have conducted the required reviews. The guidance, however, does not clearly establish lines of accountability and responsibility within the military departments and defense components for conducting the inventory reviews and addressing instances where contractors are identified as performing inherently governmental functions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the military departments and components develop guidance that provides for clear lines of authority, responsibility, and accountability for conducting an inventory review and that the Army and Air Force resolve known instances of contractors performing inherently governmental functions.

DOD relies on  contractors to perform functions as varied as professional and  management support, information technology support, and weapon  system and intelligence support. While there are benefits to using  contractors to perform services for the government, our work has shown  that reliance on contractors to support core missions can place the  government at risk of becoming overly reliant on contractors to perform  closely associated with inherently governmental functions or creating  circumstances in which contractors perform functions deemed inherently  governmental. Over the past decade, our work has identified the need  for DOD to obtain better data on its contracted services to enable it to  make more strategic workforce decisions and ensure that it maintains  appropriate control of government operations. DOD has put a number of  efforts in place to gain better insights into its acquisition of services, but  its efforts have had mixed success to date.", "In recent years, Congress has enacted legislation to improve the  department\u2019s ability to manage its acquisitions of services; to make more  strategic decisions about the right workforce mix of military, civilian, and  contractor personnel; and to align resource needs better through the  budget process to achieve that mix. For example, section 2330a of title 10  of the U.S. Code requires DOD to annually compile and review an  inventory of activities performed pursuant to contracts to help provide  better insights into the number of contractor full-time equivalents (FTE)  providing services to the department and the functions they are  performing. In addition, the inventories are to be used to identify, among  other things, whether contractors were performing inherently  governmental functions and to help inform workforce mix decisions. To  date, DOD has submitted annual inventories to Congress for fiscal years  2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010. The fiscal year 2010 inventory was  submitted on September 8, 2011.", "Section 803(c) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2010 directs GAO to report for 3 years on the inventory of activities  performed pursuant to contracts for services that are to be submitted by  the Secretary of Defense, in 2010, 2011, and 2012, respectively. Most  recently, in January 2011 we assessed the approaches used to compile  the fiscal year 2009 inventories and recommended that DOD develop a  plan of action to facilitate the department\u2019s stated intent of collecting  contractor manpower data and to address other limitations in its approach  to meeting the statutory inventory requirements. For example, in the  absence of a single department-wide data system that could provide the  data necessary to respond to the legislative reporting requirements, most  DOD components, other than the Army, relied on data from the Federal  Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG). DOD  acknowledged that using FPDS-NG as the main data source for the  inventories has a number of limitations. These limitations include that  FPDS-NG does not provide the number of contractor FTEs performing  each service, identify the requiring activity, or allow for the identification of  all services being procured. In contrast, the Army used its existing  process, which incorporated contractor-reported data, including direct  labor hours, from its Contractor Manpower Reporting Application (CMRA).  Further, we reported that the military departments differed both in their  approaches to reviewing the activities performed by contractors and the  extent to which they used the inventories to inform workforce decisions.", "For example, the Army implemented a centralized approach to identify  and assess the functions being performed by contractors and used such  assessments to inform workforce decisions. In contrast, the Air Force and  Navy used decentralized approaches that relied on major commands to  review their contracted activities, but made relatively limited use of the  inventories to inform their workforce decisions.", "To satisfy the mandate for 2011, we assessed (1) the progress DOD has  made in addressing limitations when compiling the fiscal year 2010  inventory of contracted services and in developing a strategy to obtain  contractor manpower data and (2) the extent to which the military  departments addressed issues with contractors performing inherently  governmental functions identified during reviews of their fiscal year 2009  inventories.", "To assess the progress DOD has made in addressing limitations when  compiling the fiscal year 2010 inventory and in developing a strategy to  obtain contractor manpower data, we reviewed relevant guidance related  to the inventory compilation processes used for fiscal year 2010 and  interviewed officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (AT&L), Office of Defense  Procurement and Acquisition Policy; the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense for Personnel and Readiness (P&R); and the departments of the  Army, Navy, and Air Force. We also reviewed plans submitted by the  military departments and defense components to obtain contractor  manpower data directly from contractors.", "To assess the extent to which the military departments addressed  instances in which contractors were performing inherently governmental  functions, we used data from the fiscal year 2009 inventory reviews,  which was the most current review available at the time we began our  work. To do so, we reviewed a total of 12 instances in which contractors  were identified as performing inherently governmental functions. We  selected two Army commands and one Air Force component based in  part on the number of such instances they had identified. For the Army,  we randomly selected 2 instances at the Training and Doctrine Command  and 1 at the Acquisition Support Center. In addition, we reviewed 6  instances where contractors were performing the duties of Department of  the Army systems coordinators. The Army\u2019s 2010 acquisition review  chartered by the Secretary of the Army determined these positions to be  inherently governmental.2011 that summarized the results of its inventory review process,  including functions being performed by contractors that it identified as  inherently governmental. From these data, we determined that the Air  National Guard had the largest number of inherently governmental  functions being performed by contractors, and we randomly selected 3  instances for review. We reviewed the relevant contract files and  interviewed program and contracting officials responsible for the  performance of these functions to determine what steps the military  departments took once the review process identified the functions as  inherently governmental. We did not independently assess whether the  functions the military departments identified were in fact inherently  governmental. While these cases illustrate the extent to which DOD took  actions to resolve instances in which the military departments identified  that contractors had performed inherently governmental functions, the  results of our analysis are not generalizable to the more than 2,000  instances where contractors were performing inherently governmental  functions, as identified by the military departments.", "The Air Force provided data to us in September  At the time we initiated our work, Navy headquarters officials did not have  the results of their fiscal year 2009 inventory review process available and  subsequently acknowledged that they were uncertain whether their  commands conducted the required reviews. Consequently, we  considered DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2010 in-sourcing data that were reported to  Congress in September 2011. From the Navy\u2019s in-sourcing data, we  selected Fleet Forces Command and Space and Naval Warfare Systems  Command for further review based on the number of positions they  reported as in-sourced based on contractor performance of an inherently  governmental function. We did not review individual Navy contracts  because Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command officials told us  that it was not possible to track the positions to specific contracts. Also,  we found that the commands subsequently reported that the functions  were not inherently governmental and were in-sourced for other reasons,  such as to provide Navy personnel career progression opportunities. A  detailed description of our scope and methodology is included in  appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit between July 2011 and April 2012  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

The  information to be collected includes, among other things, the total dollar  amount of the purchase and the extent of competition provided in making  the purchase.

Section 2330a(c) was also amended to state that DOD is to  use direct labor hours and associated cost data reported by contractors  as the basis for the number of contractor FTEs identified in the inventory,  though it provided that DOD may use estimates where such data are not  available and cannot reasonably be made available in a timely manner.", "The Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011, Pub.

In particular, these guidelines and procedures are to provide  special consideration for, among other things, in-sourcing functions  closely associated with inherently governmental functions that contractors  are currently performing, or having DOD civilian employees perform new  requirements that may be closely associated with inherently  governmental functions. Congress required the Secretary of Defense to  make use of the inventories created under section 2330a(c) of title10 of  the U.S. Code for the purpose of identifying functions that should be  considered for performance by DOD civilian employees under this  provision. DOD issued initial in-sourcing guidance in April 2008 and  additional guidance in May 2009 to assist DOD components in  implementing this legislative requirement.", "Further, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010  provided for a new section 115b in title 10 of the U.S. Code that requires  DOD to annually submit to the defense committees a strategic workforce  plan to shape and improve the civilian workforce. Among other  requirements, the plan is to include an assessment of the appropriate mix  of military, civilian, and contractor personnel capabilities. P&R is  responsible for developing and implementing the strategic plan in  consultation with AT&L. The act also added section 235 to title 10 of the  U.S. Code, which requires the Secretary of Defense to include  information in DOD\u2019s annual budget justification materials regarding the  procurement of contracted services.

For  example, in the fiscal year 2009 inventory, contracts for dentistry  services were reported under the broader category of medical  services, which had an average cost of about $107,000 per FTE. In  fiscal year 2010, dentistry services were reported separately from the  medical services category with an average cost of $89,000 per FTE.", "Updated labor rates to account for changes in service costs.

For example, Air Force  officials stated that for the fiscal year 2010 inventory they used their  financial system to cross-walk the contractual, financial, and requiring  activity information with the information that was provided by AT&L. The  updated information, according to Air Force officials, allowed them to  include all Air Force-funded service contracts awarded by non-DOD  agencies, provided greater fidelity in the inventory and enabled the Air  Force to use the inventory to inform the development of budget  justification materials.", "Further, AT&L in cooperation with DOD components aligned the product  and service code functions to missions by organizing their spending into  six portfolios developed by the Office of Defense Procurement and  Acquisition Policy. AT&L officials stated that this alignment was intended  to provide better organization and visibility into services being acquired  and what missions they support. AT&L also sought to identify the  \u201crequiring activity\u201d down to the major command level by using the \u201cfunding  office\u201d as a surrogate measure. AT&L officials, however, acknowledged  that the requiring activity does not always correspond to the funding  office.

As such,  DOD officials acknowledged that the factors that limited the utility,  accuracy, and completeness of using FPDS-NG remained. These  limitations include not being able to identify and record more than one  type of service purchased for each contracting action entered into the  system, not being able to capture any services performed under contracts  that are predominantly for supplies, not capturing service contracts  awarded on behalf of DOD by non-DOD agencies, not being able to  identify the requiring activity specifically, and not being able to determine  the number of contractor FTEs used to perform each service.", "As with the fiscal year 2009 inventory, AT&L authorized the Army to  continue to use its CMRA data system. CMRA is intended to capture  data directly reported by contractors on each service performed at the  contract line item level, including information on the direct labor dollars,  direct labor hours, total invoiced dollars, the functions and mission  performed, and the Army unit on whose behalf contractors are performing  the services. In instances where contractors are performing different  services under the same order, or are performing services at multiple  locations, they can enter additional records in CMRA to capture  information associated with each type of service or each location. Under  its approach, unlike the Air Force and the Navy, the Army included all  categories of research and development services in its inventory and  identified the services provided under contracts for goods. To report the  number of contractor FTEs, the Army indicated that it divided the number  of direct labor hours reported by a contractor in CMRA for each service  performed by 2,088, the number of labor hours in a federal employee  work year.

Navy and Air Force officials said they wanted to ensure that the data  collection system they implemented had the necessary capability to  inform other DOD workforce initiatives, such as in-sourcing, and to meet  the information technology requirements set by their military departments.  Subsequently, in September 2011, DOD components started submitting  their plans for reporting contractor FTEs. Some DOD components noted  that they would begin modifying existing and future contracts to require  the collection of manpower data directly from contractors starting as early  as October 2011 and that it would take about a year to modify all their  existing contracts. Components also indicated that after the contracts  were modified, they would begin collecting the data by conducting manual  data calls, implementing the Army\u2019s CMRA system, or using other internal  processes. The Navy did not include a time frame for modifying contracts,  while the Air Force estimated that it would take approximately 5 years to  modify all its contracts.

Further, the guidance provides a different formula  for DOD components to use for estimating the number of contractor FTEs  paid for the performance of an activity based on the amount of direct  labor hours provided by a contractor under each product and service  code. Since the Navy, the Air Force, and most DOD components do not  collect direct labor hours directly from contractors, the guidance indicates  that DOD components may use the best available data or a variety of  methodologies, singularly or in combination, to estimate direct labor  hours. These methodologies include  collecting direct labor hour information from contractors,  collecting direct labor hours as reported by the contracting officer\u2019s  representative for the service during fiscal year 2011,  referencing the independent government cost estimate or contractor  technical proposals to extrapolate hours for services provided in fiscal  year 2011,  reporting information collected from contract invoices, or  calculating the number of contractor FTEs by using information  extrapolated from the manpower data collected by the Army from its  contractors.", "Under this plan, the Army will continue to use its CMRA system and other  established tools and processes for preparing and submitting its  inventory.", "DOD officials noted that DOD intends to develop a comprehensive DOD  instruction for the development, review, and use of the service contract  inventories.

In some of these cases, the  Army took steps in response to the inventory review process, such as  transferring responsibility to military personnel. In contrast, we also found  that some contractors continued to perform inherently governmental  functions. For example, Army officials cited difficulty in hiring DOD  civilians caused by DOD\u2019s decision to freeze civilian FTE levels at the  fiscal year 2010 level as hindering their ability to resolve instances  identified during the inventory review process. Moreover, contracting and  program officials were unaware that the inventory review process had  identified functions under their contracts as inherently governmental.

We found no evidence at  the commands we contacted that the required reviews were conducted.  For example, Fleet Forces Command officials were not aware of a  required inventory review and did not recall guidance being issued.  Similarly, officials from the Navy\u2019s Space and Naval Warfare Systems  Command stated that they did not recall receiving guidance from Navy  headquarters to conduct a review of the fiscal year 2009 inventory. Navy  headquarters officials did not follow up to ensure that the required reviews  were completed and acknowledged that they could not verify whether  Navy commands completed the fiscal year 2009 inventory review.", "The Army used a centralized approach that included a headquarters-level  review of all functions performed by contractors. The Army, for its  headquarters-level review, established the Panel for Documentation of  Contractors, which consists of officials from the Office of the Assistant  Secretary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs along with  headquarters officials from the acquisition and manpower planning  communities. Army guidance directs the commands to provide data to the  panel, including descriptions of the functions being performed by  contractors, the organizational unit for which each function is performed,  and an assessment of whether those functions are inherently  governmental. The panel reviews information provided by the commands  and makes an independent determination to assess whether the functions  are inherently governmental. According to panel officials, function  descriptions do not always provide insight into the day-to-day activities of  contractors, sometimes making it difficult to accurately distinguish  inherently governmental functions from those that are closely associated  with inherently governmental functions. In instances where there was a  difference of opinion on the appropriate assessment of a function,  however, panel and command officials reported that they engaged in  further discussion in order to reach agreement.", "Additionally, the Army\u2019s final 2010 acquisition review chartered by the  Secretary of the Army identified the Army\u2019s systems coordinator function  as inherently governmental.include representing program managers at the Pentagon, acting as a  liaison with Congress, preparing principal staff officers for systems  reviews, writing background papers for military staff, and representing   The systems coordinator responsibilities  system program managers on integrated product teams.

An Army manpower official stated that the  panel process did not identify the remaining 7 instances.", "In contrast, we found that the Air Force used a decentralized inventory  review approach, which delegated primary responsibility for the review of  its inventory to its major commands and components. In January 2010,  the Secretary of the Air Force issued guidance instructing its major  commands and components to conduct an initial review of its fiscal years  2008 and 2009 inventories of contracted services. According to an Air  Force inventory official, a headquarters review of the initial information  submitted by the commands found that approximately 40 percent of the  fiscal year 2009 contracts included for review did not contain adequate  responses to the required review elements. Because of challenges  experienced during the initial review, the Secretary of the Air Force issued  additional guidance in October 2010 requiring major commands to  complete the review of fiscal year 2009 service contracts that may have  been missed. To do so, the Air Force headquarters-level acquisition office  provided each major command and component with a spreadsheet to  review that contained its portion of the department\u2019s service contracts  from the beginning of fiscal year 2009 through August 2010. This  guidance instructed the organizations to determine, among other things,  whether the activity performed under the contract was an inherently  governmental function. In addition to the inventory review, however, this  effort was to help implement the Secretary of Defense\u2019s direction to  reduce service support contractors, and inform budget justification  initiatives as they pertained to contractor employees.", "As a result of this process, the Air Force identified 91 instances of  contractors performing inherently governmental functions, the majority of  those instances for work performed for the Air National Guard and the Air  Force Space Command. Financial management and contracting officials  responsible for conducting the reviews at the Air National Guard and Air  Force Space Command, however, cited concerns with the accuracy and  completeness of the inventory review data. For example, at the Air  National Guard, the inventory review efforts were conducted by  individuals within the financial management office. During the course of  the inventory reviews, however, at least one staff member responsible for  the inventory review had left the organization. When we spoke to an Air  National Guard official in December 2011, she noted that when she  received the spreadsheet from Air Force headquarters, 37 functions on  the list were already identified as inherently governmental. Air Force  officials, however, provided us with documentation to indicate that other  individuals within the Air National Guard had made the determinations in  earlier reviews of the inventory data, but these determinations were not  communicated to the official.

In one of these cases, a contracting  official noted that he had initially limited the period of performance on  the task order to a 1-year base period with 6-month options because  of concern at the time of award that this function was, at the very  least, closely associated with inherently governmental functions and  because he was aware that the Army wanted to convert this function  to a civilian position. A military officer replaced the contractor on  October 31, 2011, when the first 6-month option expired.", "In another case involving a $2.1 million warehouse support contract at  Army\u2019s Training and Doctrine Command, a command official clarified  that the function performed by the contractor was not inherently  governmental. She further explained that she believes the  performance of this service was identified as such by the Panel for  Documentation of Contractors because the function description  included the term \u201cwarehouse supervisor\u201d.

For  example:  In 4 instances where it had been determined that contractors had  been performing the Department of the Army systems coordinator  function, contractor employees continued to perform these duties.  According to an Acquisition Support Center official, in June 2011 the  command requested authorization to replace the contractor  employees with military personnel. He noted, however, that the  command had not received authorization at the time of our review. He  explained, the alternative is to in-source the function and fill the  positions with civilian personnel. A function, however, may now only  be in-sourced if the Secretary of the Army personally approves it. In  February 2011, the Secretary of the Army suspended all approved in- sourcing actions that had not yet been completed and instituted a new  in-sourcing request and approval process. The command official  reported that preparing the in-sourcing package, which includes a  concept plan, a workload and funding profile analysis, a business  case, and a contractor inventory review, is a lengthy process, but  acknowledged that the command had not submitted this package as  of January 2012.", "In 2 other cases\u20141 at the Army\u2019s Acquisition Support Center and 1 at  the Air Force\u2019s Air National Guard\u2014contracting and program officials  were unaware that the inventory review process had identified  functions under their contracts as inherently governmental. One case  involved a $1.1 million contract at Acquisition Support Center for  engineering support in which the contractor employee provided  technical expertise and coordination with program office staff, other  military departments, Congress, and private companies, among other  duties. The other case involved a $409,000 Air National Guard  contract for financial analytical support. In both cases, program  officials stated that even though the original contracts had expired,  contractors continued to perform the same functions under  subsequent contracts.", "In another case at the Air National Guard, the inventory review  process identified a function under a $120,000 task order to provide  advice and advocacy on Air National Guard positions and programs to  the Air Staff and other Air Force major commands as inherently  governmental. In this case, the Director of the Contracting Division,  with responsibility for this task order, stated that she first became  aware that the function was identified as inherently governmental in  October 2010 but disagreed with the determination. She was not  aware of any process in the Air Force or Air National Guard to resolve  the disagreement. When the task order expired in May 2011, she  renewed the function under a separate task order.", "In the remaining case, involving a $6.1 million information technology  support contract at Army Training and Doctrine Command\u2019s Defense  Language Institute, a \u201cproject manager\u201d function had been identified  as inherently governmental.

According to Manpower  and Reserve Affairs officials, command officials disagreed with the  determination, but on February 22, 2010, the Army Deputy General  Counsel for Operations and Personnel issued a legal opinion that  concluded that certain functions performed by the contractors were  inherently governmental and could not be performed by a contractor.  According to Manpower and Reserve Affairs officials, contractors  continue to perform these inherently governmental functions.

After a review is complete, the military  departments and defense components will now be required to certify that  they have completed a review and submit a letter to P&R with the  following information: an explanation of the methodology used to conduct the review and  criteria for selection of contracts to review;  the results of the review, including identifying any inherently  governmental functions, closely associated with inherently  governmental functions, or unauthorized personal services contracts; a plan for divesting or realigning functions for contracts that were  identified as inherently governmental; and an explanation of the steps taken to ensure appropriate government  control and oversight for functions that were identified as closely  associated with inherently governmental.", "The guidance, however, does not clearly establish lines of accountability  and responsibility within the military departments and defense  components for conducting the inventory reviews and addressing  instances where contractors are identified as performing inherently  governmental functions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Congress has mandated that DOD use the inventory of contracted  services and the associated review process to help DOD ensure that  contractors are performing work that is appropriate, to support  development of DOD\u2019s annual strategic workforce plan, and to specify the  number of contractor FTEs included in DOD\u2019s annual budget justification  materials. As such, it is essential that the inventories contain  comprehensive, accurate, and actionable data for each service  performed.", "DOD, with the exception of the Army, has much further to go in  addressing the requirements for compiling and reviewing the inventories  of contracted services. DOD made incremental improvements to its  process to address some of the previously identified limitations when it  compiled its fiscal year 2010 inventory, but it has not resolved the  fundamental issue of how to collect the required data to meet the  legislative inventory requirements, including manpower data directly from  contractors. DOD took a significant step in November 2011 to identify  objectives for collecting contractor manpower data from contractors, but  DOD indicates that implementation will not be complete until 2016. Given  the potential value and importance of compiling a complete and accurate  inventory, it would benefit DOD to move more expeditiously. DOD\u2019s plan,  however, does not specify time frames or milestones to measure its  progress toward developing an enterprisewide data system to collect  contractor manpower data, even though it acknowledged that reaching  agreement on that approach would be challenging. We therefore reiterate  our prior recommendation that DOD\u2019s plans include milestones and time  frames to gauge progress in meeting the inventory requirements.", "The Army and Air Force conducted inventory reviews, but the wide  variation in the number of instances of contractors performing inherently  governmental functions raises the question as to how much of the  variation is due to the different approaches used to conduct the reviews.  Further, the Navy was unable to provide assurance that it actually  conducted the statutorily required review of its fiscal year 2009 inventory.  This underscores the need for greater accountability and management  attention. The absence of guidance, at all levels, providing clear lines of  responsibility for conducting, documenting, and addressing issues  identified during the fiscal year 2009 inventory review process contributed  to instances in which contractors continued to perform functions identified  as being inherently governmental in 8 of the 12 Army and Air Force cases  we reviewed.

Such  challenges, however, do not justify the continued use of contractors to  perform inherently governmental functions, in several cases more than a  year after the issue was initially identified. DOD\u2019s December 2011  guidance will require the military departments and defense components to  certify that they have conducted the required reviews, but the guidance  does not clearly establish lines of accountability and responsibility within  the military departments and defense components for doing so.

DOD agreed it was  imperative for the components to do so, but noted that its December 2011  guidance, while not prescribing individual management practices,  requires component heads to certify completion of and results from the  reviews.

As with the fiscal year  2009 inventory, the Army continued to use its Contractor Manpower  Reporting Application (CMRA) that reports manpower data collected  directly from its contractors.

We  selected two Army commands and one Air Force component based in  part on the number of such instances they had identified. For the Army,  we randomly selected 3 instances from the Army\u2019s inventory review data  at the Training and Doctrine Command and 3 instances at the Acquisition  Support Center. These data included determinations made by the Army\u2019s  Panel for the Documentation of Contractors, which identified the functions  as being inherently governmental, closely associated with inherently  governmental, or unauthorized personal services, as well as the  commands\u2019 determination of how each function was resolved. For the 6  Army cases we randomly selected, we reviewed the inventory review data  and interviewed officials responsible for the fiscal year 2009 inventory  review process. We subsequently eliminated 3 of the instances we  randomly selected because they were identified as closely associated  with inherently governmental functions or unauthorized personal services.  In addition, we reviewed 6 instances where contractors were performing  the duties of Department of the Army systems coordinators. Army\u2019s 2010  acquisition review chartered by the Secretary of the Army determined that  these positions were inherently governmental.
