This testimony is based on GAO's August 2005 report Climate Change: Federal Reports on Climate Change Funding Should Be Clearer and More Complete (GAO-05-461) and its April 2006 report Climate Change: EPA and DOE Should Do More to Encourage Progress Under Two Voluntary Programs (GAO-06-97), which addressed (1) reported changes in federal climate change funding and (2) the status and progress of two federal voluntary climate programs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Federal funding for climate change, as reported by OMB, increased from $2.35 billion in 1993 to $5.09 billion in 2004 (117 percent), or from $3.28 billion to $5.09 billion (55 percent) after adjusting for inflation. OMB reports show that, during this period, funding increased for technology, science, and--before adjusting for inflation--international assistance. CCSP, which reports only science funding, generally presented totals that were consistent with OMB's, but provided more detail. However, changes in reporting methods used by both OMB and CCSP limit the comparability of funding data over time, and therefore it was unclear whether total funding actually increased as reported. Furthermore, we were unable to compare changes in the fourth category (climate-related tax expenditures), because from 1993 to 2004 OMB reported estimates for proposed but not existing tax expenditures. With regard to individual agencies' funding, OMB reported that 12 of the 14 agencies receiving funding for climate change programs in 2004 received more funding in that year than they had in 1993, but it is unclear whether funding changed as OMB reported because of unexplained changes in what was defined as climate change funding. Reported funding for DOE, the agency with the most reported climate-related funding in 2004, increased from $963 million to $2.52 billion (162 percent), or from $1.34 billion to $2.52 billion (88 percent) after adjusting for inflation. DOE and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration accounted for 81 percent of the reported increase in funding from 1993 through 2004. However, because agency funding totals are composed of individual accounts, changes in the reports' contents, such as the unexplained addition of accounts to the technology category, limit the comparability of agencies' funding data over time, making it difficult to determine if these are real or definitional increases. EPA and DOE expected participants in their voluntary climate programs to complete several program steps within general time frames, but participants' progress in completing those steps within the time frames was mixed. Furthermore, DOE did not have a system for tracking groups' progress in completing program steps, and neither DOE nor EPA had a written policy specifying the consequences for participants not proceeding as expected. In addition, EPA and DOE had both estimated the share of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions attributable to participants in their respective programs and were working through an interagency process to quantify emissions reductions attributable to their programs. However, determining reductions attributable to each program will be challenging because of the overlap between these programs and other voluntary programs and because it is difficult to determine how much of a participant's emissions reductions can be attributed to its participation in the program, since the participant's emissions in the absence of the program cannot be known."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to participate in the Subcommittee\u2019s hearing and to discuss  some of our recent work on federal climate change funding and voluntary  programs.", "Increases in the earth\u2019s average temperature that have already occurred  over the last 100 years, combined with additional future increases  projected by a consensus of scientists, have the potential to dramatically  change life on earth. For example, changes in the frequency and intensity  of rainfall, both possible effects of climate change, could affect human  health, agriculture, forests, and water supplies in certain locations. Effects  on planetary biodiversity are projected to be even more pronounced. The  Congress and the president have supported research to improve scientific  understanding of the climate system and to develop new technologies to  reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They have also created various federal  programs to help reduce such emissions. These programs are largely  voluntary and encourage private and public sector entities to adopt goals  for reducing emissions.", "My remarks today are based on our August 2005 report on federal climate  change funding from 1993 through 2004 and our April 2006 report on  voluntary programs that encourage industry participants to set greenhouse  gas emissions reduction goals. I will focus on (1) how total funding,  funding by category, and funding by agency as reported by the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) and the Climate Change Science Program  (CCSP) changed and the extent to which such funding data are  comparable over time, and (2) the expectations for, and progress being  made by, participants in two federal voluntary programs\u2013the  Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA\u2019s) Climate Leaders and the  Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE\u2019s) Climate VISION\u2013and these agencies\u2019  estimates of the programs\u2019 current coverage (the share of U.S. emissions  that participants contribute to total U.S. emissions) and impact (emissions  reduced).", "To determine how federal climate change funding by category\u2014science,  technology, international assistance, and tax expenditures\u2014and agency  changed, we analyzed data from annual OMB and CCSP reports as well as  congressional testimony. To determine the extent to which the data on  climate change funding were comparable over time, we analyzed and  compared the contents of the reports and interviewed responsible  officials. The term \u201cfunding\u201d in this testimony reflects discretionary budget  authority, or the authority provided in law to incur financial obligations  that will result in outlays, as reported by OMB and CCSP in their reports.  Unless otherwise stated, we report funding in nominal terms (not adjusted  for inflation), and all years refer to fiscal years. To evaluate the EPA and  DOE voluntary programs, we reviewed and analyzed EPA and DOE  documents and met with these agencies\u2019 officials. Most of the information  in the report, except where otherwise noted, reflects the status of the two  programs as of November 2005. As of September 20, 2006, an additional 18  firms had joined Climate Leaders. To assess the reliability of EPA, DOE,  and other data, we spoke with agency officials about data quality control  procedures and reviewed relevant documentation.

CCSP is currently  responsible for preparing these climate change science reports, which  duplicate to some extent data provided by OMB in the science category.", "In 1992, the United States ratified the United Nations Framework  Convention on Climate Change, which has as its objective the stabilization  of greenhouse gas concentrations in the earth\u2019s atmosphere but does not  impose specific goals or timetables for limiting emissions. In response,  federal agencies developed a plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions,  primarily through voluntary efforts by companies, state and local  governments, and other organizations. Since that time, federal agencies  have sponsored voluntary programs that encourage private and public  sector entities to curb their greenhouse gas emissions by providing  technical assistance, education, research, and information sharing. The  administration has promoted such voluntary programs, along with other  measures, as an alternative to mandatory emissions reductions.", "In February 2002, the president announced a Global Climate Change  Initiative to reduce the rate of increase in greenhouse gas emissions in the  United States. Specifically, he established the goal of reducing the  emissions intensity of the United States by 18 percent between 2002 and  2012. Emissions intensity is a ratio calculated by dividing emissions in a  given year by economic output for that year. In support of this goal, the  president announced two new voluntary programs aimed at securing  private sector agreements to voluntarily reduce greenhouse gas emissions  or emissions intensity.", "Climate Leaders, an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-sponsored  government-industry partnership established in February 2002, works with  firms to develop long-term climate change strategies.

OMB also expanded the definitions of some accounts to include  more activities without clarifying how the definitions were changed.  Furthermore, OMB reports include a wide range of federal climate-related  programs and activities, some of which\u2013such as scientific research on  global environmental change\u2013are explicitly climate change programs,  whereas others\u2013such as technology initiatives promoting emissions  reduction or encouraging energy conservation\u2013are not solely for climate  change purposes.", "Science funding increased from $1.31 billion to $1.98 billion (51 percent),  according to both OMB and CCSP, or from $1.82 billion to $1.98 billion (9  percent) in inflation-adjusted dollars.

Although not  required to do so, OMB reported proposed climate-related tax  expenditures. However, OMB did not report revenue loss estimates for  existing climate change-related tax expenditures.

OMB and CCSP  officials also noted that each report was prepared in response to a one- time requirement and that they were not directed to use the same report  format over time or to explain differences in methodology from one report  to another. The director of CCSP told us that changes to climate change  science reports, such as the creation and deletion of different  categorization methods, were made because CCSP was changing towards  a goals-oriented budget, and categorization methods changed as the  program evolved. The director also said that future reports will explicitly  present budget data as it was reported in prior reports to retain continuity,  even if new methods are introduced. Regarding tax expenditures, OMB  officials said that they consistently included in the reports those proposed  tax expenditures where a key purpose was specifically to reduce  greenhouse gas emissions.

Therefore, we recommended that DOE develop a system for tracking  participants\u2019 progress in completing key steps associated with the  program, and that both EPA and DOE develop written policies that  establish the actions the agencies will take if participants are not  completing program steps on time. EPA did not comment on our  recommendation; DOE stated that it agreed with our recommendation  regarding a tracking system and would consider our recommendation  regarding establishing a written policy. We have not fully reviewed the  extent to which the recommendations have been implemented.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
