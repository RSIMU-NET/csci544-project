While VA has increased the capacity of the GPD program over the past several years, VA reports that an additional 9,600 transitional housing beds from various sources are needed to meet current demand. VA has plans to make 2,200 additional GPD beds available. GPD providers collaborate with other agencies to help veterans regain their health and obtain housing, jobs, and various services to enable them to live independently. However, resource and communications gaps may stand in the way of VA and provider efforts to meet these goals. Limited availability of affordable permanent housing, for example, may make it difficult to move veterans out of homelessness, according to GPD providers. We also identified instances of misunderstandings of program policies related to eligibility and program stay limits that could prevent homeless veterans from being admitted into the GPD program. VA assesses overall program performance by the success of veterans in attaining stable housing, income, and self-determination at the time they leave the program. VA data show that the percentage of veterans achieving these goals has generally increased or held steady over time. In 2006, VA also stepped up its assessment of the performance of GPD providers. While these assessments do not indicate how veterans fare after they leave the program, preliminary results of a onetime VA study indicate positive housing outcomes were maintained 1 year later.

Scheduled for reauthorization in 2007, this program  provides a transitional setting to help veterans prepare for permanent  housing. The program is not intended to serve all homeless veterans but is  focused instead on serving those who are most in need, including veterans  whose circumstances make them likely to remain homeless unless they  receive assistance, such as those who have had problems with mental  illness, substance abuse, or both. Through a network of local nonprofit or  public agencies, the program provides beds to homeless veterans in  settings free of drugs and alcohol that are supervised 24 hours a day,   7 days a week. Program rules generally allow veterans to stay with a single  GPD provider for 2 years, but providers have the flexibility to set shorter  time frames. In addition, veterans are generally limited to a total of three  stays in the program over their lifetime.

To assess the extent of coordination among community  partners serving homeless veterans, we visited 13 GPD providers located  in California, Florida, Massachusetts, and Wisconsin, including some in  rural areas as well as large cities. In addition, we analyzed data from a  survey of GPD providers conducted by VA\u2019s Northeast Program Evaluation  Center (NEPEC) and attended a meeting of VA\u2019s Advisory Committee on  Homeless Veterans. We focused our review on those GPD providers  serving homeless veterans in general rather than special subgroups, such  as the chronically mentally ill. In each of these locations, we interviewed  local VA officials, GPD staff, community partners, and, where possible,  current and former program participants. To develop information on GPD  performance, we interviewed officials and analyzed data from NEPEC and  VA\u2019s national program office.

Outreach is considered particularly  important to locate and serve veterans living on the street and in  temporary shelters who otherwise would not seek assistance. Treatment  involves primary and specialty medical care, mental health care, and  alcohol and drug abuse services for eligible homeless veterans. Three of  the nine programs are run jointly or solely by the Veterans Benefits  Administration that also serves homeless veterans as part of its broader  mission to provide disability compensation and pensions to eligible  veterans. Figure 1 illustrates some of the key programs and services for  homeless veterans\u2014including the GPD program that is the focus of this  report\u2014provided by VA.

To operate the GPD program at the local  level, nonprofit and public agencies compete for grants. The program  provides two basic types of grants\u2014capital grants to pay for the buildings  that house homeless veterans and per diem grants for the day-to-day  operational expenses.", "Capital grants cover up to 65 percent of housing acquisition,  construction, or renovation costs and require that agencies  receiving the grants cover the remaining costs through other  funding sources. Generally, agencies that have received capital  grants are considered for subsequent per diem grants, so that the  VA investment can be realized and the buildings can provide  operational beds.", "Per diem grants support the operations of about 300 GPD providers  nationwide. The per diem grants pay a fixed dollar amount for each  day an authorized bed is occupied by an eligible veteran up to the  maximum number of beds allowed by the grant. Generally under  this grant, VA does not pay for empty beds. VA makes payments  after an agency has housed the veteran, on a cost reimbursement  basis, and the agency may use the payments to offset operating  costs, such as staff salaries and utilities. By law, the per diem  reimbursement cannot exceed a fixed rate, which was $29.31 per  person per day in 2006. Reimbursement may be lower for providers  receiving funds for the same purpose from other sources.", "On a limited basis, special needs grants are available to cover the  additional costs of serving women, frail elderly, terminally ill, or  chronically mentally ill veterans. Although the primary focus of the GPD  program is housing, grants may also be used for transport or to operate  daytime service centers that do not provide overnight accommodations.  According to VA, in fiscal year 2005, GPD grants supported about 75 vans  that were used to conduct outreach and transport homeless veterans to  medical and other appointments. Also, 23 service centers were operating  with GPD support.", "Most GPD providers have 50 or fewer beds available for homeless  veterans, with the majority of providers having 25 or fewer.  Accommodations vary and may range from rooms in multistory buildings  in the inner city to rooms in detached homes in suburban residential  neighborhoods. Veterans may sleep in barracks-style bunk beds in a room  shared by several other participants or may have their own rooms.

Multipurpose rooms may be available for television,  games, and conversation, as well as communal kitchen facilities where  meals can be purchased or made by the participants themselves. Not all  GPD providers supply food. Some may assist the participants in obtaining  items from community food banks. GPD providers may require veterans to  pay rent, but the rent cannot exceed 30 percent of a veteran\u2019s income,  after deducting the costs of medical, child care, and court-ordered  payments. In addition, veterans may be charged fees for other services not  supported by the GPD grant, such as cable television. According to VA  rules, veterans may stay with a single GPD provider for 24 months or  longer under certain conditions. GPD providers may specify shorter limits  such as 3, 6, or 12 months.

A veteran is defined  as an individual who has been discharged or released from active military  service and includes members of the Reserves and National Guard with  active federal service. Although the GPD program definition excludes  individuals who have received a dishonorable discharge, it is less  restrictive in terms of length of service requirements. As a result, some  homeless veterans may be eligible for the GPD program and not eligible  for VA health care. VA does not pay for spouses and children of veterans  who are not themselves veterans, but they may be served by GPD  providers using other funds. Consistent with the definition used in many  other federal programs, VA defines a homeless individual as a person who  lacks a fixed, regular, adequate nighttime residence and instead stays at  night in a shelter, institution, or public or private place not designed for  regular sleeping accommodations. Prison inmates are not deemed  homeless, but may be at risk of homelessness and may be eligible for the  program upon their release. GPD providers determine if potential  participants are homeless, but VA officials determine if potential  participants meet the program\u2019s definition of veteran. VA officials are also  responsible for determining whether veterans have exceeded their lifetime  limit of three stays in a GPD program and for issuing a waiver to that rule  when appropriate.", "Prospective GPD providers may identify additional eligibility requirements  in their grant documents. Because the providers are responsible for  providing a clean and sober environment that is free of illicit drugs, about  two-thirds of providers require that veterans entering the program be  sober and free from alcohol and drug use for a given length of time. The  time frames set by many providers range from 1 to 30 days of sobriety.  Many providers also conduct drug tests of veterans after they enter the  program to ensure their continued sobriety. Most providers will not accept  veterans considered to be a danger to themselves or others, in need of  detoxification, or under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

About 40 percent of homeless veterans seen by VA had served during the  Vietnam era, and most of the remaining homeless veterans served after  that war, including over 2,500 who served in military operations in the  Persian Gulf, Afghanistan, and Iraq.

Key federal agencies with programs specifically targeted to  the homeless, including veterans, are HUD, the Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS), and the Department of Labor (DOL). HUD makes  funds available to bring together community organizations to plan and  coordinate service delivery through local or regional networks designated  as the \u201cContinuums of Care.\u201d In their planning role, the Continuums  arrange for counts of the homeless in their area, and since 2003, are  required to report the number for a given point in time and to do so at  least every 2 years. Further, as part of their coordination role, the  Continuums review agency applications for certain HUD grants. HUD also  funds emergency shelters that are open seasonally or year-round for  temporary, overnight accommodations. In addition, HUD is the only  federal agency that is authorized to provide permanent subsidized housing  for the homeless. HHS specializes in funding health care and researching  the needs of homeless with substance abuse and mental health issues.  DOL, like VA, has programs targeted specifically to veterans within the  homeless population, with DOL\u2019s emphasis on helping veterans obtain  employment. Charities, businesses, and state and local governments are  also involved in meeting the needs of homeless veterans and, in some  cases, providing funding to GPD providers.", "At the federal level, VA works with these and other federal agencies  through two key committees. VA\u2019s Advisory Committee on Homeless  Veterans is responsible for assessing the needs of homeless veterans and  determining if VA and others are meeting these needs. The committee  comprises homeless veterans, experts and advocates, community-based  service providers, state and federal government officials, and  representatives of veterans\u2019 service organizations. The committee has  made several recommendations on improvements to homeless veterans\u2019  programs, including the GPD program, some of which have been  implemented. In 2004 the committee urged VA to fund GPD providers  serving veterans with special needs, especially female veterans; in fiscal  year 2005 there were 29 programs of this kind, including 8 for female  veterans.", "VA is also a participant on the Interagency Council on Homelessness,  which coordinates the federal response to homelessness and works with  state and local governments to develop plans for ending chronic  homelessness among individuals, including veterans, in 10 years.  Although the chronic homeless represent only 10 to 20 percent of all  homeless adults, they take up roughly half of all shelter beds and also use  a disproportionate share of resources for the homeless.", "At the local level, VA works with various agencies through the Community  Homelessness Assessment, Local Education and Networking Groups for  Veterans, referred to as Project CHALENG. An arrangement of this kind is  needed, according to VA, because no single agency can provide the full  range of services required to help homeless veterans become more  productive members of society. Through CHALENG, a designated VA  official in each medical center, usually VA\u2019s homeless coordinator, reaches  out to community agencies that provide services to the homeless to raise  awareness of homeless veterans\u2019 particular needs and to plan to meet  those needs. Specific needs to be addressed include outreach, counseling,  health care, education and training, employment, and housing.

Most often, local VA officials rely on data collected by  the HUD-funded Continuums of Care, local governments, university  researchers, or other groups along with information from local homeless  providers. The estimates reported by local VA officials are compared to  the previous year\u2019s and if they have significantly changed, the local VA  officials are asked to explain the differences before their estimates are  incorporated into the national figure.", "Prior to 2004, local VA officials used a methodology to develop their  estimates that was the equivalent of mixing apples with oranges and, as a  result, yielded less consistent, reliable counts of the homeless veteran  population. This mixed methodology combined cumulative numbers such  as the total who were homeless over the course of a year with point-in- time numbers involving the number homeless on any given day or night.  The numbers were not comparable because over the course of a year some  individuals who were not homeless when the counts were conducted later  became homeless. Generally, the number of veterans who are homeless  sometime over the course of a year is larger than the number who are  homeless on any given night. Since 2004, local VA officials have been  directed to use point-in-time data exclusively in developing their estimates  to reflect the number of homeless veterans on any given day of the year.  VA reports that this standardized method yields more reliable estimates  than were developed for earlier years, although there may be some  veterans who cannot be located. Figure 3 shows VA\u2019s estimates of the  homeless veteran population from fiscal years 2000-2005.", "Recent estimates are also likely to be more reliable, according to VA,  because local VA officials increasingly use homeless data from counts  funded by HUD\u2019s Continuum of Care, which are believed to be more  accurate. In 2005, more than twice as many local VA officials used HUD  counts as was the case in 2003. HUD-funded counts in many communities  are gradually improving as the census takers increasingly seek out the  \u201chidden\u201d homeless who do not contact service providers as well as the  homeless who congregate at soup kitchens and shelters. In both Atlanta  and Los Angeles, homeless individuals were hired in 2005 to assist the  census takers in locating areas where homeless individuals could be  found. As a result, the local counts that were conducted in these two  communities were more accurate than the counts conducted in earlier  years, according to VA officials.", "Although VA officials believe that the number is likely an underestimate,  VA officials consider their 2005 year estimate of 194,000 homeless veterans  on any given night to be the best available. Counting the homeless is a  challenge for several reasons, as VA and other agencies have  acknowledged, since the homeless are hard to locate and some may not  be included in the current estimate. Also, the number may change in  relation to social and economic factors, such as job layoffs or a tighter  housing market.

We found variation in the agencies that provided these services. According  to a VA survey, most GPD providers used their own on-site staff to offer  services like case management and transportation assistance. In contrast,  mental health assessments were mostly handled indirectly, with 79 percent  of the GPD providers using the staff of other agencies, often the VA.

While most providers offered a range of services, not all  veterans received each service. To identify the specific services a veteran  may need, providers typically worked with veterans to develop individual  treatment plans that identified the veteran\u2019s needs on entering the  program.

Several programs  hosted Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and other counseling services,  while some GPD programs expected veterans to attend regular meetings  elsewhere in the community. At least two GPD providers we visited  provided their own substance abuse treatment and did not rely on  community partners to provide such services. At least two other providers  that referred veterans to VA for substance abuse treatment expressed  concerns about waiting lists for that service, making it hard for veterans to  access care immediately. Typically, a VA local medical center provided  veterans with primary and specialized health care. However, GPD  providers sometimes expressed concerns about difficulties obtaining  dental care. To meet the needs of veterans who were not eligible for VA  health care, GPD providers made other arrangements.

Some had staff who assessed a veteran\u2019s potential eligibility  for public benefits such as food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, or  Social Security Disability Insurance. Other providers relied on  relationships with local or state officials to provide this assessment. For  example, a Wisconsin GPD provider worked with a county veterans\u2019  service officer who reviewed veterans\u2019 eligibility for state and federal  benefits. The provider also had a relationship with a county employment  representative who came to the GPD facility to discuss job searches,  training, and other employment issues with veterans.

For instance, several of the providers  worked with the local HUD-funded Continuum of Care network to identify  permanent housing resources. Some providers had or were applying for  HUD funds to build single room occupancy housing units that could serve  as a transition to more permanent long-term housing. As at least one  provider mentioned, veterans sometimes become resourceful and agree to  share apartments. In some instances, providers have asked for an  extension to allow veterans to stay until housing becomes available.", "GPD providers and VA staff coordinated with community resources to  help address other issues that they identified that might also present  obstacles for transitioning veterans out of homelessness. For example,  staff in some locations indicated that such legal issues as criminal records  or credit problems may preclude veterans from obtaining employment and  housing. To help overcome these issues, some GPD providers worked with  lawyers who provided services at no cost or other volunteer organizations.  Staff in some of the locations also reported that transportation issues  made it difficult for veterans to get to medical appointments or  employment-related activities. To help address potential transportation  difficulties, some providers received GPD grants to purchase vans.

To help address this issue, VA has set aside additional funding for  more full-time liaisons.", "The program office communicates with GPD providers and VA liaisons  through written guidance and teleconferences. VA provides liaisons with a  guidebook about their responsibilities and the program rules as well as a  manual prepared by NEPEC on the forms to be completed for all program  participants. To stay up-to-date on GPD program policies, liaisons  participated in monthly conference calls and also had the opportunity to  attend a conference conducted by the GPD program office in 2004. The  program office recently held a training seminar for new liaisons and also  offers training via phone. VA also gives GPD providers program  handbooks and holds monthly conference calls to discuss program rules.  In addition, some of the VA medical centers we visited held meetings with  local GPD program providers in their areas to share information.", "Despite VA\u2019s efforts, we found that some providers did not understand all  of the GPD program policies. Some misunderstandings could affect a  veteran\u2019s ability to get\u2014and a GPD provider\u2019s ability to offer\u2014care. For  instance, two providers said that VA staff told them that veterans eligible  to participate in the GPD program were also required to be eligible for VA  health care, but this is not the case. Similarly, in another location, the local  VA liaison and a provider both told us that they had received information  from the GPD program office indicating that the total lifetime length of  stay was 2 years, but the GPD program officials told us this interpretation  of the information that they provided is incorrect. Elsewhere several  providers understood the lifetime limit of three GPD stays but may not  have known or believed that waivers to this rule could be granted. They  argued that the limit could hinder a veteran\u2019s ability to participate in the  GPD program if participation involved phased care offered by separate  GPD providers, each specializing in certain phases of treatment, such as  detoxification or job preparation. Since each phase of treatment is  counted as one GPD stay, veterans may exhaust their 3-stay limit before  they have received services vital to their improved functioning. Although  VA has the authority to waive the 3-stay limit in such cases, these  providers did not seem to understand that this option was available to  them. In addition, providers were not always aware of changes in the  GPD program in a timely fashion; sometimes not at all. For example, not  all GPD providers knew in 2006 that their program\u2019s inspections would  include a review of whether they were meeting the objectives described in  their GPD grant documents.", "VA recognizes that communication to providers and liaisons needs to be  improved. In its fiscal year 2005 report, the VA Advisory Committee on  Homeless Veterans recommended that VA hold an annual conference and  that each GPD provider have an opportunity to attend at least one such  conference. The purpose of the conference would be to improve  communications, program compliance, and treatment strategies.

Independent housing comprises  apartments, rooms, or houses, while secured housing includes transitional  housing programs, halfway houses, hospitals, nursing homes, or similar  facilities.

Providers are required to establish specific measurable  objectives for each of the three program goals. To reach the housing goal,  for example, some providers we visited established savings objectives,  requiring veterans to set aside a portion of any income they receive so that  they can accumulate sufficient cash reserves to cover costs of renting a  room or apartment when they leave the program. Most providers we  visited also set outcome objectives for the percentage of veterans  expected to obtain independent housing when they left the program. For  the income goal, some providers set objectives requiring that a certain  percentage of veterans be offered or enrolled in vocational training,  develop r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, interview for jobs, or apply for entitlement benefits.

The GPD program office has since  moved to enforce the requirement that VA liaisons review GPD providers\u2019  performance when the VA team comes on-site each year to inspect the  GPD facility.

Some grant documents  also indicate that the providers planned to measure their performance, in  part by following up with veterans from 3 to 12 months after they left the  program. Some providers follow up to meet the requirements of non-VA  funding they receive. Several providers we interviewed had DOL grants  requiring them to report the employment status of veterans 3 and 6 months  after they left the DOL program. These providers were able to report  results for the veterans deemed employable who participated in both the  GPD and DOL programs. However, GPD participants who were deemed  unemployable because of their disabilities may not have been included in  the DOL program.

Furthermore,  veterans who were not immediately successful on leaving the program  nevertheless may have benefited from participating and may be able to  achieve success at a later time. To explore the long-term outcomes of  program participants, VA funded a onetime follow-up study in May 2001 to  examine the outcomes for a randomly selected sample of about   1,300 veterans spread across five geographic locations who were  participating in the GPD program and two other VA-sponsored homeless  programs.

However, more could be done to optimize VA\u2019s  investment, particularly with respect to ensuring policies and criteria are  clearly understood and consistently applied and assessing longer-term  outcomes. In enhancing communications, VA will need to identify effective  ways of sharing information with the more than 100 agency liaisons in  addition to the 300 local GPD program providers\u2014each with a potentially  different means of operating.

According to DOL, services provided include career counseling,  employment training, job-search and job-placement assistance, life-skills  development, and follow-up. Local staff from both VA\u2019s Health  Administration and Benefits Administration provide information about  available VA benefits and services. Grantees must report the number of  veterans who are still employed 6 months after job placement, whether  they are in the same or similar jobs, and the reasons why veterans who  were placed are no longer employed.

NEPEC conducted the  survey to capture information on the types of GPD programs funded.  According to NEPEC officials, the survey was used to capture information  such as program location, admissions criteria, services available, and  licensing. Because the survey was not intended to be used as a tool to  review how programs were performing, NEPEC does not conduct rigorous  internal reviews of the data collected. We conducted basic reasonableness  tests and contacted NEPEC for any clarifications or discrepancies. We  found the survey data sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "The survey was first deployed in 2003 to all agencies that were receiving  funding that year. In subsequent years, NEPEC had newly funded agencies  complete this onetime survey. A total of 281 transitional housing facilities  were included in the survey data we analyzed\u2014148 of the facilities were  surveyed in 2003, 94 in 2004, and 39 in 2005. According to NEPEC, this  represents all operational programs as of November 2005. While there  were about 300 agencies with GPD grants, some of the agencies have  multiple grants for one facility, resulting in one survey being completed for  that facility. The surveys were completed by the VA liaisons in  consultation with GPD provider staff. NEPEC officials were confident they  have achieved a 100 percent response rate. While we did not  independently verify the response rate for the survey, we concluded that it  would be at least 90 percent.", "Table 6 shows the percentage of facilities that reportedly provide the  selected services and how the services were provided. Survey respondents  were asked to identify how, if at all, services were provided and were  directed to choose only one method. It may be the case, however, that as  in some locations we visited, services were provided by more than one  method. As can be seen, the majority of GPD programs provided a  spectrum of services for veterans. However, these programs varied in how  services were provided, with some services more likely to be provided  through partnerships and others more likely to be provided in-house  directly by staff. Some of the services that were more likely to be provided  through partnerships include those that require counseling or medical- related treatment. Services primarily provided directly by GPD providers  tended to be more related to case management type activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Participant Outcomes for the Grant and Per Diem Program", "paragraphs": ["Outcomes are reported on a standard Northeast Program Evaluation  Center discharge form that must be filled out by VA staff or by GPD staff  with VA\u2019s review and sign-off when the participant leaves the program.  The form also captures information on the length and cost of stay in the  GPD, reasons the participant left the program, and any plans for follow-up  treatment for substance abuse or other problems. NEPEC officials told us  that they do not verify the data submitted to them, but they do perform  tests for completeness and internal consistency. VA\u2019s Office of Inspector  General (OIG) found that not all outcomes shown on the discharge forms  were supported by additional information in the sample of case records  that the OIG reviewed. For example, 76 percent of records included  information supporting the veterans\u2019 outcomes indicated on the form, but  about 24 percent of records lacked such support.", "Outcomes for housing and income are shown as a percentage of all  participants who left the program for any reason. However, outcomes for  self-determination in terms of improved functioning are shown as a  percentage of those veterans who had an identified problem when they  entered the program. The determination that a participant has or has not  improved may be considered somewhat subjective. The problems are  described by participants themselves to VA staff in response to a series of  questions on a standard NEPEC intake form that also includes a section  for the VA clinical staff to record their observations of the substance abuse  or mental health problems that the participants face. The intake form also  captures other characteristics of the participants, such as their military,  financial and living circumstances. VA staff are expected to complete  these forms when they first contact homeless veterans but no later than  the veterans\u2019 third day with a GPD provider and to forward the forms to  NEPEC.
