As a result, during the first decades of the program, most women became eligible for benefits as either the spouse or survivor of their Social Security-covered husbands. Today, a larger proportion of women work and earn Social Security benefits in their own right. However, the benefit structure has not significantly changed to reflect this trend, leading to concerns about its fairness for retired women and their families."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Development of Social Security\u2019s Benefit Structure", "paragraphs": ["The Social Security Act (the act) was signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in August 1935. It originally was designed to provide retirement benefits only to people in commerce and industry occupations. Workers in these occupations could receive benefits at age 65 or older if they had no earnings.", "Benefits under the original act had a strong \u201cindividual equity\u201d component\u2014that is, benefits were to go only to retired individuals who had contributed to Social Security during their working years, and individual benefit levels were to be based on lifetime earnings. Benefits were not strictly proportional to earnings, however, because there was (and still is) a larger increase in benefits for the first increment of earnings than for later earnings increments. Thus, there was also a \u201csocial adequacy\u201d component to the benefit structure.", "The original act had no provision providing monthly benefits to workers\u2019 dependents or survivors. The first Advisory Council on Social Security, believing that the family\u2014not simply the worker\u2014should be the unit protected by the act, concluded in 1938 that this was a shortcoming. In their view, the social adequacy goals of the program needed strengthening. The Council therefore recommended that benefits be extended to the wives, widows, and eligible minor children.", "The Congress in 1939 adopted the Council\u2019s recommendations and provided \u201cauxiliary\u201d benefits to wives and widows aged 65 or older, children under age 18 (but generally only if the covered worker was male), and some dependent parents of deceased covered workers. Today, spousal benefits are 50 percent of the worker\u2019s age 65 benefit and the survivor benefits are 100 percent. The auxiliary benefits were (and are) funded, not by an additional tax on married workers or a reduction in their own benefits, but from Social Security funds to which all covered workers contribute. Thus, auxiliary benefits are not \u201cearned\u201d benefits.", "When the 1939 Congress provided auxiliary benefits to wives and widows, it recognized that many married women would also be wage earners entitled to Social Security retired worker benefits in their own right. The Congress did not want to deny such women the opportunity to receive at least some spousal or survivor benefits because doing so could result in lowered benefits for working wives. The auxiliary benefits of many women, particularly those with low-paying jobs or few years of work, might be larger than the benefits the women earned from their own jobs. At the same time, however, the Congress did not want working women who were not dependent on their husbands to receive auxiliary benefits.", "The Congress\u2019 solution, seen in the act\u2019s dual entitlement provision (or limitation), was to provide that a working woman in retirement could receive benefits from two sources\u2014(1) her own retired worker benefit plus (2) any excess of her spousal or survivor benefit over her retired worker benefit. In effect, this meant that she would receive not the sum of these two benefits but either her retired worker benefit or her auxiliary benefit, whichever was higher.", "By providing benefits to people other than the workers themselves, the 1939 amendments improved the \u201csocial adequacy\u201d part of the program but, in so doing, laid the groundwork for the \u201cindividual equity\u201d concerns. Subsequent debates about the program have often been over the appropriate balance between these two, often conflicting goals. It is not easy to move the program closer to one goal without moving it away from the other.", "Since 1939, the act has been amended many times, with the changes tending to strengthen the social adequacy features of the program\u2014for example, the 1956 amendments introduced disability benefits. Other changes included expanding the types of jobs covered, adding beneficiary categories (such as benefits for disabled workers and divorced spouses), increasing benefits, introducing automatic cost of living adjustments (COLA), and changing the payroll tax rate and level of earnings subject to the payroll tax.", "Today, about 95 percent of all jobs in the United States are covered by Social Security. Workers in the program, provided they have made the necessary contributions and met other requirements, may receive retirement benefits upon reaching age 62 or disability benefits upon becoming disabled. In 1994, more than 138 million workers contributed almost $345 billion to the program, and nearly 43 million people received $317 billion in benefits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How Benefits Are Calculated", "paragraphs": ["The calculation of Social Security benefits is essentially a three-step process (see app. I for a detailed description). First, a worker\u2019s lifetime covered earnings over his or her 35 highest earnings years are calculated. Social Security uses \u201caverage indexed monthly earnings\u201d (AIME) as its measure of lifetime covered earnings.", "Second, a progressive benefit formula is applied to these lifetime earnings to determine the benefit that would be payable to the worker at age 65.This age-65 benefit is called the \u201cprimary insurance amount\u201d (PIA). Finally, the benefit is adjusted for the age at which the worker first receives the benefit. If auxiliary benefits are being calculated, a factor is applied to the PIA for the particular type of benefit, and the resulting amount is adjusted for the auxiliary beneficiary\u2019s age.", "The benefits of retired and disabled workers are based on their own PIAs. The benefits of auxiliary beneficiaries, such as those receiving spousal benefits, are normally based on the PIAs of their current or former spouses. The benefits for persons entitled to auxiliary benefits and retired worker benefits in their own right\u2014\u201cdually entitled\u201d individuals\u2014are based in part on their own PIAs and in part on those of their current or former spouses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Benefit Structure and Women", "paragraphs": ["Today, the act\u2019s benefit provisions are gender neutral. At retirement, men and women with identical Social Security earnings histories and other relevant characteristics, such as age and marital status, will receive identical earned benefits from the program. However, because women, on average, have lower lifetime earnings than men, their average Social Security benefits are smaller. In December 1994, benefits of female retired workers averaged $601 compared with $785 for male retired workers.The lower earnings for women reflected their \u201cweaker attachment\u201d to the workplace in terms of fewer years with earnings and lower wage rates for their years of employment. Also, women\u2019s benefits tend to be lower than men\u2019s because women generally begin receiving benefits at younger ages than men. The younger the age at retirement, the larger the benefit reduction.", "Because women tend to have lower earnings than men, their benefits, relative to their lifetime earnings, are likely to be higher than men\u2019s because of Social Security\u2019s progressive benefit formula. Also, because women have lower earnings than men, more women than men receive auxiliary benefits as spouses or survivors, and, thus, more women will be subject to the dual entitlement limitation on benefit amounts. Finally, women have longer life expectancies than men and will, therefore, receive Social Security benefits for a longer period of time than men, on average.As a result, the ratio of the total benefits women and men receive over their lifetimes will be higher, on average, than the ratios of their monthly benefits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To better understand the issues involved, Senator William V. Roth, Jr., asked us to (1) describe the concerns about the fairness of the benefits received by job-holding women and their families in retirement, (2) discuss how economic and demographic trends might affect the benefits of such people in the future, and (3) discuss past proposals to address these concerns.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed current and historical Social Security documents to understand the rationale for the current Social Security benefit structure; interviewed experts and researchers who have studied Social Security\u2019s treatment of women; reviewed the literature that described concerns about Social Security\u2019s treatment of women during the past 25 years and that proposed solutions to alleviate these concerns; and obtained historical evidence and available projections of the changing labor force participation and earnings levels of women.", "Most of the data we used to analyze economic and demographic trends were published or provided by the Social Security Administration (SSA), the Department of Labor\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics and Women\u2019s Bureau, and the Bureau of the Census. Because of a lack of suitable and readily available longitudinal data to analyze these trends, we relied heavily on cross-sectional data for our analysis. Using these data, we determined the likely effect of economic and demographic trends on the Social Security benefits women will receive in the future.

Because women tend to have lower lifetime earnings and longer life expectancies than men, they are more likely than men to qualify for spousal and survivor benefits and to be affected by the dual entitlement limitation. As a result, the following fairness concerns are generally viewed as women\u2019s issues, although the concerns can apply to men as well."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Couple Benefits", "paragraphs": ["One fairness concern is that a two-earner couple receives lower combined retirement benefits than a one-earner couple with identical lifetime earnings and other identical characteristics. The reason this occurs is that the two-earner couple will receive a smaller spousal benefit than the one-earner couple and, in fact, may receive no spousal benefit at all.", "Both couples receive all the retired worker benefit each partner earned through his or her covered employment. Because the benefit formula is progressive, the two-earner couple will usually receive larger total retired worker benefits than the one-earner couple.", "The one-earner couple also receives a spousal benefit (usually for the wife) based on one-half the worker\u2019s benefit. This spousal benefit is not reduced by the dual entitlement limitation because the spouse receives no retired worker benefits of her own. Thus, the one-earner couple\u2019s total benefit is 150 percent of the worker\u2019s retired worker benefit (if both first received benefits at age 65).", "The unreduced spousal benefit for the two-earner couple will be smaller than that for the one-earner couple because it is based on the benefit of the couple\u2019s primary earner, whose lifetime earnings are smaller than those of the worker in the one-earner couple. The dual entitlement limitation will further reduce, or perhaps eliminate, this smaller spousal benefit by subtracting the secondary worker\u2019s retired worker benefit from it. The total benefit of the two-earner couple will consist of the two retired worker benefits plus, perhaps, a spousal benefit supplement. The difference in spousal benefits always exceeds the difference in total retired worker benefits, so a two-earner couple always receives lower benefits than an otherwise identical one-earner couple.", "A hypothetical example can illustrate how this occurs. We assume there are two couples who begin receiving benefits in 1995 and that all four persons are aged 65. We assume that the husband in the one-earner couple has an AIME of $2,000 and that his wife had no covered earnings. In the two-earner couple, we assume each spouse has an equal AIME of $1,000, for a total of $2,000.", "In this example, the worker in the one-earner couple would receive a retired worker benefit of $939 per month and his wife, an unreduced spousal benefit of $469 per month for a total benefit of $1,408. Each worker in the two-earner couple would receive a monthly retired worker benefit of $591. Neither would be eligible for a spousal benefit because of the dual entitlement limitation. Their total benefit would be $1,182, $243 more than the retired worker benefit received by the one-earner couple but $226 less than the one-earner couple\u2019s total benefit.", "The total monthly benefit of the two-earner couple in this example is about 16 percent less than that of the one-earner couple. The reduction can be greater or smaller depending on the relative earnings of the husband and wife in the two-earner couple and the couples\u2019 total AIME. In some cases, a two-earner couple can receive total benefits that are one-third less than an otherwise identical one-earner couple\u2019s benefits.", "Figure 2.1 shows how varying distributions of earnings would affect the combined benefits of couples with a combined AIME of $2,000 (assuming that benefits always start at age 65 in 1995). At the left end of the line, the wife\u2019s share of the couple\u2019s AIME is 0 percent (the one-earner couple in our example), and the couple\u2019s total monthly benefit is $1,408. At the right end, the wife\u2019s share is 50 percent (the two-earner couple in the example), and the couple\u2019s total monthly benefit is only $1,182. The connecting line shows the monthly benefit totals for two-earner couples with various within-couple distributions of the $2,000 AIME.", "Wife's Share of $2,000 AIME The declining segment of the line represents couples whose secondary earner (the wife) is dually entitled to retired worker benefits and spousal benefits. The line declines because, as the wife\u2019s share of the couple\u2019s AIME increases, the husband\u2019s share falls. This reduces both the husband\u2019s retired worker benefit and the spousal benefit based on it. Until the wife\u2019s retired worker benefit exceeds her benefit as a spouse, the couples\u2019 total benefits will fall. Once both husband and wife are receiving retired worker benefits, the couples\u2019 total benefit will either increase (if the wife\u2019s AIME puts her on a higher tier of the benefit formula than her husband [see app. I]) or remain constant (if both partners are on the same tier)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Survivor Benefits", "paragraphs": ["A second concern is that the disparity in the monthly benefit received by one-earner and two-earner couples with identical lifetime earnings can be even greater for the survivors of these couples. The survivor of a couple is entitled to the higher of the two retired worker benefits earned by the couple before the death of one partner. Because women tend to outlive their husbands, they are the ones most often affected.", "The surviving member of a one-earner couple receives about 67 percent of the couple\u2019s total monthly benefit when both were alive. In essence, the retired worker benefit continues, and the spousal benefit ends.", "The surviving member of a two-earner couple can receive as much as 67 percent of the couple\u2019s total monthly benefit (if the secondary earner was dually entitled) or as little as 50 percent (if each earner had identical lifetime earnings). Because two-earner couples have lower couple benefits than identical one-earner couples, the survivors of two-earner couples always receive lower survivor benefits. These survivors receive only the higher of the two retired worker benefits the couple earned. The retired worker benefit of the secondary earner and any spousal supplement he or she might have received as a dually entitled beneficiary are eliminated. As a result, the survivor of a two-earner couple can receive benefits that are as low as one-half those received by the survivor of an identical one-earner couple.", "Continuing our hypothetical example, the survivor of the one-earner couple would receive $939 (two-thirds of the couple\u2019s $1,408 monthly benefit) as shown in figure 2.2. The survivor of the two-earner couple in which the husband and wife had identical lifetime earnings would receive only $591 (half the $1,182 the couple received while both were alive). The benefits of the survivor of our two-earner couple are 37 percent less than those of the one-earner couple survivor, even though both couples had identical lifetime earnings.", "As seen in the figure, the survivor benefit of a two-earner couple whose secondary earner was dually entitled while both partners were alive will receive a benefit one-third smaller than the couple\u2019s total benefit while both were alive. Once the secondary earner is no longer dually entitled, the percentage reduction will increase because the secondary earner\u2019s retired worker benefit, which now exceeds the spousal benefit based on the primary earner\u2019s benefit, is eliminated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Benefits for Married Working Women", "paragraphs": ["A third concern is that a married person (usually the wife) may work and pay Social Security taxes only to discover at retirement that she is entitled to a spousal benefit that is larger than the retired worker benefit she earned in her own right. Because the act\u2019s dual entitlement limitation effectively limits a beneficiary to the larger of these benefits, her contributions do not result in a larger benefit at retirement. It is sometimes argued that such a limitation is unfair because it does not sufficiently reward a person for years of contributions.", "The first bar in figure 2.3 (\u201cWorking Wife\u201d) illustrates this point. In this figure, we assume that the wife had earned a retired worker benefit of $250. Her husband, however, earned a benefit of $1,000, making her eligible for a $500 spousal benefit. She receives a dually entitled benefit of $500\u2014her own $250 retired worker benefit and the $250 difference between it and her full spousal benefit. Had she never worked, she still would have been eligible for a spousal benefit of $500 (the second bar in the figure )."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Benefits for Working and Nonworking Individuals", "paragraphs": ["Related concerns have also been raised about the relative benefits that can be received by those who worked and contributed to the program versus those who receive benefits solely as spouses or survivors and about the benefits that can be received by those who are dually entitled versus those who are not. The first issue is that workers, in spite of the taxes they pay to Social Security, may not receive higher benefits in retirement than nonworkers who paid no such taxes. The second is that some workers may receive benefits that are smaller than those received by people having lower lifetime earnings and making lower contributions to the program. These concerns are most apparent when comparing benefits received by single workers with those received by the lower earner in a married couple.", "These issues are illustrated in figure 2.4. \u201cPerson 1\u201d has a monthly retired worker benefit of $500 and is not dually entitled. \u201cPerson 2\u201d has lower lifetime earnings and a lower retired worker benefit ($400 per month) but is a dually entitled spouse and receives a total monthly benefit of $550. \u201cPerson 3\u201d never worked and receives no retired worker benefit, but her spouse was a high earner. Her spousal benefit is $575 per month.", "Spouse or Survivor Benefit Persons 1 and 3 illustrate the first concern, that workers may receive smaller benefits than nonworkers. For this to occur, the covered earnings of the nonworker\u2019s spouse must be more than twice as large as the worker\u2019s covered earnings.", "Persons 1 and 2 illustrate the second concern. Person 1 had larger lifetime earnings and a larger retired worker benefit than person 2. However, he had a smaller total benefit because person 2 had a relatively high-earning spouse. As an extreme example, in December 1994, several thousand dually entitled spouses had monthly benefits in excess of $900 per month. This is a larger monthly benefit than was received by more than three-quarters of all retired worker beneficiaries in that month.", "These concerns can intensify when a couple\u2019s primary earner dies. The survivor then becomes eligible for the deceased\u2019s full retired worker benefit.

By 1993, almost 60 percent of all women were in the labor force and married women were slightly more likely than other women to be working.", "The growth in women\u2019s labor force participation is even more dramatic for women in their prime earning years\u2014ages 25 to 54. The labor force participation rate for these women increased from 42 percent in 1960 to 75 percent in 1993. The rates for married women within this age range increased even more rapidly.", "This increased labor force participation reflects not only a higher proportion of women working but also women staying in the labor force for longer periods. According to one study, recent generations of married women have much stronger attachments to the labor force at a given age than older generations did. For example, married women born from 1945 to 1949 were three times more likely to have worked 17 or more of the 20 years between ages 22 and 41 than were married women born from 1930 to 1934 (34 percent versus 11 percent).", "The stronger attachment to the labor force of recent generations of women is also demonstrated by the increasing percentage of mothers in the labor force, especially those with young children (table 3.2), and by the increasing percentage of women who have gained fully insured status under Social Security (table 3.3).", "The implication of this strong growth in women\u2019s participation rates is that a higher percentage of women retiring in the future will be fully insured and qualify for benefits based on their own work records. Also, they will have fewer years with no earnings in their work histories when they apply for benefits than do women retiring today.

Since 1980, women\u2019s earnings have risen to about 70 percent of men\u2019s. This changing relationship will increase women\u2019s retired worker benefits relative to those for men, but only slowly because benefits are based on average earnings over the workers\u2019 entire lifetimes.", "Social Security benefits are based on earnings in covered employment rather than on all earnings. Social Security covered earnings data show that younger women have higher median covered earnings relative to men their own age than do older women. Relative covered earnings fall as women age, reach a low in the women\u2019s early 30s when many have left the labor force or reduced their hours of work to care for children, and then rise slowly. This \u201cU-shaped\u201d relative earnings profile (relative earnings fall with age and then increase) is flatter for more recent generations of women, reflecting their tendency to have children later in life than older generations and to return to work sooner after childbirth.

In families where both the husband and wife have earnings (about 60 percent of all married family households in 1992), the percentage in which the wife\u2019s earnings exceed the husband\u2019s increased from 15.9 percent to 22.3 percent between 1981 and 1993.

The distinction is important because Social Security benefits are based on lifetime earnings.", "The ratio of a wife\u2019s lifetime earnings to those of her husband that moves the wife from being dually entitled to receiving retired worker benefits is not a constant.

For comparative purposes, it also shows the AIME equal to one-third of the husband\u2019s AIME (worker AIME/3). To receive a benefit based only on her own earnings, this wife needs an AIME as high as 50 percent of her husband\u2019s (if his AIME is less than about $387) or as low as about 26.6 percent (if his AIME is about $1,500).

Because (1) the survivor of a one-earner couple receives approximately two-thirds of the couple\u2019s total benefits when both husband and wife were alive, (2) the survivor of a two-earner couple can receive a smaller portion, as low as one-half, and (3) two-earner couples have smaller total benefits to begin with than one-earner couples with the same total lifetime earnings, we anticipate that there could be increased demands that benefits for survivors of like-earning couples be equalized.", "Third, the anticipated growth in the percentage of women receiving only retired worker benefits could reduce or increase the concern that married women receive little or no incremental return for the payroll taxes they pay. These women will receive the same benefit and the same return on their Social Security taxes as other retired worker beneficiaries with the same earnings history.

In addition, if auxiliary benefits are to be based on this PIA, then the appropriate auxiliary benefit adjustment factor must be applied.", "The AIME calculation requires indexing the worker\u2019s covered earnings for each year before he or she attains age 60. Indexing is accomplished by dividing the average wage in the national economy in the year the beneficiary turned age 60 by the average wage for an earlier year and multiplying the resulting amount by the beneficiary\u2019s covered earnings for that earlier year. This is done for each year the beneficiary had earnings after 1950 and before age 60. Earnings at age 60 or older are entered into the AIME calculation at their nominal (unindexed) amount. The AIME is calculated by summing the 35 years of highest indexed earnings and dividing by 420, the number of months in 35 years.", "Once the AIME is determined, a benefit formula is applied to determine the beneficiary\u2019s PIA. The benefit formula has three tiers\u201490 percent, 32 percent, and 15 percent. The AIME levels at which one moves from one tier to the next are known as bend points. The bend points are wage-adjusted annually and each year\u2019s bend points apply only to those attaining age 62 (or becoming disabled or dying before age 62) in a particular year. In 1996, these bend points are $437 and $2,635.", "Thus in 1996, the PIA for a 62-year-old worker would be 90 percent of his or her AIME if the AIME was $437 or less; $393.30 (that is, 90 percent of $437) plus 32 percent of the AIME in excess of $437 if his or her AIME was between $437 and $2,635; and $1,096.66 (that is, 90 percent of $437 plus 32 percent of $2,198 ) plus 15 percent of the AIME in excess of $2,635, if his or her AIME exceeded $2,567. For example, a 62-year-old worker with an AIME of $400 would have the entire amount valued at the 90-percent level and his or her PIA would be $360 (that is, 90 percent of $400). A worker of similar age with an AIME of $1,000 would have $437 valued at the 90-percent level and the remaining $563 valued at the 32-percent level for a PIA of $573 ($437 x 0.9 + $563 x 0.32 = $573) (see fig.I.1).", "The PIA is increased by any cost of living adjustments (COLA) that have occurred since the worker first became eligible for benefits (this will be age 62 for retired worker beneficiaries). Thus, someone who waits until age 65 to claim retired worker benefits will use the benefit formula in place when he or she was 62 and his or her PIA will be increased by all COLAs provided beginning with the year he or she attained age 62.", "The PIA is the figure from which almost all benefit amounts for the worker and his or her dependents or survivors are derived.

If retired worker benefits are first taken before age 65, the monthly benefit will be the PIA reduced by five-ninths of 1 percent for each month benefits are taken early. If benefits are first taken after age 65 but before age 70, the monthly benefit usually will be the PIA increased by the delayed retirement credit (DRC).

For example, in 1992 almost one in four unmarried women aged 75 or older was poor (had an income below the poverty line) and nearly two in five were poor or near poor (had incomes below 125 percent of the poverty line). In contrast, only about one in four unmarried men aged 75 or older was poor or near poor. Elderly married couples were less likely than unmarried men to be poor or near poor.", "The problem these women have is one of low incomes, not necessarily one of low Social Security benefits. Most widows already receive Social Security benefits based on their deceased husbands\u2019 work records and these benefits are indexed to offset the effects of inflation, thus maintaining the benefits\u2019 purchasing power over time. Other sources of income, such as private pensions and income from assets, are rarely indexed and sometimes disappear upon the death of the spouse who \u201cowned\u201d them.", "To improve income adequacy for these women, some advocate increasing Social Security survivor benefits. Increasing Social Security benefits for widows (who account for more than 80 percent of the unmarried women aged 65 and older living in poverty) and elderly divorced spouses (the elderly group with the highest poverty rate) is seen as a relatively direct and focused way of addressing this problem. Others believe that Social Security is doing the job it was intended to do and that any income improvement for these women should come from a different program such as the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, which is designed to assist the aged, blind, and disabled who have low incomes and low levels of assets.", "If it is decided that Social Security benefits should be increased to improve the incomes of the very elderly, the proposals listed below would accomplish this.

As currently structured, benefits to auxiliary beneficiaries are not earned benefits. Married workers did not pay a higher payroll tax than unmarried workers to provide the funding for auxiliary benefits. Nor are their retired worker or disabled worker benefits reduced to provide funding for such benefits. Instead, these auxiliary benefits are transfers to the auxiliaries from the program and are paid for by a combination of higher taxes on all workers than would be necessary and lower benefits for all retired and disabled beneficiaries than could be provided if these auxiliary benefits were not available.", "Another major source of retirement income, pensions, does not embody an adequacy goal. Like Social Security, pension plans very often pay benefits in the form of a life annuity; that is, a benefit that is paid to the retiree as long as he or she lives. Spousal benefits are rarely, if ever, provided by pension plans and survivor benefits are usually provided only under a joint and survivor option.", "The joint and survivor option reduces a retired worker\u2019s benefit and, in the event of his or her death, pays an annuity for the life of his or her designated survivor. The annuity value of the joint and survivor option must be as great as the annuity value of the single life option covering the retired worker alone. However, many pension plans allow the joint and survivor option to be waived, in which case, the survivor would not receive an annuity upon the death of the worker.", "If Social Security auxiliary benefits were restructured following the joint and survivor model, spousal benefits would not be paid. The benefits of all married retired worker and disabled worker beneficiaries would be reduced to provide survivor benefits to their spouses in the event of the beneficiaries\u2019 deaths. Thus, all married couples, especially one-earner couples and two-earner couples in which the lower earner is dually entitled, would receive lower benefits than they would receive under current law. However, the cost savings from eliminating the spousal benefit and reducing the transfers inherent for many in current survivor benefits could be used to increase retired worker and disabled worker benefits.", "The survivor would receive his or her own retired worker benefit (which also would have been reduced to provide a survivor benefit in the event he or she died before his or her spouse) plus the survivor benefit from his or her deceased spouse.
