These include both unintentional and intentional threats, and may come in the form of targeted or untargeted attacks from criminal groups, hackers, disgruntled employees, nations, or terrorists. The interconnectivity between information systems, the Internet, and other infrastructures can amplify the impact of these threats, potentially affecting the operations of critical infrastructures, the security of sensitive information, and the flow of commerce. Moreover, the electricity grid\u0092s reliance on IT systems and networks exposes it to potential and known cybersecurity vulnerabilities, which could be exploited by attackers. The potential impact of such attacks has been illustrated by a number of recently reported incidents and can include fraudulent activities, damage to electricity control systems, power outages, and failures in safety equipment.", "To address such concerns, multiple entities have taken steps to help secure the electricity grid, including the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the Departments of Homeland Security and Energy.

Once electricity is generated\u2014whether by burning fossil fuels; through  nuclear fission; or by harnessing wind, solar, geothermal, or hydro  energy\u2014it is generally sent through high-voltage, high-capacity  transmission lines to local electricity distributors. Once there, electricity is  transformed into a lower voltage and sent through local distribution lines  for consumption by industrial plants, businesses, and residential  consumers. Because electric energy is generated and consumed almost  instantaneously, the operation of an electric power system requires that a  system operator constantly balance the generation and consumption of  power.", "Utilities own and operate electricity assets, which may include generation  plants, transmission lines, distribution lines, and substations\u2014structures  often seen in residential and commercial areas that contain technical  equipment such as switches and transformers to ensure smooth, safe  flow of current and regulate voltage. Utilities may be owned by investors,  municipalities, and individuals (as in cooperative utilities). System  operators\u2014sometimes affiliated with a particular utility or sometimes  independent and responsible for multiple utility areas\u2014manage the  electricity flows. These system operators manage and control the  generation, transmission, and distribution of electric power using control  systems\u2014IT- and network-based systems that monitor and control  sensitive processes and physical functions, including opening and closing  circuit breakers.

We recommended that NIST  finalize its plan and schedule for incorporating missing elements, and  NIST officials agreed. We are currently working with officials to determine  the status of their efforts to address these recommendations.", "FERC also has taken several actions to help secure the electricity grid.  For example, it reviewed and approved NERC\u2019s eight critical  infrastructure protection standards in 2008. Since then, in its role of  overseeing the development of reliability standards, the commission has  directed NERC to make numerous changes to standards to improve  cybersecurity protections. However, according to the FERC Chairman\u2019s  February 2012 letter in response to our report on electricity grid  modernization, many of the outstanding directives have not been  incorporated into the latest versions of the standards. The Chairman  added that the commission would continue to work with NERC to  incorporate the directives. In addition, FERC has authorized NERC to  enforce mandatory reliability standards for the bulk power system, while  retaining its authority to enforce the same standards and assess penalties  for violations. We reported in January 2011 that FERC also had begun  reviewing initial smart grid standards identified as part of NIST efforts.

Under this role, the Department\u2019s National Cyber Security  Division\u2019s Control Systems Security Program has issued recommended  practices to reduce risks to industrial control systems within and across all  critical infrastructure and key resources sectors, including the electricity  subsector. For example, in April 2011, the program issued the Catalog of  Control Systems Security: Recommendations for Standards Developers,  which is intended to provide a detailed listing of recommended controls  from several standards related to control systems. The program also  manages and operates the Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency  Response Team to respond to and analyze control-systems-related  incidents, provide onsite support for incident response and forensic  analysis, provide situational awareness in the form of actionable  intelligence, and share and coordinate vulnerability information and threat  analysis through information products and alerts.

As mentioned above, under the  Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, FERC is responsible  for adopting cybersecurity and other standards that it deems  necessary to ensure smart grid functionality and interoperability.  However, FERC had not developed an approach coordinated with  other regulators to monitor, at a high level, the extent to which  industry will follow the voluntary smart grid standards it adopts. There  had been initial efforts by regulators to share views, through, for  example, a collaborative dialogue between FERC and the National  Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, which had discussed  the standards-setting process in general terms. Nevertheless,  according to officials from FERC and the National Association of  Regulatory Utility Commissioners, FERC and the state public utility  commissions had not established a joint approach for monitoring how  widely voluntary smart grid standards are followed in the electricity  industry or developed strategies for addressing any gaps. Moreover,  FERC had not coordinated in such a way with groups representing  public power or cooperative utilities, which are not routinely subject to  FERC\u2019s or the states\u2019 regulatory jurisdiction for rate setting. We noted  that without a good understanding of whether utilities and  manufacturers are following smart grid standards, it would be difficult  for FERC and other regulators to know whether a voluntary approach  to standards setting is effective or if changes are needed.", "Aspects of the current regulatory environment made it difficult to  ensure the cybersecurity of smart grid systems. In particular,  jurisdictional issues and the difficulties associated with responding to  continually evolving cyber threats were a key regulatory challenge to  ensuring the cybersecurity of smart grid systems as they are  deployed. Regarding jurisdiction, experts we spoke with expressed  concern that there was a lack of clarity about the division of  responsibility between federal and state regulators, particularly  regarding cybersecurity. While jurisdictional responsibility has  historically been determined by whether a technology is located on  the transmission or distribution system, experts raised concerns that  smart grid technology may blur these lines. For example, devices  such as smart meters deployed on parts of the grid traditionally  subject to state jurisdiction could, in the aggregate, have an impact on  those parts of the grid that federal regulators are responsible for\u2014 namely the reliability of the transmission system.", "There was also concern about the ability of regulatory bodies to  respond to evolving cybersecurity threats. For example, one expert  questioned the ability of government agencies to adapt to rapidly  evolving threats, while another highlighted the need for regulations to  be capable of responding to the evolving cybersecurity issues. In  addition, our experts expressed concern with agencies developing  regulations in the future that are overly specific in their requirements,  such as those specifying the use of a particular product or technology.  Consequently, unless steps are taken to mitigate these challenges,  regulations may not be fully effective in protecting smart grid  technology from cybersecurity threats.", "Utilities were focusing on regulatory compliance instead of  comprehensive security. The existing federal and state regulatory  environment creates a culture within the utility industry of focusing on  compliance with cybersecurity requirements, instead of a culture  focused on achieving comprehensive and effective cybersecurity.  Specifically, experts told us that utilities focus on achieving minimum  regulatory requirements rather than designing a comprehensive  approach to system security. In addition, one expert stated that  security requirements are inherently incomplete, and having a culture  that views the security problem as being solved once those  requirements are met will leave an organization vulnerable to cyber  attack. Consequently, without a comprehensive approach to security,  utilities leave themselves open to unnecessary risk.", "There was a lack of security features built into smart grid systems.", "Security features are not consistently built into smart grid devices. For  example, experts told us that certain currently available smart meters  had not been designed with a strong security architecture and lacked  important security features, including event logging and forensics  capabilities that are needed to detect and analyze attacks. In addition,  our experts stated that smart grid home area networks\u2014used for  managing the electricity usage of appliances and other devices in the  home\u2014did not have adequate security built in, thus increasing their  vulnerability to attack. Without securely designed smart grid systems,  utilities may lack the capability to detect and analyze attacks,  increasing the risk that attacks will succeed and utilities will be unable  to prevent them from recurring.", "The electricity industry did not have an effective mechanism for  sharing information on cybersecurity and other issues. The electricity  industry lacked an effective mechanism to disclose information about  cybersecurity vulnerabilities, incidents, threats, lessons learned, and  best practices in the industry. For example, our experts stated that  while the electricity industry has an information sharing center, it did  not fully address these information needs. In addition, President  Obama\u2019s May 2009 cyberspace policy review also identified  challenges related to cybersecurity information sharing within the  electric and other critical infrastructure sectors and issued  recommendations to address them. According to our experts,  information regarding incidents such as both unsuccessful and  successful attacks must be able to be shared in a safe and secure  way to avoid publicly revealing the reported organization and  penalizing entities actively engaged in corrective action. Such  information sharing across the industry could provide important  information regarding the level of attempted cyber attacks and their  methods, which could help grid operators better defend against them.  If the industry pursued this end, it could draw upon the practices and  approaches of other industries when designing an industry-led  approach to cybersecurity information sharing. Without quality  processes for information sharing, utilities will not have the information  needed to adequately protect their assets against attackers.", "The electricity industry did not have metrics for evaluating  cybersecurity. The electricity industry was also challenged by a lack of  cybersecurity metrics, making it difficult to measure the extent to  which investments in cybersecurity improve the security of smart grid  systems. Experts noted that while such metrics are difficult to  develop, they could help compare the effectiveness of competing  solutions and determine what mix of solutions combine to make the  most secure system. Furthermore, our experts said that having  metrics would help utilities develop a business case for cybersecurity  by helping to show the return on a particular investment. Until such  metrics are developed, there is increased risk that utilities will not  invest in security in a cost-effective manner, or have the information  needed to make informed decisions on their cybersecurity  investments.", "To address these challenges, we made recommendations in our January  2011 report. To improve coordination among regulators and help  Congress better assess the effectiveness of the voluntary smart grid  standards process, we recommended that the Chairman of FERC  develop an approach to coordinate with state regulators and with groups  that represent utilities subject to less FERC and state regulation to (1)  periodically evaluate the extent to which utilities and manufacturers are  following voluntary interoperability and cybersecurity standards and (2)  develop strategies for addressing any gaps in compliance with standards  that are identified as a result of this evaluation. We also recommended  that FERC, working with NERC as appropriate, assess whether  commission efforts should address any of the cybersecurity challenges  identified in our report. FERC agreed with these recommendations.", "Although FERC agreed with these recommendations, they have not yet  been implemented. According to the FERC Chairman, given the  continuing evolution of standards and the lack of sufficient consensus for  regulatory adoption, commission staff believe that coordinated monitoring  of compliance with standards would be premature at this time, and that  this may change as new standards are developed and deployed in  industry. We believe that it is still important for FERC to improve  coordination among regulators and that consensus is reached on  standards. We will continue to monitor the status of its efforts to address  these recommendations.", "In summary, the evolving and growing threat from cyber-based attacks  highlights the importance of securing the electricity industry\u2019s systems  and networks. A successful attack could result in widespread power  outages, significant monetary costs, damage to property, and loss of life.  The roles of NERC and FERC remain critical in approving and  disseminating cybersecurity guidance and enforcing standards, as  appropriate. Moreover, more needs to be done to meet challenges facing  the industry in enhancing security, particularly as the generation,  transmission, and distribution of electricity comes to rely more on  emerging and sophisticated technology.", "Chairman Bingaman, Ranking Member Murkowski, and Members of the  Committee, this concludes my statement.
