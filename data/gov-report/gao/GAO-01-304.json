In May 1999, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 1833, which contained these pay amendments. In August 1999, the Senate passed another version of H.R. 1833, which did not contain the pay provisions. Similar provisions were introduced, but not passed, in the 105th Congress, and such provisions may be reintroduced in the 107th Congress.

Section 123 (b) would change the times and reduce the number of hours in a day that Customs officers could earn night differential pay. This section, as discussed in more detail in table 3 below, would replace the current \u201cmajority of hours\u201d provision, which allows night differential pay for shifts starting as early as 12 noon and as late as 3 a.m. Instead, section 123 (b) would limit night differential pay to hours worked between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. and on a 12 midnight-to-8 a.m. shift.", "Section 121 would change the way the annual overtime and premium pay (Sunday, holiday, and night differential pay) cap is calculated. It would remove premium pay, including night differential pay, from the annual pay cap that Customs officers cannot exceed. Table 3 describes and compares current law with proposed changes to night differential pay and the annual pay cap. As noted in table 3, section 123 (b) would eliminate the \u201cmajority of hours\u201d provision for night differential pay.

However, to a lesser extent, it would also increase the number of night differential hours available for a few morning shifts. Generally, eliminating the \u201cmajority of hours\u201d provision would have the effect of reducing Customs officers\u2019 pay.", "An example of how the elimination of the majority of hours provision would decrease the number of available night differential hours is as follows: If a Customs officer is scheduled to work a shift that starts at 12 noon and ends at 8 p.m., 5 of the 8 hours of that shift (the majority of hours) occur between 3 p.m. and 12 midnight. As such, because the majority of hours worked falls within the prescribed hours (3 p.m. to 12 midnight) under current law, the Customs officer would earn night differential pay at 15 percent of the base hourly rate for the entire 8-hour shift. Under proposed pay changes in H.R. 1833, the officer working the 12 noon-to-8 p.m. shift would earn night differential pay at 15 percent of the base hourly rate only for the 2 hours worked between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. In short, the Customs officer would have 6 fewer hours subject to night differential pay under the proposed changes. \u201cFinally, the Committee recognizes the adverse impact on the quality of life of Customs officials  who are required to work regularly scheduled shifts at night or on Sundays and holidays. Accordingly, the bill provides for shift differential compensation at levels substantially greater than applied generally to other Federal employees for such regularly scheduled work.\u201d (H.R.

These six shifts accounted for 82 percent of the night differential pay in fiscal year 1999 (see table 10 in app. I).

Many of them shared the NTEU national president\u2019s reasons for opposing section 123 (b). However, other Customs field managers and supervisors we interviewed supported this provision. One CMC director said that the current law is not fair because hours worked before 6:00 p.m. are not inconvenient to Customs officers and therefore they should not receive night differential pay. In addition, one port director commented that officers who earn premium pay would not be severely impacted by this provision. He said that they could work more overtime to make up the difference in pay lost due to changes in the premium pay policy.", "Regardless of whether they expressed support or opposition, many of the Customs and NTEU officials and officers we interviewed commented that section 123 (b), in particular, would have a significantly adverse effect on morale and would cause problems in staffing their ports\u2019 night shifts because it would greatly decrease officers\u2019 night differential pay.

If an officer worked a shift and was paid night differential for it, the transaction code would be different from another shift where, for example, the officer was on annual leave and received night differential pay.", "Using these transaction codes, we calculated the amount of night differential pay received for every shift that received it. Then, we estimated the amount of night differential pay that would have been received for these same shifts had sections 123 (a) or (b) of H.R. 1833 (or both) been in effect in fiscal year 1999, and we calculated the difference between them. These differences were totaled for all the officers at each port and aggregated by officer to determine how much each officer would have gained or lost over the entire fiscal year.", "Further, since night differential pay is given for certain shifts and the proposed legislation changes the rules for which shifts qualify to receive night differential pay, we also aggregated the existing night differential pay amounts and proposed night differential amounts by shift, to understand which shifts would be most affected by the proposed changes. A full discussion of the results of these analyses at each of the five ports can be found in appendixes II-VI.", "We determined how much increased or decreased night differential pay Customs officers would have received if section 123 (a) alone was in effect, if section 123 (b) alone was in effect, and if both sections were in effect. It is important to note, here, that the effect of these sections together is not just the sum of the effect of each section. For example, under current law, if an officer worked a regularly scheduled shift from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m., the officer would receive 8 hours of night differential pay for days on leave. If section 123 (a) alone was in effect, the officer would receive no night differential pay when taking leave, thus losing 8 hours of night differential pay on each leave day. However, if section 123 (b) alone was in effect, the officer on a leave day would receive 3 hours of night differential pay for the hours between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m., losing 5 hours of night differential pay. In summary, under section 123 (a) alone, the officer would lose 8 hours of night differential pay on leave days. Under section 123 (b) alone the officer would lose 5 hours of night differential pay on leave days. However, if both sections (a) and (b) were in effect, the officer would only lose 8 hours of night differential pay while on leave, not 13 hours. Section 123 (b) would not have an effect on leave days if section 123 (a) was in effect. Therefore, the sum of the effects of each section alone may be larger than the effect of both sections being in effect.", "To assess the general reliability of COSS, we reviewed the data for shifts that officers worked and the amount of night differential pay they earned. With few exceptions, the start and stop times and the amount of night differential pay earned were consistent with existing requirements. We also obtained information from Customs about COSS internal controls and data reliability. On the basis of responses to a list of our questions about data reliability, Customs seems to have a number of steps and quality control procedures in place to ensure the reliability of COSS data.", "Finally, while patterns of hours worked in future years may change, and our five selected ports are not representative of all ports, our analysis is an indicator of the changes that could occur in pay if provisions such as 123 (a) and (b) were enacted. However, if scheduling patterns at the ports changed or if the proposed legislation would change the way ports scheduled shifts, the effects could be very different from the data presented here."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Determining Customs and NTEU\u2019s Views on Proposed Changes in Officers\u2019 Pay", "paragraphs": ["Customs headquarters\u2019 officials were reluctant to provide written comments on the premium pay provisions in H.R. 1833, including those pertaining to night differential pay, apparently in view of the sensitivity of the subject.
