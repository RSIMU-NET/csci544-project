This coordinated  approach includes developing national guidelines and standards and  monitoring and assessing preparedness against those standards to  effectively manage risk. The National Strategy for Homeland Security  (National Strategy), released in 2002 following the proposal for DHS,  emphasized a shared national responsibility for security involving close  cooperation among all levels of government and acknowledged the  complexity of developing a coordinated approach within our federal  system of government and among a broad range of organizations and  institutions involved in homeland security. The national strategy  highlighted the challenge of developing complementary systems that avoid  unintended duplication and increase collaboration and coordination so  that public and private resources are better aligned for homeland security.  The national strategy established a framework for this approach by  identifying critical mission areas with intergovernmental initiatives in each  area. For example, the strategy identified such initiatives as modifying  federal grant requirements and consolidating funding sources to state and  local governments. The strategy further recognized the importance of  assessing the capability of state and local governments, developing plans,  and establishing standards and performance measures to achieve national  preparedness goals.", "Recent reports by independent research organizations have highlighted  the same issues of the need for intergovernmental coordination, planning,  and assessment. For example, the fifth annual report of the Advisory Panel  to Assess Domestic Response Capabilities for Terrorism Involving  Weapons of Mass Destruction (the Gilmore Commission) also emphasizes  the importance of a comprehensive, collaborative approach to improve the  nation\u2019s preparedness. The report states that there is a need for a  coordinated system for the development, delivery, and administration of  programs that engage a broad range of stakeholders. The Gilmore  Commission notes that preparedness for combating terrorism requires  measurable demonstrated capacity by communities, states, and the private  sector to respond to threats with well-planned, well-coordinated, and  effective efforts by all participants. The Gilmore Commission recommends  a comprehensive process for establishing training and exercise standards  for responders that includes state and local response organizations on an  ongoing basis. The National Academy of Public Administration\u2019s recent  panel report also notes the importance of coordinated and integrated  efforts at all levels of government and in the private sector to develop a  national approach to homeland security. Regarding assessment, the report  recommends establishing national standards in selected areas and  developing impact and outcome measures for those standards.", "The creation of DHS was an initial step toward reorganizing the federal  government to respond to some of the intergovernmental challenges  identified in the national strategy.  The reorganization consolidated   22 agencies with responsibility for domestic preparedness functions to,  among other things, enhance the ability of the nation\u2019s police, fire, and  other first responders to respond to terrorism and other emergencies  through grants. Many aspects of DHS\u2019s success depend on its maintaining  and enhancing working relationships within the intergovernmental system  as the department relies on state and local governments to accomplish its  mission. The Homeland Security Act contains provisions intended to  foster coordination among levels of government, such as the creation of  the Office of State and Local Government Coordination and ONCRC.", "The Homeland Security Act established ONCRC within DHS to oversee  and coordinate federal programs for, and relationships with, state, local,  and regional authorities in the National Capital Region.

In another example, four nearby  jurisdictions allocated grant funds on hazardous response vehicles or  hazardous materials supplies that reflected costs of $155,289 for one  jurisdiction\u2019s rapid hazmat unit, $355,000 for a neighboring jurisdiction\u2019s  hazardous materials response vehicle, $550,000 for a jurisdiction\u2019s fire and  rescue hazmat unit vehicle, and $115,246 for a jurisdiction\u2019s hazardous  materials supplies. While such purchases might not be duplicative,  discussions among neighboring jurisdictions could have facilitated a plan  and determined whether these purchases were necessary or whether the  equipment purchased could be shared among the jurisdictions, thereby  freeing up grant dollars for other needed, equipment to create greater  combined capacity within the region. Maximizing the use of resources  entails avoiding unnecessary duplication wherever possible. This requires  some discussion and general agreement on priorities, roles, and  responsibilities among the jurisdictions.

ONCRC could not provide a  complete list of grants allocated to the NCR as a whole, and the state  emergency management agencies did not provide complete lists of grants  for NCR jurisdictions within their respective states. For example, the  Maryland Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) provided data on the  federal grants for Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s counties that were  allocated through the state.

The challenges faced  in NCR\uf8e7 a lack of performance standards; baseline information on  preparedness and threat and risk scenarios, plans based on those tools,  and reliable data to report on the status of initiatives\uf8e7are fundamental  obstacles in achieving desired levels of preparedness.

It is also difficult to target  funding in a way that ensures it is used for goods and services that  enhance preparedness and response without current threat information or  scenarios and standards that reflect performance goals for preparedness  and response. The approach taken in planning for the use of the UASI  funds, with its emphasis on regional allocations, is a step toward improved  coordination that could provide a more rational and effective method for  enhancing emergency preparedness within NCR.
