GAO was asked to assess the extent to which FCC has (1) effectively implemented appropriate information security controls for the initial components of the ESN project, and (2) implemented appropriate procedures to manage and oversee its ESN project. To do so, GAO determined the effectiveness of ESN security controls by evaluating control configurations and identifying management controls; and determined how FCC applied them to the ESN project by analyzing documentation and interviewing commission officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) did not effectively implement appropriate information security controls in the initial components of the Enhanced Secured Network (ESN) project. Although FCC took steps to enhance its ability to control and monitor its network for security threats, weaknesses identified in the commission's deployment of components of the ESN project as of August 2012 resulted in unnecessary risk that sensitive information could be disclosed, modified, or obtained without authorization. This occurred, in part, because FCC did not fully implement key information security activities during the development and deployment of the initial components of the project. While FCC policy is to integrate security risk management into system life-cycle management activities, the commission instead deployed the initial components of the ESN project without, among other things, first selecting and documenting the security controls, assessing the controls, or authorizing the system to operate. As a result of these deficiencies, FCC's information remained at unnecessary risk of inadvertent or deliberate misuse, improper disclosure, or destruction. Further, addressing these deficiencies could require costly and timeconsuming rework.", "FCC's efforts to effectively manage the ESN project were hindered by its inconsistent implementation of procedures for estimating costs, developing and maintaining an integrated schedule, managing project risks, and conducting oversight. If not addressed, these weaknesses could pose challenges for the commission to achieve the project's goal of improved security. Specifically, FCC", "had not developed a reliable life cycle cost estimate for ESN that includes all implementation costs;", "did not, in its project schedule, adequately identify the sequence in which activities must occur, ensure that detailed activities were traceable to higherlevel activities, or establish a baseline schedule;", "documented and managed some risks to project success, but its prime contractor did not identify any project risks until after the deployment of the initial components of the ESN project had begun; and", "had not included the ESN project in its processes for conducting regular oversight of information technology projects.", "According to FCC officials, a key reason that they had not fully applied their policies or widely accepted best practices for security risk management and project management is because the ESN project was an emergency project and, therefore, needed to be initiated quickly. However, while GAO agrees that the security threat makes implementation urgent, it does not negate the need to perform key security risk management activities. Unless FCC more effectively implements its IT security policies and improves its project management practices and effectively applies them to the ESN project, unnecessary risk exists that the project may not succeed in its purpose of effectively protecting the commission's systems and information."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making seven recommendations to the FCC to implement management controls to help ensure that ESN meets its objective of securing FCC's systems and information.

FCC did not  establish a reliable schedule for the ESN project. The project  schedule consisted of multiple schedules that were not always fully  integrated. For example, one schedule was maintained by the prime  contractor for the work it was contracted to perform, a second  schedule was maintained by the project management support  contractor to show a high-level view of all activities, and a third  schedule was created by FCC to guide the deployment activities  completed in July 2012.

This limits FCC\u2019s ability to predict the effect on  the project\u2019s end date of, among other things, delayed activities  and unrealistic deadlines.", "Verifying that the schedule can be traced horizontally and  vertically. The separate project schedules were not integrated with  one another. For example, no links existed between design  activities in the prime contractor\u2019s management schedule with the  high-level view contained in the project management support  contractor\u2019s schedule. The lack of integration among these  separate schedules reduces their usefulness for managing the  project and the ability of different teams to work to the same  schedule expectations.", "Maintaining a baseline schedule. The project did not have an  established baseline schedule that showed baseline dates,  forecasted dates, or actual progress to date for any activities to  monitor and report project performance against targeted  milestones. This reduces FCC\u2019s ability to measure progress and  promote accountability.", "Because of these weaknesses, it is difficult to know whether the  project\u2019s planned completion date is realistic. As an integrated and  reliable schedule is an essential basis for managing trade-offs  between cost, schedule, and scope, the absence of such a schedule  increases the risk that FCC will be faced with unexpected and difficult  choices about completing the project.", "Project risks were not fully managed. Although FCC made efforts  to document and manage certain project risks, limitations existed in  the commission\u2019s management of these risks and key project risks  were not taken into account. For example, although the prime  contractor has begun tracking project risks, no risks had been  identified before July 31, 2012, which was after deployment of the  initial components of the project had begun and more than 3 months  after the contractor began work. Additionally, the prime contractor did  not document plans for how project risks would be addressed.  Specifically, although 12 risks on the contractor\u2019s list of project risks  as of August 24, 2012, had not been accepted by FCC, none of them  had contingency plans documented, including 6 high-priority risks.  Also, as previously discussed, we identified problems in FCC\u2019s  management of the ESN project in several major areas, including  information security risk management, requirements development and  testing, project scheduling, and cost estimation; however, these  problems were not identified by FCC as risks. Such weaknesses in  managing project risk may limit the ability of the commission to  identify and address cost, schedule, and performance shortfalls.", "These project management weaknesses occurred, at least in part,  because FCC lacked policies and guidance for project management  including for cost estimation, project scheduling, and managing project  risks. Additionally, commission officials stated that FCC had lacked  project management expertise. According to officials, as of November  2012, the commission had established an internal project management  office to address these weaknesses. Further, they stated that this office  had developed a number of standard operating procedures for various  project management disciplines, although additional procedures for  project management remained to be completed. Lastly, the officials stated  that the office was also performing the project management functions for  the ESN project, including, among other things, schedule management,  cost management, and project risk management; the office also had  produced a draft schedule and cost and risk documents. These are  positive steps; however, until FCC updates the ESN cost estimate,  finalizes a reliable schedule and fully manages project risks, it will  continue to have limited ability to effectively manage and monitor the ESN  project, increasing the potential that successfully mitigating the risk from  cyber threats will cost more than planned and will take longer than  projected.", "Through IT investment management, organizations define and follow a  process to help senior leadership make informed decisions on competing  investment options. Such investments, if managed effectively, can have a  dramatic impact on an organization\u2019s performance and accountability. If  mismanaged, they can result in wasteful spending and lost opportunities  for improving delivery of services. Our IT Investment Management  framework states that an organization should establish the management  structure needed to manage its investments and build the investment  foundation by selecting and controlling individual projects. Once a project  is selected, an organization should effectively oversee it throughout all  phases of its life cycle. The organization should ensure that the project  continues to meet mission needs at the expected levels of cost and risk  as it develops and expenditures are incurred. If the project is not meeting  expectations or if problems develop, the organization should quickly take  steps to address the deficiencies.", "To its credit, FCC documented its policy for selecting, controlling, and  evaluating IT investments in its Information Technology Capital Planning  and Investment Control Guide. Among other things, the policy states that  ongoing IT projects are to be monitored for progress against their  projected cost, schedule, performance, and expected mission benefits  during their planning, acquisition, deployment, and operations. All IT  projects in the commission\u2019s IT investment portfolio are to be discussed  by stakeholders from across FCC on a regular basis, including project  schedules and related risks or impacts that may prevent projects from  meeting their target schedules. Such activities are intended to ensure that  the commission\u2019s IT initiatives are conducted in a disciplined, well- managed, and consistent manner through timely oversight, quality  control, and executive review.", "However, FCC did not consistently conduct regular oversight of the ESN  project in accordance with its investment policy. Although FCC held  monthly project management review meetings where many of the  commission\u2019s IT projects were discussed by stakeholders, the ESN  project was not discussed at these meetings because, according to FCC  officials, only those projects under FCC\u2019s Programming Services  contract\u2014which does not include the ESN project\u2014were included in the  project management reviews.", "Two oversight activities that were being performed for the ESN project  include (1) periodic reviews by the CIO of a summary report of  performance information on all IT projects and (2) quarterly briefings to  congressional staff. However, the summary report and quarterly briefings  contained limited cost, schedule, and performance data on the project. To  illustrate, the quarterly congressional briefings on the status of the project  were not based on measurable performance data and did not include key  project activities. For example, although the August 2012 briefing slides  described schedule progress as \u201con track,\u201d the slides did not indicate that  several activities, including requirements development, were significantly  behind schedule.", "Officials stated that they did not update or expand the schedule section of  the quarterly briefing because of the concern that doing so would  increase the complexity of their presentation beyond an acceptable level.  Nevertheless, without providing such information, FCC may limit the  ability of congressional staff and others with oversight responsibilities to  provide meaningful oversight, thus increasing the risk that the project may  not meet its objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In response to a security breach, FCC has undertaken a variety of  activities to enhance the security of its network. However, because FCC  deployed the initial components of the project without performing key  security risk management and life-cycle management activities called for  within its own policies\u2014such as completing security and functional  requirements, conducting risk management framework steps, and  performing gate reviews\u2014it limited the effectiveness of its security  enhancements and did not sufficiently protect the initial deployments from  the security threats that the project is intended to mitigate. In addition, the  commission\u2019s ability to successfully achieve the objectives of the project  has been hindered by weaknesses related to ESN project management  and oversight activities. Although the commission reported that the  project is within cost and on schedule, the lack of a reliable life cycle cost  estimate and project schedule, inconsistent management of project risks,  and inconsistent oversight may leave FCC management and Congress  without sufficient awareness of the total life-cycle costs for developing  and deploying the ESN, sufficient assurance that the commission will be  able to successfully complete the project by its scheduled completion  date, and adequate understanding of potential obstacles to the success of  the project. These shortcomings existed, at least in part, because of a  lack of FCC guidance on project management, including cost estimating,  scheduling, and risk management. Unless FCC more effectively  implements its IT security policies, improves its project management  practices, and conducts regular oversight in accordance with commission  policies, unnecessary risk exists that the ESN project may not succeed in  its purpose of effectively protecting the commission\u2019s systems and  information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help strengthen IT and project management controls over the ESN  project, we recommend that the Chairman of the FCC take the following  seven actions:", "Perform key security risk management activities for the ESN project  including selecting and documenting the security controls, assessing  the implementation of the controls, and authorizing the system to  operate.", "Conduct appropriate gate reviews, such as the Requirements  Approval, at major transition points in the project.", "Develop a life-cycle cost estimate for the ESN project that reflects  current project status.", "Establish an integrated and reliable master schedule for the ESN  project.", "Document, evaluate, and manage all identified project risks in a risk  management process, and document mitigation strategies for all risks.", "Commit to a time frame for establishing commission guidance on  project management, including cost estimating, scheduling, and risk  management.", "Monitor and oversee the ESN project on a regular basis and ensure  that project data used for this purpose are current and valid.", "In a separate report with limited distribution, we are also making 26  recommendations associated with 21 findings to resolve technical  information security weaknesses related to access controls and  configuration management of the ESN."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["In providing written comments (reprinted in app. II) on a draft of this  report, the Managing Director of FCC stated that the commission largely  concurred with our findings and recognized the need to maintain an  effective and forward-leaning cybersecurity program, and noted that it had  multiple ongoing cybersecurity initiatives dedicated to this purpose,  including the ESN project.

To determine the extent to which FCC reliably  estimated the costs for the ESN project, we compared the practices  used in deriving the project\u2019s cost estimate to best practices  documented in the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide,  which states that a reliable cost estimate is comprehensive, well- documented, accurate, and credible. As part of this, we reviewed the  estimate and supporting documentation, and interviewed commission  officials about the estimate and reasons for the deficiencies we  identified.", "Scheduling. To determine the extent to which FCC developed and  maintained a reliable schedule, we analyzed the project schedule as  of September 2012 against the 10 best practices documented in the  Exposure Draft of the GAO Schedule Assessment Guide.
