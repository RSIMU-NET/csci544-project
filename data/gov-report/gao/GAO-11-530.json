GAO was asked to examine whether or not sexual assault incidents are fully reported and what factors may contribute to any observed underreporting, how facility staff determine sexual assault-related risks veterans may pose in residential and inpatient mental health settings, and precautions facilities take to prevent sexual assaults and other safety incidents. GAO reviewed relevant laws, VA policies, and sexual assault incident documentation from January 2007 through July 2010 provided by VA officials and the VA Office of the Inspector General (OIG). In addition, GAO visited and reviewed portions of selected veterans' medical records at five judgmentally selected VA medical facilities chosen to ensure the residential and inpatient mental health units at the facilities varied in size and complexity. Finally, GAO spoke with the four Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) that oversee these VA medical facilities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found that many of the nearly 300 sexual assault incidents reported to the VA police were not reported to VA leadership officials and the VA OIG. Specifically, for the four VISNs GAO spoke with, VISN and VA Central Office officials did not receive reports of most sexual assault incidents reported to the VA police. Also, nearly two-thirds of sexual assault incidents involving rape allegations originating in VA facilities were not reported to the VA OIG, as required by VA regulation. In addition, GAO identified several factors that may contribute to the underreporting of sexual assault incidents including unclear guidance and deficiencies in VA's oversight. VA does not have risk assessment tools designed to examine sexual assaultrelated risks veterans may pose. Instead, VA staff at the residential programs and inpatient mental health units GAO visited said they examine information about veterans' legal histories along with other personal information as part of a multidisciplinary assessment process. VA clinicians reported that they obtain legal history information directly from veterans, but these self-reported data are not always complete or accurate. In reviewing selected veterans' medical records, GAO found that complete legal history information was not always documented. In addition, VA has not provided clear guidance on how such legal history information should be collected or documented. VA facilities GAO visited used a variety of precautions intended to prevent sexual assaults and other safety incidents; however, GAO found some of these measures were deficient, compromising facilities' efforts to prevent sexual assaults and other safety incidents. For example, facilities often used patientoriented precautions, such as placing electronic flags on high-risk veterans' medical records or increasing staff observation of veterans who posed risks to others. These VA facilities also used physical security precautions--such as closed-circuit surveillance cameras to actively monitor units, locks and alarms to secure key areas, and police assistance when incidents occurred. These physical precautions were intended to prevent a broad range of safety incidents, including sexual assaults, through monitoring patients and activities, securing residential programs and inpatient mental health units, and educating staff about security issues and ways to deal with them. However, GAO found significant weaknesses in the implementation of these physical security precautions at these VA facilities, including poor monitoring of surveillance cameras, alarm system malfunctions, and the failure of alarms to alert both VA police and clinical staff when triggered. Inadequate system installation and testing procedures contributed to these weaknesses. Further, facility officials at most of the locations GAO visited said the VA police were understaffed. Such weaknesses could lead to delayed response times to incidents and seriously erode efforts to prevent or mitigate sexual assaults and other safety incidents."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that VA improve both the reporting and monitoring of sexual assault incidents and the tools used to identify risks and address vulnerabilities at VA facilities.

These initiatives have targeted several  specific veteran populations\u2014including women veterans, young veterans  from the military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and veterans facing  legal issues or those currently incarcerated. Such outreach initiatives have  increased the number of veterans from these specific populations  participating in residential and inpatient mental health care programs at  VA medical facilities and have changed the demographics of patients cared  for by VA.", "Such changes in patient demographics along with the department\u2019s  commitment to providing health care services to all eligible veterans  present unique challenges for VA both in providing and maintaining  accessible care and keeping veterans and staff safe in VA medical  facilities, including those that treat veterans suffering from mental health  conditions. During our recent work on services available for women  veterans in VA medical facilities, several clinicians raised concerns about  the safety of women veterans in mental health programs at one VA medical  facility. For example, these clinicians raised concerns about the safety of  women veterans in a VA residential mental health facility that housed both  women veterans and veterans who had committed sexual crimes in the  past. Clinicians also expressed concerns about women veterans receiving  treatment in the inpatient mental health units of this VA medical facility  because they did not feel adequate safety precautions were in place to  protect women admitted to these units.", "These concerns highlight the importance of VA having both effective  security precautions in place at its medical facilities, especially those with  residential and inpatient mental health programs, and a consistent way to  exchange information and facilitate discussions about safety incidents,  including sexual assault incidents. VA has policies in place regarding  security precautions in residential and inpatient mental health settings and  procedures for reporting and analyzing patient safety incidents through its  National Center for Patient Safety (NCPS). For example, VA requires that  residential and inpatient mental health facilities conduct periodic reviews  of the security precautions in use in these settings. Also, VA\u2019s NCPS has  established procedures for medical facilities to report patient safety  incidents that occur in these facilities to leadership officials.", "You asked us to examine: (1) VA\u2019s processes for reporting sexual assault  incidents and the volume of these incidents reported in recent years;   (2) the extent to which sexual assault incidents are fully reported and  what factors may contribute to any observed underreporting; (3) how  medical facility staff determine sexual assault-related risks veterans may  pose in residential and inpatient mental health settings; and (4) the  precautions in place in residential and inpatient mental health settings to  prevent sexual assaults and other safety incidents and any weaknesses in  these precautions.", "To examine VA\u2019s processes for reporting sexual assault incidents, the  volume of these incidents reported in recent years, the extent to which  these incidents were fully reported, and factors that may contribute to any  observed underreporting, we reviewed relevant VA and Veterans Health  Administration (VHA) policies, handbooks, directives, and other guidance  documents on the reporting of safety incidents. We also interviewed VA  and VHA Central Office officials involved with the reporting of safety  incidents\u2014including officials with VA\u2019s Office of Security and Law  Enforcement (OSLE), VHA\u2019s Office of the Deputy Under Secretary for  Health for Operations and Management, and VHA\u2019s Office of the Principal  Deputy Under Secretary for Health. In addition, we conducted site visits  to five VA medical facilities. These judgmentally selected medical facilities  were chosen to ensure that our sample: (1) had both residential and  inpatient mental health settings; (2) reflected a variety of residential  mental health specialties, including military sexual trauma; (3) had  medical facilities with various levels of experience reporting sexual  assault incidents; and (4) varied in terms of size and complexity. During  the site visits, we interviewed medical facility leadership officials and  residential and inpatient mental health unit managers and staff to discuss  their experiences with reporting sexual assault incidents. We also spoke  with officials from the four Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN)  responsible for managing the five selected medical facilities to discuss  their expectations, policies, and procedures for reporting sexual assault  incidents. Information obtained from these VISNs and VA medical  facilities cannot be generalized to all VISNs and VA medical facilities. In  addition, we interviewed officials from the VA Office of the Inspector  General\u2019s (OIG) Office of Investigations\u2014Criminal Investigations  Division\u2014to discuss information they receive from VA medical facilities  about sexual assault incidents that occur in these facilities. Finally, we  reviewed documentation of reported sexual assault incidents at VA  medical facilities provided by VA\u2019s OSLE, the VA OIG, and VISNs from  January 2007 through July 2010, to determine the number and types of  incidents reported, as well as which VA and VHA offices were notified of  those incidents. For this analysis, we used a definition of sexual assault  that was developed for the purpose of this report. Our analysis of VA  police and VA OIG reports was limited to only those incidents that were  reported and cannot be used to project the volume of sexual assault  incident reports that may occur in future years. Following verification that  VA police and VA OIG incidents met our definition of sexual assault and  comparisons of sexual assault incidents reported by the two groups within  VA, we found data derived from these reports to be sufficiently reliable for  our purposes.", "To examine how medical facility staff determine sexual assault-related  risks veterans may pose, we reviewed: (1) relevant VA and VHA policies  and procedures and (2) risk assessment policies and procedures from our  judgmentally selected sample of VISNs and VA medical facilities\u2019  residential and inpatient mental health units. We also interviewed VA,  VHA, VISN, and VA medical facility leadership officials and residential and  inpatient mental health unit managers and staff regarding the assessment  of risks. Finally, to inform our understanding of information collected  during this process, we reviewed selected portions of medical records for  all veterans at our selected medical facilities who were registered in the  state\u2019s publicly available sex offender registry and had addresses matching  the selected medical facilities\u2019 residential or inpatient mental health units.

For example, officials  from one VISN told us they expect to be informed of all sexual assault  incidents occurring in medical facilities within their network, but this  expectation was not explicitly documented in their policy. We found  several reported allegations of sexual assault incidents in medical facilities  in this VISN\u2014including three allegations of rape and one allegation of  inappropriate oral sex\u2014that were not forwarded to VISN officials. When  asked about these four allegations, VISN officials told us that they would  only have expected to be notified of two of them\u2014one allegation of rape  and one allegation of inappropriate oral sex\u2014because the medical  facilities where they occurred contacted outside entities, including the VA  OIG. VISN officials explained that the remaining two rape allegations were  unsubstantiated and were not reported to their office; the VISN also noted  that unsubstantiated incidents are not often reported to them.", "VA medical facilities. At the medical facility level, we also found that  reporting expectations may be unclear. In particular, we identified cases in  which the VA police had not been informed of incidents that were  reported to medical facility staff. For example, we identified VA police  files from one facility we visited where officers noted that the alleged  perpetrator had been previously involved in other sexual assault incidents  that were not reported to the VA police by medical facility staff. In these  police files, officers noted that staff working in the alleged perpetrators\u2019  units had not reported the previous incidents because they believed these  behaviors were a manifestation of the veterans\u2019 clinical conditions. We  also observed cases of communication breakdowns during our discussions  with medical facility officials and clinicians. For example, at one medical  facility VA police reported that prior to our arrival they were not  immediately informed of an alleged sexual assault incident involving two  male patients in the dementia ward that occurred the previous evening. As  a result, VA police were unable to immediately begin their investigation  because staff from the unit had completed their shifts and left the ward. At  another medical facility we visited, quality management staff identified  five sexual assault incidents that had not been reported to VA police at the  medical facility, despite these incidents being reported to their office."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Deficiencies Exist in VHA Central Office Oversight of Sexual Assault Incidents", "paragraphs": ["The VHA Central Office also had deficiencies in several necessary  oversight elements that could contribute to the underreporting of sexual  assault incidents to VHA management\u2014including information-sharing  practices and systems to monitor sexual assault incidents reported  through the management reporting stream. Specifically, the VHA Central  Office has limited information-sharing practices for distributing  information about reported sexual assault incidents among VHA Central  Office officials and has not instituted a centralized tracking mechanism for  these incidents.", "Currently, the VHA Central Office relies primarily on e-mail messages to  transfer information about sexual assault incidents among its offices and  staff (see fig. 2). Under this system, the VHA Central Office is notified of  sexual assault incidents through issue briefs submitted by VISNs via e-mail  to one of three VISN support teams within the VHA Office of the Deputy  Under Secretary for Health for Operations and Management. These issue  briefs are then forwarded to the Director for Network Support within this  office for review and follow-up with VA medical facilities if needed.  Following review, the Director for Network Support forwards issue briefs  to the Office of the Principal Deputy Under Secretary for Health for  distribution to other VHA offices on a case-by-case basis, including the  program offices responsible for residential programs and inpatient mental  health units. Program offices are sometimes asked to follow up on  incidents in their area of responsibility.", "We found that this system did not effectively communicate information  about sexual assault incidents to the VHA Central Office officials who  have programmatic responsibility for the locations in which these  incidents occurred. For example, VHA program officials responsible for  both residential programs and inpatient mental health units reported that  they do not receive regular reports of sexual assault incidents that occur  within their programs or units at VA medical facilities and were not aware  of any incidents that had occurred in these programs or units. However,  during our review of VA police files we identified at least 18 sexual assault  incidents that occurred from January 2007 through July 2010 in the  residential programs or inpatient mental health units of the five VA  medical facilities we reviewed. If the management reporting stream were  functioning properly, these program officials should have been notified of  these incidents and any others that occurred in other VA medical facilities\u2019  residential programs and inpatient mental health units. Without the  regular exchange of information on sexual assault incidents that occur  within their areas of programmatic responsibility, VHA program officials  cannot effectively address the risks of such incidents in their programs  and units and do not have the opportunity to identify ways to prevent  incidents from occurring in the future.", "In early 2011, VHA leadership officials told us that initial efforts, including  sharing information about sexual assault incidents with the Women  Veterans Health Strategic Health Care Group and VHA program offices,  were under way to improve how information on sexual assault incidents is  communicated to program officials. However, these improvements have  not been formalized within VHA or published in guidance or policies and  are currently being performed on an informal ad hoc basis only, according  to VHA officials.", "In addition to deficiencies in information sharing, we also identified  deficiencies in the monitoring of sexual assault incidents within the VHA  Central Office. VHA\u2019s Office of the Deputy Under Secretary for Health for  Operations and Management, the first VHA office to receive all issue briefs  related to sexual assault incidents, does not currently have a system that  allows VHA Central Office staff to systematically review or analyze reports  of sexual assault incidents received from VA medical facilities through the  management reporting stream. Specifically, we found that this office does  not have a central database to store the issue briefs that it receives and  instead relies on individual staff to save issue briefs submitted to them by  e-mail to electronic folders for each VISN. In addition, officials within this  office said they do not know the total number of issue briefs submitted for  sexual assault incidents because they do not have access to all former staff  members\u2019 files. As a result of these issues, staff from the Office of the  Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Operations and Management could  not provide us with a complete set of issue briefs on sexual assault  incidents that occurred in all VA medical facilities without first contacting  VISN officials to resubmit these issue briefs. Such a limited archive  system for reports of sexual assault incidents received through the  management reporting stream results in VHA\u2019s inability to track and trend  sexual assault incidents over time. While VHA has, through its National  Center for Patient Safety (NCPS), developed systems for routinely  monitoring and tracking patient safety incidents that occur in VA medical  facilities, these systems do not monitor sexual assaults and other safety  incidents. Without a system to track and trend over time sexual assaults  and other safety incidents, the VHA Central Office cannot identify and  make changes to serious problems that jeopardize the safety of veterans in  their medical facilities."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Self-Reported Legal Histories Are Commonly Used to Inform Clinicians of Sexual Assault- Related Risks, but Guidance on Information Collection Is Limited", "paragraphs": ["VA does not have risk assessment tools specifically designed to examine  sexual assault-related risks that some veterans may pose while they are  being treated at VA medical facilities.

Clinicians also cited other sources of information that  could be used to learn about veterans\u2019 legal issues, including family  members, the court system, probation and parole officers, VHA justice  outreach staff, and Internet searches of public registries containing  criminal justice information. However, clinicians reported limitations in  the use of several of these sources. In some cases, veterans must authorize  the disclosure of their criminal or medical information before it can be  released to a VA medical facility\u2014although clinicians noted that veterans  who have a legal restriction on where they may reside or need to meet  probation or parole requirements while in treatment are often willing to  release information. In addition, clinicians reported challenges in  contacting veterans\u2019 families to obtain information as many have no family  support system, particularly those who are homeless prior to entering  treatment. Further, VA\u2019s Office of General Counsel and VHA Central Office  officials told us that VHA staff cannot conduct background checks on  veterans applying for VA health care services, including Internet searches  of public sources of criminal justice information because VHA lacks legal  authority to collect or maintain this information.", "VA clinicians from residential programs and inpatient mental health units  at the five medical facilities we visited said that although they inquire  about veterans\u2019 past legal issues, they do not always obtain timely,  complete, or reliable information on these issues from veterans. These  clinicians noted that although many veterans are eventually forthcoming  about their legal history, some may not disclose this information during  the admission assessment or ongoing reassessment processes. For  example, clinicians told us that sometimes they learned about particular  legal issues, such as an arrest warrant or parole requirements, after  veterans have been admitted to the program or when they were being  discharged. They explained that sometimes veterans are uncomfortable  discussing legal or sexual abuse issues during their admission interviews,  but may share this information over time when they become comfortable  with their treatment team. However, these clinicians noted that sometimes  these issues do not come to light until veterans are beginning their  transitions into community housing during the discharge process.  Nevertheless, clinicians reported that they try to encourage veterans to  disclose their full legal histories because it helps them to identify and  address mental health problems that may have contributed to veterans\u2019  encounters with the legal system and to aid the transition to independent  community living.", "To determine whether legal history information in veterans\u2019 medical  records was complete, we reviewed the biopsychosocial assessments for  seven veterans at our selected medical facilities who were registered sex  offenders and found that while nearly all of these assessments  documented that medical facility clinicians inquired about these veterans\u2019  legal issues, these issues were not consistently included in the  assessments. The extent to which information about legal history was  documented for these seven veterans varied\u2014from assessments  containing detailed information about current and past criminal  convictions, including the veterans\u2019 sex offense violations and conviction  dates, to assessments that did not contain any information about their past  or current legal history. Specifically, four of these seven assessments  contained detailed descriptions of the veterans\u2019 legal histories including  information on sex offense violations; two of these seven assessments  contained limited descriptions of the veterans\u2019 legal histories; and one of  these seven assessments contained no information on the veteran\u2019s legal  history. In addition, we could not review one additional biopsychosocial  assessment for an eighth veteran who was a patient in one of our selected  medical facilities and was also listed in the publicly available state sex  offender registry for the selected medical facility because the medical  facility did not conduct a biopsychosocial assessment, as required by  policy.", "Incomplete or missing information about veterans\u2019 legal histories and  histories of violence can hinder clinicians\u2019 abilities to effectively assess  risks, provide appropriate treatment options, and ensure the safety of all  veterans. In particular, some clinicians noted that insufficient information  about veterans\u2019 legal backgrounds can affect their ability to make  appropriate program residency placement decisions and assist veterans in  developing appropriate housing and employment plans for their  reintegration into the community. For example, clinicians reported they  face challenges in assisting some homeless veterans in finding jobs or  housing partly because outside entities often conduct background checks  prior to accepting veterans into their programs and VA staff cannot always  effectively help veterans navigate those issues if they lack relevant or  timely information about veterans\u2019 legal histories. Clinicians also said that  knowledge about legal issues\u2014such as pending court appearances,  criminal charges, or sentencing requirements\u2014is useful because such  issues can interrupt or delay rehabilitation treatment services at VA or  prevent veterans from using certain community resources when they are  discharged if not adequately addressed.

We found that some precautions were used by  staff in both residential programs and inpatient mental health units, while  other precautions were specific to only one of these settings. Some of the  patient-oriented precautions we noted during our site visits included the  following:    Using patient medical record flags. Staff in residential programs and  inpatient mental health units reported that they can request that an  electronic flag be placed on a veteran\u2019s medical record when they have  concerns about the individual\u2019s behavior and reported that they use these  flags to help inform their interactions with veterans.", "Relocating or separating veterans. Staff in residential programs and  inpatient mental health units noted that they may move or separate  patients who have the potential for conflict with other veterans to help  prevent incidents from occurring. For example, at one medical facility we  visited such relocations involved moving veterans that the clinical staff  determine are safety risks to rooms closer to the nurses\u2019 station where  they can be monitored more closely. Staff from some of the medical  facilities we visited reported that veterans who pose a threat to others may  also be moved to areas where they have restricted contact with others in  the unit.", "Setting expectations and using patient contracts. Residential program staff  reported using several contract or patient education mechanisms to  reinforce both what is expected of veterans in these programs and what  behaviors are prohibited during their stay.

For example, the medical facilities  we visited regularly required training for staff on the prevention and  management of disruptive behavior. Another preparedness precaution in  use in some units was the establishment of a regular VA police presence  through activities such as police conducting rounds or holding educational  meetings with patients.

At three medical facilities, the inpatient  units\u2019 stationary or computer-based panic alarms sounded at the medical  facility\u2019s police command and control center. At another medical facility,  two types of panic alarms were used. The stationary panic alarms used by  this facility\u2019s inpatient mental health units sounded at both the police  command and control center and on the inpatient unit itself to instantly  alert unit staff members if a panic alarm was depressed, while the  computer-based panic alarms used at the nursing stations sounded only at  the police command and control center. Alarms in use at the fifth medical  facility we visited sounded at the units\u2019 nursing stations. Finally, while all  five units had locked entrances, four of the units used physical keys to  open the locks on the entrance doors, while the unit at the fifth medical  facility used a keyless entry approach in which staff used their badges to  electronically enter the units and relied on physical keys only if the  keyless system was not functioning.", "Other precautions were present in only some of the inpatient mental  health units we visited. For example, three medical facilities used closed- circuit surveillance cameras on their inpatient units to varying degrees.  Cameras in place at one of these medical facilities could be monitored at  the unit\u2019s nursing station and were used to monitor the entrance doors,  common areas, and seclusion rooms used for veterans who needed to be  isolated from others. At another medical facility, cameras were used in a  similar fashion, except that this unit did not use cameras to monitor  veterans in seclusion rooms. Cameras in place at the remaining medical  facility were part of a passive system that was not actively monitored by  staff at the unit\u2019s nursing station and was used only to record incidents at  the entrance doors and common areas. One of these medical facilities also  used alarms on bedroom doors that enunciated when the door was  opened. These door alarms were installed on all bedrooms used by women  and for other veterans on an as-needed basis. The ability to instantly alert  staff of either unexpected entries or exits from these rooms could  potentially minimize response time if an incident occurred. This latter  medical facility also used a community policing approach, with one VA  police officer dedicated to meeting regularly with inpatient mental health  unit staff and patients to build relationships and help address any issues or  concerns that arose.", "Residential programs. Physical security precautions in place at all five  medical facilities\u2019 non-CWT/TR residential programs included the use of  regular staff rounds to observe patients, staff training on the prevention  and management of disruptive behavior, the use of surveillance cameras to  monitor program areas, and the placement of women veterans in  designated areas of the residential facility. Some of these commonly used  precautions were implemented in different ways across the five medical  facilities. For example, some medical facilities placed women veterans in  separate bedrooms located closest to the nursing stations, while others  placed only women veterans in a separate wing of the facility. Medical  facilities\u2019 residential programs also varied with respect to where their  closed-circuit camera feeds could be viewed. At four of the five medical  facilities we visited, the camera feeds could be viewed by staff at the  programs\u2019 nursing stations or security desks, but at two medical facilities,  cameras at the domiciliary could also be viewed by staff at VA police  command and control centers. At all medical facilities, the camera systems  were passive and not actively monitored by staff.", "Other precautions were used only in some of the five medical facilities\u2019  non-CWT/TR residential programs. For example, residential programs in  four of five medical facilities used stationary or computer-based panic  alarms to alert others in case of emergency; the remaining medical facility  did not use any form of stationary or computer-based panic alarm system.  The four medical facilities\u2019 stationary alarms varied with respect to where  they sounded. In addition, only one medical facility we visited provided  portable personal panic alarms with GPS capability to its residential  program staff. In addition, VA police presence was widely used in two of  the five medical facilities we visited. One of these medical facilities  permanently staffed VA police officers at a residential program located off  the medical facility\u2019s main campus, while the other medical facility\u2019s  community policing officer met regularly with residential program staff  and patients to facilitate more direct communications between the  programs and VA police at the medical facility.", "CWT/TR residential programs.

Neither  of these locations actively monitored the camera feeds. In addition, one  medical facility reported using regular rounds and conducting bed checks.  Another medical facility had individual locks on bedroom doors; other  sites did not. Only one of the three CWT/TR programs we visited  accepted women; its apartment-style structure allowed women veterans to  be placed in separate apartments.

We  observed that VA staff in the police command and control center were not  continuously monitoring closed-circuit surveillance cameras at all five VA  medical facilities we visited. For example, at one medical facility, the  system used by the residential programs at that medical facility cannot be  monitored by the police command and control center staff because it is  incompatible with systems installed in other parts of the medical facility.  According to this medical facility\u2019s VA police, the residential program staff  did not consult with VA police before installing their own system. At  another medical facility where staff in the police office monitor cameras  covering the residential programs\u2019 grounds and parking area, we found  that the police office was unattended part of the time. In addition, at the  remaining three medical facilities we visited, staff in the police command  and control centers assigned to monitor medical facility surveillance  cameras had other duties that prevented them from continuously  monitoring the camera feeds. Specifically, they were also responsible for  serving as telephone operators and police/emergency dispatchers for the  entire VA medical facility. During our direct observations of their  activities, we noted that they were not monitoring the camera feeds  continuously. Although effective use of surveillance camera systems  cannot necessarily prevent safety incidents from occurring, lapses in  monitoring by security staff compromise the effectiveness of these  systems in place to help prevent or lessen the severity of safety incidents.", "Alarm malfunctions. At least one form of alarm failed to work properly  when tested at four of the five medical facilities we visited. For example,  at one medical facility, we tested the portable personal panic alarms used  by residential program staff and found that the police command and  control center could not always properly pinpoint the location of the tester  when an alarm was activated. When we tested this alarm inside a building  at this campus it functioned properly; however, when we tested it outside,  the location identified as the site of the alarm was at least 100 feet away  from the location where we set off the alarm. Further, when we tested an  emergency call box located outside the entrance to the residential  program buildings at this same medical facility, the call went to a central  telephone operator at the VA medical facility switchboard\u2014not the VA  police command and control center\u2014and the system improperly identified  our tester as calling from an elevator rather than from our location outside  the residential program building. At another medical facility that used  stationary panic alarms in inpatient mental health units, residential  programs, and other clinical settings (i.e., staff offices, nursing stations,  and common rooms), almost 20 percent of these alarms throughout the  medical facility were inoperable. Many of the inoperable alarms were due  to ongoing construction of new units at the medical facility, but some of  the remaining inoperable alarms were located in other parts of the medical  facility still in use. It is unclear if staff in these other areas were aware that  these alarms were inoperable and could not be used to call for help if they  needed it. At an inpatient mental health unit in a third medical facility, our  tests of the computer-based panic alarm system detected multiple alarm  failures. Specifically, three of the alarms we tested failed to properly  pinpoint the location of our tester because the medical facility\u2019s computers  had been moved to different locations and were not properly reconfigured.  Finally, at a fourth medical facility, alarms we tested in the inpatient  mental health unit sounded properly, but staff in the unit and VA police  responsible for testing these alarms did not know how to turn them off  after they were activated. In each of the cases where alarms  malfunctioned, VA staff were not aware the alarms were not functioning  properly until we informed them. Deficiencies like these at VA medical  facilities could lead to delayed response times and seriously erode efforts  to prevent or mitigate sexual assaults and other safety incidents.", "Inadequate documentation or review of alarm system testing. We  found that one of the five sites we visited failed to properly document tests  conducted of their alarm systems for their residential programs, although  testing of alarms is a required element in VA\u2019s Environment of Care  Checklist. Testing of alarm systems is important to ensure that systems  function properly, and not having complete documentation of alarm  system testing is an indication that periodic testing may not be occurring.  In addition, three medical facilities reported using computer-based panic  alarms that are designed to be self-monitoring to identify cases where  computers equipped with the system fail to connect with the servers  monitoring the alarms. All three of these medical facilities stated that due  to the self-monitoring nature of these alarms, they did not maintain alarm  test logs of these systems. However, we found that at two of these three  medical facilities these alarms failed to properly alert VA police when  tested. Such alarm system failures indicate that the self-monitoring  systems may not be effectively alerting medical facility staff of alarm  malfunctions when they occur, indicating the need for these systems to be  periodically tested by VA police.", "Alarms failed to alert both police and unit staff. In inpatient mental  health units at all five medical facilities we visited, stationary and  computer-based panic alarm systems we tested did not alert staff in both  the VA police command and control center and the inpatient mental health  unit where the alarm was triggered. Alerting both locations is important to  better ensure that timely and proper assistance is provided. At four of  these medical facilities, the inpatient mental health units\u2019 stationary or  computer-based panic alarms notified the police command and control  centers but not staff at the nursing stations of the units where the alarms  originated. Had these alarms been used in real emergencies, response  times may have been delayed because staff in the police command and  control center would have had to inform the inpatient mental health unit  that an alarm had been activated by someone within their unit. At the fifth  medical facility, the stationary panic alarms only notified staff in the unit  nursing station, making it necessary to separately notify the VA police.  Finally, none of the stationary or computer-based panic alarms used by  residential programs notified both the police command and control  centers and staff within the residential program buildings when tested.", "Limited use of portable personal panic alarms. Electronic portable  personal panic alarms were not available for the staff at any of the  inpatient mental health units we visited and were available to staff at only  one residential program we reviewed. In two of the inpatient mental health  units we visited, staff were given safety whistles they could use to signal  others in cases of emergency, personal distress, or concern about veteran  or staff safety. However, relying on whistles to signal such incidents may  not be effective, especially when staff members are the victims of assault.  For example, a nurse at one medical facility we visited was involved in an  incident in which a patient grabbed her by the throat and she was unable  to use her whistle to summon assistance. Some inpatient mental health  unit staff we spoke with indicated an interest in having portable personal  panic alarms to better protect them in situations like these.", "VA police staffing and workload challenges. At most medical facilities  we visited, VA police forces and police command and control centers were  understaffed, according to medical facility officials. For example, during  our visit to one medical facility, VA police officials reported being able to  staff just two officers per 12-hour shift to patrol and respond to incidents  at both the medical facility and at a nearby 675-acre veteran\u2019s cemetery.  While this staffing ratio met the minimum standards for VA police staffing,  having only two police officers to cover such a large area could potentially  increase the response times should a panic alarm activate or other security  incident occur on medical facility grounds. Also, we found that there was  an inadequate number of officers and staff at this medical facility to  effectively police the medical facility and maintain a productive police  force. The medical facility had a total of nine police officers at the time of  our visit; according to VA staffing guidance, the minimum staffing level for  this medical center should have been 19 officers. Similarly, at another  medical facility, the police force was short 14 active police officers  because some officers either were on military leave or awaiting the  completion of pending background checks. During our visit to this  medical facility, we also noted a shortage of officers at one of the medical  facility\u2019s police offices responsible for the inpatient mental health units.  Because of this, there were periods of time when this police office was  unattended. Not all medical facilities we visited had staffing problems. At  one medical facility, the VA police appeared to be well staffed and were  even able to designate staff to monitor off-site residential programs and  community based outpatient clinics.", "Lack of stakeholder involvement in unit redesign. As medical  facilities undergo remodeling, it is important that stakeholders are  consulted in the design process to better ensure that new or remodeled  areas are both functional and safe. Involving the VA police, security  specialists, computer experts, and staff in the affected units would better  ensure that proper security precautions are built into redesign projects.  We found that such stakeholder involvement on remodeling projects had  not occurred at one of the medical facilities we visited. At this medical  facility, some clinicians said that a lack of stakeholder involvement in the  redesign of the inpatient mental health units had created several safety  concerns and that postconstruction changes had to be made to the unit to  ensure the safety of veterans and unit staff. Specifically, clinical and VA  police personnel were not consulted about a redesign project for the  inpatient mental health unit. The new unit initially included one nursing  station that did not prevent patient access if necessary. After the unit was  reopened following the renovation, there were a number of assaults,  including an incident where a veteran reached over the counter of the  unit\u2019s nursing station and physically assaulted a nurse by stabbing her in  the neck, shoulder, and leg with a pen. Had staff been consulted on the  redesign of this unit, their experience managing veterans in an inpatient  mental health unit environment would have been helpful in developing  several safety aspects of this new unit, including the design of the nursing  station. Less than a year after opening this unit, medical facility leadership  called for a review of the units\u2019 design following several reported  incidents. As a result of this review, the unit was split into two separate  units with different veteran populations, an additional nursing station was  installed, and changes were planned for the structure of both the original  and newly created nursing stations\u2014including the installation of a new  shoulder-height plexiglass barricade on both nursing station counters."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["VA management has not remedied problems relating to the reporting of  sexual assault incidents, the assessment of sexual assault-related risks,  and the precautions used to prevent sexual assaults and other safety  incidents in VA medical facilities. This has led to a disorganized incident  reporting structure and has left VA vulnerable to the continued occurrence  of such incidents and unable to take systematic action on needed  improvements to prevent future incidents in all VA medical facilities. To  mitigate the occurrence of sexual assaults and other safety incidents in its  medical facilities and better ensure the safety of both veterans and staff,  VA needs to address several areas\u2014including the processes for reporting  sexual assault incidents, the underreporting of sexual assault incidents,  the assessment of risks certain veterans may pose to the safety of others,  and the implementation of physical security precautions. Failure to act  decisively in all of these areas would likely continue to place veterans and  medical facility staff in some locations in harm\u2019s way. To begin addressing  these concerns, VA must ensure that both management and law  enforcement officials are aware of the volume and specific types of sexual  assault incidents that are reported through the law enforcement stream.  Such awareness would help both management and law enforcement  officials address safety concerns that emerge for both patients and staff  throughout VA\u2019s health care system.", "Medical facility staff remain uncertain about what types of incidents  should be reported to VHA leadership and VA law enforcement officials,  and prevention and remediation efforts are eroded by failing to tap the  expertise of these officials. These officials can offer valuable suggestions  for preventing and mitigating future sexual assault incidents and help  address broader safety concerns through systemwide improvements  throughout the VA healthcare system. Leaving reporting decisions to local  VA medical facilities\u2014rather than allowing VHA management and VA OIG  officials to determine what types of incidents should be reported based on  the consistent application of known criteria\u2014increases the risk that some  sexual assault incidents may go unreported. Moreover, uncertainty about  sexual assault incident reporting is compounded by VA not having:   (1) established a consistent definition of sexual assault, (2) set clear  expectations for the types of sexual assault incidents that should be  reported to VISN and VHA Central Office leadership officials, and   (3) maintained proper oversight of sexual assault incidents that occurred  in VA medical facilities. Unless these three key features are in place, VHA  will not be able to ensure that all sexual assault incidents will be  consistently reported throughout the VA health care system. Specifically,  the absence of a centralized tracking system to monitor sexual assault  incidents across VA medical facilities may seriously limit efforts to both  prevent such incidents in the short and long term and maintain a working  knowledge of past incidents and efforts to address them when staff  transitions occur.", "Maintaining veterans\u2019 access to care is a priority in VA, but in those cases  where veterans have a history of sexual assault or other violent acts, VA  must be vigilant in identifying the risks that such veterans may pose to the  safety of others at its medical facilities. Risk assessment tools can be  valuable mechanisms for identifying those veterans that pose risks to  others while being treated at VA medical facilities. However, VA does not  currently have a risk assessment tool specific to sexual assault and instead  relies on clinicians\u2019 professional judgments. These judgments are largely  informed by the assessment of veterans\u2019 legal histories, which depend  heavily on self-reported data that must be accurately documented by  clinicians in veterans\u2019 medical records. Moreover, current VA guidance is  not specific about the extent to which current and past legal issues\u2014such  as the type or date of convictions\u2014should be documented in veterans\u2019  medical records\u2014a factor that further complicates the ability of VA  clinicians both to compile complete legal histories on veterans and to  make informed decisions about risks certain veterans may pose to other  veterans and VA staff.", "Ensuring that medical facilities maintain a safe and secure environment  for veterans and staff in residential programs and inpatient mental health  units is critical and requires commitment from all levels of VA. Currently,  the five VA medical facilities we visited are not adequately monitoring  surveillance camera systems, maintaining the integrity of alarm systems,  and ensuring an adequate police presence.
