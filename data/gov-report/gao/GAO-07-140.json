Education used ACS data primarily because state data were incomplete. In September, Education officials told us they were developing plans to clarify instructions for state data submissions to address identified inconsistencies. While Education officials expected their efforts to improve the quality of the data, they told us that they had not established criteria or a methodology to determine the relative accuracy of the two data sources. State data represent the number of students with limited English proficiency assessed annually for English proficiency, and ACS data are based in part on responses to subjective English ability questions from a sample of the population. ACS data showed large increases and decreases in numbers of these students from 2003 to 2004 in part due to sample size. ACS data and state counts of students with limited English proficiency for the 12 study states differed. GAO's simulation of the distribution of Title III funds for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 based on these numbers showed that there would be differences in how much funding states would receive. In fiscal year 2006, Congress authorized over $650 million in Title III funding for students with limited English proficiency--an increase of over $200 million since fiscal year 2001 under NCLBA. This increase in funding as well as the change in how funds are distributed--from a primarily discretionary grant program to a formula grant program--contributed to more districts receiving federal funding to support students with limited English proficiency since the enactment of NCLBA. States and school districts used Title III funds to support programs and activities including language instruction and professional development. Education provided oversight and support to states. Officials from 5 of the 12 study states reported overall satisfaction with the support from Education. However, some officials indicated that they needed more guidance in certain areas, such as developing English language proficiency assessments that meet NCLBA's requirements.

Title III of the No Child Left Behind Act of  2001 (NCLBA) designates federal funds to support the education of  students with limited English proficiency. We addressed how states can  better measure the progress of these students in our July 2006 report.  NCLBA, which reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act,  provides for formula-based grants to states, replacing the discretionary  grants authorized under Title VII of the Improving America\u2019s Schools Act  of 1994. In particular, under NCLBA, the Secretary of Education is  required to base the distribution of funds on the more accurate of two  allowable sources of data on the population of children and youth with  limited English proficiency and immigrants: the Bureau of the Census\u2019  (Census) American Community Survey (ACS) data or state-collected data.  However, questions have been raised about data measurement issues,  such as what the data are designed to measure and how that measurement  occurs, that affect the data the Department of Education (Education) can  use to distribute Title III funds. Congress is interested in the implications  of using each of the two data sources to distribute these funds as well as  other issues related to serving students with limited English proficiency. In  response to congressional interest we agreed to answer the following  questions: 1) What data does Education use to distribute Title III funds and  what are the implications of data measurement issues for the two  allowable sources of data for allocating funds across states? 2) How have  the level and distribution of federal funds to support students with limited  English proficiency changed under NCLBA? 3) How do states and school  districts use Title III funds? 4) How has Education provided oversight and  support to help states meet Title III requirements?", "In doing our work we used a variety of methodological approaches. To  address how data measurement issues affect the distribution of Title III  funds to states and to determine the implications of these issues, we  reviewed documentation and literature about ACS data, including prior  GAO reports, and interviewed Census officials knowledgeable about ACS.  We also analyzed information in 2002-04 state Biennial Evaluation  Reports and Consolidated State Performance Reports for the 2003-04 and  2004-05 school years\u2014the most recent years for which these reports were  available\u2014for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. We  analyzed the data that states reported related to the number of students  with limited English proficiency and recent immigrant students. We  selected 12 states and collected data related to students with limited  English proficiency and those students classified as recent immigrants. To  assess the reliability of state data, we interviewed knowledgeable state  officials about data quality control procedures and potential limitations of  these data and data systems. We also reviewed relevant documents. We  determined that the data obtained from these states related to students  with limited English proficiency were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. The selected states have large or growing populations of these  students, are geographically diverse, and represent more than 75 percent  of both Title III funding and the population of students with limited  English proficiency. We visited 6 of the 12 states\u2014Arizona, California,  Florida, Illinois, Nevada, and Texas\u2014and called officials in the other 6  states\u2014Colorado, Georgia, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and  Washington. We simulated the distribution of Title III funds to the 12  states based on state-reported data and compared the results to the actual  distribution for the 2005-06 and 2006-07 school years. To address the  second and third questions, we used information from the states\u2019 Biennial  Evaluation Reports, including information on the number of subgrantees  receiving Title III funds in each state and how states used Title III funds.  We also gathered in-depth information on funding and programs that  support students with limited English proficiency from the12 study states.  We reviewed Education documents and interviewed Education officials,  including officials from the Office of English Language Acquisition, the  Office of Budget Service, and the National Center for Education Statistics,  to obtain information about funding distribution and Education\u2019s support  to states. In addition, we met with officials in 11 school districts and 1  school in each of these districts to collect in-depth information on how  funds were used in the 6 states we visited. Finally, to complete the answer  to the question relevant to Education\u2019s oversight and support, we reviewed  the guidance Education has issued on Title III and analyzed Education\u2019s 21  Title III monitoring reports completed as of September 30 and states\u2019  responses to these reports as available.

However, Title III differs from Title VII in terms of  funding methods and requirements for academic standards and English  language proficiency standards and assessments. In particular, Title III  provides for formula-based grants whereas Title VII provided funds  primarily through discretionary grants. Title III also requires states to have  English language proficiency standards that are aligned with the state  academic content standards, in addition to annually assessing the English  language proficiency of students having limited English proficiency. GAO  reported on the academic achievement of these students and the validity  and reliability of assessments used to measure their performance. We  recommended that Education undertake a variety of activities to help  states better measure the progress of these students under NCLBA.", "Title VII authorized various discretionary grants to eligible states, school  districts, institutions of higher education, or community-based  organizations to, among other things, assist with the development of  instructional programs for students with limited English proficiency.  Under Title VII, colleges and universities also could apply for grants to  provide professional development programs on instructional and  assessment methodologies and strategies as well as resources specific to  limited English proficient students for teachers and other staff providing  services to these students. Title VII also required that funds be set aside  for the establishment and operation of a national clearinghouse for  information on programs for students with limited English proficiency.

Education  officials explained that not all states provided these data for school year  2004-05, and some provided data that included only partial counts of  students. For example according to Education, some states, such as  California and Texas, did not assess all students with limited English  proficiency. Education officials told us that the lack of complete state  data was, in part, due to the time needed to establish academic standards  and align English language proficiency assessments to those standards and  collect the related data.", "Education officials also explained that some states provided inconsistent  data on the number of students with limited English proficiency who were  assessed for English proficiency in the Consolidated State Performance  Reports because instructions for providing this information did not  include definitions of the data to be collected. Similarly, we found that  these instructions could be interpreted to ask for different data elements.  For example, it was unclear whether states should provide the number of  students screened for English proficiency, the number of students who  were already identified as limited English proficient who were then  assessed for their proficiency or a combination of the two numbers.  Further it was not clear whether or not states were to provide an  unduplicated count\u2014as some states use more than one assessment to  evaluate a student\u2019s mastery of the various dimensions of English  proficiency (reading, writing, and oral). Such students may be reported  more than once. As a result, some states included duplicate counts of  students, and in other states, these data included other student counts  (based on screening of new students rather than assessments of already  identified students as specified in the law).

Table 1 compares different characteristics of these data, including what  they measure and how.", "NCLBA requires that all students with limited English proficiency are  assessed annually for proficiency in English. However, states have  different methods of identifying which students have limited English  proficiency (see fig. 1). These varied methods, along with any differences  in interpreting student performance on such screenings, could result in a  lack of uniformity in the population identified as having limited English  proficiency. States generally employ home language surveys\u2014 questionnaires asking what languages are spoken at home\u2014to determine  which students should be screened for English proficiency. However,  beyond the home language survey, methodologies for determining a  student\u2019s English proficiency vary. States use different screening  instruments, and even within a state, there could be variation in the  instruments used. In addition, some states and school districts may  implement other methods\u2014such as subjective teacher observation  reports\u2014in determining a student\u2019s language proficiency. Regardless of  how states determine which students have limited English proficiency and  need language services, they are required to offer services and assess the  progress of all such students.", "The ACS data used by Education to represent the number of students with  limited English proficiency are based on a sample of the population. In  particular, these data represent the number of persons ages 5 to 21 who  speak a language other than English in the home and who report speaking  English less than \u201cvery well\u201d (see fig. 2).

The Census Bureau has found some inconsistency with  these responses in its re-interview process, which is a data quality check.", "Is a language other than English spoken in the home?", "It is not known how accurately the ACS data reflect the population of  students with limited English proficiency. According to Census officials,  no research exists on the linkage between the responses to the ACS  English ability questions and the identification of students with limited  English proficiency. Because ACS data are used as the basis of Title III- funding distribution, it is critical to understand how accurately these data  represent the population and whether they do so uniformly across states.", "In addition, ACS data for 2003 and 2004 show some large fluctuations in  the number of respondents who speak English less than very well. In part,  these fluctuations can be attributed to the partial implementation of the  ACS in these 2 years. The full implementation of the ACS occurred in  2005, and the data on English ability were not yet available at the time of  our review. Our analysis of the 2003 and 2004 ACS data that Education  used as the basis of Title III funding showed that 13 states had increases of  10 percent or more in this population, while 20 states and the District of  Columbia had decreases of 10 percent or more from the prior year.", "Further, seven of the states that showed decreases of 10 percent or more  in the ACS 2003-04 data representing students with limited English  proficiency also showed an increase in the number of recent immigrants  for this period. Many of these immigrants were likely to have limited  English proficiency. For example, according to ACS data that Education  uses to represent students with limited English proficiency, Rhode Island  had a decrease of 33.5 percent in this population at the same time that it  had an increase (about 33 percent) in the number of recent immigrants  (age 3 to 21).", "Education used the most current ACS data available to distribute Title III  funding across the states, consequently the fluctuations in the ACS data  were reflected in fluctuations in funding. In so far as these data reflect  population changes, such fluctuations are to be expected. However, if the  fluctuations were due to errors resulting from the sample size for the 2003  and 2004 ACS data, then they may have resulted in some states receiving a  greater (or lesser) proportion of the funds than their population of  students with limited English proficiency and recently immigrated  children and youth would warrant.

In 6 states, the 2004 ACS number was greater than the state\u2019s  count (for school year 2004-05), while in the other 6 states the ACS  number was less than the corresponding state count. For example, while  California reported having about 1.6 million students with limited English  proficiency in the 2004-05 school year, ACS estimates of the population of  persons ages 5 to 21 who speak a language other than English in the home  and speak English less than \u201cvery well\u201d was less than 1.1 million. This  represents a difference of almost 50 percent. The difference in New York  for that school year was also large\u2014New York reported about 204,000  students with limited English proficiency\u2014and the ACS number used by  Education was about 332,000, a difference of almost 40 percent for the  same school year (see fig. 3).", "Education used ACS data for the number of immigrant children and youth  for fiscal years 2005 and 2006; however, for fiscal years 2002-2004,  Education relied on state-reported counts of the number of immigrant  children and youth. With regard to data states collect on the number of  children and youth who are recent immigrants, state officials expressed a  lack of confidence in these data. State officials in some of the 12 study  states told us that these data were not very reliable because school and  school district officials did not ask about immigration status directly.  Some state and school district officials told us that in order to determine  whether a student should be classified as a recent immigrant, they relied  on information such as place of birth and the student\u2019s date of entry into  the school system. Officials in one state told us that in the absence of prior  school documentation, they made the assumption that if a student was  born outside the U.S. and entered the state\u2019s school system within the last  3 years, then the student was a recent immigrant.

Further, fewer schools in a district receiving Title  VII funds may have actually benefited from these funds. For example,  officials in two districts noted that under Title III all schools in the  districts received some funds to support their students with limited  English proficiency. In contrast, these officials told us that prior to  NCLBA, Title VII discretionary grants were targeted to some schools in  their districts while other schools with students with limited English  proficiency received no Title VII funds.

Specifically, all states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto  Rico reported using ESL programs, which typically involve little or no use  of the native language, such as sheltered English instruction and pull-out  ESL. In addition, all but 12 states also reported using bilingual programs,  which may provide instruction in two languages, such as dual language  programs that are designed to serve both English-proficient and limited  English proficient students concurrently (see table 5).

For example, officials in one state noted that many school districts used  these funds to expand activities designed for all students with limited  English proficiency, while other districts used them to meet the unique  needs of immigrant students not addressed through other programs, such  as providing counseling for traumatized refugee students. Officials in  another state noted that school districts commonly used these funds to  provide newcomer centers that provided educational and other services to  recent immigrants and their parents. Funds were also used to provide ESL  classes before and after school for recent immigrant students as well as  ESL classes, literacy classes, and computer classes for their parents.", "States also reported that Title III funds supported professional  development activities. Specifically, all states, the District of Columbia,  and Puerto Rico reported that school districts used Title III funds to  conduct professional development activities for teachers or other  personnel, such as workshops or seminars on the administration and  interpretation of English language proficiency assessments or on various  teaching strategies for students with limited English proficiency. In  addition, 40 states reported reserving a portion of state-level funds to  provide professional development to assist teachers and other personnel  in meeting state and local certification, endorsement and licensing  requirements for teaching these students. For example, one state reported  offering a seminar once per year that provided professional development  hours that participants could use to meet state certification or  endorsement requirements, and another state noted that it reimbursed  teachers for tuition for courses that led to ESL endorsement.", "In addition, 49 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico reported  reserving state-level funds for other activities, including providing  technical assistance, planning, and administration (table 6). All 12 study  states reported reserving state-level funds. While all study states reported  reserving state-level funds for administration\u2014including salaries for Title  III staff\u2014as well as for professional development and technical assistance,  the majority of study states also reserved these funds for other activities,  such as to develop guidance on English language proficiency standards.", "Similarly, in interviews with officials in 11 school districts and schools  we visited in 6 of our study states, we found that Title III funds were used  to support a variety of programs and activities for these students. Most  districts we visited reported using Title III funds for the instructional  program and materials as well as for professional development and  assessments. In addition, districts used these funds to provide services,  such as after-school tutoring or summer school programs, and for parent  outreach activities, such as adult ESL classes or workshops on how to  help your child succeed in school.", "For example, in one school district, we visited a high school that used Title  III funds for two English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) teachers  and one teacher aide who worked with all of the school\u2019s limited English  proficient students. School officials also said that the county used Title III  funds for a resource teacher who visited their school on a weekly basis to  instruct teachers in ESOL strategies. The resource teacher also provided  individualized pull-out instruction. This school also purchased computer- based learning software with Title III funds.", "NCLBA requires school districts to use a portion of Title III funds for  language instruction programs for students with limited English  proficiency and to provide professional development to teachers or other  personnel. However, Education found issues related to these required uses  during Title III-monitoring visits to seven states. For example, Education  found that one of two districts visited in one state used all its Title III  funds for teacher salaries and benefits. Education found that this issue  arose due to a lack of familiarity with federal requirements and required  the state to develop a corrective action plan.

However, officials in one district we  visited noted that teacher transience in high-needs schools presents  challenges because schools must continually provide training to new staff  on strategies for teaching students with limited English proficiency. In  another district, officials noted a particular challenge in locating qualified  substitute teachers to work with these students when necessary.", "Prior GAO work also found that states and school districts were  experiencing challenges implementing NCLBA\u2019s teacher qualification  requirements, including difficulties with teacher recruitment and  retention.

As part of its oversight effort, Education  implemented a monitoring program in 2005 to address each states\u2019  administration of the Title III program. This monitoring effort was  designed to provide regular, systematic reviews and evaluations of how  states meet Title III requirements to ensure that they implement and  administer programs in accordance with the law. Monitoring is conducted  on a 3-year cycle, and as of September 2006, Education officials had  monitored and reported on 20 states and the District of Columbia.  Education officials reported that they plan to visit 17 more states in fiscal  year 2007.", "As part of the monitoring visits, Education reviews states\u2019 and districts\u2019  implementation of NCLBA requirements, such as data to be included in  required reports and required district uses of Title III funds. Education has  found issues relating to a number of these requirements. For example, for  4 of the 20 states monitored and the District of Columbia, Education had  findings related to the data that these states submitted in their  Consolidated State Performance Reports. According to Education, 20 of  the 21 monitoring reports had findings, and most states have developed  corrective action plans to address them. Education officials stated that  they are reviewing these plans and working with states to determine which  findings have been appropriately addressed and to develop a time frame  for resolving remaining findings.", "In addition, Education\u2019s program officers perform semiannual reviews of  states\u2019 responses to sections of the Consolidated State Performance  Report related to Title III and Biennial Evaluation Reports states submit  to Education along with phone calls to state officials to address issues  identified. For example, in October 2005 the program officers asked states  how quickly they got the funding out to school districts because this was  an area identified as a concern. Finally, Education officials explained that  they provide informal, ongoing monitoring by addressing issues brought  up by state officials throughout the year.", "Education offered support in a variety of ways to help states meet Title III  requirements. Education held on-site and phone meetings to provide  technical assistance to states, such as how to address the needs of those  students having both limited English proficiency and disabilities.  Education also held annual conferences focused on students with limited  English proficiency that included sessions that provided information to  state Title III directors and others on a variety of topics, such as NCLBA  policies related to students with limited English proficiency and English  language proficiency assessment issues. Education also held semiannual  meetings and training sessions with state Title III directors, a nationwide  Web cast on English language achievement objectives, and also  videoconference training sessions for some state officials on how to meet  Title III requirements. The department issued guidance on issues related to  students with limited English proficiency on its Web site and also  distributed information through an electronic bulletin board and a weekly  electronic newsletter focused on students with limited English proficiency  and through the National Clearinghouse for English Language Acquisition  and Language Instruction Educational Programs. In addition, Education  plans to provide assistance to individual states in developing appropriate  goals for student progress in learning English through at least 3 of the 16  regional comprehensive centers the agency has contracted with to build  state capacity to help school districts that are not meeting their adequate  yearly progress goals.", "Officials from 5 of the 12 study states reported general satisfaction with  the guidance, training, and technical assistance Education provided.  However, one area that officials from seven of the study states identified  as a challenge was addressing the needs of those students having both  limited English proficiency and disabilities. Although Education issued  guidance on including students with both limited English proficiency and  disabilities in English language assessments and English proficiency goals,  two states noted that the guidance does not specifically address how to  serve those students with the most significant cognitive disabilities who  also have limited English proficiency. Education estimates that nationwide  about 1 percent of students have the most significant cognitive disabilities.  An Education official stated that there is limited research on how to  address this group of students, but Education is working with states and  experts to explore the appropriate identification, assessment, placement,  and interventions for such students.", "In addition, officials in 5 of the 12 study states thought more guidance was  needed to develop English language proficiency assessments that meet  NCLBA\u2019s requirements. In our July 2006 report we found that Education  has issued little written guidance on how states are expected to assess and  track the English proficiency of these students, leaving some state officials  unclear about Education\u2019s expectations. We recommended that  Education identify and provide the technical support states need to ensure  the validity of academic assessments and publish additional guidance on  requirements for assessing English language proficiency.

NCLBA specifies that Education is to  distribute funds based on the more accurate data source\u2014Census\u2019 ACS  data or the number of students with limited English proficiency assessed  annually. Because Education has not provided states with clear  instructions on the portions of the Consolidated State Performance Report  relevant to the collection of state data on the number of students with  limited English proficiency assessed annually for English proficiency, it  has been difficult for states to provide the data Education needs in order  to consider the use of state data as the basis of distributing Title III funds.  Until Education provides clear instructions, states may continue to  provide inconsistent data.", "Once Education has provided such instructions and continues to work  with states to improve data quality, the state data will be more reliable and  complete. In addition, as Education completes its review of state-supplied  school-year 2003-04 and 2004-05 data, it will be in a better position to  consider the relative accuracy of the ACS and state data. However,   without a methodology in place to assess the relative accuracy of these  data sources, it is unclear how Education will determine which data to use  as the basis of Title III-funding distribution. This is of particular concern,  since without such a methodology, it will remain unknown how well either  of the two data sources captures the population of children with limited  English proficiency.", "In addition, ACS data have shown volatility\u2014large increases and  decreases\u2014in the numbers of students with limited English proficiency  from 2003 to 2004. While some volatility may be related to population  fluctuations, some is related to the ACS sample size. Consequently, states  may experience excessive fluctuations in their funding amounts from year  to year. Some states may continue to see large fluctuations in the Title III  funding when data based on the fulI ACS sample are introduced, when  data are based on new annual population estimates are incorporated,  and when data based on the 2010 Decennial Census become available. As a  result, states affected by this volatility may be unable to plan effectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To address the need for reliable and complete state data on the number of  students with limited English proficiency assessed annually, we  recommend that the Secretary of Education clarify the instructions on the  portions of the Consolidated State Performance Report relevant to the  collection of data on the number of students with limited English  proficiency assessed annually for English proficiency.", "To strengthen the basis for Education\u2019s distribution of Title III funds, we  recommend that the Secretary of Education develop and implement a  transparent methodology for determining the relative accuracy of the two  allowable sources of data, ACS or state data on the number of students  with limited English proficiency assessed annually, for Title III allocations  to states.", "To address volatility in annual ACS data, we recommend that as part of  NCLBA reauthorization, the Secretary should seek authority to use  statistical methodologies, such as multiyear averages."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to Education for review and comment.  In a letter, Education agreed with our recommendation regarding the need  for reliable and complete data on the number of students with limited  English proficiency assessed annually for English proficiency.  The  department stated that it has addressed this recommendation by revising  the CSPR data collection form for the 2005-06 school year and by  proposing additional changes to the 2007 CSPR (Part I) form.  However, as  stated in our report, Education did not provide documentation of the  proposed changes.  Further, it is not clear that the changes the department  describes would result in complete and reliable data on the number of  students with English proficiency assessed annually for English  proficiency.  We still recommend that Education review and clarify  instructions to allow for an unduplicated count of students that would  meet NCLBA requirements for use as a potential data source for funding.  Regarding our second recommendation, Education agreed that it should  develop a methodology to compare the relative accuracy of the two data  sources, but stated that it should wait until the quality of state data  improves.  However, we encourage Education to take steps now to  develop a methodology, since the department has been taking multiple  steps to improve the quality and completeness of state data.  In this way,  Education will be positioned to determine which data source is the more  accurate when state data has sufficiently improved.  Finally, Education  seemed to agree with our recommendation concerning the volatility of  ACS data, but commented that the department did not have the legal  authority to use multiyear averages of ACS data as the basis for  distributing Title III funds.  The department suggested that Congress might  want to address this issue in the NCLBA reauthorization.
