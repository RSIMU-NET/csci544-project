During this period, regulators reduced capital standards and allowed the use of alternative accounting procedures to increase reported capital levels. While these conditions were occurring, institutions were allowed to diversify their investments into potentially more profitable, but risky, activities. The profitability of many of these activities depended heavily on continued inflation in real estate values to make them economically viable. In many cases, diversification was accompanied by inadequate internal controls and noncompliance with laws and regulations, thus further increasing the risk of these activities.", "As a result of these factors, many institutions experienced substantial losses on their loans and investments, a condition that was made worse by an economic downturn. Faced with increasing losses, the industry\u2019s insurance fund, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), began incurring losses in 1984. By the end of 1987, 505 savings and loan institutions were insolvent. The industry\u2019s deteriorating financial condition overwhelmed the insurance fund which only 7 years earlier reported insurance reserves of $6.5 billion. In 1987, the Congress responded by creating the Financing Corporation (FICO) to provide financing to the FSLIC through the issuance of bonds. Through August 8, 1989, FICO provided $7.5 billion in financing to the FSLIC; however, the insurance fund required far greater funding to deal with the industry\u2019s problems.", "In response to the worsening savings and loan crisis, the Congress enacted the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) on August 9, 1989. FIRREA abolished FSLIC and transferred its assets, liabilities, and operations to the newly-created FSLIC Resolution Fund (FRF) to be administered by the FDIC.

RTC\u2019s overall responsibilities included managing and disposing of receivership assets and recovering taxpayer funds. In 1993, the Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act required RTC to cease its operations on or before December 31, 1995, and transfer any remaining assets and liabilities to the FSLIC Resolution Fund.", "FIRREA provided RTC with a total of $50 billion in funding to resolve failed institutions and pay related expenses. FIRREA also established the Resolution Funding Corporation (REFCORP) to provide RTC with $30 billion of the $50 billion in funding through the issuance of bonds.

These lawsuits assert various legal claims including breach of contract or an uncompensated taking of property resulting from the FIRREA provisions regarding minimum capital requirements for thrifts and limitations as to the use of supervisory goodwill to meet minimum capital requirements.

However, because the lower courts had not determined the appropriate measure or amount of damages, the Supreme Court returned the cases to the Court of Federal Claims for further proceedings. Until the amounts of damages are determined by the court, the amount of additional cost from these three cases is uncertain. Further, with respect to the other pending cases, the outcome of each case and the amount of any possible damages will depend on the facts and circumstances, including the wording of agreements between thrift regulators and acquirers of troubled savings and loan institutions. Estimates of possible damages suggest that the additional costs associated with these claims may be in the billions.

For instance, for tax purposes, assistance paid to an acquiring institution was considered nontaxable. In addition, in some cases, acquiring institutions could carry over certain losses and tax attributes of the acquired troubled institutions to reduce their own tax liability. The effect of these special tax benefits was to reduce the amount of FSLIC assistance payments required by an acquiring institution for a given transaction because of the value of tax benefits associated with the transaction. Thus, total assistance received by an acquiring institution consisted of both FSLIC payments and the value of these tax benefits.", "Because these tax benefits represented a reduction in general Treasury receipts rather than direct costs to FSLIC, we are presenting tax benefits as indirect costs associated with FSLIC\u2019s assistance transactions. Of the $7.5 billion in estimated tax benefits, $3.1 billion has been realized through December 31, 1995. The remaining $4.4 billion represents an estimate of the future tax benefits that could be realized by acquiring institutions in the future. However, the amount of future tax benefits depends greatly upon the future actions and profitability of the acquirers. For example, reduced or enhanced earnings, institutional acquisitions, and changes in corporate control would all affect acquirers\u2019 taxable income or the amount of tax benefits allowed to offset such taxable income in the future.

In addition, a significant portion of direct costs were paid from appropriations at a time when the federal government was operating with a sizable budget deficit. Therefore, it is arguable that additional borrowing was incurred. In view of these circumstances, we are presenting information on the known and estimated interest expense associated with financing the crisis because the future stream of payments associated with interest will have continuing fiscal implications for taxpayers and the savings and loan industry.
