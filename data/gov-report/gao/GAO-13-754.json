The percentage of the population with private dental coverage decreased from 53 to 50 percent. Dental coverage through Medicaid or the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which was established in 1997, rose from 9 to 13 percent. The increase was due primarily to an increase in the number of children covered by these federal-state health programs with mandated pediatric dental coverage. Individuals with no dental coverage decreased from 28 to 25 percent, and coverage for 10 to 12 percent of the population was unknown. Use of dental services--the percentage of individuals who had at least one dental visit--also remained relatively unchanged at around 40 percent from 1996 to 2010. Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries, children in particular, showed increases in the use of dental services (from 28 to 37 percent), but still visited the dentist less often than privately insured children (58 percent in 2010).", "GAO's analysis showed that average annual dental payments--the total amount paid out of pocket by individuals and by other payers--increased 26 percent, inflation-adjusted, from $520 in 1996 to $653 in 2010.

For 8 of 24 common procedures GAO examined, reported upper-end fees (the 95th percentile of the range in local dentist fees) were at least double the midpoint fees (the 50th percentile of the range in local dentist fees) in several communities. For example, in Miami, Florida, the upper-end fee of $150 for a periodic oral examination was more than twice the midpoint dental fee of $62. Dental fees also varied between local dentists billing private insurers and health centers serving residents of the same community.

For example, in all age groups, fewer individuals in rural  areas reported having a dental visit than individuals in urban areas (see  fig. 10). Specifically, 34 percent of individuals ages 65 and older living in  rural areas had dental visits in a year, compared with 45 percent of their  counterparts in urban areas, for 2008 through 2010.

We examined and analyzed data from 3 years:  1996, 2004, and 2010. We selected these years for our analysis because  1996 was the first year MEPS was administered and 2010 was the most  recent year for which data were available, we included 2004 to provide  three points in time for our analysis. MEPS is administered by the  Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Agency for Healthcare  Research and Quality (AHRQ) and is a nationally representative survey of  the noninstitutionalized population, including families, medical providers,  and employers. MEPS collects self-reported information on individuals\u2019  demographics, health and insurance status, and use of medical services  by setting and provider type, as well as expenses and payments related  to those medical and dental visits, among other things. We analyzed  responses to MEPS questions about types of dental insurance coverage,  number of dental visits, types of dental procedures received, and  payments made related to those visits. A dental visit refers to care by or  visits to any type of dental care provider, including general dentists,  dental hygienists, dental technicians, dental surgeons, orthodontists,  endodontists, and periodontists. For this report, we referred to all visits as  dental visits.", "To determine whether an individual had private dental insurance  coverage, we examined MEPS data and noted whether the individual  reported having dental insurance or had private insurance pay on a dental  claim during the year. Thus, we considered an individual to have private  dental coverage if he or she (1) reported having dental insurance or   (2) had that insurer pay on a dental claim.", "To identify adult Medicaid coverage by state, we used a list of states  provided by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) for  2004 and 2010. For states that were identified as having \u201climited\u201d or  \u201cemergency only\u201d dental coverage, we did not consider those benefits to  be Medicaid dental coverage. Our analysis of adult Medicaid coverage  based on the list from CMS resulted in only small differences from a  similar analysis conducted by AHRQ for its Chartbook 17 publication that  examines dental coverage and expenses.", "To categorize dental procedure codes, we consulted with AHRQ and  used the same categories used by AHRQ for its Chartbook 17. For  example, AHRQ placed various dental procedure codes related to  preventive dental care\u2014such as teeth cleaning and sealant application\u2014 in the preventive services category.", "In MEPS, expenses are defined as the sum of payments for care  received, including out-of-pocket payments and payments made by  private insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, and other sources. For this report,  we referred to MEPS expenses as payments\u2014payments by insurers or  other payers as well as out-of-pocket payments made by individuals. To  present the dental payments in constant 2010 dollars, we used the  Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) as the price  deflator for both the aggregate dental payments and the out-of-pocket  payments.", "To identify potential differences in dental service use and payments by  demographic groups, we looked at responses by age group, income level,  and urban or rural area. We examined income level in terms of the federal  poverty level.

Using 2010  Census data, we selected two communities in each state, one large  based on population and volume of dental claims and one small based on  population. Our nine selected community pairs, large and small (with  selected geozips), were Phoenix (850) and Flagstaff (860), Arizona; Los  Angeles (900) and Fresno (936), California; Miami (331) and Palm Coast  (321), Florida; Chicago (606) and Champaign (618), Illinois; Boston (021)  and Pittsfield (012), Massachusetts; Minneapolis (554) and Mankato  (560), Minnesota; New York (100) and Elmira (148), New York; Nashville  (372) and Jackson (382), Tennessee; and Dallas (752) and San Angelo  (768), Texas.", "To identify representative dental fees in each community, we analyzed   (1) 2012 dental insurance claims data compiled by FAIR Health, Inc., as  of January 2013, and (2) dental fee schedules from selected health  centers serving these communities. Based on the FAIR Health claims  data, we selected 24 of the most of commonly billed dental procedures in  six categories of the American Dental Association\u2019s (ADA) Current Dental  Terminology (CDT) codes: five diagnostic, five preventive, five restorative,  three endodontic, three periodontic, and three oral surgery.consulted with academic dental experts and ADA officials to confirm that   We  the CDT codes we selected were representative of common dental  procedures. We also compared our list of common dental procedures to  data from the ADA Survey of Dental Fees. We also obtained health  center dental fees for these 24 procedures in our 18 selected  communities. Based on a list of health centers provided by HHS\u2019s Health  Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), we selected one health  center (the center that served the most dental patients) in each  community. We obtained full-fee and sliding fee schedules from each  health center, although some health centers did not provide or bill  separately for all 24 procedures. The 18 health centers studied may not  be representative of the more than 1,200 health centers supported by  HRSA.", "For each selected dental procedure, we extracted from the FAIR Health  data set the midpoint dental fee (the 50th percentile) and the upper-end  fee (the 95th percentile). A percentile indicates the percentage of reported  fees that were below the stated amount; for example, 95 percent of  reported fees fall below the 95th percentile. Within each community, we  selected one geozip (an area that shares the first three digits of a postal  zip code) with the most dental claims to represent the community.  Because geozip boundaries do not align with metropolitan statistical area  designations, we selected one geozip (the one with the most dental  claims) to represent each large and each small metropolitan area. Large  metropolitan areas can include multiple geozips. For example, the Los  Angeles/Long Beach metropolitan area includes geozips 900 to 912  (excluding 909).", "To determine the reliability of the FAIR Health and health center data, we  reviewed related documentation, interviewed agency officials and  academic experts, and conducted data testing for missing data.
