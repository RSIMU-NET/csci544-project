With increased trade and travel, zoonotic diseases (transmitted between animals and humans) and animal diseases can emerge anywhere and spread rapidly. The importation of live animals is governed by five principal statutes and implemented by four agencies. GAO was asked to examine, among other things, (1) potential gaps in the statutory and regulatory framework governing live animal imports, if any, that may allow the introduction and spread of zoonotic and animal diseases and (2) the extent to which the agencies collaborate to meet their responsibilities, and face barriers, if any, to collaboration. GAO reviewed statutes, met with agency officials, visited ports of entry, and surveyed experts on animal imports."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The statutory and regulatory framework for live animal imports has gaps that could allow the introduction of diseases into the United States, according to the experts GAO surveyed, discussions with agency officials, and scientific studies. Specifically, (1) The Department of Health and Human Services' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has regulations to prevent the importation of live animals that may pose a previously identified disease risk to humans for some diseases, but gaps in its regulations may allow animals presenting other zoonotic disease risks to enter the United States. CDC has solicited comments in advance of a rulemaking to better prevent the importation of animals that pose zoonotic disease risks. (2) The Department of the Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) has regulations to prevent imports of nonnative live animals that could become invasive. However, it has not generally emphasized preventing the introduction of disease through importation. FWS is taking some initial steps to address disease risks. For example, in January 2010, the department directed FWS to review statutory authorities and regulations to address existing problems concerning nonnative live animals and recommend tools to better prevent the introduction of new threats. In contrast, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has regulations to prevent importing live animals it finds may pose a disease risk to agricultural animals. In 2008, APHIS issued a long-term strategy that would broaden its oversight of live animal imports. APHIS, the Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection (CBP), CDC, and FWS have collaborated to meet their responsibilities related to live animal imports by taking actions in five areas--strategic planning, joint strategies, written procedures, leveraging resources, and sharing data. However, experts GAO surveyed and agency officials GAO interviewed identified barriers to further collaboration on live animal imports, such as different program priorities and unclear roles and responsibilities, which are inherent when multiple agencies have related responsibilities. For example, experts noted that because each of the agencies is focused on a different aspect of live animal imports, no single entity has comprehensive responsibility for the zoonotic and animal disease risks posed by live animal imports. Experts also reported the need for an entity to help the agencies overcome these barriers to collaboration. Furthermore, the agencies have largely incompatible data systems, and a completion date for CBP's planned data system, which would provide the agencies with full operational access to information on incoming shipments of live animals, has not been established. In addition, APHIS, CBP, CDC, and FWS have yet to jointly determine which data elements on live animal imports are needed in this system for them to effectively oversee these imports, according to CBP officials. As a result, it is unclear whether the data elements in the completed system will meet interagency needs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Secretaries of Agriculture, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, and the Interior develop a strategy to address barriers to agency collaboration that may allow potentially risky imported animals into the United States and jointly determine data needs to effectively oversee imported animals.

However, these imports have the potential to transmit zoonotic diseases\u2014 infectious diseases that can be transmitted between animals and humans  and can cause a substantial number of deaths. Furthermore, zoonotic  diseases have represented about 75 percent of newly emerging infectious  diseases in recent years. Because of growing international trade and travel,  these zoonotic diseases can emerge anywhere and spread rapidly around  the globe, as demonstrated by the 2003 outbreak of severe acute  respiratory syndrome (SARS), a viral respiratory illness that caused  pneumonia in most patients and was responsible for over 700 deaths in  East Asia and 43 deaths in Canada. Over the past few years, another  zoonotic disease, a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza, killed  millions of wild and domestic birds worldwide and infected over 400  people, more than half of whom died. The spread of zoonotic diseases, as  well as other diseases affecting only animals, can take a major economic  toll on many industries. For example, the highly pathogenic avian  influenza in East Asia cost the affected economies an estimated $10  billion. In the United States, an outbreak of exotic Newcastle disease\u2014a  contagious and fatal viral disease affecting birds\u2014resulted in the  destruction of over 4.5 million birds in 2002 and 2003 at a cost of more  than $395 million in lost trade.", "The laws governing the importation of live animals include five statutes  that are implemented by four agencies. Specifically,    Animal Health Protection Act. The U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s  (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) may prohibit  imports of particular animals to prevent the introduction of any pest or  disease affecting agricultural animals, such as cattle, horses, poultry, and  swine.", "Lacey Act.

Taking into account the nation\u2019s  long-range fiscal challenges, we noted that the federal government must  identify ways to deliver results more efficiently and in a way that is  consistent with its multiple demands and limited resources. We also  identified key practices that can help enhance and sustain federal  agencies\u2019 collaboration. In addition, we have previously reported on the  need to collaborate on animal disease issues. For example, we reported in  2007 on the steps that USDA took to prepare for highly pathogenic avian  influenza in poultry and recommended that USDA and DHS clarify their  roles during emergency responses to a disease outbreak. Both USDA and  DHS officials told us that they have taken preliminary steps to clarify and  better define their coordination roles. For example, the two agencies meet  on a regular basis to discuss such coordination.", "In this context, you asked us to examine (1) potential gaps in the statutory  and regulatory framework governing live animal imports, if any, that may  allow the introduction and spread of zoonotic and animal diseases; (2) the  extent to which APHIS, CBP, CDC, and FWS collaborate to meet their  responsibilities and face barriers, if any, to collaboration; and (3) the  performance information that the responsible agencies have reported on  live animal imports.", "To identify potential gaps in the statutory and regulatory framework, we  reviewed relevant statutes, the agencies\u2019 implementing regulations, and  other agency documents. We also reviewed APHIS and FWS data on the  number, type, and exporting country of all imported animals regulated by  these two agencies for fiscal years 2005 through 2009. For the APHIS and  FWS data, we analyzed documentation related to the data, and worked  with agency officials to identify data problems, and determined the data  were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of providing background to this  report. To obtain information on potential gaps in the statutory and  regulatory framework as well as agencies\u2019 processes for overseeing live  animal imports, we interviewed officials at agency headquarters and ports  of entry\u2014airports in Atlanta, Baltimore, Los Angeles, New York, and  Washington, D.C., and the land border crossings with Mexico at Otay Mesa  and San Ysidro, California. At these ports, we focused our review on the  legal importation of live animals and not on agencies\u2019 actions to prevent  animal smuggling. We also reviewed scientific studies on zoonotic and  animal diseases, including studies by the National Academies of Sciences.", "To examine the extent to which the four agencies collaborate to meet their  responsibilities and face barriers, if any, to collaboration, we reviewed  each agency\u2019s strategic plans, policies, and protocols; reviewed  documentation on the allocation of staff resources; and interviewed  headquarters officials. We also examined the degree to which the agencies\u2019  collaborative efforts reflected the key practices we had identified that can  help enhance and sustain collaboration among federal agencies.", "To address the first two objectives, we also conducted a two-round survey  to identify potential gaps in the current statutory and regulatory  framework, how well responsible agencies collaborate to meet their  responsibilities, and potential barriers to collaboration. The first round of  the survey was conducted from January through February 2010, and the  second round was conducted from April through May 2010. We identified  knowledgeable experts who had primary employment responsibilities  related to or dependent on live animal imports, authored peer-reviewed  papers, presented at professional conferences, provided testimony on the  subject matter to Congress, or were recognized by their peers as experts  on live animal imports. To ensure a cross section of different sectors, we  selected experts from federal and state government, academia,  nongovernmental organizations, and industry to obtain a broad spectrum  of opinions. For the first round, we sent surveys that consisted of open- ended questions (questions that solicit additional information) to our  initial list of 39 experts, and we received responses from 33, resulting in a  response rate of about 85 percent. On the basis of recommendations  provided by those responding in our first round and other experts, we  expanded our list of experts to 64 for the survey\u2019s second round, which  consisted of closed-ended questions (questions with a set of answers to  choose from). Of these 64 experts, we received responses from 56,  resulting in a response rate of about 88 percent for the second round.", "To examine the performance information the responsible agencies have  reported on live animal imports in their planning and reporting documents,  we reviewed strategic plans, operational plans, mission statements, and  annual performance plans and reports from APHIS, CBP, CDC, and FWS.

APHIS restricts the importation of live animals that it has  determined may pose a disease risk to agricultural animals, such as cattle,  horses, poultry, sheep, and swine. APHIS requires that many of the  animals it regulates be visually inspected at the port of entry and generally  requires the animals be accompanied by health certificates signed by a  licensed veterinarian in the country of export and import permits. APHIS  determines the level of inspection for animals on the basis of their  associated disease risk, for both the type of animal and country of export.  As a result of this determination, APHIS may restrict imports of certain  animals from certain countries or require that animals undergo quarantine  and disease testing. APHIS veterinarians inspect live animal imports at 15  land ports along the border with Mexico, 20 land ports along the border  with Canada, and 30 airports across the continental United States, and in  Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. In addition, APHIS maintains animal  quarantine facilities in southern California, southern Florida, and New  York state and oversees private quarantine facilities for birds and horses in  southern California. At these quarantine facilities, imported animals are  held until test results for various diseases are received.", "CBP. CBP assists other federal agencies in enforcing their import  regulations, has the primary authority to inspect imports, and seeks to  interdict shipments of contraband and the illegal importation of live  animals and other products while facilitating the flow of legal travel and  trade. According to CBP officials, when a live animal shipment arrives at a  port of entry, CBP holds and refers the shipment to the responsible agency  or agencies. CBP holds the import until an agency representative is  available to release it. After the responsible regulating agency has released  the import, CBP clears the import for entry into the United States. CBP  staff are present at more than 300 land, air, and sea ports of entry and are  trained in the procedures to follow when live animals are presented for  customs clearance.", "CDC. CDC restricts the importation of live animals that it has determined  pose a risk to public health. CDC\u2019s restrictions on these imports vary by  type of animal and can include banning certain imports, requiring permits,  requiring vaccination certificates, and requiring quarantine. CDC staff are  not present at all ports of entry to routinely inspect live animal imports.  According to CDC officials, CDC relies on APHIS, CBP, and FWS staff to  enforce its regulations at ports of entry. When the agencies\u2019 staff have  questions about enforcing CDC\u2019s regulations, they are to contact CDC  quarantine public health officers, who are often located at a CDC  quarantine station that is at or near the port of entry. CDC has 20  quarantine stations in the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and  Puerto Rico.", "FWS. FWS restricts the importation of certain wildlife. Specifically, FWS  restricts the importation of injurious wildlife and threatened or  endangered species and related species for which international trade is  regulated under international agreements. Injurious wildlife includes  animals that are individually listed in the Lacey Act or prescribed in FWS  regulations to be injurious to human beings; to the interests of agriculture,  horticulture, or forestry; or to wildlife or the wildlife resources of the  United States. FWS seeks to prevent the introduction of invasive species  as injurious wildlife under the Lacey Act. Invasive species are alien (or  nonnative) species whose introduction does, or is likely to, cause  economic or environmental harm or harm to human health. At ports of  entry, FWS wildlife inspectors review the required import documents and,  for some live animal shipments, perform visual inspections. If FWS  determines that the animals are prohibited from importation based on  FWS regulations, for example, are injurious to wildlife or threatened or  endangered species, it rejects the import unless it has an FWS permit,  which may be issued under certain conditions, such as educational  purposes. FWS has about 120 wildlife inspectors who handle shipments at  49 ports of entry nationwide, including 7 land ports along the Mexican  border, 24 land ports along the Canadian border, and 18 designated ports  for air, ocean, rail, and truck across the continental United States and in  Alaska and Hawaii."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Number, Type, and Purpose of Live Animals Imports", "paragraphs": ["APHIS and FWS data systems provide information on the number of and  purpose for live animal imports, as well as on the country from which the  import has been shipped into the United States in recent years.

Instead, they relied on the experience and  expertise of port staff and import center officials. In addition, a 2008 audit  report on APHIS\u2019s controls over live animal imports indicated that APHIS  relies on health certificates from the exporting country to certify the  animal\u2019s health condition, age, and other import requirements. However,  the report stated, APHIS does not have adequate processes to determine  whether individual problems detected represent a larger systemic  noncompliance that needs to be addressed by agency inspection personnel  or the exporting country.

That is, CDC restricts imports of some animals to  prevent the introduction of specific diseases: nonhuman primates, to  prevent the spread of tuberculosis, among other things; bats, to prevent  the introduction of a variety of infectious pathogens, including Ebola virus;  rodents from Africa, to prevent monkeypox; dogs and cats, to prevent  zoonotic diseases in general and rabies in dogs; and certain turtles, to  prevent Salmonella. In 2004, CDC banned the importation of birds from  specified countries based on the threat that imports from such countries  increased the risk that highly pathogenic avian influenza may be  introduced into the United States. In 2009, CDC rescinded this ban.

For example,    While CDC generally requires proof of current rabies vaccination and the  confinement of most dogs for up to 30 days after vaccination, it has  received reports of large-volume shipments of puppies intended for  immediate resale. According to agency officials, these animals often  appear younger than the age on their accompanying documents, that is,  they are too young to receive an effective rabies vaccination, and their  vaccination status is questionable. In addition, according to agency  officials, if CDC finds at ports of entry that a dog was not vaccinated for  rabies, the agency allows it to enter, if the owner agrees to keep the dog  confined until it can be properly vaccinated and then confined for an  additional 30 days following vaccination to prevent the potential spread of  rabies. However, state and local agencies that are to monitor confinement  frequently lack resources to do so, according to CDC officials.", "CDC\u2019s regulations do not require rabies vaccinations for cats, which are  highly susceptible to certain strains of rabies virus and can also transmit  the infection to humans.", "In addition, experts responding to our survey told us that CDC generally  reacts only when a zoonotic disease problem arises. For example, since  the 1970s it has been well known that monkeypox, a zoonotic disease, was  endemic to Africa. However, according CDC officials, CDC did not have a  process to conduct a risk assessment on the potential movement of  monkeypox to the United States. Furthermore, they said, if such a risk  assessment process had been in place, CDC might have restricted the  importation of certain animals from Africa. After a 2003 outbreak of  monkeypox in the United States, which sickened over 70 people, CDC  restricted the importation of African rodents and other animals that may  carry the monkeypox virus. However, CDC still allows the importation of  rodents from countries outside of Africa, and these imported rodents are  not subject to examination to determine whether they may be carrying  zoonotic disease. Furthermore, according to experts responding to our  survey and CDC officials, the importation of many other wildlife species is  allowed with little or no screening for zoonotic disease risks. For example,  mice, rats, and gerbils are not screened for zoonotic diseases, but the  animal family that includes these animals has been found to harbor 21  zoonotic diseases.", "CDC\u2019s regulation of live animal imports does not sufficiently protect  against zoonotic disease risks, according to the experts responding to our  survey and scientific studies. According to 50 of the 55 experts responding  to our survey question about CDC\u2019s statutory and regulatory framework,  changes are needed. For example, 40 of the 51 experts responding to a  question in our survey strongly or somewhat supported giving CDC the  authority to use pre-import screening, such as a process that assesses  disease risk by species and country and determines allowable imports on  the basis of that assessment. CDC is considering other regulatory  mechanisms that would allow CDC to suspend the entry of animal imports  into the United States from designated foreign countries for public health  reasons. Decisions to suspend animal imports from designated foreign  countries would be based on the existence of a communicable disease in  that country and the likelihood that allowing such imports would increase  the likelihood of introducing disease into the United States. While these  regulatory mechanisms are not specifically \u201cpre-import screening,\u201d these  mechanisms may serve the same purpose.", "The CDC officials we interviewed acknowledged gaps in the agency\u2019s  regulation of live animal imports for zoonotic diseases. To address this  problem, in 2007, CDC issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking  on live animal imports to take steps to better prevent the introduction of  zoonotic disease into the United States. The questions raised in the  advance notice of proposed rulemaking include whether CDC should (1)  establish a regulation that maintains a list of species or categories of high- risk animals for which importation is restricted (e.g., either prohibited  from entry or subject to certain requirements), (2) apply these potential  restrictions to broad taxonomic groupings (e.g., all rodents) or individual  species, (3) issue these potential restrictions on a limited geographical  basis (i.e., certain countries or regions) or more broadly, and (4) make  rabies vaccination a requirement for entry into the United States for all  dogs and cats. CDC is currently analyzing the comments that it received,  revising the proposed language, and conducting economic analyses. CDC  expects to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in 2011."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Although FWS Has Regulations for Injurious Wildlife, It Does Not Restrict the Entry of Imported Wildlife That May Pose Disease Risks", "paragraphs": ["Under the authority of the Lacey Act, FWS has implemented regulations to  restrict imports of various types of nonnative live animals that have been  identified as injurious wildlife because, for example, they could become  invasive. However, FWS\u2019s regulations allow other types of wildlife to enter  the United States with little assessment of the disease risk or health status  of the animal, despite the possible presence of diseases in animals that are  not endemic to the United States. For example, FWS does not restrict the  importation of live amphibians or assess their risk for the presence of  disease, creating a risk that the Bd fungus (Batrachochytrium  dendrobatidis)\u2014which causes a highly contagious disease that is  potentially fatal to amphibians\u2014will continue to enter and spread. The  Department of the Interior has been petitioned by the Defenders of Wildlife  to ban imports of live amphibians unless they are free of the Bd pathogen.  As of September 2010, the department planned to gather information from  the public before deciding whether to develop a regulation in response to  this petition. Furthermore, the Lacey Act\u2019s process to ban the importation of  injurious wildlife often requires too much time for the process to be  effective, according to FWS officials and experts responding to our survey.  On average, it takes about 4 years for FWS to identify a species or group of  species as injurious wildlife. During this time, the animals in question  continue to be imported into the United States.", "In addition, according to FWS officials, FWS inspectors visually inspect  some live wildlife imports, which may include observation for signs of  disease, but they are not veterinarians, and they do not have expertise in  detecting diseased animals. Furthermore, experts responding to our  survey said that visual inspections have limited effectiveness in detecting  diseased animals. They noted that it is often difficult to distinguish  between a healthy, uninfected animal and an apparently healthy but  infected animal, and even healthy animals can carry pathogens that could  harm other species or humans but not harm the host.", "In written comments to our survey, some experts reported that the Lacey  Act should be amended to better prevent the importation of live animals  that pose disease risks, while other experts said FWS should use its  current authority to improve its regulations in this area.

According to Department of the  Interior testimony provided at a March 2010 hearing on invasive species,  FWS is reviewing several proposals to create a more proactive and  comprehensive approach to preventing the spread of invasive species,  including streamlining the evaluation process, examining gaps that the  Lacey Act\u2019s injurious wildlife provisions leave in the listing process,  revising its risk assessment process, and supporting improved regulatory  and educational approaches."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agencies Have Collaborated to Meet Their Responsibilities, but Experts and Agency Officials Identified Barriers to Further Collaboration", "paragraphs": ["APHIS, CBP, CDC, and FWS have collaborated to meet their  responsibilities by taking actions in five areas\u2014strategic planning, joint  strategies, written procedures, leveraging resources, and sharing data\u2014 but experts responding to our survey and agency officials we interviewed  identified barriers to further collaboration on live animal imports.

Experts also identified  the need for an entity to help the agencies overcome these barriers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Although Agencies Have Collaborated to Meet Common Goals, They Face Barriers to Additional Collaboration", "paragraphs": ["Strategic planning. APHIS, CBP, CDC, and FWS have engaged in strategic  planning that recognizes the need for joint efforts to reduce the risks of  zoonotic and animal diseases from live animal imports. Specifically,  according to APHIS\u2019s 2007-through-2012 strategic plan, it is working with  CBP to reduce pest and disease threats at the borders. The strategic plan  also states that the agency\u2019s risk assessment protocols must recognize the  growing importance of zoonotic diseases and the need to work with public  health agencies to reduce the risk of these diseases. Within APHIS, the  program office of Veterinary Services\u2019 strategic plan\u2014VS2015\u2014states that  Veterinary Services intends to meet future animal health challenges, such  as emerging zoonotic and animal diseases, by 2015. According to this plan,  Veterinary Services will expand its mission to include public health  concerns connected to any type of animal. In addition, the plan states that  Veterinary Services will work with wildlife entities to address health issues  that affect the health of both agricultural animals and wildlife. Such  collaboration would involve working with CDC and FWS. According to  CBP\u2019s strategic plan for 2009 through 2014, CBP is actively pursuing new  relationships with CDC to enhance CBP\u2019s response to public health  threats. CDC officials told us that it has identified a strategic goal to  enhance CDC\u2019s ability to prevent, detect, and respond to zoonotic diseases  associated with the importation of live animals. Furthermore, according  to FWS\u2019s law enforcement strategic plan for 2006 through 2010, increased  coordination will be required with agencies (such as CDC and APHIS) that  are responsible for addressing linkages between wildlife trade and the  cross-border spread of zoonotic and animal diseases.", "As we have previously reported, federal agencies can use their strategic  and annual performance plans as tools to drive collaboration with other  agencies and partners and establish complementary goals and strategies  for achieving results. While the agencies\u2019 strategic planning addresses  some concerns about the disease risk from live imported animals, it does  not specify how they will collaborate to address the risk of disease from  live animal imports. Such specificity is difficult, according to several  experts responding to our survey, in part because the agencies\u2019 program  priorities are based on different missions, constituencies, and priorities. In  particular, experts responding to our survey noted that because each of  the agencies is focused on a different aspect of live animal imports, no  single entity has comprehensive responsibility for the zoonotic and animal  diseases risks posed by live animal imports. As one expert noted, the  principal barrier to collaboration is agencies\u2019 \u201cfailure to take a broader  view of the entire importation process,\u201d focusing instead on only those  components of the process each agency controls under its statutory  authority. As we have previously reported, when agencies do not have a  compelling rationale, such as legislation, directives, or their perceptions of  the benefits from collaboration, it is difficult to overcome differences in  missions and priorities and to define and articulate a common outcome  that is consistent with their respective agency missions. However, as the  One Health concept recognizes, human and animal diseases are  interconnected. In this regard, the federal agencies that are responsible for  live animal imports appear to have a common goal\u2014preventing the  introduction and spread of zoonotic and animal diseases from live animal  imports.", "Joint strategies to reduce disease risk from imported live animals.  Several of the agencies we reviewed participated in joint strategies to  directly or indirectly address risks posed by imported live animals. For  example,    APHIS, FWS, and the Department of Commerce\u2019s National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration jointly developed the National Aquatic  Animal Health Plan in 2008. Under this plan, the agencies are to prepare  coordinated research and development strategies and budget  recommendations to provide a framework for how the three agencies  should develop programs for diseases that affect the health of aquatic  animals, including finfish, crustaceans, and mollusks. Activities  addressed in the plan include (1) defining pathogens of national concern;  (2) preventing, controlling, and managing pathogens or the diseases  caused by those pathogens; (3) describing and implementing surveillance  programs; and (4) describing strategies for continued outreach and  awareness regarding national aquatic animal health strategies and the  plan. As of July 2010, an advisory committee was being formed and a  surveillance network had been established for viral hemorrhagic  septicemia, a deadly infectious fish disease that affects 28 susceptible  species of fresh and saltwater fish and is a growing threat in the Great  Lakes region. While this plan is not fully launched, experts responding to  our survey commented that the effort has strengthened collaboration  among international, federal, and state partners. According to the  Department of the Interior, this plan is a model for federal cooperation  with regard to movement of aquatic animal diseases, and it will be  broadened to include amphibians and reptiles in the future.", "The National Invasive Species Council\u2019s 2008-2012 National Invasive  Species Management Plan, which is the council\u2019s primary coordination  tool for the prevention and control of invasive species, includes an  objective to expand the coordination of invasive species programs and  expenditures to leverage resources. It also directs the relevant agencies to  update the budget for federal agencies\u2019 expenditures concerning invasive  species. The council expects to report on the plan\u2019s progress in October  2010. APHIS, CBP, and FWS have participated in the council since its  inception, while CDC has recently rejoined the group.", "The Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force\u2014an intergovernmental  organization composed of 13 federal agencies, including FWS, APHIS, and  the Department of Commerce\u2019s National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration\u2014is working to prevent and control aquatic nuisance  species. The task force was established by the Nonindigenous Aquatic  Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990. In 2007, the task force  developed a strategic plan for 2007 through 2012 that includes an objective  for analyzing and evaluating rapid response plans, including plans for  foreign animal disease events, to see how they could apply to reported  introductions of invasive species. In addition, the task force and the  National Invasive Species Council have identified various pathways by  which pathogens can be introduced into the country. These pathways  include container water in which aquatic animals are transported.  According to FWS officials, this container water can contain pathogens  and, in some instances, importers may not disinfect the water before  disposing of it.", "In 2009, APHIS, CBP, CDC, and several southern California animal  agencies formed a task force to address issues with the importation of  puppies, such as reducing and eliminating the illegal smuggling and selling  of dogs that are underage, in poor health, or do not have the required  health certifications.", "These strategies are positive steps toward furthering the common goal of  preventing disease risk from live animal imports. As we have previously  reported, collaborating agencies need to establish strategies that work in  concert with those of their partners or are joint in nature. Such strategies  help in aligning the partner agencies\u2019 activities, core processes, and  resources to accomplish the common outcome. In addition, all 56 experts  responding to our survey indicated that it is very or moderately important  for the federal agencies to collaborate to develop a coordinated national  strategy to better align activities, processes, and resources.", "According to the experts responding to our survey, the agencies develop  joint strategies to respond quickly to emergencies as they arise, but the  agencies tend to develop joint strategies in reaction to an identified  problem, rather than in anticipation of it. For example, one expert noted  that the outbreak of monkeypox in 2003 spread to prairie dogs and  subsequently to humans. The expert, as well as CDC officials, commented  that although this outbreak was addressed promptly, it might have been  avoided if officials had considered the risk of this disease and taken  appropriate actions before an outbreak occurred.", "Several studies and CDC officials also cited the need for a formal joint  strategy to prevent the introduction of zoonotic and animal diseases, such  as a comprehensive risk assessment system, and for responding to health  risks, such as having plans and resources for early detection and response.  Experts also commented that the development of such a system should  focus on how live animal imports affect the health of humans, agricultural  animals, and wildlife. Moreover, the 2005 National Academies of Sciences  report noted that the animal health infrastructure does not have formal  and comprehensive science-based risk analysis systems for anticipating  potential challenges to animal health. In addition, experts responding to  our survey commented that a comprehensive risk assessment system  should be established on the basis of an analysis of imported animals to  assess the threat that these animals pose. The experts stated that the  components of this risk assessment system might include an analysis of  the species\u2019 exporting country, diseases of concern, typical packaging and  delivery times, and methods of shipment of concern, among other things.  Suggested uses of the risk assessment include targeting passengers and  cargo most likely to be carrying prohibited animals, and making decisions  based on this information. According to experts responding to our survey,  agencies could use this information to determine whether the importation  of particular species from certain countries should be banned and which  animals require pre-import screening, including the increased use of  disease testing and quarantine at the ports of entry. For example, such risk  assessment could be similar to APHIS\u2019s process, which assesses the  disease risk within defined regions on a consistent and scientific basis and  evaluates the animal health status of countries or regions requesting  approval to import live animals into the United States.", "Written procedures for ports of entry. The four agencies have written  procedures to follow when working with other federal agencies at ports of  entry. In particular, three of the agencies\u2014APHIS, CBP, and FWS\u2014signed  a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on forfeiture that lays out the  specific roles and responsibilities each has for seizing, quarantining, and  disposing of birds that are brought into the United States in violation of  laws or regulations. In addition, APHIS and CBP signed an MOU that  outlines the agencies\u2019 roles for entry and inspection of the imported  animals that APHIS regulates. Two of the four agencies\u2014APHIS and  CBP\u2014also have other types of written procedures, while CDC is  developing guidance, according to CDC officials. Specifically,    APHIS has guidance that outlines the procedures and responsibilities that  its division of Veterinary Services is to follow with CBP in handling legally  and illegally imported pet and performing birds arriving as passenger  baggage, from when the birds arrive at the port of entry until they are  released to enter into the United States or refused entry. For example, the  guidance specifies which birds are eligible for entry and which agency is  responsible for (1) transferring birds to a quarantine station and (2)  obtaining supplies for handling the birds.", "CBP has a standard operating procedure that informs its staff at ports of  entry of procedures to follow in handling shipments of APHIS-regulated  live fish. Specifically, if the species has been approved by APHIS for  import, CBP staff are to allow it to proceed; if the species has not already  been approved, then the staff are to hold the shipment for Veterinary  Services; if the species is not regulated by APHIS, CBP is to hold the  shipment for USDA\u2019s Agricultural Marketing Service, which administers  programs that facilitate the marketing of U.S. agricultural products.", "CBP and APHIS have written guidance for coordinating their processing of  live animals arriving at Canadian land border ports of entry.", "CBP and APHIS have written procedures for the importation of livestock  at four Mexican land border ports of entry and certain cattle at all Mexican  land border ports of entry.", "CBP has written procedures to help its port staff make appropriate  referrals to other agencies.", "According to CDC officials, the agency is developing internal standard  operating procedures to distribute to its staff at ports of entry on CDC- regulated animals. The officials said the first such guidance will be on how  to handle imported turtles, although the officials did not know when this  guidance would be issued.", "While the agencies have developed some written procedures, officials told  us that they do not have written procedures for all animal imports. In the  absence of written procedures, agencies collaborate informally at ports of  entry on how to handle incoming shipments. Specifically, according to  FWS headquarters officials we spoke with, FWS and CDC port officials  regularly coordinate on physical inspections of live animals they both  regulate, such as nonhuman primates, turtles and tortoises, and bats. For  example, according to CBP officials, when turtles are imported into the  United States, CBP usually contacts FWS inspectors. According to FWS  officials, if the type of turtle being imported is not banned, FWS may  contact CDC or APHIS for inspection or further action if it believes there  is potential for another type of violation, such as undersized turtles that  pose a risk for Salmonella (CDC) or turtles with ticks that may have  Heartwater infection (APHIS), a potentially fatal disease to cattle. In  addition, officials at ports of entry from CBP and APHIS told us that they  usually have access to an official from another agency to speak with if  questions arise about a shipment. For example, CBP officials at several  ports told us they contact APHIS, CDC, and FWS officials informally  through e-mails, telephone calls, and in person in order to verify that  procedures are being followed for live animal imports they regulate.  Finally, some experts responding to our survey noted that officials at some  ports have cultivated effective collaborative relationships.", "However, we have previously reported that by using informal coordination  mechanisms, agencies may rely on relationships with individual officials to  ensure effective collaboration and that these informal relationships could  end once personnel move to their next assignments. Without written  procedures, agencies\u2019 roles and responsibilities are not clearly defined. We  reported that agencies can strengthen their commitment to work  collaboratively by articulating their roles and responsibilities in formal  documents to facilitate decision making. Such formal documents can  include MOUs, interagency guidance, or interagency planning documents,  signed by senior officials in the respective agencies. These documents can  clarify which agencies will be responsible for particular activities, and how  they will organize their joint and individual efforts.", "Experts responding to our survey generally agreed that uncertainty about  agencies\u2019 roles and responsibilities for imported animals is a barrier,  particularly for species that are (1) not regulated for disease risk by any  agency or (2) regulated by more than one agency. For example, several of  the experts noted that federal regulations do not address the risk to  human and animal health posed by the importation of most nonnative wild  animals, such as non-African rodents, and that where regulations do allow  for the import of nonnative wild animals, no disease assessment is made.  In addition, the agencies do not have written procedures for all species  that are regulated by more than one agency, such as reptiles. For example,  APHIS and FWS do not have a written procedure to coordinate their  shared responsibilities for regulating reptiles\u2014which are a source of  Salmonella infection in humans and also carry disease-causing parasites.", "Leveraging resources. APHIS, CBP, CDC, and FWS have taken steps to  leverage resources\u2014staff and funding\u2014to enhance their ability to address  disease risks associated with live animal imports. For example,    APHIS has provided CDC headquarters with a liaison to represent USDA\u2019s  interests on a broad range of topics, including live animal imports, and  shares information with CDC on zoonotic diseases. CDC officials stated  that they are currently exploring the possibility of establishing a DHS  liaison.", "APHIS, FWS, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the Department of Commerce\u2019s  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration worked together to  launch two national campaigns designed to help the public understand its  role in preventing the introduction and spread of zoonotic and animal  diseases. The first campaign, called \u201cStop Aquatic Hitchhikers,\u201d is directed  toward the public who engage in aquatic activities to, among other things,  prevent the spread of invasive species, zoonotic diseases, and animal  pathogens. The second campaign, \u201cHabitattitude,\u201d is directed toward,  among others, pet owners to promote environmentally friendly behaviors,  such as not releasing nonnative pets into the environment.", "While the agencies have worked together to leverage their resources, they  do not separate the amount of funding and level of staff for live animal  imports from other agency activities. As a result, they may not be able to  determine whether their funding and staff are sufficient, and the extent to  which they could be leveraged in a collaborative effort. Furthermore, the  four agencies vary significantly in the extent to which they have resources  for regulating live animal imports, according to agency officials and  experts responding to our survey. For example, APHIS has staff who  perform services\u2014such as review of information provided by foreign  governments\u2014to support assessments of the risk of live animal imports  into the United States. In addition, APHIS has quarantine facilities that  inspect and test imports for diseases prior to an animal being released into  the United States. In contrast, FWS does not have similar resources for  assessing risk and has no quarantine facilities. The experts responding to  our survey also noted that resource constraints, such as limited facilities  and staff, make it difficult for the four agencies to devote enough time to  collaboration when they face time constraints in completing daily tasks.  The experts responding to our survey noted that under these conditions it  is challenging for the agencies to collaborate.", "As we have previously reported, collaborating agencies should identify the  human, information technology, physical, and financial resources needed  to initiate or sustain their collaborative effort. By assessing their relative  strengths and limitations, collaborating agencies can look for  opportunities to obtain additional benefits that would not be available if  they were working separately. Forty-nine of the 54 experts who responded  to a survey question about leveraging resources strongly or somewhat  supported leveraging APHIS resources to assist FWS in preventing the  importation of animal diseases, and 48 indicated that APHIS resources  should be leveraged to assist CDC in preventing the importation of  zoonotic diseases. In addition, according to APHIS officials we spoke with,  APHIS has expertise that could assist FWS and CDC in assessing disease  risks in other countries. Furthermore, 50 of 56 experts responding to our  survey reported that it is very or moderately important for federal agencies  to collaborate to develop a plan to maximize existing resources.", "Data sharing. As we have reported, agencies can facilitate collaboration  by coordinating data information systems for carrying out shared  objectives. According to CBP officials, the agency is developing the  International Trade Data System (ITDS) within the Automated  Commercial Environment (ACE) system. ACE will serve as a Web-based  portal for exchanging trade information among federal agencies that share  the responsibility for facilitating international trade. Currently, APHIS  and FWS can access data, such as importer data and other related  information, but cannot enter information into the system. In its 2009  Report to Congress on the International Trade Data System, CBP stated  that agencies participating in ITDS, including APHIS, CDC, and FWS, have  formed working groups to ensure, among other things, that data elements  are identified and specified to the detail necessary in shipment  information. For example, according to agency officials, a working group  of agencies that use data on or oversee imported eggs was formed. While  agencies do not yet have access to an integrated data system, agency  officials and experts responding to our survey identified efforts to share  data. For example, FWS has shared its data with CDC to identify possible  health risks from imports of nonnative wildlife. In addition, according to  APHIS officials, the agency is beginning to implement terminology in its  trade database that is consistent with CBP\u2019s so that the agencies can share  information about incoming shipments.", "According to CBP officials, APHIS, CDC, FWS and other agencies will  ultimately be able to enter and retrieve information using the ACE system.  However, CBP officials do not have a target date for when APHIS, CBP,  CDC, and FWS would have full operational access to ACE, and they stated  that a unified data system has been a goal since 1995; ITDS has been  ongoing since 2006. In addition, while the agencies participating in ITDS  have formed workgroups for some types of trade data, APHIS, CBP, CDC,  and FWS have yet to jointly determine which data elements are needed for  them to effectively oversee live animal imports, according to CBP officials.  As a result, it is unclear whether the data in the completed system will  meet interagency needs.", "Until ITDS is completed, the agencies responsible for live animal imports  continue to collect and rely on data that are not easily shared. Experts  responding to our survey pointed out that the agencies have not linked  their data systems so that they can share information on live animal  shipments, as well as track violations. In particular, APHIS and FWS  maintain separate databases that contain information on shipments of  animals that they regulate, and CBP maintains a database on all imports,  including live animals. However, the three databases do not interface, so  that agencies regulating the same shipment of live animals can have access  to the same information at the same time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Experts Responding to Our Survey Identified the Need for an Entity to Help the Agencies Overcome Barriers to Collaboration", "paragraphs": ["The experts responding to our survey, including federal and state agency  officials, also generally pointed to the need for some formal entity to help  overcome barriers to achieving their common interest in preventing the  importation of animals that may be carrying zoonotic or animal diseases.

For example, APHIS reported  that in fiscal year 2009 it conducted risk assessments on the animal health  status of at least 14 foreign countries that have been denied access to U.S.  import markets. In fiscal year 2009, APHIS conducted risk analyses in the  European Union for the presence of exotic Newcastle disease, highly  pathogenic avian influenza, and classical swine fever\u2014a highly contagious  virus that can cause high mortality rates in swine populations.

CDC attributed this improvement to its instituting  facility inspections and new infection control requirements.

Of  the three agencies responsible for regulating live animal imports for  disease risks\u2014APHIS, CDC, and FWS\u2014only APHIS comprehensively  assesses an animal\u2019s disease risk or health status, and APHIS has issued a  strategy for expanding its role in overseeing nonagricultural animals. In  contrast, CDC and FWS have gaps in their oversight of disease risks from  live animal imports. CDC\u2019s regulations direct its focus to particular species  or diseases, and the agency does not have a process for identifying risks  from some emerging diseases that could be imported in live animals. FWS  generally does not restrict the entry of imported wildlife that may pose  disease risks and does not generally assess the disease risk or health  status of these animals. Experts responding to our survey indicated that  changes are needed in FWS\u2019s statutory authority, its regulations, or both.  Recognizing such issues, APHIS, CDC, and FWS have separately proposed  additional actions to better protect against disease risks from live  imported animals, including actions that may involve pre-import  screening.", "The four agencies we reviewed have collaborated to meet their  responsibilities to some extent. They have recognized the need to work  together in their strategic planning, formulated some joint strategies,  developed some written procedures for collaboration, leveraged resources  in some situations, and shared some data on live animal imports. However,  experts responding to our survey and agency officials identified barriers to  further collaboration in each of these areas. These barriers\u2014such as  different program priorities and unclear roles and responsibilities\u2014are  inherent when multiple agencies have related responsibilities.  Furthermore, the agencies have largely incompatible data systems, and it  appears that some time will pass before these issues are resolved or ACE  is able to offer a conduit for data sharing among APHIS, CBP, CDC, and  FWS. Because the agencies have not determined which data they will  need, it is also unclear whether the data elements in the latest version of  ACE will meet interagency needs. While these barriers pose a challenge,  the agencies still have a common interest in preventing the introduction of  diseases from live animal imports. Recognizing this common interest, the  experts responding to our survey, including federal and state officials,  reported that increased collaboration through some type of formal entity,  such as a workgroup, is needed to help overcome these barriers.

We interviewed officials from these agencies  at agency headquarters and ports of entry. Using information from  interviews of agency officials and agency documents, we compared the  level of inspection and review used by each of the agencies to regulate the  importation of various types of animals, including mammals, birds, fish,  and reptiles.

The process we followed is based on GAO guidance for  identifying experts for panels or other work requiring expertise in a specific  area. We identified potential experts on disease risk posed by live animal  imports who had primary employment responsibilities related to or  dependent on live animal imports, authored peer-reviewed papers,  presented at professional conferences, provided testimony on the subject  matter to Congress, or were recognized by their peers as experts on live  animal imports. We then selected experts from federal and state  government, academia, nongovernmental organizations, and industry to  obtain a broad spectrum of views. We conducted pretests with several  survey recipients prior to distributing both surveys. The goals of the pretests  were to ensure that (1) the questions were clear and unambiguous and (2)  terminology was used correctly. The first round of the survey consisted of  five open-ended questions (questions that solicit additional information) in  which experts provided their opinions on gaps in the current statutory and  regulatory framework, how well the responsible federal agencies work  together to meet their responsibilities, and potential barriers to  collaboration.

APHIS has developed import processes that depend on  the level of risk associated with either the type of animal or country of  export. APHIS has a memorandum of agreement with CBP whereby CBP  refers live animal shipments to APHIS port veterinarians for inspection.  APHIS port veterinarians visually inspect all applicable live animal  shipments and review the import documentation, which may include a  declaration of importation, vaccination records, and health certificates  from a licensed veterinarian in the country of export. APHIS requires that  most imported animals that it regulates be accompanied by a health  certificate. A licensed veterinarian in the country of export inspects the  animals and then signs the health certificate certifying the health status of  the animals and whether U.S. requirements are met. The most common  type of certification states that the animals to be imported were inspected  and determined to be free of communicable disease.", "If the animals do not pass inspection, the animals are either quarantined  and then reinspected or are refused entry. For example, if cattle from  Mexico fail a visual inspection for tick-free status, they are dipped and  quarantined for 10 to 14 days and then presented for a second inspection.  If ticks are found during the second inspection, the cattle will be rejected,  branded as rejected, and sent back to Mexico. For those animals that  require quarantine, such as horses, importers are required to reserve space  at either an APHIS-managed animal import center or an APHIS-approved  private quarantine facility. During the quarantine, the animal undergoes  disease testing. Animals that test positive for a regulated disease are  refused entry into the United States.", "APHIS has established processes for specific animals and exporting  countries. For example, for imports from Canada and Mexico, APHIS has  established streamlined processes, such as eliminating requirements for  permits or quarantine for some animals. Additionally, commercial birds\u2014 birds that are imported for resale, breeding, or public display\u2014entering  the United States through a land border from Canada are not required to  have a permit or undergo quarantine, as long as they are accompanied by a  veterinary health certificate from a Canadian government veterinarian.  Commercial birds not imported from Canada are required to be  quarantined and tested for avian influenza. In some instances, APHIS  restricts the importation of animals based on risk. For example, APHIS  restricts the import of commercial birds from countries with highly  pathogenic avian influenza and cattle from countries with foot-and-mouth  disease. An example of species-specific regulation can be found with  imports of fish susceptible to Spring viremia of carp; such species include  the common carp and goldfish. APHIS checks that these imports have the  required documents, visually checks the shipments to ensure that they are  not leaking or emitting an atypical odor, and assesses the animals\u2019 disease  status if the shipment is chosen for inspection.", "APHIS relies on a manual process to account for and track the movement  of the live animal imports from CBP to APHIS inspection at the border and  to their final destination. According to agency officials, APHIS is  developing an automated data system, the Veterinary Services Process  Streamlining System, which is expected to replace the existing manual,  paper-oriented process and will track live animal imports, exports,  interstate movement of animals, and veterinary accreditation. According  to APHIS officials, the new system became operational in June 2010 and  will be able to track live animal imports in calendar year 2011.", "CBP assists APHIS, CDC, and FWS in enforcing their import regulations,  has the primary authority to inspect imports, and seeks to interdict  shipments of contraband and the illegal importation of live animals and  other products while facilitating the flow of legal trade and travel. If there  is a problem with a particular shipment, CBP will levy the appropriate  fines and penalties.", "CBP requires importers to file entry documents that describe the  merchandise, quantity, value, and exporting country, among other things,  and a Harmonized Tariff Schedule classification, which is a schedule of  tariffs associated with individual products. All entry documents must be  filed before the imported goods are allowed to be released into U.S.  commerce. For faster release, importers or their brokers may provide CBP  with pre-arrival notification of an incoming shipment by submitting  information on the shipment locally or electronically submitting  information on the shipment to either CBP\u2019s legacy computer system, the  Automated Commercial System, or the Automated Commercial  Environment, the agency\u2019s replacement system. CBP screens the incoming  information through its information systems to verify if the shipment  meets the criteria or requires further examination or inspection. According  to agency officials, if CBP then determines that further inspection is  needed by APHIS, FWS, or CDC, CBP will hold the shipment, provide  minimal custodial care, and contact the relevant agency. According to  agency officials, CBP holds the shipment until an agency representative of  the other government agency is available to inspect and release it.  According to agency officials, if an agency representative is unavailable,  then CBP denies entry of the shipment.", "CDC restricts the importation of live animals that it has determined pose a  risk to public health and bans the importation of certain animals. All live  animal imports on which CDC has placed import restrictions are to be  visually examined by the inspecting personnel to ensure that the animal  has no obvious signs of infectious diseases. Dogs and cats that show signs  of infectious diseases are to be examined, tested, or treated by a licensed  veterinarian at the owner\u2019s expense. According to agency officials, other  CDC-regulated animals that show signs of infectious diseases, such as  nonhuman primates, are inspected at an import facility. For many of the  animal imports restricted by CDC, the agency requires a permit for  importation. Imports that are restricted to these purposes and require a  permit include African rodents, civets, live bats, and shipments of more  than six turtles with a shell length of less than 4 inches. For nonhuman  primates only, CDC requires that persons or facilities importing such  animals be registered with CDC. If the shipment has the required  documents, it is released to a registered importer. Nonhuman primates are  quarantined for 31 days after entry on the importer\u2019s premises. No permit  is required for the importation of dogs and cats. Generally dogs greater  than 3 months of age from countries where rabies is present must have a  valid certificate of vaccination against rabies signed by a licensed  veterinarian showing that the dog was vaccinated greater than or equal to  30 days prior to import. If the dog is more than 3 months old and does not  have a vaccination certificate, the dog may be admitted if the owner agrees  to confine the dog until vaccination, vaccinate the dog within 4 days upon  arrival at the ports of entry, and then confine the dog for an additional 30  days following vaccination. If the dog is more than 3 months old and has a  certificate showing a vaccination done less than 30 days prior to arrival,  the dog may be admitted if the owner signs an agreement to confine the  dog for the balance of 30 days. If the dog is less than 3 months old, the dog  may be admitted if the owner signs an agreement to confine the dog until it  is 3 months old, and then have it vaccinated and confined for an additional  30 days. Confinement is defined as restricting the animal to a building or  other enclosure, in isolation from other animals and people, except for  contact necessary for its care. If the dog is allowed out of the enclosure,  the owner must muzzle the dog and use a leash. After agreeing to these  conditions, the dog is released and the agreement is forwarded to a CDC  quarantine station. The rabies vaccination requirement does not apply to  dogs that have been exclusively in a rabies-free area for at least 6 months  immediately preceding arrival or since birth. Cats are only required to pass  visual inspection.", "FWS has restrictions on the importation of certain wildlife. Specifically,  FWS restricts the importation of injurious wildlife and threatened or  endangered species and related species for which international trade is  regulated under international agreements. According to agency officials,  FWS inspectors work with public health officials and other federal  inspectors at ports of entry to enforce wildlife regulations and ensure the  safety and legality of wild animal imports. According to agency officials,  FWS inspectors coordinate with the other agencies to ensure that the  requirements for animals that are jointly regulated by FWS and APHIS  and/or CDC have been met, such as APHIS prohibitions on hedgehogs that  can transmit foot-and-mouth disease or CDC inspection requirements for  small turtles. Importers of wildlife shipments generally must provide FWS  with a 48-hour notice of the shipment\u2019s arrival. Commercial importers of  wildlife must be licensed by FWS.", "According to agency officials, the following processes occur at the port of  entry. The shipment is declared at the port of entry, and FWS reviews the  accuracy and consistency of the required documents, which depend on  species and can include declaration forms, permits, import/export  licenses, invoices, and packing lists. Following documentation review,  FWS inspectors then decide if a physical inspection is required. Common  reasons for inspecting shipments include the type of live animal, exporting  country, importer history, intelligence on the shipment, outcome of  documentation review, or random selection. If the shipment fails a  physical inspection, FWS either seizes the animals with the violations and  releases the remainder of the shipment or seizes the entire shipment,  based on the type of animal or violation. If the shipment passes physical  inspection and has the required documentation, then FWS clears the  shipment.

About 94  percent of these imports came from Canada, with the remainder generally  coming from Mexico. These animals were primarily imported for slaughter  plants or farms. By fiscal year 2008, imports of fish represented about half  of the total number of APHIS live animal imports, with the largest  suppliers of these animals, including China, Malaysia, Hong Kong, the  United Kingdom, Thailand, and Singapore, primarily importing these fish  for commercial purposes. According to agency officials, APHIS reported  large numbers of fish beginning in fiscal year 2007 because of a new  regulation on the import of fish, which previously were not required to  have APHIS permits and thus were not counted by APHIS. In August 2006,  APHIS issued regulations requiring importers of species of fish that are  susceptible to Spring viremia of carp, a contagious, fatal viral disease, to  obtain an APHIS permit prior to importation into the United States.", "Table 3 shows the number of FWS-regulated live wildlife imported from  2005 through 2009.

We identified  potential experts on disease risk posed by live animal imports who had  primary employment responsibilities related to or dependent on live  animal imports, authored peer-reviewed papers, presented at professional  conferences, provided testimony on the subject matter to Congress, or  were recognized by their peers as experts on live animal imports. We then  selected experts from federal and state government, academia,  nongovernmental organizations, and industry to obtain a broad spectrum  of views. The first round of the survey consisted of five open-ended  questions (questions that solicit additional information) in which experts  provided their opinions on gaps in the current statutory and regulatory  framework, how well the responsible federal agencies work together to  meet their responsibilities, and potential barriers to collaboration. In the  first round, we received responses from 33 out of the 39 experts contacted,  resulting in a response rate of about 85 percent. We performed a content  analysis of the responses to the open-ended questions in order to compile  a list of gaps in the statutory and regulatory framework, corrective actions  to address those gaps, the effectiveness of federal agencies\u2019 collaboration,  and barriers to federal agencies\u2019 collaboration mentioned by the experts.  We used this list to construct the second round of survey questions. These  were primarily closed-ended (questions with a set of answers to choose  from).

Of the 64 experts we contacted, 56 provided responses, resulting  in a response rate of about 88 percent in the second round.

In the report, we state that federal agencies face a range of barriers  when they attempt to collaborate with other agencies and that these  barriers can confuse and frustrate program customers. In addition, as  the Department of the Interior notes, this issue was not part of our  objectives.  2.  Our report does not attempt to describe all of the pathways by which  live animal imports could introduce diseases into the United States.  However, we modified the report to include a reference to container  water in which aquatic animals are transported as a potential pathway.  3.  In the report, we state that the National Aquatic Animal Health Plan is  an example of federal agencies\u2019 joint strategies to reduce disease risks  from live animal imports. We have added language to provide more  information on this plan\u2019s relevant efforts.  4.  We revised the report to reflect this comment by deleting from the  highlights page the reference to FWS\u2019s review of a petition on  amphibians.  5.  We added language to the highlights page to clarify that FWS was  directed to review statutory authorities and regulations to address  existing problems associated with nonnative live animals.  6.  We added language to the report to clarify that imported live animals  are used for additional purposes.  7.  We modified language in the report to clarify that FWS\u2019 authority to list  organisms as injurious wildlife is not limited to live animals.  8.  We modified the report to attribute a description of CBP\u2019s processes to  CBP officials only.  9.  We modified the report to clarify that FWS regulates all wildlife.  10.  We did not change the language because it is a quote from the cited  National Academies of Sciences report that we attributed.  11.  We modified the report to clarify that the Bd pathogen is a fungus.", "12.  We modified the report to clarify that FWS is revising its risk  assessment procedures.  13.  The National Invasive Species Council\u2019s activities to help federal  agencies collaborate are described in the report. We added information  on the Invasive Species Advisory Committee, which works closely with  the National Invasive Species Council. In addition, we added  information on the Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force.  14.  The use of an existing interagency body to serve as a coordinating  entity to help federal agencies prevent the importation of animals that  may be carrying zoonotic and animal diseases was not mentioned in  experts\u2019 responses to the first round of our survey, which was the basis  for our second round of survey questions. Placing a coordinating entity  for live animal imports within an existing interagency body may help in  avoiding duplication of effort. We recommended the development and  implementation of a strategy to help the agencies explore the need for  any additional legislative or executive authority to develop and  implement this strategy, such as the authority to establish a  coordinating entity (e.g., an interagency workgroup). If the agencies  determine that it is appropriate to place the coordinating entity for live  animal imports within an existing interagency body, this response  would be consistent with our recommendation.  15.  We modified the report to clarify that agencies focus on only those  components of the process each agency controls under its statutory  authority. As noted in the report, in January 2010, the Secretary of the  Interior directed FWS to comprehensively review statutory authorities  and regulations.  16.  We modified the report to add that an evaluation of the amount of  FWS\u2019s funding and level of staff for live animal imports has occurred.  17.  We modified the report to clarify that FWS requires that all carriers  transporting wild mammals and birds to the United States have a  certificate of veterinary medical inspection signed by a veterinarian."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix XI: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Thomas M.
