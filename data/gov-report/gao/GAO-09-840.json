For example, all 12 sites we visited trained employees on NSPS, and the DOD-wide tool used to compose self-assessments links employees' objectives to the commands' or agencies' strategic goals and mission. However, we determined that DOD could immediately improve its implementation of three safeguards. Although DOD civilian employees under NSPS responded positively regarding some aspects of the NSPS performance management system, DOD does not have an action plan to address the generally negative employee perceptions of NSPS identified in both the department's Status of Forces Survey of civilian employees and discussion groups we held at 12 select installations. According to our analysis of DOD's survey from May 2007, NSPS employees expressed slightly more positive attitudes than their DOD colleagues who remain under the General Schedule system about some goals of performance management, such as connecting pay to performance and receiving feedback regularly. For example, an estimated 43 percent of NSPS employees compared to an estimated 25 percent of all other DOD employees said that pay raises depend on how well employees perform their jobs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Mr. Rudy deLeon and Members of the Task Group:   Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the first of our three  congressionally directed reports on the implementation of the Department  of Defense\u2019s (DOD) National Security Personnel System (NSPS). As you  know, DOD is in the process of implementing this human capital system,  and according to DOD, about 212,000 civilian employees are currently  under the system. On February 11, 2009, however, the House Armed  Services Committee and its Subcommittee on Readiness asked DOD to  halt conversions of any additional employees to NSPS until the  administration and Congress could properly address the future of DOD\u2019s  personnel management system. On March 16, 2009, DOD and the Office of  Personnel Management (OPM) announced an upcoming review of NSPS  policies, regulations, and practices. According to DOD, the department has  delayed any further transitions of employees into NSPS until at least  October 2009\u2014pending the outcome of its review. Furthermore, on May  14, 2009, the Deputy Secretary of Defense asked the Defense Business  Board to form what has become this task group to review NSPS to help  the department determine, among others things, whether NSPS is  operating in a fair, transparent, and effective manner. Today, my statement  will focus on the work we conducted in 2008 reviewing DOD\u2019s  implementation of NSPS.", "As we have previously reported, the implementation of NSPS could have  far-reaching implications for civil service reform across the federal  government, because NSPS could serve as a baseline for governmentwide  transformation in human capital. Key components of NSPS include  compensation, classification, and performance management. Our review  focused on the performance management aspect of NSPS. We have  previously reported that effective performance management systems are  not merely used for once or twice-yearly individual expectation setting  and rating processes, but are tools to help the organization manage on a  day-to-day basis. These systems are used to achieve results, accelerate  change, and facilitate two-way communication throughout the year so that  discussions about individual and organizational performance are  integrated and ongoing. OPM recognizes that performance management  systems are to extend beyond rating individual performance. According  to OPM, performance management is the systematic process by which a organization involves its employees\u2014as individuals and members of a  group\u2014in improving organizational effectiveness in the accomplishment  of the mission and goals.", "Prior to the enactment of the NSPS legislation, in a series of testimonies in  2003, we raised a number of critical issues about the proposed regulations  for NSPS. Since then, we have provided congressional committees with  information and analyses on DOD\u2019s process to design NSPS, the extent to  which DOD\u2019s process reflects key practices for successful transformation,  the need for internal controls and transparency of funding, and the most  significant challenges facing DOD in implementing NSPS. In addition, we  have previously reported that in general, successful transformations of  large organizations can take from 5 to 7 years to achieve in a sustainable  manner. Similarly, reports published by OPM have shown that  organizational transformations, such as the adoption of a new  performance management system, often entail fundamental and radical  changes to an organization that require an adjustment period to gain  employee acceptance and trust. While GAO supports human capital  reform in the federal government, how such reform is done, when it is  done, and the basis upon which it is done can make all the difference in  whether such efforts are successful. Specifically, we have noted in  testimonies and reports that DOD and other federal agencies must ensure  that performance management systems contain appropriate internal  safeguards. Implementing internal safeguards is a way to help ensure that  pay-for-performance systems in the government are fair, effective, and  credible. We developed an initial list of safeguards based on our extensive  body of work looking at the performance management practices used by  leading public sector organizations both in the United States and other  countries.", "Additionally, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008  required us to determine the extent to which DOD had effectively  incorporated certain specific accountability mechanisms and internal  safeguards (both of which I refer to as safeguards) in NSPS and to assess  employee attitudes toward NSPS. The safeguards we used in our review  are as follows:  involve employees, their representatives, and other stakeholders in the  design of the system, to include employees directly involved in validating  any related implementation of the system;    assure that the agency\u2019s performance management system links employee  objectives to the agency\u2019s strategic plan, related goals, and desired  outcomes;  implement a pay-for-performance evaluation system to better link  individual pay to organizational performance, and provide an equitable  method for appraising and compensating employees;    provide adequate training and retraining for supervisors, managers, and  employees in the implementation and operation of the performance  management system;  institute a process for ensuring ongoing performance feedback and  dialogue between supervisors, managers, and employees throughout the  appraisal period, and setting timetables for review;    provide a means for ensuring that adequate agency resources are allocated  for the design, implementation, and administration of the performance  management system;    assure that there are reasonable transparency and appropriate  accountability mechanisms in connection with the results of the  performance management process, including periodic reports on internal  assessments and employee survey results relating to performance  management and individual pay decisions while protecting individual  confidentiality;    assure that the agency\u2019s performance management system results in  meaningful distinctions in individual employee performance; and    assure that certain predecisional internal safeguards exist to help achieve  consistency, equity, and nonpoliticization of the performance management  process (e.g., independent reasonableness reviews by a third party or  reviews of performance rating decisions, pay determinations, and  promotions before they are finalized to ensure that they are merit-based,  as well as pay panels that consider the results of the performance  appraisal process and other information in connection with final pay  decisions).", "My statement focuses on the performance management aspect of NSPS  specifically (1) the extent to which DOD has implemented internal  safeguards to ensure the fairness, effectiveness, and credibility of NSPS  and (2) how DOD civilian personnel perceive NSPS and what actions DOD  has taken to address these perceptions. It is based on the work we  reported on in our September 2008 report, which was conducted in  response to a mandate in the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2008. This mandate also directed us to continue examining  DOD efforts in these areas for the next 2 years. We currently have ongoing  work reviewing the implementation of NSPS for the second year, and we  also will perform another review next year.", "To determine the extent to which DOD had implemented safeguards to  ensure the fairness, effectiveness, and credibility of NSPS, we identified,  as mentioned before, safeguards specified in the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, as well as other key internal  safeguards that GAO had previously identified, and analyzed regulations  and other guidance provided by officials in DOD and the headquarters of  the four components\u2014the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and the Fourth  Estate. We also reviewed documents, such as pay pool business rules and  regulations, that we obtained during 12 site visits\u20143 for each  component\u2014to military installations. The sites were selected because they  contained a large number or concentrated group of civilian employees  who had been placed under NSPS and were geographically distributed  throughout the United States. Further, we interviewed appropriate agency  officials at various levels within DOD and conducted interviews with  officials of various management levels at each site we visited. In addition,  to determine how DOD civilian employees perceive NSPS, we analyzed the  results of DOD\u2019s May 2006, November 2006, and May 2007 Status of Forces  Survey of civilian employees\u2014the most recent surveys available at the  time of our review. These surveys gauged initial employee attitudes  toward NSPS. We also conducted small group discussions with employees  and supervisors at each of the 12 sites we visited. While the information  from our discussion groups is not generalizable to the entire population of  DOD civilians, it provides valuable insight into civilians\u2019 perceptions about  the implementation of NSPS. We conducted our work in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained  provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOD Has Taken Some Steps to Implement Internal Safeguards, but Additional Monitoring Is Needed to Ensure the Fairness of NSPS", "paragraphs": ["DOD has taken some steps to implement internal safeguards to help  ensure that the NSPS performance management system is fair, effective,  and credible; however, we believe continued monitoring of safeguards is  needed to help ensure that DOD\u2019s actions are effective as implementation  proceeds.

For example, all 12 sites we visited trained  employees on NSPS, and the DOD-wide tool used to compose self- assessments links employees\u2019 objectives to the commands\u2019 or agencies\u2019  strategic goals and mission. However, we determined that DOD could  immediately improve its implementation of three safeguards.", "First, DOD\u2019s implementation of NSPS does not provide employees with  adequate transparency over their rating results because it does not require  commands or pay pools to publish their respective ratings and share  distributions to employees. According to DOD, distributing aggregate data  to employees is an effective means for providing transparency, and NSPS  program officials at all four components\u2019 headquarters told us that  publishing overall results is considered a best practice. In addition, 3 of  the 12 sites we visited decided not to publish the overall final rating and  share distribution results. Without transparency over rating and share  distributions, employees may believe they are not being rated fairly, which  ultimately can undermine their confidence in the system. To address this  finding, we recommended that DOD require overall final rating results to  be published. DOD concurred with this recommendation and, in 2008,  revised its NSPS regulations and guidance to require commands to publish  the final overall rating results.", "Second, NSPS guidance may discourage rating officials from making  meaningful distinctions in employee performance because this guidance  emphasized that most employees should be evaluated at \u201c3\u201d (or \u201cvalued  performer\u201d) on a scale of 1 to 5. According to NSPS implementing  issuance, rating results should be based on how well employees complete  their job objectives using the performance indicators. Although DOD and  most of the installations we visited emphasized that there was not a forced  distribution of ratings, some pay pool panel members acknowledged that  there was a hesitancy to award employee ratings in categories other than  \u201c3.\u201d Unless NSPS is implemented in a manner that encourages meaningful  distinctions in employee ratings in accordance with employees\u2019  performance, there will be an unspoken forced distribution of ratings, and  employees\u2019 confidence in the system may be undermined. As a result, we  recommended that DOD encourage pay pools and supervisors to use all  categories of ratings as appropriate. DOD partially concurred with this  recommendation, and in April 2009, DOD issued additional guidance  prohibiting the forced distribution of ratings under NSPS.", "Third, DOD does not require a third party to analyze rating results for  anomalies prior to finalizing ratings. To address this finding, GAO  recommended that DOD require predecisional demographic and other  analysis; however, DOD did not concur, stating that a postdecisional  analysis is more useful. Specifically, in commenting on our prior report,  DOD stated that its postdecisional analysis of final rating results by  demographics was sufficient to identify barriers and corrective actions.  We are currently assessing DOD\u2019s postdecisional analysis approach as part  of our ongoing review of the implementation of NSPS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Although DOD Civilian Employees under NSPS View Some Aspects of the System Positively, DOD Does Not Have a Plan to Address the Generally Negative Employee Perceptions of the System", "paragraphs": ["Although DOD civilian employees under NSPS responded positively  regarding some aspects of the NSPS performance management system,  DOD does not have an action plan to address the generally negative  employee perceptions of NSPS identified in both the department\u2019s Status  of Forces Survey of civilian employees and discussion groups we held at  12 select installations. According to our analysis of DOD\u2019s survey from  May 2007, NSPS employees expressed slightly more positive attitudes than  their DOD colleagues who remain under the General Schedule system  about some goals of performance management, such as connecting pay to  performance and receiving feedback regularly. For example, an estimated  43 percent of NSPS employees compared to an estimated 25 percent of all  other DOD employees said that pay raises depend on how well employees  perform their jobs.", "However, in some instances, DOD\u2019s survey results showed a decline in  employee attitudes among employees who have been under NSPS the  longest. Employees who were among the first employees converted to  NSPS (designated spiral 1.1) were steadily more negative about NSPS from  the May 2006 to the May 2007 DOD survey. At the time of the May 2006  administration of the Status of Forces Survey for civilians, spiral 1.1  employees had received training on the system and had begun the  conversion process, but had not yet gone through a rating cycle and  payout under the new system. As part of this training, employees were  exposed to the intent of the new system and the goals of performance  management and NSPS, which include annual rewards for high  performance and increased feedback on employee performance. As DOD  and the components proceeded with implementation of the system, survey  results showed a decrease in employees\u2019 optimism about the system\u2019s  ability to fulfill its intent and reward employees for performance. The  changes in attitude reflected in DOD\u2019s employee survey are slight but  indicate a movement in employee perceptions. Most of the movement in  responses was negative. Specifically, in response to a question about the  impact NSPS will have on personnel practices at DOD, the number of  positive responses decreased from an estimated 40 percent of spiral 1.1  employees in May 2006 to an estimated 23 percent in May 2007. Further,  when asked how NSPS compared to previous personnel systems, an  estimated 44 percent said it was worse in November 2006, compared to an  estimated 50 percent in May 2007. Similarly, employee responses to  questions about performance management in general were also more  negative from May 2006 to May 2007. Specifically, the results of the May  2006 survey estimated that about 67 percent of spiral 1.1 employees agreed  that the performance appraisal is a fair reflection of performance,  compared to 52 percent in May 2007. Further, the number of spiral 1.1  employees who agreed that the NSPS performance appraisal system  improves organizational performance decreased from an estimated 35  percent to 23 percent.", "Our discussion group meetings gave rise to views consistent with DOD\u2019s  survey results. Although the results of our discussion groups are not  generalizable to the entire population of DOD civilians, the themes that  emerged from our discussions provide valuable insight into civilian  employees\u2019 perceptions about the implementation of NSPS and augment  DOD\u2019s survey findings. Some civilian employees and supervisors under  NSPS seemed optimistic about the intent of the system however, most of  the DOD employees and supervisors we spoke with expressed a consistent  set of wide-ranging concerns. Specifically, employees noted (1) NSPS\u2019s  negative effect on employee motivation and morale, (2) the excessive  amount of time and effort required to navigate the performance  management process, (3) the potential influence that employees\u2019 and  supervisors\u2019 writing skills have on panels\u2019 assessments of employee  ratings, (4) the lack of transparency and understanding of the pay pool  panel process, and (5) the rapid pace at which the system was  implemented, which often resulted in employees feeling unprepared and  unable to find answers to their questions. These negative attitudes are not  surprising given that organizational transformations often entail  fundamental and radical change that requires an adjustment period to gain  employee acceptance and trust.", "To address employee attitudes and acceptance, OPM issued guidance that  recommends\u2014and we believe it is a best practice\u2014that agencies use  employee survey results to provide feedback to employees and develop  and implement an action plan that guides their efforts to address the  results of employee assessments. However, according to Program  Executive Office officials, DOD has not developed a specific action plan to  address critical issues identified by employee perceptions, because the  department wants employees to have more time under the system before  making changes. Without such a plan, DOD is unable to make changes that  address employee perceptions that could result in greater employee  acceptance of NSPS. We therefore recommended, in our September 2008  report, that DOD develop and implement a specific action plan to address  employee perceptions of NSPS ascertained from DOD\u2019s surveys and  employee focus groups. The plan should include actions to mitigate  employee concerns about, for example, the potential influence that  employees\u2019 and supervisors\u2019 writing skills have on the panels\u2019 assessment  of employee ratings or other issues consistently identified by employees or  supervisors. DOD partially concurred with our recommendation, noting  that it will address areas of weakness identified in its comprehensive, in- progress evaluation of NSPS and that it is institutionalizing a continuous  improvement strategy. Since our 2008 review, NSPS officials at DOD have  told us that they are working on an action plan; however, to date the  department has not provided us a plan for review."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s implementation of a more performance- and results-based  personnel system has positioned the agency at the forefront of a  significant transition facing the federal government. We recognize that  DOD faces many challenges in implementing NSPS, as any organization  would in implementing a large-scale organizational change. NSPS is a new  program, and organizational change requires time for employees to accept.  Continued monitoring of internal safeguards is needed to help ensure that  DOD\u2019s actions are effective as implementation proceeds. Moreover, until  DOD develops an action plan and takes specific steps to mitigate negative  employee perceptions of NSPS, DOD civilian employees will likely  continue to question the fairness of their ratings and lack confidence in  the system. The degree of ultimate success of NSPS largely depends on the  extent to which DOD incorporates internal safeguards and addresses  employee perceptions. Moving forward, we hope that the Defense  Business Board considers our previous work on NSPS as it assesses how  NSPS operates and its underlying policies.", "This concludes my prepared statement.
