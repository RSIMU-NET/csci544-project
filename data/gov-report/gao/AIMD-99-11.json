First, we agreed to evaluate DOD\u2019s recoupment of monies owed by FMS customers for the U.S. government\u2019s research, development, and production costs of major defense equipment. Second, we agreed to evaluate DOD\u2019s accountability over expenditures of FMS customers\u2019 funds. This report, which discusses the first of these efforts, focuses on Air Force and Navy activities. As agreed with your office, we did not review the Army-managed cases because the U.S. Army Audit Agency is currently completing an audit of the Army\u2019s recoupment of nonrecurring costs. We will respond to the other segment of your request in a subsequent report."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Arms Export Control Act gives the President authority to sell defense articles and services to eligible foreign countries, generally at no cost to the U.S. government. While the Defense Security Assistance Agency (DSAA) has overall responsibility for administering the FMS program, the Army, Navy, and Air Force normally execute the sales agreements\u2014commonly referred to as sales cases.", "Foreign military sales are made on an individual case basis. The cases are initiated by a foreign country representative sending a letter of request to DOD asking for various information, such as precise price data. Once the customer decides to proceed with the purchase, DOD prepares a Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) stating the terms of the sale for the goods and services being provided. The Arms Export Control Act requires that, after September 30, 1976, letters of offer for the sale of major defense equipment shall include a proportionate amount of nonrecurring costs related to the research, development, and production of major defense equipment. DOD interpreted the act as requiring the recovery of these costs on a pro rata basis. The military services calculate the pro rata rate by dividing the total research and development and other one-time production costs by the anticipated total number of units to be produced for both domestic and foreign use. A separate charge is calculated for each item of major defense equipment and is included in the LOA as part of the price that FMS customers are to pay for the purchase of major defense equipment.", "After the LOA is accepted, the FMS customer is generally required to pay, in advance, amounts necessary to cover costs associated with the sales agreement, including any nonrecurring costs. These advance payments are held in an FMS trust fund by the Department of the Treasury. DOD then uses these funds to pay private contractors and reimburse DOD activities for the costs of executing and administering the FMS agreement.", "In addition, as deliveries of major defense equipment occur, the military services are to prepare delivery reports and related cost statements which, among other things, are used as support to charge FMS customers\u2019 trust fund accounts for applicable nonrecurring research, development, and production costs. Nonrecurring costs collected from the FMS trust funds are to be deposited into the general fund of the Treasury. The funds are returned to the Treasury instead of to DOD since the Congress had previously provided DOD with appropriated funds to pay for the research, development, and production costs of major defense equipment. If, for some reason, DOD fails to process the charges to recover applicable nonrecurring costs from the FMS customers\u2019 trust fund, amounts paid in advance to reimburse the U.S. government for nonrecurring costs would eventually be returned to the FMS customer.", "As deliveries of major defense equipment are made, the military services are to report the detailed delivery and recovery of nonrecurring costs within 30 days to a central accounting activity\u2014the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), Denver Center\u2014which maintains records of each country\u2019s trust fund balance and issues quarterly statements to foreign customers summarizing deliveries and amounts charged to their cases."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objective, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The objective of this assignment was to determine if the Air Force and Navy were correctly recovering nonrecurring research, development, and production costs owed by FMS customers for purchases of major defense equipment. To determine the regulatory requirements for charging and collecting these nonrecurring costs from FMS customers, we obtained and reviewed applicable laws, policies, procedures, regulations, and guidance. During our visits to DOD locations, we gathered and analyzed financial information from pertinent accounting reports and records to identify data on reported deliveries of major defense equipment items and related charges for nonrecurring research, development, and production costs.", "We judgmentally selected 30 FMS cases for detailed review from a total of 93 Air Force and Navy FMS sales cases listed on their March 1998 reports entitled Recoupment of Nonrecurring Costs on Sales of USG Products and Technology (RCS DSAA (Q) 1112). According to DOD accounting officials, the quarterly reports are to include only ongoing current FMS cases since all nonrecurring costs should be recovered and transferred to the general fund of the Treasury before a case is completed and closed. The reports generally included the country, case, item description, quantity of items to be sold, scheduled delivery dates, quantity of items delivered to date, amount of nonrecurring research, development, and production costs to be collected, and amount of nonrecurring research, development, and production costs collected to date.", "We selected the 30 FMS cases for detailed review based on whether the unrecovered amount of nonrecurring research, development, and production costs was large and whether the report showed, among other things, that (1) items had been delivered to the customers, but that there had been little or no recovery of nonrecurring costs or (2) scheduled delivery dates were for March 1998 or earlier and no or few deliveries had been made. The 30 FMS cases accounted for about $266 million (40 percent) of the two services\u2019 total unrecovered nonrecurring research, development, and production costs of over $655 million. For the selected cases, we contacted the staff responsible for managing the case or other responsible officials knowledgeable about the case, to determine the (1) quantity of items to be delivered, (2) quantity of items delivered to date, (3) total amount of nonrecurring costs to be recovered, and (4) total amount of nonrecurring costs recovered to date. We also asked the staff to provide an explanation for why nonrecurring research, development, and production costs that should have been recovered earlier had not yet been recovered. The dollar values of nonrecurring research, development, and production costs related to major defense equipment items discussed in this report were obtained from DOD reports or responsible program officials. We did not independently verify these costs.", "We performed our work at the headquarters, departments of the Navy and Air Force; Defense Security Assistance Agency; Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), Washington, D.C.; Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland; Naval Sea Systems Command, Arlington, Virginia; Air Force Aeronautical Systems Center and Air Force Security Assistance Center, Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio; and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service centers in Denver, Colorado, and Columbus, Ohio.", "We performed our work between February 1998 and August 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We requested written comments on a draft of this report from the Secretary of Defense or his designee. The Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) provided written comments.

While the DOD policy is not specific about the length of time after delivery during which an activity is to charge an FMS customer\u2019s trust fund account for the nonrecurring costs, responsible DOD accounting officials told us that the nonrecurring costs should be recouped as items are delivered. According to the DOD accounting officials, DOD activities should prepare the delivery report, recover the nonrecurring costs, and submit both the delivery and recovery of costs data to DFAS Denver within 30 days of shipment of the items. Therefore, DOD policy recognizes delivery reporting as a key step toward initiating the charges to recover nonrecurring costs from FMS customers\u2019 trust funds.", "The following describes what generally should be a typical transaction flow to report the delivery of major defense equipment and recovery of nonrecurring research, development, and production costs.", "The military service program office is generally responsible for reporting the delivery of items as they are made. It also prepares a cost statement, which serves as the supporting documentation for recording earnings, and forwards these data along with the delivery report to its budget or finance office.", "The budget or finance office reviews the information and reports the delivery to DFAS Denver. The budget or finance office also attaches a letter to the cost statement requesting that the area accounting office prepare a voucher to collect the nonrecurring costs. The letter and cost statement are then forwarded to the area accounting office for processing.", "The area accounting office processes the transaction to charge the FMS trust fund and transfer the amount to the general fund of the Treasury and reports the transaction to DFAS Denver, which records the charge against the FMS customer\u2019s trust fund account."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Millions of Dollars Not Recovered", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s reports on nonrecurring costs for current sales cases show that as of March 1998, the Air Force and Navy had over $655 million of nonrecurring research, development, and production costs for major defense equipment sales that had not been recovered from FMS customers. Our analysis and discussions with program officials concerning $266 million of this amount found that at least $183 million of the reported outstanding nonrecurring costs was related to equipment that had been delivered, and therefore, should have already been recovered from the FMS customers\u2019 trust fund accounts and deposited in the general fund of the Treasury. In most cases where nonrecurring costs had not been recovered, we found that the military activities\u2019 program offices generally had failed to provide the budget or finance office or appropriate accounting station with the proper delivery or cost documentation to support the recoupment of the nonrecurring costs. Following are several examples of FMS cases where nonrecurring research, development, and production costs were not recovered.", "From July 1993 through November 1995, 48 F-16 aircraft were delivered to South Korea. While DOD\u2019s accounting records showed that the FMS customer\u2019s account had been charged for over $1.3 billion to pay the contractor and DOD activities for their costs, the Air Force program office had not completed the necessary delivery and cost reports in order to recover the U.S. government\u2019s nonrecurring costs of $1,018,050 per aircraft. As a result, as of May 1998, 5 years after the first aircraft had been delivered and over 2 years after the delivery of the 48th aircraft, nearly $49 million of nonrecurring research, development, and production costs, which should have been charged against South Korea\u2019s trust fund account and transferred to the general fund of the Treasury, was still outstanding. The program official responsible for preparing the delivery reports could not explain why he had not reported the deliveries of the aircraft. Air Force officials agreed that they had not prepared the delivery reports to recoup the nonrecurring costs and told us that, in response to our finding, they were in the process of preparing the necessary delivery reports and cost statements in order to recover the nearly $49 million from South Korea\u2019s trust fund account.", "Between April 1996 and March 1998, the Air Force reported that it had delivered a total of 78 F-16 aircraft to Taiwan. Based on these reported deliveries, the Air Force should have charged Taiwan\u2019s trust fund account $49,920,000 for nonrecurring research, development, and production costs\u2014$640,000 for each delivered aircraft. We found, however, that while Taiwan\u2019s trust fund account had been charged over $2.3 billion to pay the contractor and other costs, only $1,574,366 of nonrecurring research, development, and production costs had been charged against the trust fund account. In discussing this case with officials in the program and budget offices, we found that the program office had reported the delivery of the items to the budget office and DFAS Denver but that the delivery report did not include the cost statement, which the budget office required for processing nonrecurring costs charges. As a result, over $48 million of nonrecurring costs had not been charged to Taiwan\u2019s trust fund account and transferred to the general fund of the Treasury. Air Force officials agreed with our finding and told us that they have instructed the program office to include the cost statement with the delivery report so that this does not happen again, and that they have begun the process of preparing the necessary cost statements for the aircraft that have already been delivered. The officials anticipate that they will recover the $48 million from Taiwan\u2019s trust fund account.", "A review of the nonrecurring costs report for another Taiwan case, this one managed by the Navy, showed that between June 1993 and February 1998, Taiwan had received 43 attack helicopters, 53 night target systems, and 20 spare engines. Based on these reported deliveries, the Navy should have charged Taiwan\u2019s trust fund account for $19,819,858 of nonrecurring research, development, and production costs. While our review of financial records disclosed that Taiwan\u2019s trust fund account had over $600 million recorded against it for contractor payments and other miscellaneous charges, we found that none of the over $19 million of nonrecurring costs had been charged to Taiwan\u2019s account. Navy program officials responsible for reporting the delivery of the items agreed that Taiwan\u2019s trust fund account had not been charged for nonrecurring costs but could not explain why this was allowed to happen. They added that they were not aware of this problem until we brought it to their attention. They now plan to take the necessary actions to charge Taiwan\u2019s trust fund account for the over $19 million of outstanding nonrecurring costs.", "A review of the nonrecurring costs report for a Navy sale of 482 target detectors to Japan showed that all of the items had been delivered as of 1989. However, the report showed that only $163,398 of the $557,444 of the nonrecurring research, development, and production costs associated with the items had been recovered. At our request, the Navy program official reviewed the case and told us that the original amount had been miscalculated and should have been $376,442, not the $557,444 shown on the report. He told us that based on his new calculations, an additional $213,044 of nonrecurring costs should have been charged to Japan\u2019s trust fund account; but he could not tell us why this amount had not been recovered earlier. He told us that the Navy plans to recoup the $213,044 of outstanding nonrecurring costs from Japan\u2019s trust fund account.", "As noted earlier, our review focused only on 30 of the 93 FMS cases that were included in the March 1998 reports, which should only include current ongoing cases, of DOD recoupment of nonrecurring costs of U.S. government products and technology. Over the years DOD has routinely closed FMS cases as they were completed. In response to our request for nonrecurring cost data on these closed cases, DOD officials told us that a query of their FMS system\u2019s database disclosed that over 11,000 cases, involving major defense equipment, had been closed since 1976. However, their database did not include information on the total amounts of nonrecurring costs owed or collected. The officials did acknowledge, however, that there would have been hundreds of millions of dollars of nonrecurring research, development, and production costs associated with these closed cases.", "Because of the magnitude of nonrecurring research, development, and production costs we identified that had not been charged to FMS customers\u2019 trust fund accounts as a result of the services\u2019 noncompliance with established DOD policies and procedures for recovering these costs, some FMS cases may have been erroneously closed before all nonrecurring costs were recovered from FMS customers\u2019 trust fund accounts. A responsible DOD accounting official agreed that this was a major concern and acknowledged that, given the level of the services\u2019 noncompliance with DOD\u2019s policies and procedures for reporting the deliveries of items and recovery of applicable nonrecurring costs, FMS cases could have easily been closed before all nonrecurring costs were recovered."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Not recovering nonrecurring research, development, and production costs from the FMS trust fund promptly after major defense equipment is delivered to the FMS customer represents a poor financial management practice that delays the transfer of millions of dollars into the general fund of the Treasury.

The Air Force and Navy should begin to comply with DOD\u2019s established policies and procedures for reporting the delivery of major defense equipment and recouping applicable nonrecurring research, development, and production costs.
