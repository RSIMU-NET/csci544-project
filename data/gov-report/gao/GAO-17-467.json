CMS instituted a qualitative method for assessing the susceptibility of its program that was consistent with requirements, including assessing each of the nine required qualitative risk factors. However, CMS stated that it may not report improper payment estimates for the PTC program as required until at least fiscal year 2022 because of the complexity and timing of the process for developing such estimates. As a result, HHS's overall improper payments estimate will continue to be understated, and Congress and others will continue to lack key payment integrity information for monitoring HHS's improper payments. The fiscal year 2016 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) assessment for its PTC program was not consistent with requirements nor did it demonstrate whether the program met applicable thresholds for susceptibility to significant improper payments. Until IRS conducts an appropriate assessment, it will remain uncertain whether IRS should estimate the amount of improper payments for its PTC program.", "Although CMS properly designed and implemented control activities related to the accuracy of advance PTC payments, it did not properly design control activities related to preventing and detecting improper payments of advance PTC, such as verifying individuals' eligibility. As a result, CMS is at increased risk of making improper payments of advance PTC to issuers on behalf of individuals.", "IRS did not design and implement certain key control activities related to preventing and detecting PTC improper payments, including recovering excess advance PTC overpayments. For example, IRS did not properly design procedures to routinely check for duplicate employer- or government-sponsored coverage. In addition, in 2015 and 2016, IRS used an ad hoc process for notifying nonfilers of the requirement to file tax returns; however, IRS did not establish procedures for sending these notices regularly during each filing season to facilitate compliance. Without properly designed control activities related to PTC, IRS is at increased risk of making improper payments to individuals.", "IRS faces challenges that affect its ability to design and implement procedures related to preventing and detecting PTC improper payments, including recovering advance PTC overpayments and reimbursing advance PTC underpayments. For example, IRS maintains that reduced resources have impaired its ability to implement needed controls. Further, statutory limitations contributed to IRS's inability to fully collect excess advance PTC overpayments and reimburse PTC underpayments and to automatically correct errors in tax returns. GAO previously suggested that IRS seek legislative authority to correct tax returns at filing based on marketplace data. The Department of the Treasury, on behalf of IRS, has submitted proposals for congressional consideration to permit IRS to correct such errors where individuals' information on tax returns does not match corresponding information provided in government databases. Congress has not yet granted this broad authority."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making 10 recommendations to HHS.

Individuals can have  the federal government pay PTC to their issuers in advance on their  behalf, known as advance PTC, which lowers their monthly premium  payments. The advance PTC is based on estimates of household income.  Taxpayers who choose to have advance PTC must reconcile the amount  of advance PTC paid to issuers on their behalf with PTC they are eligible  for on their income tax returns, which is computed based on the actual  modified adjusted gross income calculated when filing their returns.

We reviewed improper payment assessments that CMS and IRS  conducted for fiscal year 2016 for their respective PTC program areas.  We then analyzed those assessments against relevant IPIA requirements  and OMB guidance to determine whether the agencies had evaluated the  appropriate risk factors for improper payments and appropriately  considered those factors in their susceptibility assessments.

We selected CMS\u2019s FFM because, at the time of our audit, it  operated on behalf of about two-thirds of the states and about 75 percent  of all enrollees receiving advance PTC. We evaluated the design and  implementation of key control activities by reviewing CMS policies,  procedures, and other relevant documents, such as interagency  agreements and standard operating procedures for eligibility support  workers.

The testing period covered  applications received during the 2016 open enrollment period (November  1, 2015, through February 1, 2016). We did not evaluate control activities  related to advance PTC payments to issuers on behalf of individuals  because such payments included other aggregated costs and  adjustments, such as cost-sharing reduction subsidies and user fees,  which were beyond the scope of our audit.

Inconsistencies are also created whenever the FFM is unable to solicit  information from trusted data sources due to data element requirements.  As required by federal regulations, when there are inconsistencies, the  marketplace grants temporary eligibility using applicant attestations and  ensures that advance PTC is provided to issuers on behalf of the  applicants qualified to receive them while such inconsistencies are being  resolved.

We believe that such an evaluation is a reasonable step to  address our recommendation to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency  of the program related to verification of household income. In addition,  HHS stated that it currently accepts attestation when the family size  provided by the individual does not match IRS\u2019s records.  HHS stated that  establishing a process to verify family size with IRS would require  significant operational and privacy complexity.  While we recognize that  there may be certain complexities in the verification of family sizes, it is  important that CMS develop policies and procedures to reasonably  assure that such verifications are made on a regular basis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Internal Revenue Service", "paragraphs": ["In its comments, IRS stated that it faces significant challenges  administering refundable tax credits given their complex structural design  and the difficulty in validating eligibility criteria. IRS stated that it also  faces significant challenges in the use of third party and other data to  validate information provided by filers because many potential sources  contain information that is incomplete, out-of-date, or otherwise  unsuitable for use in tax administration. IRS also stated that the  complexity of the law means that not every situation is a matter for simple  adjudication. IRS added that it must take all these factors into account  when designing and implementing pre-filing and post-filing approaches to  tax compliance. IRS also stated that its refundable tax credits may have  compliance-related risks that differ from those associated with other tax  provisions and that administration of these provisions must address these  unique risks. According to IRS, it has committed to OMB that it will  conduct a quantitative analysis of PTC in fiscal year 2018, the first year  that National Research Program data will be available to perform such  analysis.", "IRS stated that that it agreed with two of our recommendations, partially  agreed with another two recommendations, and disagreed with the  remaining recommendation.", "IRS agreed with our second and third recommendations related to  meeting eligibility requirements for citizenship and identifying individuals  with duplicate health insurance coverage. IRS outlined several actions it  plans to take to address those recommendations. These actions, if  implemented effectively, would address our recommendations.", "IRS partially agreed with our first recommendation related to an improper  payment assessment for the PTC program. IRS stated that instances in  which the advance PTC is greater than or equal to the PTC amount  claimed on the tax return do not result in the IRS increasing the outlay  related to PTC and so these occurrences are not subject to IPIA. While  we acknowledge that IRS\u2019s interpretation of the IPIA definition of  \u201cpayments\u201d excludes reductions in tax receipts, we nonetheless believe  that these instances should be considered within the scope of the IRS  susceptibility assessment for improper payments. Taxpayers may  inaccurately complete Form 8962 and erroneously report excess advance  PTC on their returns instead of claiming net PTC, or they may simply fail  to report net PTC on their tax returns altogether. Such errors would result  in underpayments of net PTC and therefore affect program outlays and  improper payments. In addition, IPIA defines improper payments to  include both overpayments and underpayments. IRS also stated that it  conducted its fiscal year 2016 PTC improper payment risk assessment  consistent with OMB guidance but will discuss with OMB a future change  to the approach for assessing PTC improper payments as part of a larger  discussion about the administration of refundable tax credits. However,  IRS did not conclude whether or not the program may be susceptible to  significant improper payments. Further, although we found that IRS used  all of the required qualitative risk factors specified in IPIA and OMB  guidance within its assessment, IRS did not analyze how each of the risk  factors affected the susceptibility of the program to significant improper  payments. Until IRS conducts an appropriate assessment consistent with  IPIA and OMB guidance, it will continue to be uncertain about whether it  should estimate the amount of improper PTC payments.", "IRS also partially agreed with our fifth recommendation related to  notifying non-filers of the need to file to continue receiving advance PTC.   IRS stated that using a research-based approach to evaluate the 2015  tax filing season, it developed a post-compliance process for sending  notices to individuals who received advance PTC paid on their behalf in  the previous calendar year but failed to file a tax return and also to those  who requested an extension to file. IRS stated that being flexible in its  approach has allowed IRS to refine the process to improve efficiency and  effectiveness. IRS further stated that based on the 2017 research  analysis, IRS will determine whether the information should be included in  an existing IRM. We agree that IRS should review its process to improve  the efficiency and effectiveness of its operations. However, we continue  to believe that designing and implementing procedures to regularly notify  non-filers of the need to file to continue receiving advance PTC  decreases the risk that the ad hoc notification process will not be followed  consistently in each filing season.", "IRS disagreed with our fourth recommendation related to reviewing tax  returns to those who are not reporting SRP. However, IRS stated that,  among other things, it has drafted a new IRM section for examiners who  are responsible for reviewing tax returns to determine whether health  insurance is reflected for the taxpayer for the entire year, and for  identifying and assessing SRP on taxpayers who are not appropriately  reporting SRP on their tax returns. IRS stated that the IRM section is  pending approval by Exam Policy. Although IRS stated that it disagreed  with our recommendation, we believe that the actions that IRS described  in its response to our draft report would sufficiently address our  recommendation if implemented effectively.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the  Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Administrator of the  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Commissioner of Internal  Revenue, and other interested parties.

Further, for those key control activities assessed that we  determined were properly designed and implemented, we evaluated the  extent to which they were operating as designed.", "To address our first objective, we reviewed improper payments reporting  requirements and guidance, such as that in IPIA and the related guidance  in Appendix C to OMB Circular No. A-123, Requirements for Effective  Estimation and Remediation of Improper Payments, to identify  requirements that agencies must meet to ascertain whether their  programs are susceptible to significant improper payments. We  interviewed key officials from CMS and IRS to gain an understanding of  their processes for implementing IPIA requirements, including how each  of their risk assessments were performed and their plans, if any, to  estimate and report on improper payments related to PTC. We also  analyzed CMS and IRS risk assessments for fiscal year 2016 to  determine whether they were consistent with IPIA and OMB guidance.  Specifically, we examined documentation to determine whether the CMS  and IRS risk assessments (1) considered the qualitative risk factors  specified by the improper payments requirements, (2) provided a basis for  the risk determination, and (3) sufficiently concluded whether the  programs met the criteria for susceptibility for significant improper  payments. In addition, we considered relevant IPIA requirements, OMB  guidance, and Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  to assess whether the Departments of Health and Human Services and  the Treasury externally communicated necessary quality information in  their 2016 agency financial reports regarding improper payments for the  PTC programs.", "To address our second objective, we first reviewed the Patient Protection  and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), its implementing regulations, relevant  internal control standards, and leading practices for measuring fraud  risks in federal programs. Based on this review, we identified CMS\u2019s  relevant risk areas and the key control activities needed to prevent and  detect improper payments of advance PTC. These control activities  included those related to verifying applicants\u2019 eligibility requirements to  receive advance PTC, accurately determining advance PTC amounts  based on expected household incomes and family sizes, and making  accurate PTC payments to certified issuers for qualified health plans. The  key control activities we selected are those that we viewed as critical for  addressing the various types of key risks that CMS faces that are likely to  result in improper payments of advance PTC.", "For this objective, we evaluated CMS\u2019s key control activities related to  CMS\u2019s federally facilitated marketplace (FFM) for plan year 2016. We  selected the FFM because it represented about two-thirds of the states  and about 75 percent of all enrollees receiving advance PTC at the time  of our audit. For our audit, we assessed whether the key control activities  at CMS, both individually and in combination with other control activities,  were properly designed to prevent and detect improper payments of  advance PTC.", "We then evaluated the design of these key control activities at CMS by  reviewing CMS policies, procedures, and other relevant documents, such  as interagency agreements and standard operating procedures for  eligibility support workers. We evaluated the key control activities to  determine whether they sufficiently addressed the key risk areas that we  identified by inspecting and analyzing relevant policies and procedures  and directly testing the design of certain controls contained therein using  the sample method described below. For key control activities that we  determined were properly designed, we then performed walk-throughs  and reviewed documents related to the control activities to determine  whether CMS had properly implemented them.", "For key control activities that we determined were properly designed and  implemented, we evaluated whether they were operating as designed by  testing a statistically random sample of FFM policyholders with advance  PTC payment transactions from CMS. To evaluate whether such key  control activities at CMS were operating as designed during the FFM\u2019s  PPACA\u2019s 2016 open enrollment period, we obtained all 2016 open  enrollment application transactions, including auto reenrollment  application transactions that had effectuated medical policies from the  FFM that were submitted from November 1, 2015, through February 1,  2016, and resulted in advance PTC. The total population of these  transactions was approximately 5.0 million records. To assess the  reliability of the application data, we (1) interviewed knowledgeable CMS  officials about the quality control procedures the agency had in place  when collecting and creating the data and (2) electronically tested the  data. Based on the results of these procedures, we determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "From the population of approximately 5.0 million applications, we  randomly selected 93 applications that had effectuated policies according  to CMS records. For these 93 applications, we reviewed CMS records to  determine whether the agency had performed the required internal control  activities related to verifying key eligibility requirements and determining  payments of advance PTC. We also used the random sample to provide  evidence of the effect of providing advance PTC on behalf of individuals  who did not meet the minimum income eligibility requirements. We did not  evaluate whether the control activities related to the accuracy of advance  PTC payments to issuers were operating as designed because such  payments included aggregated costs and adjustments, such as cost- sharing reduction subsidies and user fees, which were outside the scope  of our audit. As a result, the focus of our work in this area was on the  design and implementation of key control activities related to preventing  and detecting improper payments of advance PTC made to issuers.", "Similar to our procedures for our second objective, to address our third  objective, we first reviewed PPACA, its implementing regulations, relevant  internal control standards, and leading practices for managing fraud risks  in federal programs. Based on this review, we identified IRS\u2019s relevant  risk areas and the key control activities needed to prevent improper  payments of PTC, including recovering overpayments and reimbursing  underpayments. These key control activities were related to verifying  individuals\u2019 eligibility for PTC, accurately calculating PTC claims,  recovering overpayments (and reimbursing underpayments) related to  advance PTC, and appropriately resolving PTC-related errors and  discrepancies on federal income tax returns. The key control activities we  selected are those that we viewed as critical for addressing the various  types of key risks that IRS faces that are likely to result in improper  payments of PTC, including the failure to recover overpayments (and  reimburse underpayments).We evaluated IRS\u2019s key control activities from  October 1, 2015, to June 18, 2016. We also did not evaluate whether key  control activities that we determined were not properly designed and  implemented were operating as designed because, without proper design  and implementation, such control activities cannot achieve the control  objectives.", "We assessed whether the key control activities at IRS, both individually  and in combination with other controls, were properly designed to achieve  their objectives and address the related risks for preventing and detecting  improper payments of PTC.

To do this, we obtained a universe of PTC  transaction data from federal income tax returns that had PTC-related  transactions from October 1, 2015, to June 18, 2016, and then identified a  relevant total population of approximately 6.1 million transactions. To  assess the reliability of the PTC-related transaction data, we (1) reviewed  IRS\u2019s Individual Income Tax Credits reports and supporting data extracts,  (2) interviewed knowledgeable IRS officials about the quality control  procedures IRS has in place for collecting and creating the data, and (3)  electronically tested the data. Based on the results of these procedures,  we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "From the population of approximately 6.1 million transactions, we  randomly selected 93 federal income tax returns with PTC transactions  for our sample. For these 93 items, we reviewed the related federal  income tax returns, including the Form 8962, Premium Tax Credit, and  IRS processing reports and financial records on PTC-related transactions  to determine whether IRS had performed the required internal control  activities related to processing the credits. We also used this random  sample to provide evidentiary support and illustrative examples of the  effect of IRS\u2019s lack of statutory authority to correct PTC-related errors on  tax returns and certain identified control deficiencies.", "Because we followed a probability procedure based on random  selections, each of our samples (for both CMS and IRS) is only one of a  large number of samples that we might have drawn from the respective  sampling populations. Since each sample could have provided different  estimates, we express our confidence in the precision of our particular  sample\u2019s results as a 95 percent confidence interval. This is the interval  that would contain the actual population value for 95 percent of the  samples we could have drawn. Confidence intervals are provided along  with each sample estimate in this audit report. The results apply to the  universes of (1) all FFM application transactions received from November  1, 2015, through February 1, 2016, with effectuated medical policies that  resulted in payments of advance PTC and (2) PTC transaction data from  federal income tax returns occurring from October 1, 2015, through June  18, 2016.", "While our second and third audit objectives focused on certain significant  control activities related to preventing and detecting the improper  payments of PTC programs at CMS and IRS; we did not evaluate all  control activities and other components of internal control.
