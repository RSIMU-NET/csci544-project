Ten of these agencies experienced challenges with depending on an SSP to take actions before the agency could proceed. Agencies responding to GAO's survey also reported other challenges, such as a lack of guidance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury), limited customer agency and SSP resources, SSP errors affecting data quality, and inadequate SSP project management activities. Twelve of these 16 agencies stated that they are taking steps to address these challenges\u2014such as increasing communication with their SSPs, making technology improvements, and performing manual work-arounds to reconcile and correct data files. Nine agencies reported remaining additional steps, for example, correcting data errors and developing a reconciliation process and internal guidance on topics such as data quality plans. While agencies are primarily responsible for the quality of DATA Act submissions, five agencies also reported that their SSPs had taken similar steps to address identified challenges.", "Twenty of the 27 agencies described useful practices for working with SSPs on DATA Act submissions, including the agency discussing issues with the SSP and obtaining data files from the SSP each month to provide additional time to correct any identified errors. Treasury officials stated prior to GAO's survey that they held workshops for SSPs in the early stages of DATA Act implementation and clarified guidance issued in June 2018 to specifically address their concerns and questions.

Depending on the effectiveness of  agencies\u2019 and SSPs\u2019 actions to address them (as discussed further  below), these challenges may increase the risk that agencies will be  unable to submit quality data in accordance with the DATA Act.", "Dependencies. Ten agencies reported that they have experienced  challenges related to agency submission activities that depend on  relationships with, or actions being taken by, the SSP before the agency  can proceed. One agency reported that it must rely on its SSP to prepare,  validate, and finalize all DATA Act files prior to agency certification and  the files are often submitted close to the due date. Another agency  reported that its SSP provided DATA Act submission files to the agency  the day before or near the certification deadline. Relying on SSPs to  prepare DATA Act files in a timely manner increases the risk that  agencies may be unable to certify and publish their DATA Act  submissions on time.", "Resources. Seven agencies said that they have experienced resource  challenges related to a lack of funding or human resources at the  customer agency or its SSP. One agency noted that its SSP has only a  small group of people that assist with all of its SSP\u2019s services, making it  challenging in particularly busy seasons (such as the close of the fiscal  year) for the SSP to meet internal deadlines and resolve data  discrepancies affecting the timeliness, completeness, and accuracy of  data submissions. Another agency reported challenges with funding  resources, noting that the agency has been unable to use its SSP\u2019s  integrated financial and procurement system because of the costs  associated with implementation, operation, and maintenance. The  shortage of resources to bring on more staff or improve systems  increases the risk that agencies may be unable to submit quality data and  fully carry out DATA Act requirements.", "Competing priorities. Five agencies said that they have experienced  challenges related to statutory, regulatory, policy, or other matters that  have competing priorities or conflicting requirements that may affect an  agency or its SSP\u2019s DATA Act submission process. One agency reported  that the fourth quarter DATA Act reporting deadline falls within fiscal year- end reporting time frames, requiring the agency to prioritize fiscal year- end reporting over some of the DATA Act reporting tasks. Similarly,  officials from an SSP told us that they also experienced challenges with  the short turnaround times required to incorporate system updates for  DATA Act submissions.", "Data quality. Four agencies reported that they have experienced  challenges related to meeting DATA Act requirements for data quality  because they use an SSP, including completeness and accuracy of  agency data to be reported as well as SAO certification and reporting of  nonfinancial data elements. One agency reported that its SSP included  extraneous transactions in its File C that were not required for DATA Act  reporting. This created a high volume of warning messages when the  Broker compared the data with file D2 during the validation process.  Another agency reported that its SSP provided incomplete files for  agency certification and that the data in the files did not reflect the data in  the agency\u2019s financial reports. These challenges not only increase the risk  of lower-quality agency data submissions but may also require SSPs and  customer agencies to expend additional resources to address warning  messages that the Broker generated.", "Guidance. Four agencies reported experiencing challenges involving  incomplete, unclear, missing, and evolving OMB and Treasury guidance  related to SSP implementing requirements and Broker changes, including  data elements, the technical schema, and other key policies. One agency  noted that guidance on performing quarterly certifications is not readily  available. Two agencies reported challenges involving a lack of guidance  on how to communicate error corrections and desired changes to their  SSPs. Lack of guidance could result in misunderstandings or  miscommunications between the SSP and its customer agency,  increasing the risk of delays or errors in the agency\u2019s data submissions.", "Technology. Four agencies reported that they have experienced  technology challenges with developing and submitting required files.  These challenges include SSP infrastructure issues, such as integrating  multiple existing and disparate management systems or their SSPs  needing to modify existing systems to implement the DATA Act. Agencies  reported that some systems are unable to include the required data  elements for all reported transactions. Similarly, an SSP official told us  prior to our survey of customer agencies that the SSP also experienced  technical challenges with systems and data that have since been  resolved. Another SSP experienced challenges with its financial systems  not capturing award identification data elements, such as the PIID. Such  limitations in customer agency and SSP technology may require the use  of limited resources for error corrections and manual work-arounds,  increasing the risk of reporting errors, and may hamper customer  agencies\u2019 and SSPs\u2019 ability to submit quality data in accordance with the  DATA Act.", "Project management. Two agencies reported that they have  experienced challenges related to their SSPs\u2019 project management, such  as the lack of a designated project manager and inadequate  documentation of progress made or key decisions. Specifically, both  customer agencies said that their SSPs did not provide data in a timely  manner for their review prior to submission. One agency reported that  although this did not affect the timeliness of its submission, it affected  data quality because the agency did not have sufficient time to test and  implement sufficient internal controls and validation procedures prior to  data being published on USAspending.gov. Additionally, the same  agency reported that there is no senior project manager at the SSP who  oversees the processes used to provide financial management services  to the agency. This challenge may affect agencies\u2019 ability to resolve  errors, increasing the risk that they submit incorrect data.

Eight of the 12 agencies described  communication efforts with their SSPs or Treasury to facilitate  coordination and seek information needed to address their challenges  associated with using an SSP. These efforts include requesting  information from the SSP, Treasury, and other government resources to  obtain additional knowledge regarding the DATA Act and to prepare  internal guidance and procedures. One agency reported implementing a  weekly meeting with its SSP on DATA Act reporting. Another agency  reported that its SSP has been very proactive in sharing information  (bulletins, updates, etc.) and assisting with submitting DATA Act  information. According to the eight customer agencies, increased  communication and coordination has helped to address several  technology, dependency, and resource challenges.", "Technology improvements. To address technology challenges, four  agencies discussed making improvements in technology at both the  agency and the SSP. The improvements include implementing an  integrated financial and procurement system platform and working with  the software vendor to obtain access to FPDS-NG for anticipated 2019  procurement activity reporting. Another agency is currently implementing  a technological solution to aid in consolidating and reconciling files. In  addition to technological solutions, two agencies reported using manual  work-arounds, such as developing and implementing internal manual  processes to reconcile and correct data files.

These agencies also reported the need  to negotiate annual service-level agreements with their SSPs to address  resource and competing priority concerns. One of these agencies  reported that it continues to work with its SSP to understand what is  lacking in the process of correcting PIID information for obligations. A few  agencies reported the need to develop internal guidance on topics such  as data quality plans per OMB guidance and a reconciliation process to  address their data quality challenges. Finally, one agency reported that  it is in the process of hiring additional personnel to address its challenges  with competing priorities.", "While customer agencies are primarily responsible for the quality of their  DATA Act submissions, six of the 16 agencies that reported challenges  reported that their SSPs also need to take certain steps to address  identified challenges, such as communicating with the customer agency  and making technology improvements. For example, one agency reported  that its SSP does not provide the customer agency with updated data  submission files after the agency has requested changes. The customer  agency suggested that the SSP provide updated files more often to help  the agency ensure that the changes are included in the final file it submits  to the Broker. Another agency reported that its SSP has been  experimenting with different methods to eliminate cross-file warnings and  errors in File C that need to be addressed.", "Five of the 27 customer agencies we surveyed reported that additional  tools or guidance from OMB, Treasury, or other entities (such as the  SSP) could assist agencies with using an SSP for DATA Act submission.  Specifically, three agencies reported that they would like to have  guidance, including standard operating procedures, for communicating  and working with their SSPs. One agency suggested additional OMB or  Treasury training on compliance with the DATA Act, and one agency  suggested improvements by Treasury to prevent Broker errors that result  from normal business scenarios and require manual work-arounds to the  agencies\u2019 system-generated files.", "OMB staff told us that they are involved with the DATA Act Executive  Steering Committee, working closely with Treasury to oversee all aspects  of both policies and implementation related to federal spending  transparency efforts. According to OMB staff, neither the SSPs nor their  customer agencies have reported any current challenges with DATA Act  submissions to OMB. OMB staff stated that effective implementation of  OMB Memorandum M-18-16 guidance to agencies and SSPs, which  discusses establishing entity-level controls related to using SSPs, would  help to ensure that the SSPs provide quality services. In April 2019,  OMB issued Memorandum M-19-16 on shared services, which among  other things described the process and desired outcomes for shared  services and established a governance and accountability model for  achieving them. For example, as it relates to the DATA Act, the  memorandum calls for the Shared Services Governance Board to  leverage the DATA Act Executive Steering Committee\u2019s work on DATA  Act standards.", "Treasury officials told us prior to our survey that they held two workshops  for SSPs in the early stages of implementation to address specific  concerns and questions on DATA Act implementation. Treasury officials  stated that the only challenge reported by SSPs to the department related  to linking and certifying award data using the Broker when the awarding  agency and the file C reporting agency were different. To address this  concern, Treasury added clarification in guidance on files A, B, and C  submissions and a new Broker feature allowing agencies to specify  whether the award data submitted in Files D1 and D2 comes from the  funding agency or the awarding agency."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to OMB; Treasury, including ARC; ESC;  PFS; and IBC for comment.

We  issued our first report on data quality in November 2017, as required. In  July 2018, we issued a report on our review of OIG reports on agencies\u2019  first DATA Act submissions and in the course of our review found that  some OIGs reported challenges involving the use of federal shared  service providers (SSP) that helped agencies implement the DATA Act.", "For this report, our objectives were to describe (1) the types and  variations of services that the federal SSPs provide to their financial  management customer agencies to assist them in implementing the  DATA Act and meeting the act\u2019s requirements and (2) any challenges that  federal SSPs and their financial management customer agencies have  encountered in their efforts to ensure the quality of data submissions  consistent with the standards established under the DATA Act and the  steps they have taken to address those challenges.", "To address our first objective, we interviewed four federal SSPs and  surveyed their financial management customer agencies to identify the  types and variations of services the SSPs provide related to DATA Act  implementation and meeting the act\u2019s requirements.

During the  survey, we determined that 60 of those 67 agencies actually received  DATA Act services from a federal SSP and were eligible members of our  study population. We received survey responses from 31 agencies by our  January 2019 deadline and, based on our review, determined that 27  were eligible and sufficiently complete for our purposes. After excluding  ineligible agencies from our population, the response rate was 45  percent.", "In developing, administering, and analyzing the survey, we took steps to  minimize the five types of potential errors, described below, that may  affect survey results. Because we surveyed all agencies in our  population, there was no sampling error. To minimize the effects of  coverage error\u2014the exclusion of some eligible members of the  population, or inclusion of ineligible members\u2014we identified as ineligible  and removed seven initially identified agencies because we determined  that they did not use a federal SSP to provide DATA Act services.  Measurement error may result from differences in how a question is  interpreted and the sources of information available to respondents. To  help prevent measurement error, we conducted pretests of the draft  questionnaire with four customer agencies, each using a different SSP,  and made revisions to improve the validity and minimize the burden of  responding to our questions.", "Nonresponse error may result when a survey fails to capture information  from all agencies selected in the survey, and it may introduce bias if those  agencies that did not respond would have given materially different  answers than those that did. To maximize survey response, we sent  multiple email reminders to the surveyed agencies and extended the  submission deadline. While we do not have evidence of material bias  from those not responding, we limit our survey results in this report as  representing only those 27 agencies responding. Finally, to limit the  possibility of processing error, survey responses were checked for invalid  or illogical answer patterns, and data edits were made as necessary to  facilitate processing and analysis of the results.
