The Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, among other things, allowed public housing authorities, through allocation plans approved by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), to designate these units for either or both types of tenants. While elderly persons with disabilities remained eligible for elderly-only housing, younger persons with disabilities were no longer eligible to move into those buildings and needed other housing options. To provide options, HUD set aside incremental (new) Section 8 rental housing certificates and vouchers for low-income persons with disabilities. The Congress appropriated $50 million for fiscal year 1997 and $40 million for fiscal year 1998 for incremental certificates and vouchers for the exclusive use of persons with disabilities. Of the $90 million, $45 million was earmarked for housing authorities with approved allocation plans, and $45 million was earmarked for housing authorities that could identify the impact on persons with disabilities of elderly-only preferences established by privately owned projects in their communities.", "Concerned about the availability of housing for low-income persons with disabilities who can no longer move into public housing apartments that have been designated for the elderly, the Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies of the House Committee on Appropriations directed us, in its July 11, 1997, report (H. Rep. 105-175) accompanying the fiscal year 1998 VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies appropriations bill, to undertake a study. Specifically, the Subcommittee asked us to assess (1) the impact of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 on the availability of public housing for persons with disabilities and (2) how incremental Section 8 certificates and vouchers that were made available since the passage of the 1992 act were assisting persons with disabilities seeking affordable rental housing. As requested, we also developed estimates of the number of households that may meet HUD\u2019s definition for persons with disabilities. Appendix I describes in depth the methodology used to determine the size of this population and HUD\u2019s definition for persons with disabilities.", "To obtain information for this report, we surveyed, out of the 3,200 housing authorities nationwide, all 96 housing authorities that either had HUD-approved allocation plans or received certificates or vouchers for the exclusive use of persons with disabilities as of November 1, 1997. All 96 housing authorities responded to our survey. We supplemented the survey results by conducting six case studies at housing authorities around the country. We also interviewed housing officials at the federal and local levels as well as representatives of national associations of persons with disabilities and the elderly. Our methodology is described further in appendix II. Our case study analyses appear in appendix III."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The definition of \u201celderly families\u201d used to determine eligibility for certain public housing has evolved over time. Until 1992, the term encompassed low-income families whose head, spouse, or sole member was aged 62 or older, as well as low-income individuals with disabilities, regardless of age. All housing authorities were obligated by law to provide equal access to units in developments known as \u201celderly buildings\u201d to both elderly persons and persons with disabilities. These developments usually consisted of efficiencies and one-bedroom units rather than the multiple-bedroom units typical of family housing.", "As the number of younger persons with disabilities residing in \u201celderly housing\u201d increased, the complaints from their elderly neighbors also increased. Elderly residents cited the differences in values and lifestyles they had with the younger residents as impediments to safe and decent housing for the elderly. In 1992, we reported that nonelderly tenants with mental disabilities occupied between 8 and 10 percent of the units in public housing for the elderly, but were, according to public housing authorities (PHA), causing a disproportionate share of problems for the elderly residents as well as for the PHAs\u2019 management and staff. Problems included complaints about noise, visitors, crime, and disrespectful attitudes of the younger residents toward the elderly residents.", "It was primarily this increase in the number of tenants with disabilities in elderly housing and the resultant complaints that led the Congress to promote designated housing in the 1992 act. First, the 1992 act established a definition of elderly persons that no longer included persons with disabilities under the age of 62. Second, the act allowed PHAs to seek approval for designating housing as elderly-only, disabled-only, or elderly and disabled through allocation plans submitted to HUD. The 1992 act laid out criteria for the contents of allocation plans and standards that HUD should use to approve the plans. Specifically, the law stipulated that approval is to be granted to only PHAs that demonstrate in their allocation plans that designation is necessary to achieve the housing goals for their jurisdictions and to meet the needs of the jurisdictions\u2019 low-income population. PHAs that do not have approved allocation plans must continue to treat persons with disabilities and the elderly equally and allow both to live in elderly buildings on a first-come, first-serve basis. Finally, the act allowed owners of privately owned, HUD-assisted projects that were designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families to designate housing for the elderly through the establishment of elderly preferences or restrictions. Unlike PHAs that designate housing, however, owners of privately owned projects do not need to seek HUD\u2019s approval prior to designation or to notify HUD once designation occurs.", "To offset the potential loss of housing for persons with disabilities and to provide them with greater housing choices, HUD set aside Section 8 rental housing certificates and vouchers for their use. Through appropriations for fiscal years 1997 and 1998 for incremental certificates and vouchers, the Congress augmented HUD\u2019s ability to set aside Section 8 assistance for persons with disabilities displaced by public and privately owned housing designated for the elderly. Separately, HUD has also made Section 8 certificates and vouchers available to provide mainstream housing opportunities for persons with disabilities. The mainstream program is open to all housing authorities, not just those with approved allocation plans. It is popular with persons with disabilities who want to find housing in the private sector (known as \u201chousing of choice\u201d) rather than in public or project-based housing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Allocation Plans Have Had Little Impact Thus Far", "paragraphs": ["Only 73 of the nation\u2019s 3,200 PHAs had allocation plans as of November 1, 1997.

As a result, these units may no longer be available to persons with disabilities. However, persons with disabilities occupied only a portion of these units in the past, and most who resided in those units still do. Specifically, 53 of the 64 PHAs that designated units as elderly-only and provided complete occupancy data in our survey reported that when they submitted their plans, about 4,100 persons with disabilities were occupying units now designated for the elderly. The number had fallen to about 3,000 as of November 1, 1997.", "Overall, there has been little change in the number of persons with disabilities residing in units now designated as elderly-only, disabled-only, and elderly and disabled or in other undesignated units available to the elderly and persons with disabilities. One reason is that more than half of the PHAs with allocation plans had them approved as recently as 1996 or 1997, so the designations are relatively new. Another reason is that PHAs are not permitted to force residents with disabilities to move out of housing newly designated for the elderly and residents with disabilities may not wish to relocate.

The total decrease of 1,066 occupants represented about one-quarter of the persons with disabilities residing in those PHAs\u2019 units designated as elderly-only. The Chicago Housing Authority accounted for much of this decline, reporting 419 fewer people with disabilities residing in units now designated elderly-only. Thirteen PHAs reported no change, and 15 reported increases. One PHA reported an increase of 52 nonelderly people with disabilities occupying units that had been designated elderly-only. According to an official at this PHA, the allocation plan permits the PHA to accept near-elderly persons\u2014including those with disabilities\u2014if there is an insufficient number of elderly persons to occupy designated units. The increase in persons with disabilities at this PHA is due to the large number of near-elderly persons with disabilities who moved into designated units after the PHA submitted its allocation plan.", "Forty PHAs that designated units as elderly-only reported that 618 people with disabilities had moved out of the elderly-only units. Some of these PHAs also reported where these persons with disabilities went: 80 moved into other public housing units; 138 moved into private housing using Section 8 certificates or vouchers; and 275 moved into other housing.", "The PHAs that designated units for the elderly and disabled combined or that had undesignated units available for the elderly and persons with disabilities reported a total increase in the number of persons with disabilities occupying those units.

HUD cited the collaborative approach it uses to review plans, coupled with the availability of targeted Section 8 certificates and vouchers, as the factors that have minimized the potential impact.", "Two-thirds of the PHAs responding to our survey indicated that their designation of housing to date has neither helped nor hindered their ability to meet the housing needs of persons with disabilities. Officials at the three PHAs we visited that had allocation plans confirmed that designating units for the elderly had not had an impact on persons with disabilities. They noted that persons with disabilities were not required to move out of the designated units and that many of them had decided not to relocate. For example, an official at the Dallas Housing Authority said that many of the tenants preferred to stay where they were.

However, as of November 1, 1997, only about one-fourth of the total 4,943 certificates and vouchers reported had been used successfully. Officials from HUD and housing authorities that we surveyed gave various reasons for certificates and vouchers not being used. For instance, because of the time involved in awarding certificates and vouchers to housing authorities, many had not been in a position to issue the new rental certificates and vouchers by November 1, 1997. Statutory restrictions on the funds have limited their use.

Half of the $50 million was earmarked for housing authorities with approved allocation plans, and the other half was earmarked for housing authorities that could identify the impact on persons with disabilities of elderly-only preferences established by privately owned projects in their communities. As of November 1, 1997, none of the $25 million for housing authorities with approved allocation plans had been spent. According to HUD officials, this $25 million will be used once all of the funding made available in the October 1996 notice is awarded.

We have added, in the appropriate sections of the report, language to acknowledge the time needed for the submission and approval of housing authorities\u2019 applications and for the issuance and execution of annual contributions contracts before certificates and vouchers are actually available for use. HUD also suggested that we include the fiscal year 1998 funding of $48.5 million for the mainstream certificates and vouchers program. We did so. However, we disagree with HUD\u2019s suggestion that we delete from our analysis the $25 million of the fiscal year 1997 appropriations and the $20 million of the fiscal year 1998 appropriations that were directed at assisting nonelderly persons with disabilities affected by elderly preferences established by privately owned projects. We included these amounts because the Congress requested that our analysis include all new Section 8 certificates and vouchers for persons with disabilities.", "Comments on our survey instrument: HUD thought that our survey instrument should have included questions pertaining to housing demand, characteristics of persons on public housing waiting lists, and the number of efficiencies and one-bedroom units in family developments. Questions 24, 37, and 38 of the survey instrument asked PHAs to evaluate the impact that designating housing and issuing additional certificates and vouchers have had on their ability to meet the housing needs of persons with disabilities. We expected the PHAs to take demand for housing and the characteristics of the persons on their waiting lists into consideration in their responses to these subjective questions. Public housing waiting lists, we discovered in our pretests, are imperfect measures of demand for housing as they reflect demand only at the time the individual is placed on the waiting list or when the list is updated. Our survey found that 82 percent of the certificates and vouchers were used by persons with disabilities on public housing and/or Section 8 waiting lists. This is consistent with HUD\u2019s point that persons on waiting lists are the group most helped by the targeted Section 8 rental assistance. Furthermore, the focus of the survey questions regarding occupancy was on the designated units and the units available to the elderly and persons with disabilities. These questions did not exclude the possibility of such units in family buildings. Finally, we disagree that our question on how many units PHAs had designated for only persons with disabilities did not differentiate between units designated in the allocation plan and physically accessible units that were not designated in the plan. Questions 11 and 12 of the survey used the language \u201cunits you designated in your allocation plan as \u2019disabled-only,\u2019\u201d which we believe is very clear. We had no indication from either our pretests or our callbacks to housing authorities for response clarification that they were incorrectly interpreting these questions.", "Comments on our population analysis: HUD believed that we needed to focus more on families with very low incomes (i.e., incomes at or below 50 percent of the median family income for their area) in our analysis, not just low-income families (i.e., those with incomes at or below 80 percent of the median income for their area). HUD stated that families with incomes between 50 and 80 percent of the area\u2019s median income qualify for a smaller number of public housing units and generally do not qualify for Section 8 rental assistance. We concurred and made appropriate modifications. HUD also pointed out that our estimates of low-income persons with disabilities meeting HUD\u2019s definition differ significantly from the conclusion HUD reached in its 1997 report to the Congress on worst-case housing needs.

To further assist the residents moving out of the developments newly designated for the elderly, the housing authority contacted local landlords to find those willing to rent to people with disabilities. Housing authority staff told us that landlords were typically more willing to accept Section 8 individuals who were physically disabled than they were to accept families receiving Section 8 assistance.

The waiting time for those needing an elderly/disabled unit is about 60 to 90 days, though the wait may be as long as 6 months if the applicant needs a studio or an accessible unit.

Renting units with Section 8 assistance is generally not a problem for persons with disabilities, as they usually have a landlord in mind who has been contacted and is willing to work with them, according to TVRHA. However, few landlords are willing to make expensive modifications for tenants they are unfamiliar with because they do not know how long the tenants will stay. A TVRHA official told us that as a result, it may sometimes take persons with disabilities a little longer to secure a lease if units need various changes to comply with HUD standards.
