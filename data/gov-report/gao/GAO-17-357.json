In some cases these factors were cited as enhancing collaboration, while in other cases they were cited as hindering it. Among the factors identified were federal authorities, agency initiatives, joint community-level planning, and others. For example, several officials and stakeholders cited laws such as the Good Neighbor Authority and Tribal Forest Protection Act of 2004 as enhancing collaboration because they provide federal and nonfederal entities the authority to work across jurisdictions on projects to reduce risk. In addition, several officials and stakeholders cited the 2014 National Cohesive Wildland Fire Management Strategy (Cohesive Strategy) as helpful for collaboration because it emphasizes the importance of coordination across multiple agencies and includes comprehensive fire management goals. In contrast, some officials and stakeholders said collaboration on certain types of projects was hindered by the difficulty in sharing project costs between federal and nonfederal entities.", "Federal officials and nonfederal stakeholders also identified several actions they said could improve federal agencies' and nonfederal entities' ability to reduce wildland fire risk to communities. Among the actions cited was improving the implementation of the Cohesive Strategy. Some agency officials and stakeholders noted the importance of increasing accountability for implementing the Cohesive Strategy, such as through the use of performance measures. The strategy states that its success depends in part on monitoring and accountability, and calls for national outcome measures. This is consistent with previous GAO findings regarding national strategies. However, GAO found that the Wildland Fire Leadership Council (WFLC)\u2014the interagency body charged with overseeing and implementing the Cohesive Strategy and which includes the Forest Service and Interior as members\u2014has not developed measures to assess progress on the part of federal and nonfederal participants in meeting the national goals of the Cohesive Strategy. In 2013, WFLC proposed several measures but concluded that implementing them could place undue burden on the agencies and nonfederal partners. In 2016, however, WFLC reported that recent research findings could help quantify the strategy's effects over time. By working with WFLC to develop such measures, the Forest Service and Interior, together with federal and nonfederal partners, could better assess national progress toward achieving the goals of the Cohesive Strategy. Federal officials and nonfederal stakeholders also identified actions that, while not necessarily within the federal agencies' control, could be taken to reduce wildland fire risk to communities. For example, these actions include adopting state laws that require property owners to take risk-reducing actions such as using fire-resistant building materials or reducing vegetation around their homes. Some states have adopted laws to promote such actions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Forest Service and Interior work with WFLC to develop measures to assess progress toward achieving the Cohesive Strategy's goals.

Over the past century, however, various land  management practices, including fire suppression, have disrupted the  normal frequency of fires in many forest and rangeland ecosystems,  resulting in abnormally dense accumulations of vegetation. According to  scientific reports, this altered landscape, combined with drought and other  climate stressors, has contributed to larger and more severe wildland  fires. At the same time, development occurring in and around wildlands\u2014  an area often called the wildland-urban interface (WUI)\u2014 continues to  increase, placing more people, businesses, and infrastructure at risk from  wildland fire. As of fiscal year 2015, approximately 76,000 communities  nationwide were considered at risk from wildland fire, according to the  National Association of State Foresters. Recent wildland fire seasons  have demonstrated the potentially devastating consequences of fire to  communities. During the 2016 fire season, for example, a wildland fire  resulted in 14 deaths and destroyed or damaged thousands of structures  in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, while fires in California resulted in several  deaths and hundreds of structures lost.", "Taking action to address the wildland fire problem can be complex and  involve multiple federal and nonfederal entities. Wildland fires and the  vegetation that fuels them can cross the administrative boundaries  between federal lands, such as national forests and national parks, and  nonfederal lands, where most of the increased development in the WUI  occurs. At the federal level, five land management agencies\u2014the Forest  Service within the Department of Agriculture and the Bureau of Indian  Affairs (BIA), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Fish and Wildlife  Service (FWS), and National Park Service (NPS) within the Department  of the Interior\u2014are primarily responsible for wildland fire management on  federal lands, and in BIA\u2019s case, tribal lands. State forestry agencies and  other nonfederal entities\u2014including county, city, and rural fire  departments\u2014have primary responsibility for managing wildland fires on  nonfederal lands and share responsibility for protecting homes and other  private structures.", "To address the increase in wildland fires threatening communities, federal  land management agencies have placed greater emphasis on  coordinating efforts with nonfederal entities to reduce the risk of fire.  These efforts include, for example, reducing vegetation that can fuel  wildland fires and making houses or other structures more fire resistant.  Over the past 2 decades, federal land management agencies have issued  guidance and policies supporting a collaborative, cross-boundary  approach to reducing wildland fire risk and have undertaken multiple  efforts intended to reduce risk. For example, federal agencies have  collaborated with nonfederal entities in conducting fuel reduction projects  that span multiple jurisdictions, in some cases under nationwide federal  agency programs intended to facilitate such collaboration. In addition, to  prepare for wildfire seasons, federal agencies, states, and others have  signed agreements to document their commitment to coordinate and  exchange personnel, equipment, supplies, services, and funds among the  agencies in order to respond to wildland fires.", "Congress has also encouraged agencies to work with nonfederal entities  to reduce wildland fire risk. For example, the Cooperative Forestry  Assistance Act of 1978 authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to  cooperate with states to protect state and private forest lands from  damage caused by fire. More recently, in 2009, Congress passed the  Federal Land Assistance, Management, and Enhancement Act, which  requires land management agencies to develop a cohesive wildland fire  management strategy. The subsequent National Cohesive Wildland Fire  Management Strategy (Cohesive Strategy), issued in 2014, provides a  nationwide framework designed to more fully integrate fire management  efforts across jurisdictions, manage risks, and protect firefighters,  property, communities, and landscapes by setting \u201cbroad, strategic, and  national-level direction as a foundation for implementing actions and  activities across the nation.\u201d Rather than viewing fire management solely  as keeping fire away from communities, the Cohesive Strategy treats  wildland fire as a part of the natural landscape, assuming that it is  unavoidable and that communities must take action to become \u201cfire- adapted\u201d\u2014that is, be able to withstand a wildfire without loss of life or  property. The Cohesive Strategy, developed in collaboration with tribal,  state, and local governments, nongovernmental organizations, and  members of the public, describes ways the nation can make strategic  investments intended to reduce the effects of wildland fire on high-risk  areas.", "You asked us to examine federal and nonfederal collaboration to reduce  wildland fire risk to communities.

We  focused our review on federal wildland fire management activities  intended to reduce risk before a potential wildland fire incident occurs,  through fire preparedness, fuel reduction, prevention, and education.", "To address our first objective, we interviewed fire management officials  from 10 federal land management units, such as national forests and  national parks, and representatives of communities near these lands  about factors that enhance or hinder their collaboration to reduce risk to  communities. We selected land management units from each of the five  federal agencies using the following criteria: the size of the estimated  population in nearby WUI areas with high wildland fire hazard potential  (considering WUI areas defined by the Forest Service), the size in acres  of the land management unit, input from regional agency officials, and the  geographic location of the land management unit, with units selected to  provide geographic diversity. We then selected communities adjacent to  the federal land management units by considering input from local land  management agency officials. For each community selected, we  interviewed nonfederal stakeholders representing entities with which land  management unit officials collaborate, such as county officials, local fire  department officials, and homeowners. Using these criteria, we selected  land management units and adjacent communities in five states: Arizona,  California, Colorado, Florida, and Oregon. Because this is a  nonprobability sample, the information we report is not generalizable to all  land management units and communities and does not represent a  comprehensive list of collaborative programs or efforts nationwide or in  these states, but rather provides illustrative examples.

To gain a wider range of states\u2019  perspectives, we interviewed officials with the National Association of  State Foresters, the Southern Group of State Foresters, and the  Northeastern Area Association of State Foresters, which represent states  across the country. We also interviewed representatives of  nongovernmental organizations identified by federal officials we  interviewed or in reports as being involved in federal-nonfederal efforts to  reduce wildland fire risk; these organizations included the National Fire  Protection Association, the Intertribal Timber Council, and The Nature  Conservancy.", "In responding to our interview questions about factors that affect their  collaborative efforts to reduce risk to communities, federal officials and  stakeholders described factors that we defined as having affected direct  collaborative efforts (i.e., situations involving a tangible relationship  between two or more parties) and indirect collaborative efforts (i.e.,  situations in which actions by one entity may affect other entities  attempting to achieve a similar outcome). We include both types of  factors in our report, distinguishing between direct and indirect  collaborative efforts as appropriate.", "To address our second objective, we interviewed the federal officials and  nonfederal stakeholders described above to obtain information about  actions they stated could improve their ability to reduce wildland fire risk.  To increase our understanding of their responses, we interviewed agency  headquarters officials to obtain additional information and reviewed  relevant authorities, programs, and initiatives. For example, we reviewed  the Cohesive Strategy, associated action plans for implementing it, and a  2016 interagency report on the status of the Cohesive Strategy; we also  interviewed several of the officials responsible for implementing the  Cohesive Strategy. We compared the agencies\u2019 efforts to assess their  progress in achieving the goals of the Cohesive Strategy to guidance  contained in the Cohesive Strategy and associated action plans.

Fires have long shaped the composition of forests and  grasslands across every region of the United States, including ponderosa  pine forests in the Northwest and the Rocky Mountain West, chaparral in  the Southwest, sagebrush steppe in the Great Basin, tallgrass prairies in  the Midwest, longleaf pine forests in the South, and the pine barrens of  the Atlantic Coast. Fires periodically reduce vegetation densities and  stimulate seedling regeneration and growth in some species. Wildland  fires can be ignited by lightning or by humans, either accidentally or  intentionally. As we have described in previous reports from our body of  work on wildland fire management, however, various land use and  management practices over the past century\u2014including fire suppression,  grazing, and timber harvesting\u2014have reduced the normal frequency of  fires in many forest and rangeland ecosystems and have reduced these  ecosystems\u2019 resiliency to fire. We have reported that these practices  contributed to abnormally dense, continuous accumulations of vegetation,  which not only can fuel uncharacteristically large or severe wildland fires  but also\u2014with more homes and communities built in or near areas at risk  from wildland fire\u2014threaten lives, health, property, and infrastructure.", "In addition, changing climate conditions, including drier conditions in  certain parts of the country, have increased the length and severity of  wildfire seasons, according to many scientists and researchers. For  example, in the western United States, the average number of days in the  fire season increased from approximately 200 in 1980 to approximately  300 in 2013, according to the 2014 Quadrennial Fire Review. In Texas  and Oklahoma, the average fire season increased from fewer than 100  days to more than 300 during this time frame. According to the U.S.  Global Change Research Program\u2019s 2014 National Climate Assessment,  projected climate changes suggest that western forests in the United  States will be increasingly affected by large and intense fires that occur  more frequently.

Development in the WUI increased over the last several decades, in turn  increasing the risk to life and property from wildland fire. According to the  2014 Quadrennial Fire Review, 60 percent of new homes built in the  United States since 1990 were built in the WUI, which contains 46 million  single-family homes, representing about 40 percent of single-family  homes in the United States. Most development in the WUI occurs on  nonfederal lands, and, according to the National Association of State  Foresters, approximately 76,000 communities nationwide are considered  to be at risk from wildland fire.

WUI  communities can be very different from each other\u2014for example,  seasonal resort towns located in valleys, with homes in close proximity  and surrounded by fire-prone vegetation, or major suburban or  metropolitan areas adjacent to wildlands. The risk each community faces  also varies depending on such things as the flammability of the vegetation  in and around the community, structure location and building materials,  and local land use decisions. While the degree of risk can vary from one  place to another, under specific conditions, wildfire can affect people and  their homes in almost any location where vegetation is found. Even  structures not immediately adjacent to wildland vegetation can be  vulnerable because wind can transport embers and ignite homes more  than a mile from a fire.

Collectively, these activities are  generally intended to contribute to helping communities become more fire  adapted.", "Fuel reduction\u2014the removal of flammable vegetation that can fuel fires\u2014 can reduce the severity of wildland fires that occur, slow fire spread, or  otherwise make fires more manageable. Fuel reduction can occur through  mechanical treatment (i.e., thinning of trees and underbrush) or planned  ignitions (known as prescribed fires), which often replicate the positive  effects of naturally occurring wildfire. Federal agencies have collaborated  with nonfederal entities to prioritize, plan, and conduct fuel reduction  activities. For example, federal agencies have assisted local communities  or counties in developing Community Wildfire Protection Plans\u2014 documents that outline ways individual communities plan to reduce their  risk from wildland fire, such as by identifying priority areas for fuel  reduction. Federal agencies have also funded landscape-scale fuel  reduction projects that span multiple jurisdictions and include multiple  partners. Federal initiatives involving such projects include the  Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program and the Reserved  Treaty Rights Lands Program.", "Preparedness activities can help communities protect themselves during  a wildland fire by ensuring they have access to fire suppression  equipment, personnel, and emergency dispatch services. To prepare for  wildfire seasons, federal agencies, states, and others sign agreements\u2014 such as State Cooperative Wildland Fire Management and Stafford Act  Response Agreements\u2014to document their commitment to coordinate and  exchange personnel, equipment, supplies, services, and funds among the  agencies for responding to wildland fires. At the local level, federal land  management officials may meet with nonfederal entities, such as local fire  department officials, ahead of the wildland fire season to discuss roles  and responsibilities for wildland fire response and to train together by  simulating incident responses.", "Prevention activities can reduce the likelihood of fires caused by humans.  From 2001 through 2011, approximately 85 percent of wildfires in the  United States were human-caused, according to the National Interagency  Fire Center. Such fires can occur unintentionally\u2014for example, when  people burn leaves or trash or leave campfires unattended\u2014or they may  be deliberately set. According to research, communities with effective  wildfire prevention programs are likely to have fewer human-caused fire  starts. To help provide information about fire prevention, federal  agencies work with nonfederal entities. For example, under the  Cooperative Forest Fire Prevention program, established under the Smokey Bear Act of 1952, the Forest Service works with the National  Association of State Foresters and the Ad Council to develop and  distribute materials for the Smokey Bear campaign.", "Education activities can help reduce risk by helping homeowners and  communities understand actions they can take to reduce risk. For  example, communities may help minimize their risk by reducing  vegetation and flammable objects around structures\u2014an activity often  called creating defensible space. They also may help minimize their risk  by using fire-resistant building materials in construction and building in  low-risk areas. To help provide information about these activities, federal  agencies worked with stakeholder groups to develop a guide \u201cdesigned to  help leaders, planners, emergency professionals, and citizens learn the  best approaches and programs to help their community become more fire  adapted.\u201d Some communities have encouraged the use of voluntary  programs aimed at improving fire risk awareness and promoting steps to  reduce their risk, such as the Firewise Communities program. In  addition, some states have adopted legislation to encourage or require  wildfire mitigation in high-risk areas. For example, some state and local  governments have adopted laws and ordinances requiring property  owners to establish and maintain defensible space. Figure 3 shows  various actions federal agencies and nonfederal entities may take to  reduce wildfire risk in and around communities.", "Some federal-nonfederal collaboration at the national level encompasses  all types of risk-reduction efforts. For example, federal agencies and  nonfederal entities participate in the Wildland Fire Leadership Council  (WFLC), an intergovernmental committee of federal, tribal, state, county,  and municipal government officials. The WFLC is to provide strategic  oversight to help ensure policy coordination, accountability, and effective  implementation of long-term strategies to address wildfire preparedness  and suppression, hazardous fuel reduction, restoration and rehabilitation  of the nation\u2019s wildlands, and assistance to communities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Policies and Laws Aimed at Federal- Nonfederal Collaboration to Reduce Risk", "paragraphs": ["After emphasizing the need to suppress all fires for much of the 20th  century, federal agencies in recent decades reassessed their approach to  wildland fire management. As part of this reassessment, and as a result  of several wildfires and associated firefighter fatalities, the agencies  developed the Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy of 1995. Under  this policy, the agencies sought to make communities and resources less  susceptible to damage from wildland fires and to respond to fires to  protect communities and important resources at risk while considering the  cost and long-term effects of that response. The policy was reaffirmed  and updated in 2001, and guidance for its implementation was issued in  2003 and 2009.", "To address the increase in wildland fires threatening communities, over  the past 2 decades, federal land management agencies have also placed  greater emphasis on coordinating efforts with nonfederal entities to  reduce the risk of fire. For example, in 2000, the President asked the  Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to submit a report on managing  the impact of wildland fires on communities and the environment. The  report, along with congressional approval of increased appropriations for  wildland fire management for fiscal year 2001, as well as other related  activities, formed the basis of what is known as the National Fire Plan. As  part of this effort, Congress directed the Secretaries of Agriculture and the  Interior to work with state governors to develop a strategy. The resulting  strategy\u2014the 10-Year Comprehensive Strategy\u2014was developed by  federal, state, tribal, and local government and nongovernmental  representatives and outlined a collaborative framework to facilitate  implementation of proactive and protective measures to reduce the risk of  wildland fire to communities and the environment. For example, the  strategy recognized that while suppressing fires\u2014especially near homes  and communities\u2014is important, a continued shift in fire management  emphasis from reactive to proactive is also important in order to address  the root of the problem rather than react only when faced with costly  emergencies. Specifically, the strategy emphasized, among other things,  the importance of reducing human-caused fires through fire-prevention  education, increasing incentives for private landowners to address  defensible space and fuel reduction on private property through local land  use policies, promoting local government initiatives to implement fire- sensitive land use planning, and prioritizing fuel reduction where the  negative impacts of wildland fire are greatest.", "As noted, in 2014, the federal agencies, in collaboration with partners  from multiple jurisdictions, issued the Cohesive Strategy. The vision of the  Cohesive Strategy is \u201cto safely and effectively extinguish fire, when  needed; use fire where allowable; manage our natural resources; and as  a nation, live with wildland fire.\u201d The Cohesive Strategy identified three  goals: (1) landscapes across all jurisdictions are resilient to fire-related  disturbances in accordance with management objectives, (2) human  populations and infrastructure can withstand wildfire without loss of life or  property, and (3) all jurisdictions participate in developing and  implementing safe, effective, and efficient risk-based wildfire  management decisions. The Cohesive Strategy calls for a set of national  outcome measures to assess progress in meeting these goals.", "Since 2003, Congress has passed several laws aimed at actions federal  agencies can take to reduce wildland fire risk across federal and  nonfederal jurisdictions. For example, the Good Neighbor Authority  contained in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, authorizes the  Forest Service and BLM to enter into agreements allowing states to  perform watershed restoration activities, including hazardous fuel  reduction projects, on federal lands when the state is performing similar  activities on adjacent state or private lands. In addition, the Tribal Forest  Protection Act of 2004 authorizes the Secretaries of Agriculture and the  Interior to enter into agreements or contracts with Indian tribes to carry  out projects to protect Indian forest lands.

In 2017, the Department of Agriculture is to  invest in 10 new projects under the program while providing funding to 26  existing projects. The projects are located in 29 states across the  country. For example, in 2016, the Forest Service and NRCS selected  the Greater La Pine Basin project in Central Oregon as a recipient of  funding under the program. The project is to take place over 3 years and  is to target restoration on nearly 345,000 acres of federal, state, and  private land.

In  fiscal year 2016, Interior directed $10 million toward the program, which  funded 21 projects.", "In addition, many officials and stakeholders said that the Cohesive  Strategy, issued in 2014, enhances collaboration because it emphasizes  the importance of coordination across multiple agencies through an \u201call  lands approach\u201d and frames comprehensive goals that, taken together,  may mitigate wildland fire risk. As noted, the Cohesive Strategy identified  three goals: (1) landscapes across all jurisdictions are resilient to fire- related disturbances in accordance with management objectives,  (2) human populations and infrastructure can withstand wildfire without  loss of life or property, and (3) all jurisdictions participate in developing  and implementing safe, effective, and efficient risk-based wildfire  management decisions. Unlike the other initiatives described above,  implementation of the Cohesive Strategy is not separately funded  because the agencies do not consider it a program. One stakeholder  involved in its implementation described the Cohesive Strategy as a  framework designed to be applied differently in various locations and  scales to best suit a particular circumstance or address a need or  opportunity, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.

In addition, many federal officials and stakeholders said developing  Community Wildfire Protection Plans (CWPP)\u2014which outline ways  communities aim to reduce their risk from wildland fire by, for example,  prioritizing areas for fuel reduction in or near the community\u2014enhances  collaboration. Communities are not required to develop CWPPs, but when  they do, the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 directs that CWPPs  be developed collaboratively by local and state government  representatives, in consultation with federal agencies and other interested  parties. Under the act, agencies can prioritize funding for fuel reduction  projects that implement CWPPs.", "Communities may benefit from CWPPs in several ways. For example,  according to a 2015 Forest Stewards Guild report, CWPPs provide a  structure for collaboration and building community capacity. The report  also suggested that fuel reduction treatments completed in New Mexico  communities with CWPPs have changed fire behavior, and that projects  identified in CWPPs are less likely to be canceled or postponed  compared to projects conducted in areas without CWPPs. Eldorado  National Forest officials said that a CWPP completed in 2016 that covers  an area managed by state, federal, and private landowners has helped  enhance collaboration with community members to reduce risk because  participants came together to jointly determine priority projects, including  the placement of fuel reduction treatments. In addition, Florida state  forestry officials said they used information from CWPPs to develop their  statewide wildland fire risk assessment. According to these officials, the  assessment helps identify communities at high risk and inform state land  management decisions.", "Some federal officials and stakeholders also said that regularly sharing  information about wildland fire issues in person can enhance  collaboration to reduce wildland fire risk. For example, community  members near the Eldorado National Forest said that pre-season wildland  fire response training simulations, which included approximately 15  federal and nonfederal entities, helped participants develop relationships  and gain a better understanding of each stakeholder\u2019s responsibilities and  concerns ahead of a potential wildland fire. These community members  said that after participating in one such simulation, the state highway  patrol agency began to understand the community\u2019s concerns about  impediments to safe evacuation. In addition, meeting regularly to discuss  wildland fire risk reduction also helps create and facilitate collaboration,  according to some officials from federal and nonfederal entities. For  example, a Deschutes County official in Oregon said he participates in  monthly meetings with BLM officials and community members to  exchange information about upcoming activities, including efforts to  reduce risk from wildland fire.

In addition, federal officials  and community members said that engaged leaders enhance federal- nonfederal collaboration. For example, Eldorado National Forest officials  said that the forest supervisor, who respects community members with  differing views, has helped the forest successfully complete NEPA  requirements for fuel reduction projects. A National Association of  Counties representative said that having federal officials who are willing  to engage with communities by providing frequent updates about agency  risk reduction efforts shows people that federal officials consider  themselves part of the community; in doing so, they can help reduce  communities\u2019 risk of wildland fire. Similarly, a Forest Service official said  that in cases in which federal, state, and local representatives work  together, mitigation actions are more likely to occur and be sustained.", "Community members in Southern California cited an example of  leadership they said enhanced collaboration. These community members  said officials from NPS\u2019 Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation  Area initiated a meeting with local agencies in early 2016 to address  public concern regarding standing dead oak trees in the area.

According to federal  officials and stakeholders, communities tend to be more engaged in  wildland fire risk reduction activities if they have experienced recent fires,  have resources to carry out risk reduction projects, and have a group of  stakeholders from multiple jurisdictions dedicated to working  collaboratively on wildland fire risk reduction. According to a 2013 Forest  Service report, efforts to create and maintain fire-adapted communities  must involve the entire community\u2014including residents, government  agencies, emergency responders, businesses, land managers, and  others\u2014if these efforts are to succeed. Officials and stakeholders  provided examples of actions on the part of engaged communities,  including working to identify priority locations and actions for reducing  risk, creating defensible space on properties, and establishing WUI codes  and ordinances aimed at reducing risk.", "Several federal officials and community members said that communities  that have recently experienced nearby wildfires are often more eager to  take action and work with federal agencies to reduce risk. For example,  community members in Calabasas, California, and Topanga, California,  said they created a multiagency fire council after the Old Topanga Fire in  1993, which burned about 18,000 acres, destroyed 359 homes, and  resulted in three deaths. The community members said that working  together through the council has helped them provide wildland fire  education to community members and implement fuel reduction projects.  FWS officials said that agencies and others should harness this interest in  reducing risk because once a fire ends and time has passed, some  community members may no longer feel the same urgency to reduce risk.  In 2015, the Forest Service started a pilot program that officials said tries  to take advantage of the \u201cteachable moment\u201d in communities recently  affected by wildfires by deploying a \u201cCommunity Mitigation Assistance  Team\u201d to these communities. Forest Service officials said the team  focuses on, among other things, risk mitigation education and building  local capacity to undertake mitigation actions.", "Some federal officials and stakeholders also said communities that have  access to financial or other resources tend to be more engaged in  carrying out risk-reduction projects. For example, Oregon Department of  Forestry officials said state funding has helped establish collaborative  groups, consisting of diverse stakeholders, that focus on forest-related  issues around the state. California officials said federal grant funds aimed  at community risk reduction help communities purchase equipment for  fuel reduction projects, thereby keeping these communities engaged in  mitigation efforts. Some officials and stakeholders also said it can be  helpful when communities have a designated person assigned to work on  wildland fire mitigation by facilitating coordination, communication,  activities, and projects aimed at reducing risk. For example, Deschutes  County in Oregon hired a forester who is dedicated to collaborating with  the community to reduce risk, providing education about risk reduction,  and initiating and implementing fuel reduction projects, among other  duties. Similarly, the Forest Stewards Guild reported in 2015 that having  dedicated WUI specialists helped accelerate fuel reduction work and  expand public outreach in a county in New Mexico.", "In addition, community engagement increases when groups of  stakeholders from multiple jurisdictions are involved, according to BIA  headquarters officials we interviewed. For example, 27 states have  prescribed fire councils, in which federal agencies, nonfederal entities,  and others gather to discuss priority areas for fuel reduction treatments  and adopting building codes to mitigate wildfire risk, among other issues.", "In contrast, some federal officials and stakeholders identified several  potential impediments to community engagement. For example, some  federal officials in certain areas said that residents are resistant to  government intervention, including requirements that they take steps to  reduce their risk on their own properties. On the other hand, an NPS  official and stakeholders from western Colorado said some people expect  firefighters to intervene and save their homes, and as a result these  residents are not interested in taking steps to reduce risk. Furthermore,  other stakeholders said that some residents resist fuel reduction  treatments because they perceive the treatments as damaging the  environment or because they want the privacy provided by the vegetation  near their homes. Additionally, some federal officials and stakeholders  said the public\u2019s tolerance of smoke from prescribed burns can be limited,  which results in fewer prescribed fire treatments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Resources for Collaboration", "paragraphs": ["Many federal officials and stakeholders said that the availability of agency  resources, including funds provided to states and localities as well as  funding for agency activities, affects federal-nonfederal collaboration to  reduce wildland fire risk to communities and federal efforts to reduce  wildland fire risk more broadly. Regarding funding for states and localities,  federal officials and stakeholders cited cooperative agreements and  grants provided under the Forest Service\u2019s State Fire Assistance (SFA)  and Volunteer Fire Assistance (VFA) programs, and Interior\u2019s assistance  aimed at rural fire districts and communities, as helping communities in  their efforts to reduce risk. For example, the Forest Service\u2019s SFA  program provides financial assistance through partnership agreements  with state foresters for fire management activities, including helping  communities become fire adapted. According to the Forest Service\u2019s  fiscal year 2017 budget justification, SFA is a critical part of the agency\u2019s  efforts to reduce wildland fire risk to communities, residents, property, and  firefighters, because the program helps ensure that state, local, and  private landowners have the capacity and tools they need to prepare for,  respond to, and mitigate fire risk in the WUI and other critical areas. (See  app. V for descriptions of selected federal programs that provide risk- reduction funding to states and localities.)", "Several federal officials and stakeholders said the uncertainty of federal  funding through grants and assistance makes some nonfederal entities  reluctant to undertake joint efforts to reduce risk. For example, California  state officials said that landowners and other nonfederal entities may be  reluctant to commit to joint efforts because federal funding may decrease,  resulting in incomplete projects. In addition, several federal officials and  stakeholders said that, in contrast to the cost-sharing mechanisms  available for fire suppression activities, leveraging dollars for fuel  reduction projects can be difficult because no standard procedures or  agreements exist for sharing costs for such projects. According to a  senior official from the National Association of State Foresters, state and  federal agencies drafted a new \u201cSupplemental Project Agreement\u201d  appendix for the Master Cooperative Wildland Fire Management and  Stafford Act Response Agreement template that includes standard  procedures and agreements for sharing costs associated with non- suppression projects, such as fuel reduction projects. As of February  2017, the updated Master Agreement template was undergoing review  and awaiting final approval from the Departments of Agriculture and the  Interior.", "Many federal officials and stakeholders expressed concern about the  amount of funding available for risk-reducing activities carried out by the  agencies. Some federal officials and stakeholders said the growing  percentage of Forest Service funding spent to suppress fire has  hampered the agencies\u2019 ability to invest in activities on federally managed  lands that may reduce risk. Similarly, several Interior officials said that  Interior\u2019s funding reductions, and shifts in wildland fire management  priorities over the past 2 years to include a greater emphasis on  sagebrush steppe ecosystems, have affected their ability to carry out  wildland fire risk reduction activities. The officials also said that  proposed changes to the department\u2019s process for determining funding  distribution to its four agencies may have similar effects. Funding  constraints can have various effects, according to officials and  stakeholders. For example, Forest Service officials said that limiting  agency travel can reduce the agency\u2019s ability to establish or maintain  collaborative relationships with nonfederal entities. Forest Service officials  also said that fire prevention efforts have been diminished in cases in  which the agency has eliminated fire prevention positions or not filled  them when they became vacant.

Some  federal officials and stakeholders said Firewise, which encourages  homeowners to take responsibility for their own properties by using fire  resistant building materials and establishing defensible space, has helped  reduce risk through community education. For example, a Florida Forest  Service official said the Firewise program helped communicate to  communities across the state the importance of reducing wildland fire  risk. This official said the Firewise program works well in the state  because it primarily relies on voluntary action rather than regulations.  Figure 5 shows an example of a Firewise presentation at a community  event and an advertisement for a Firewise event.", "Federal officials also said they have used the Ready, Set, Go! program to  educate the public. For example, officials from the Apache-Sitgreaves  National Forest in Arizona said they use this program to help members of  the public understand actions they can take to prepare for a wildland fire  incident, such as making sure car gas tanks are at least half full so that  homeowners can evacuate quickly in case of a wildfire.", "Some federal officials said that conducting property risk assessments has  been helpful to educate property owners about the steps they can take to  reduce their risk of wildland fire. For example, BIA officials said fire  managers at the Fort Apache Indian Reservation reach out to  homeowners individually to teach them about risk-reducing actions they  could take based on their home\u2019s characteristics; these actions could  include clearing vegetation or relocating firewood to a spot away from  their home. BIA officials said that because they make the effort to reach  people at home, rather than provide general information to the broader  public, homeowners are more likely to undertake risk-reducing activities  pertinent to their homes. However, some officials said homeowners are  not always receptive to having their properties evaluated, and some  stakeholders said not all counties can afford to conduct risk assessments  and not all homeowners want to pay to create defensible space. More  broadly, a Forest Service headquarters official said that, while community  education has been successful in increasing awareness about reducing  risk, it does not necessarily result in individuals or communities taking  action. In addition, this official said programs such as Firewise have  increased risk awareness, but the extent of the risk reduction is unclear.  To help address this, the official said the agency expects to complete a  study in late 2017 that examines mitigation actions resulting from the  Firewise program; the Forest Service is conducting this study in  partnership with the National Wildfire Coordinating Group, the Wildland  Urban Interface Mitigation Committee, and the National Association of  State Foresters.

Regarding consistent prevention messaging, Forest Service officials said  that numerous federal and state agencies in the western United States  have used the One Less Spark\u2013One Less Wildfire campaign, which  started in California in 2012 and has since been used in other states. In  addition, some federal officials we spoke with said they use the Smokey  Bear campaign and materials as part of fire prevention efforts in their  communities.", "A community in Arizona, which attracts recreation visitors but is prone to  fires, created a working group to improve the consistency of local fire  prevention messages. Specifically, officials from the Apache-Sitgreaves  National Forest, the BIA Fort Apache Agency, surrounding counties, the  Pinetop-Lakeside community, and other entities formed the White  Mountain Fire Restrictions Working Group. Working group members said  they issue unified, cross-jurisdictional fire restrictions (i.e., limitations on  activities such as building campfires or using fireworks) to help ensure the  consistency of information provided to the public. According to working  group members, before they formed this group, the area was at greater  risk of human-caused fire because each jurisdiction issued its own level  of fire restriction, which led to public confusion because the fire  restrictions often differed across jurisdictions. Working group members  said that as a result of their efforts, the risk of fire has decreased because  the public is less confused about where and when fire-related activities  can be conducted.", "Regarding targeted fire prevention messaging, Forest Service officials  cited National Fire Prevention Education Teams as an example of  federal-nonfederal efforts to provide targeted fire prevention information.  These officials said the National Wildfire Coordinating Group sends  teams\u2014which may include members from the Departments of Agriculture  and the Interior, states, and others\u2014to areas at high risk of wildland fire  to raise awareness of actions communities can take to reduce their risk.  According to the National Interagency Fire Center, these teams can help  reduce the loss of human life, property, and resources. They can also  improve interagency relations.", "BIA officials said that, in part because of targeted efforts aimed at  reducing arson, the number of human-caused fires on the Fort Apache  Indian Reservation in Arizona decreased from several hundred in 2004 to  40 in 2016. BIA officials estimated that these types of efforts also helped  reduce the number of fires caused by youths on the Warm Springs Indian  Reservation in Oregon from 17 in 2009 to 2 in 2016.

For example, under Oregon\u2019s Forestland-Urban  Interface Fire Protection Act, property owners in identified forestland- urban interface areas must reduce excess vegetation around structures  and along driveways that can fuel a fire. According to Oregon state  officials, the law, at the time of our review, was applicable to 17 of  Oregon\u2019s 36 counties identified as having a higher wildland fire risk.  Oregon state officials said it is helpful that the state legislature recognizes  the need for individual homeowner action in risk mitigation, and they said  they are reviewing the law to determine ways it could be improved.  California state law also requires property owners in certain areas to  maintain a specified amount of defensible space around structures.", "Local governments in several states have codes or ordinances aimed at  wildland fire risk reduction by requiring fire resistant building materials,  requiring the creation of defensible space, or limiting where homes can be  built.

As a  result, this official said, county decision-makers should weigh the costs of  requiring such actions against the benefits gained through reduced risk.  Forest Service headquarters officials said codes and ordinances can help  reduce wildland fire risk in some circumstances, but they said no data are  available to show what type of community planning is instrumental in  reducing risk. These officials also noted that taking action does not  guarantee that a home will be spared, given the conditions and severity of  a fire.", "According to a nonfederal researcher we interviewed, it is also helpful  when communities integrate actions or requirements to reduce risk into  comprehensive county land-use plans. For example, the Community  Planning Assistance for Wildfire program, established in 2015 by  Headwaters Economics and Wildfire Planning International, is a grant  program that works with communities to help reduce wildfire risk through  improved land-use planning. In Wenatchee, Washington, the program  developed recommendations to help the community improve its land-use  plans specific to its wildland fire risk. While the community has high- frequency fires, they are not high intensity and most are grass fires,  though many buildings have been lost in recent fires.

Some officials and stakeholders said it is important to increase  accountability for implementing the Cohesive Strategy, such as through  the use of performance measures as part of implementing the strategy.  The Cohesive Strategy states that its successful implementation depends  in part on monitoring and accountability, noting that \u201cA set of national  outcome performance measures will allow Congress, the national  wildland fire management community, and other stakeholders to monitor  and assess progress toward achieving the results for each of the three  national goals.\u201d This emphasis on monitoring and accountability is  consistent with key characteristics we have described for developing and  implementing effective national strategies. Likewise, one of the key  collaboration practices we have identified is that federal agencies  engaged in collaborative efforts should develop mechanisms to monitor,  evaluate, and report on results.

More broadly, the Wildland Fire Leadership Council (WFLC)\u2014the  interagency organization responsible for oversight and leadership in  implementing the Cohesive Strategy (and which includes the Forest  Service and Interior as members)\u2014has not developed measures to  assess progress on the part of federal and nonfederal participants in  meeting the national goals of the Cohesive Strategy.", "According to a December 2016 WFLC report, a performance measure  task group was convened in January 2013 and proposed several  performance measures that could be used to track progress in achieving  the broad goals of the Cohesive Strategy. One such measure was the  percentage of communities at risk with a high probability of withstanding  wildfire without loss of life and infrastructure; this measure was intended  to assess the extent to which the threat to communities at risk from  wildfire had decreased. However, the Wildland Fire Executive Council, a  former advisory council to WFLC, concluded that, while performance  information for many of the 2013 task group\u2019s proposed measures could  be collected using reporting measures the agencies already had in place,  fully implementing the proposed performance measures would likely  place undue burden on the agencies and nonfederal partners. The Forest  Service and Interior each have performance measures to monitor and  assess their wildland fire management efforts. For example, one of  Interior\u2019s performance measures is the amount of fuel reduction  conducted in the WUI, which is consistent with the Cohesive Strategy\u2019s  emphasis on resilient landscapes. However, these agency measures are  intended to separately assess each agency\u2019s performance\u2014or, in some  cases the performance of specific programs\u2014and do not represent the  set of measures to assess national progress toward meeting the  Cohesive Strategy\u2019s goals, as called for in the strategy.", "The 2016 WFLC report states that the use of research findings, remote  sensing, and modelling can help quantify the effects of activities over time  and can contribute to showing accountability and success in meeting the  goals of the Cohesive Strategy.

Some federal officials we interviewed said consistent prevention  messaging across locations, such as through the nationwide Smokey  Bear campaign, is important; this is because it helps the public identify  with the message no matter where they travel. Federal officials said that,  in addition, targeting prevention messages to specific groups is important  because the origin of human-caused fires varies depending on the  location and characteristics of the community. For example, some areas  may have more instances of juvenile arson, while other areas may have  more instances of campers not fully extinguishing their campfires. A  senior Forest Service official said that communities can benefit from  developing prevention plans that identify a targeted prevention audience.  Otherwise, this official said, communities and federal officials \u201cthrow darts  at a board\u201d rather than targeting prevention efforts at specific fire-causing  activities unique to a particular area.

Community members in northern California said  limited timber-processing capability affects their ability to process the  vegetation removed as part of fuel reduction efforts. Because timber is  valuable to some communities, the ability to process it can help support  jobs and the local economy. Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest officials  in Arizona cited the usefulness of establishing biomass processing  facilities near communities, noting that such facilities located near the  neighboring community of Snowflake have helped facilitate a local timber- processing market.

Stakeholders in Southern California also said some insurance  companies have refused to provide homeowner\u2019s insurance to property  owners unless they undertake risk-reducing actions.

This official also noted that providing discounts to homeowners in  Firewise communities does not guarantee that every homeowner within  the community has taken action to reduce risk. Similarly, a 2016 review  by Headwaters Economics reported, based in part on conversations with  insurance industry experts, that it is unlikely that insurance rates and  policies alone will determine whether a landowner decides to build a new  home on wildfire-prone land.

One area of focus for both federal  and nonfederal entities has been the development of the Cohesive  Strategy, which emphasizes the importance of coordination across  entities and frames comprehensive national goals for mitigating the risk of  wildland fire. However, WFLC has not developed performance measures  to assess the combined efforts of federal and nonfederal participants in  meeting the goals of the Cohesive Strategy. The Forest Service and  Interior each have performance measures to monitor and assess their  wildland fire management efforts, but those measures apply to the  agencies individually and do not represent the set of national measures  called for in the Cohesive Strategy.

We also received written comments from Interior, which are reproduced in  appendix VIII. Interior did not concur with our recommendation, citing  three primary areas of disagreement.", "First, while acknowledging that measures to assess national progress  toward achieving the goals of the Cohesive Strategy could be beneficial,  Interior noted in its letter that the Wildland Fire Executive Council had  previously determined that instituting the measures that had been  presented to it would place undue burden on the agencies and nonfederal  partners. Interior also stated that assessing national progress toward  achieving the Cohesive Strategy\u2019s goals would cost taxpayers more than  it would save, and cited a 2013 study that noted the challenging nature of  efforts to assess the effectiveness of fuel reduction and restoration  treatments. More recently, however, as we note in our report, a  December 2016 WFLC report stated that the use of research findings,  remote sensing, and modelling can help quantify the effects of activities  over time and can contribute to showing accountability and success in  meeting the goals of the Cohesive Strategy. During our review, Interior  officials said they had not had sufficient time to determine which, if any,  research findings could be useful in this effort, and Interior\u2019s letter does  not refer to this aspect of the 2016 WFLC report. As a result, it is not clear  whether Interior has fully considered the potential for using research  findings or other tools described in the 2016 report to measure national  progress in a cost-effective way.", "Second, Interior stated that in 2014 it changed its strategic performance  metrics to demonstrate departmental progress toward meeting the  strategy\u2019s goals. Our report describes an example of one such  departmental measure that is consistent with the Cohesive Strategy\u2019s  emphasis on resilient landscapes. However, as we note in our report,  agency performance measures are intended to separately assess each  agency\u2019s performance\u2014or, in some cases the performance of specific  programs\u2014and do not represent a set of measures to assess national  progress toward meeting the Cohesive Strategy\u2019s goals, as called for in  the strategy. Such measures could, as noted in the Cohesive Strategy,  allow Congress and other stakeholders to monitor and assess progress  toward achieving the strategy\u2019s goals. Interior did not indicate any steps it  would take to meet the Cohesive Strategy\u2019s call for measuring national,  rather than departmental, progress in meeting the strategy\u2019s goals.", "Third, Interior noted that federal entities cannot control or mandate  response or participation from non-federal partners. However, given the  Cohesive Strategy\u2019s emphasis on collaboration between federal and  nonfederal entities to achieve its goals, the WFLC\u2014as the interagency  body charged with implementing the strategy\u2014is an appropriate forum for  working to develop measures.

Among the laws we reviewed were the Federal Land  Assistance, Management, and Enhancement Act; Healthy Forests  Restoration Act of 2003; Good Neighbor Authority; Wyden Amendment;  and Tribal Forest Protection Act of 2004. In addition, we reviewed policy  documents and agency budget justifications, such as the 2009 Guidance  for Implementation of Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy, the  National Cohesive Wildland Fire Management Strategy, and the Forest  Service fiscal year 2017 budget justification. We also reviewed other  documents such as the 2014 Quadrennial Fire Review Final Report, the  U.S. Global Change Research Program\u2019s 2014 National Climate  Assessment, Headwaters Economics\u2019 paper Do Insurance Policies and  Rates Influence Home Development on Fire-Prone Lands?, and the  Forest Stewards Guild report Evaluating the Effectiveness of Wildfire  Mitigation Activities in the Wildland-Urban Interface. We conducted a  basic assessment of these studies\u2019 methodologies, assumptions, and  limitations and determined them to be sufficiently credible for our  purposes. We also interviewed headquarters officials from each of the  five federal land management agencies responsible for wildland fire  management\u2014the Forest Service in the Department of Agriculture and  the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and  Wildlife Service, and National Park Service in the Department of the  Interior\u2014as well as Interior\u2019s Office of Wildland Fire. Because our report  addresses reducing risk to communities, we focused our review on  federal wildland fire management activities intended to reduce risk before  a potential wildland fire occurs, through fire preparedness, fuel reduction,  prevention, and education.", "To address our first objective, we interviewed fire management officials  from 10 federal land management units, such as national forests and  national parks, as well as representatives of communities near these  lands. We selected land management units from each of the five federal  agencies using the following criteria: the size of the estimated population  in nearby wildland-urban interface areas, as defined by the Forest  Service, with high wildland fire hazard potential; the size in acres of the  land management unit; input from regional land management agency  officials; and the geographic location of the land management unit, with  units selected to provide geographic diversity. We then selected  communities adjacent to the federal land management units by  considering input from local land management agency officials. For each  community selected, we interviewed representatives from nonfederal  entities with which land management unit officials interacted; these  representatives included county officials, local fire department officials,  and homeowners. Using these criteria, we selected land management  units and adjacent communities in five states: Arizona, California,  Colorado, Florida, and Oregon. During our interviews with federal officials  and community representatives, we asked about ways in which federal  and nonfederal entities collaborated and factors that enhanced or  hindered their ability to collaborate.", "In addition, for the five states we selected, we interviewed officials with  state wildland fire and forestry agencies. To gain a wider range of  perspectives from states that were not included in our site selection, we  interviewed officials with the National Association of State Foresters, the  Southern Group of State Foresters, and the Northeastern Area  Association of State Foresters, which represent states across the  country.

In response to our  interview questions about factors that affect collaboration efforts aimed at  reducing risk to communities, officials and stakeholders described factors  that we defined as having affected direct collaboration and indirect  collaboration. For example, direct collaboration (i.e., situations involving a  tangible relationship between two or more parties) includes federal  policies and authorities that require or enable collaboration. Factors that  affect indirect collaboration (i.e., situations in which actions by one entity  may affect other entities attempting to achieve a similar outcome) include  community education, which can affect communities\u2019 ability to take risk  reduction actions that may or may not include collaboration with others.  We include both types of factors in our report, distinguishing between  direct and indirect collaboration as appropriate.", "Based on the frequency of factors identified, as well as information we  obtained through our review of documents mentioned above related to  this topic, we reported on factors associated with nine categories.

Because many  of the responses were broad in nature and could be categorized into  multiple categories, analysts verified each other\u2019s categorizations. After  completing the categorization of responses, we assessed the frequency  with which responses occurred in each category to help identify factors to  discuss in our report. Our report generally does not discuss infrequently  identified factors.", "To address our second objective, we interviewed federal officials and  nonfederal entities described above to obtain information about actions  they said could reduce risk to communities from wildland fire. We  categorized and coded their responses using the method described  above. Based on the frequency of solutions identified, as well as  information we obtained through our review of documents mentioned  above related to this topic, we reported on solutions associated with  seven categories: improving implementation of the Cohesive Strategy,  increasing collaborative planning, expanding education, increasing  prevention efforts, improving timber-processing capability, adopting state  and local ordinances, and providing insurance incentives. To increase our  understanding of the actions identified, we reviewed information about  related programs and initiatives, including information about the Forest  Service\u2019s Wood Innovations grant program, documents such as Best  Management Practices for Creating a Community Wildfire Protection  Plan, and information about the Smokey Bear campaign. We reviewed  the Cohesive Strategy and action plans for implementing it, various  \u201csuccess story\u201d project descriptions, guiding documents for WFLC and its  regional committees, and other relevant documents. We also reviewed  Cohesive Strategy implementation guidance and a 2016 report on the  Cohesive Strategy by WFLC\u2019s National Strategic Committee. We then  compared agency efforts to assess progress toward achieving the  Cohesive Strategy\u2019s goals against guidance contained in the strategy and  associated action plans. To obtain additional insight into the use of  performance information on the part of federal agencies, we reviewed our  previous reports related to interagency strategies and agencies\u2019 efforts to  collaborate. We also reviewed various state and local ordinances that  encourage fire-resistant building and the removal of potentially flammable  vegetation around structures and that discourage development in areas at  high risk from wildland fire.
