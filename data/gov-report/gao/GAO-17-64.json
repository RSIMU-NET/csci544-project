While FDA and some states collect data on drug compounders, only one state reported collecting data on the number of prescriptions or the volume of compounded drugs. In addition, states GAO surveyed and stakeholders GAO interviewed did not collect data specific to the extent of compounding performed by nonpharmacists, such as physicians.", "Nearly all of the states GAO surveyed reported having drug compounding laws, regulations, or policies, though few apply to nonpharmacists, and states conduct inspections and can take actions to enforce them. Less than 20 percent of states reported having laws, regulations, or policies specific to compounding by nonpharmacists (e.g., physicians), and these state laws varied. To help ensure compliance, most states reported inspecting drug compounders, such as pharmacies and outsourcing facilities, and most states can take several types of actions against pharmacies, including monetary fines, and suspension and revocation of a license or registration.", "Most states reported being satisfied with their communication with FDA and other states, although some reported challenges. About three quarters of the states reported participating in FDA-sponsored activities, such as intergovernmental meetings, and obtaining information from FDA's website. Some states reported challenges with this communication, such as getting FDA to respond to requests for information. In terms of communication between states, most survey respondents reported that they are satisfied with this communication, which occurs through conferences and other activities.", "FDA has taken steps to implement its regulatory responsibilities to oversee drug compounding, but states and stakeholder organizations have cited challenges and concerns. FDA has issued numerous draft and final guidance documents related to drug compounding, and conducted more than 300 inspections of drug compounders, which resulted in actions such as FDA issuing warning letters and voluntary recalls of potentially contaminated compounded drugs. Some stakeholder organizations said the amount of time it takes FDA to finalize the guidance and other documents\u2014including those required by the 2013 law\u2014is challenging. FDA officials noted that reviewing the large number of comments received has contributed to the time the agency has taken to finalize them. States and stakeholder organizations also cited concerns related to access to compounded drugs and differences between states and FDA on the appropriate inspection protocols to use when inspecting drug compounders. In August 2016, FDA changed its procedures to address concerns about the appropriate protocols to use for these inspections."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Drug compounding is the process of combining, mixing, or altering  ingredients to create a medication tailored to the needs of an individual  patient. Compounding is typically used to prepare medications that are  not commercially available, such as medication for a patient who is  allergic to an ingredient in a mass-produced pharmaceutical product. At  the state level, drug compounding has traditionally been overseen by  state pharmacy regulatory bodies (e.g., boards of pharmacy). In addition  to pharmacists, other health care practitioners, such as physicians, may  prepare compounded drugs, and these practitioners are generally  overseen by their respective state licensing agencies (e.g., state medical  boards). At the federal level, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), an  agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is  responsible for overseeing the safety and quality of domestic and  imported pharmaceutical products under the Federal Food, Drug, and  Cosmetic Act (FDCA).", "Concerns have been raised that some pharmacies were going beyond  traditional drug compounding for individual patients by compounding and  selling large quantities of drugs to facilities in multiple states without  meeting federal safety and other requirements applicable to new drugs.", "Further, an outbreak of fungal meningitis in 2012 linked to contaminated  compounded steroid injections, which resulted in over 60 deaths and  hundreds of people getting ill, raised questions about the safety and  quality of compounded drugs and concerns about state and federal  oversight of drug compounding. In July 2013, we reported that FDA\u2019s  oversight authority was unclear and recommended that Congress  consider clarifying FDA\u2019s authority to oversee drug compounding. The  Drug Quality and Security Act (DQSA), enacted in November 2013,  helped clarify FDA\u2019s authority to oversee drug compounding nationally  and created a new category of compounders called outsourcing  facilities\u2014facilities that meet certain FDA requirements, including  compounding sterile drugs, that register with and are inspected by FDA,  and are allowed to compound drugs without patient-specific prescriptions.  The act also included a provision for GAO to review drug compounding.

We reviewed relevant  documents provided by these stakeholder organizations, including  comments submitted to FDA regarding FDA\u2019s compounding-related  activities. In addition to officials from the 25 stakeholder organizations, we  interviewed state officials, including officials from the boards of pharmacy,  medical boards, and the agencies that have oversight responsibility for  outsourcing facilities in three selected states\u2014North Carolina, Minnesota,  and Texas. We selected these states because they reported differing  laws, regulations, or policies related to drug compounding (such as  oversight of outsourcing facilities) in their responses to the survey, among  other reasons. We obtained information on state laws, regulations, and  policies related to drug compounding in each selected state, and we  obtained additional details for certain survey responses from the board of  pharmacy officials. In addition, we interviewed officials from two  pharmacy benefit managers\u2014third-party administrators of prescription  drug programs for certain health plans and federal and state government  employee plans\u2014to obtain information related to drug compounding,  including how these entities determine the safety and quality of  compounded drugs.

For example, a pharmacist may tailor a medication for a patient  who is allergic to an ingredient in a conventionally manufactured drug or  prepare a liquid formulation for a patient who has difficulty swallowing  pills. Pharmacies sometimes compound drugs in advance of receiving  individual patient prescriptions in anticipation of receiving prescriptions  based on historical prescribing patterns\u2014a practice referred to as  anticipatory compounding. Drugs are also sometimes compounded to be  kept in stock by a hospital, clinic, or physician\u2019s office to administer to  patients, such as patients with an immediate need for the compounded  drug\u2014a practice referred to as office-use compounding. In addition to  pharmacists, other health care practitioners, such as physicians, may also  compound drugs. Compounded drugs include nonsterile preparations\u2014 such as capsules, ointments, creams, gels, and suppositories\u2014and  sterile preparations, including intravenously administered fluids,  ophthalmic products, and other injectable drugs. Compounded sterile  drugs pose special risks of contamination if not made properly, and  require special safeguards to prevent injury or death to patients receiving  them. In addition, nonsterile drugs that are compounded improperly (e.g.,  if they contain too much active ingredient) can also cause serious harm.", "An outbreak of fungal meningitis in 2012 linked to contaminated  compounded drugs led to questions about the safety and quality of  compounded drugs, and raised concerns about state and federal  oversight of drug compounding. At the time, concerns were raised by  FDA and others\u2014including members of Congress and public health  advocates\u2014that some pharmacies were going beyond traditional drug  compounding by producing large quantities of compounded drugs without  prescriptions for individual patients, and selling those compounded drugs  to facilities in multiple states. Many believed that these types of  pharmacies were engaging in conventional manufacturing under the  guise of compounding without meeting safety and other requirements with  which conventional drug manufacturers must comply. In July 2013, we  found that the authority of FDA to oversee drug compounding was  unclear and this lack of clarity had resulted in gaps in oversight of drug  compounding. Specifically, two federal circuit court decisions had  resulted in differing FDA authority in different parts of the country, and  these inconsistent decisions contributed to challenges in FDA\u2019s ability to  inspect and take enforcement action against entities engaging in drug  compounding.", "In November 2013, the DQSA was enacted to help clarify FDA\u2019s authority  to oversee drug compounding. The act established a new type of facility,  an outsourcing facility, that prepares sterile compounded drugs and which  may compound drugs without patient-specific prescriptions. These  outsourcing facilities differ from drug compounders operating under  section 503A of the FDCA, which exempts drugs compounded by a  licensed pharmacist or licensed physician based on the receipt of a valid  prescription, for an identified individual patient, and in accordance with  certain other conditions, from three key provisions of the FDCA that are  otherwise applicable. The DQSA also removed certain provisions from  section 503A of the FDCA that were found to be unconstitutional by the  U.S. Supreme Court in 2002, and affirmed the validity of the remaining  provisions in section 503A. Table 1 outlines some of the requirements  under section 503A, applicable to 503A compounders, and section 503B,  applicable to outsourcing facilities.", "While FDA is required to inspect outsourcing facilities, it does not  routinely inspect 503A compounders, although it may in certain instances  (e.g., in response to complaints). In general, states regulate  compounding as part of the practice of pharmacy and the state pharmacy  regulatory bodies (e.g., boards of pharmacy) are responsible for oversight  of the practice of pharmacy, which may include inspections of pharmacies  that are 503A compounders. For example, a state board of pharmacy  may inspect pharmacies that compound drugs for compliance with the  U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention\u2019s (USP) compounding standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Drugs Are Compounded in a Variety of Settings; FDA and Some States Collect Data on the Number of Drug Compounders, but Not the Volume of Compounded Drugs", "paragraphs": ["Our survey of state pharmacy regulatory bodies found that drugs are  compounded in a variety of pharmacy and other health care settings,  including outsourcing facilities.

Respondents in most states also reported that FDA- registered outsourcing facilities were authorized to compound sterile  drugs in their states; however, respondents in 5 states reported that these  entities were not authorized to do so for reasons including that the state  was still in the process of developing a state license for these entities. In  addition, respondents in over half of the states reported that physicians\u2019  offices\u2014both general practitioners\u2019 offices and medical specialty offices  (e.g., dermatologists and pediatricians)\u2014were authorized to prepare  sterile compounded drugs in their states; however, respondents in several  other states reported that they did not know if certain medical settings  were authorized to do so.

For example,  respondents in two states commented that almost all pharmacies  compound or have the potential to compound nonsterile drugs, such as  simple creams. A respondent in one state commented that they are under  the assumption that any licensed pharmacy can perform nonsterile  compounding without a special authorization to do so, and a respondent  in another state reported that nearly all community and hospital  pharmacies do at least some nonsterile compounding.", "In addition, officials from some of the stakeholder organizations we  interviewed said that certain medical specialists, such as dermatologists,  pediatricians, and allergists, prepare compound drugs. They explained  that, for example, some medical specialists mix nonsterile topical creams  or sterile preparations, such as lidocaine (a local anesthetic agent that  can be administered by injection), as part of their medical practice.  However, some of these officials said that whether health care  practitioners compounded drugs depended on what was considered  compounding, and that some medical specialists generally use  compounded drugs provided by a pharmacy or outsourcing facility and do  not compound the drugs themselves."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA and Some States Collect Data on Drug Compounders, but Only One State Reported Collecting Data on the Volume of Compounded Drugs", "paragraphs": ["According to FDA officials, there is no good source for data on the extent  of drug compounding and who is doing it except for data on outsourcing  facilities. Although outsourcing facilities are required to provide FDA with  a report of the drugs they compounded during the previous 6-month  period, including the number of units they produced, aggregate data on  the listed drugs were not available at the time of our review. According to  FDA officials, not all outsourcing facilities provided these reports and the  data provided were not yet collected and maintained in a standard format.  Therefore, the officials said that FDA does not input the data into a single  database, but instead maintains this information on the individual  spreadsheets that the outsourcing facilities provided. According to FDA,  the agency plans to makes necessary modifications to its electronic  reporting system to accommodate the information outsourcing facilities  must provide in the future so that outsourcing facilities will be able to  electronically submit drug product reports into a single standardized  format. In addition, even though the compounded drugs are reported\u2014 and some outsourcing facilities report thousands of compounded drugs\u2014 FDA has not received data on the quantity of each drug listed in the  reports in some cases, according to the officials. Further, while all  outsourcing facilities are required to submit drug product reports to FDA,  the officials we interviewed said that there are some facilities that have  not provided it. As of April 22, 2016, 40 of the 59 outsourcing facilities had  not provided some or all required reports. One FDA official said that to  date, FDA has not taken regulatory action against outsourcing facilities  that have not provided the reports of the drugs they compounded unless  FDA was already taking steps to address some other violation of statute  by the outsourcing facility, including through the issuance of a warning  letter. According to the FDA officials, this is because addressing all of the  firm\u2019s violations that FDA has identified in a single action is a more  effective mechanism to bring the firm into compliance and a more efficient  use of agency resources than pursuing separate actions for discrete  violations of the FDCA.", "While respondents in almost all of the states we surveyed reported having  license categories for resident and nonresident pharmacies, respondents  in some states reported having other license categories, including those  specific to sterile drug compounding. For example, 12 states reported  having a separate license category for resident pharmacies that  compound sterile drugs and 12 states reported having a sterile  compounding license category for nonresident pharmacies. Other  respondents reported licensing categories for pharmacies that included  nuclear pharmacies, home infusion pharmacies, and Internet/mail order  pharmacies; and entities that distribute compounded drugs. (See table  3.) In addition, respondents in some states reported that they do not have  separate license categories for specific types of practice settings;  however, they are aware of pharmacies and other entities in their state  that engage in certain practice areas (e.g., pharmacies that engage in  sterile compounding).", "In addition, respondents in half of the states we surveyed reported  collecting data on licensed or registered pharmacies that compound  sterile drugs, but not all of these states reported data. For example, 16  states reported data for 2015, ranging from 31 pharmacies in Nevada to  1,024 in California. Respondents in most of the states that reported data  on pharmacies that compound sterile drugs reported collecting this  information yearly. (See table 4.)", "National data on the extent of drug compounding, as measured by the  number of prescriptions or the volume of compounded drugs (e.g.,  number of units), were not available from our survey, as only one state  reported collecting these data, and its data were limited to sterile  compounded drugs. That state reported that 658,128 total prescriptions  for sterile compounded drugs were dispensed by pharmacies in the state  in 2014, and 708,142 total prescriptions were dispensed in 2015. In  addition, the state reported that close to 2.5 million units of sterile  compounded drugs were dispensed by pharmacies in the state in 2014,  and almost 2 million units were dispensed in 2015. Staff from the state\u2019s  board of pharmacy said that the state does not collect data on the total  number of all prescriptions dispensed by pharmacies; therefore, they  could not calculate the percentage of prescriptions for sterile  compounded drugs to all prescription drugs. Board staff also noted that  the source of the state\u2019s data was based on self-reporting from  pharmacies; as such, pharmacies\u2019 methods for identifying and reporting  numbers of prescriptions and units of sterile compounded drugs may  differ, and the state cannot confirm the validity or accuracy of the data.", "When asked if collecting data on the number of prescriptions for  compounded drugs or the volume of compounded drugs would have any  effect on their oversight of drug compounding activities, officials from the  state boards of pharmacy in our three selected states said that collecting  such data could be burdensome and costly. For example, the official from  Texas said that because they have thousands of licensed pharmacies in  their state, the volume of such data would be overwhelming and they do  not know what they would do with all of that data. The official from North  Carolina said that there would be a significant cost to collecting these  data and the ultimate benefit is unclear. In addition, the official from  Minnesota said that it seemed like there could be a sizable amount of  data to collect, and the pharmacy board would have to work out details,  including whether the data would be collected in aggregate or much more  specifically by patient, how the data would be collated and stored (such  as in a database), and how the board would pay for such data collection  and management.", "Officials in almost all of the stakeholder organizations we interviewed had  not conducted or were not aware of any studies or reviews on the extent  of drug compounding or the settings in which compounding occurs in  each state. However, one stakeholder organization, the Pew Charitable  Trusts, conducted a survey of the state boards of pharmacy in the 50  states and the District of Columbia (43 of the 51 states responded) on  state oversight of sterile drug compounding. Among its findings, the  Pew Charitable Trusts reported that from 3 percent to 24 percent of  pharmacies in the 43 responding states were performing sterile  compounding. In June 2016, HHS\u2019s Office of Inspector General reviewed  spending for compounded drugs under Part D, the Medicare program\u2019s  prescription drug benefit. This review found that Medicare Part D  spending for compounded drugs rose from $70.2 million in 2006 to  $508.7 million in 2015, particularly for topical compounded drugs which  include creams and ointments. The HHS Office of Inspector General  attributed this increase to both an increase in the average cost of  prescriptions and an increase in the number of beneficiaries receiving  these compounded drugs.", "While respondents in 26 states reported that providers in general  practitioners\u2019 and medical specialty offices were authorized to compound  drugs in their state, we did not find any sources of data specific to the  extent to which this occurs. In one of our selected states, the state  medical board official said that the extent of drug compounding by  physicians and nonpharmacist health care practitioners is likely minimal  because their board has not heard about it; however, because the board  is complaint driven (i.e., they only inspect or investigate practitioners if a  complaint has been submitted) it could be that such compounding activity  has not led to any complaints. Another state\u2019s medical board official told  us that it is not known whether the scale of compounding by physicians is  small and specific to certain medical specialties, or whether it is  widespread. This official speculated that it is not widespread, except  within particular medical specialties. Further, officials from one  stakeholder organization\u2014a national medical association\u2014said that they  were not sure how extensive compounding by physicians is or the amount  of compounding that is being conducted; and officials from another  stakeholder organization\u2014a different national medical association\u2014told  us that they would not know how to go about gathering information on the  extent of compounding by physicians. Finally, an official from another  stakeholder organization\u2014a national pharmacy association\u2014told us the  extent of physician compounding varies dramatically depending on the  practice environment or physician specialty, in that almost every patient  receives compounded drugs from physicians in outpatient surgery and  cancer centers, but general practitioners do not usually perform much  compounding otherwise."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Nearly All States Reported Having Drug Compounding Laws, Though Few Apply to Nonpharmacists, and States Conduct Inspections and Can Take Actions to Enforce These Laws", "paragraphs": ["Respondents in almost all of the states we surveyed reported having  laws, regulations, or policies specific to the practice of drug compounding.

An official from the Minnesota Board of  Medical Practice said that the medical board has a complaint-driven  process and that if there are allegations that a physician has violated  medical or pharmacy statutes that regulate the practice of medicine,  including compounding, the board has the authority to investigate.", "North Carolina. A state statute in North Carolina requires that a  physician who dispenses prescription drugs, for a fee or other charge,  register with the board of pharmacy and comply with relevant laws  and regulations governing distribution of drugs that apply to  pharmacists; however, this statute does not specifically address  compounding by physicians. According to the board of pharmacy  official we interviewed, disciplinary authority over these physicians lies  solely with the state\u2019s medical board. The North Carolina Medical  Board official explained that the board has the authority to discipline a  physician for violating any law involving the practice of medicine and  that compounding drugs is included in the practice of medicine. This  official further explained that the board\u2019s role in overseeing physicians  has historically been complaint driven and the board had not had any  complaints or issues brought to its attention related to compounding  by physicians until a recent case referred to them by the board of  pharmacy. This official said that the board is currently developing its  role in overseeing compounding by physicians.", "Texas. The Texas medical board official told us that there was no  specific mention of compounding by physicians in the Texas state  statute. The official said, however, that if the medical board received a  complaint that involved one of their licensees (i.e., practitioner)  violating the state\u2019s drug compounding laws, then the board could  take enforcement actions.", "Respondents in 21 states reported that their office had heard concerns  about the practice of compounding by physicians and other  nonpharmacists. Some of the concerns respondents in these states  reported were about a lack of regulation and oversight of compounding by  physicians and other nonpharmacists, and whether physicians were  complying with compounding standards, such as USP standards. Further,  respondents in some states were unsure which entity, if any, in their state  had oversight responsibility for compounding by physicians and other  nonpharmacists. For example, respondents in 17 states reported that  they did not know if their state had any laws, regulations, or policies  specific to drug compounding by nonpharmacists. A respondent in one  state commented that they do not believe that the medical, nursing, and  naturopath practitioners are subject to any laws, regulations, or policies  related to compounding.", "Some of the stakeholder organizations we interviewed also expressed  concerns about compounding by physicians and other nonpharmacists.  Officials from one stakeholder organization said that drug compounding  conducted in standalone physician practices does not generally fall under  medical licensing requirements of state medical boards; therefore, there  are gaps in oversight of compounding by physicians. Officials from  another stakeholder organization told us that there are an increasing  number of companies that are targeting physicians, offering to establish  compounding labs within the physicians\u2019 offices. The officials said that the  market has been responding to DQSA by targeting physicians because  FDA\u2019s oversight of drug compounding has focused on pharmacists, and  the market sees an opportunity for physicians to profit off of compounding  rather than see the prescriptions they write leave their offices. An official  from another stakeholder organization said that there is an enormous  amount of compounding in physician offices, but few state boards of  pharmacy have oversight over this practice. This official said that boards  of pharmacy oversee pharmacists and pharmacies, but do not oversee  compounding by physicians. According to this official, the state boards of  pharmacy have tried to bring physician-compounded drugs under their  oversight, but it has been difficult. Officials from one stakeholder  organization, the Federation of State Medical Boards, told us that they  conducted an informal review of state laws regarding compounding by  physicians (i.e., state medical practice acts) and found that few states  have laws specifically regulating compounding by physicians; however,  most medical boards consider compounding as part of the practice of  medicine. The officials said that they plan to further study this issue to  determine whether to develop guidelines for their members. In addition,  FDA officials told us that the agency has not taken a proactive role in  compounding by physicians and there is not much oversight of physician  compounding by state medical boards.

In response to our survey of  state pharmacy regulatory bodies, respondents in 13 states reported  that they would direct purchasers of compounded drugs to use FDA\u2019s  compounding website, or other FDA information, in order to determine  the safety and quality of compounded drugs.", "State board of pharmacy websites: Purchasers can contact their  state board of pharmacy or search their state board of pharmacy\u2019s  website to determine whether the state has inspected a pharmacy,  and if so, whether the state had found shortcomings in its  compounding operations (for those states that make this information  available on their website). Fourteen states reported that they would  direct purchasers of compounded drugs to state websites.", "Pharmacy accreditation organizations: Purchasers can determine  whether a pharmacy was accredited for compounding by an  organization, such as the Accreditation Commission for Health Care\u2019s  Pharmacy Compounding Accreditation Board, or identify whether a  pharmacy has met the requirements of other national associations\u2019  programs, such as the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy\u2019s  Verified Pharmacy Program. Six of the 25 stakeholder organizations  we talked to indicated that pharmacy accreditation for compounding  by an organization, such as the Accreditation Commission for Health  Care\u2019s accreditation board, is a tool that purchasers of compounded  drugs can use to assess the safety and quality of compounded drugs.", "However, our review found that there were few drug compounders with  clean inspections, and relatively few compounders were accredited.  Therefore, many purchasers of compounded drugs may rely on  information from state and federal regulatory bodies on the safety and  quality of compounded drugs, including deficiencies found during  inspections.", "Institutional purchasers and health care practitioners have additional tools  available to identify and evaluate drug compounders as they seek  sources to provide compounded drugs for their operations.", "The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists\u2019  assessment tool: Nine of the 25 stakeholder organizations we talked  to referenced the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists\u2019  assessment tool, which is intended to help purchasers that choose to  outsource the preparation of compounded drugs to evaluate  proposals in order to select a drug compounder to supply those drugs.", "The International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists\u2019  Compounding Pharmacy Assessment Questionnaire: Three of the  25 stakeholder organizations we talked to referenced the International  Academy of Compounding Pharmacists\u2019 compounding pharmacy  assessment questionnaire checklist. This tool was developed based  on the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention\u2019s compounding standards, to  provide purchasers with a checklist of what to look for in a pharmacy  compounding practice.", "Other organizations involved in the purchase of prescription drugs\u2014 specifically pharmacy benefit managers\u2014may utilize their own tools to  help determine whether drug compounders are maintaining the  appropriate standards for the safety and quality of these drugs. For  example, officials from one pharmacy benefit manager told us that their  organization has developed a credentialing process to evaluate  compounding pharmacies for inclusion in their network and to determine  the type of compounded drugs these pharmacies may sell in the  pharmacy benefit manager\u2019s network. The officials said that this process  consists of a questionnaire that covers items such as the pharmacy\u2019s  quality procedures for each compounded dosage form (i.e., it determines  whether the pharmacy is capable of accurately making capsules, complex  suspensions, and other dosage forms), and the pharmacy\u2019s quality  practices and procedures. In addition, the officials said they also review  the findings from inspections conducted by a state or FDA. At the end of  the credentialing process, the organization will establish an agreement  with the pharmacy that allows it conduct either \u201ccomplex nonsterile  compounding\u201d or \u201climited scope nonsterile compounding.\u201d", "Ten of the 25 stakeholder organizations we talked to indicated that the  drug\u2019s label is also a tool for patients to use to determine whether the  drug is a compounded drug. Outsourcing facilities are required to include  a statement on compounded drugs indicating that it is a compounded  drug, as well as the drug\u2019s expiration date and ingredients. In addition,  24 states reported requiring labeling for compounded drugs, as of  January 1, 2016. Therefore, for drugs with such labeling, the patient (if  the drug is dispensed directly to a patient) or the provider (if administered  in the office or medical facility) could know it was a compounded drug and  the expiration date and the ingredients. Section 503A of the Federal  Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act does not require 503A compounders to  include a statement that it is a compounded drug on the drugs they  compound. One stakeholder organization pointed out that most labeling is  not consistent and that certain drugs may not have a label, such as  compounded drugs for hospital patients, or compounded drugs in nuclear  pharmacies; another stakeholder organization stated that unless a state  requires pharmacies to label compounded drugs as such, patients likely  won\u2019t know whether the drug was compounded. FDA officials also noted  that the agency has heard from stakeholders that physicians and patients  may not be aware that the drugs that they are administering or receiving  were compounded, or that they are not approved by FDA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The Drug Quality and Security Act (DQSA), enacted in November 2013,  included a provision for GAO to review drug compounding.

We also examined available  information for purchasers of compounded drugs (e.g., hospitals, health  systems, and patients) to determine the safety and quality of those drugs.", "To address our reporting objectives and obtain information about  purchasers of compounded drugs, we administered a web-based survey  to the state pharmacy regulatory bodies (e.g., boards of pharmacy) in the  50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S.  Virgin Islands. We interviewed officials at 25 national associations and  other stakeholder organizations, government officials in 3 states  (Minnesota, North Carolina, and Texas), officials at two pharmacy benefit  manager organizations, and officials from the Food and Drug  Administration (FDA); and we reviewed relevant documents from FDA  and the organizations we interviewed.

We surveyed state pharmacy regulatory bodies  (states) because these are the entities that regulate pharmacy practice,  including drug compounding activities, through state laws and regulations.  To collect information on drug compounding across the country, we  surveyed all 50 states and the District of Columbia. We also included  selected U.S. territories in our survey population\u2014Guam, Puerto Rico,  and the U.S. Virgin Islands\u2014because these are the three most populous  territories, all have boards of pharmacy, and all are members of the  National Association of Boards of Pharmacy. We primarily obtained  contact information for the states from information on boards of pharmacy  on the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy\u2019s website, and we  tested the survey by conducting three pretests of draft versions with  officials from a state board of pharmacy in a rural state, officials from a  state board of pharmacy in a populous state, and a national pharmacy  association.", "Our survey was administered from February 8, 2016, through April 15,  2016.

Two states, Alaska and Indiana, responded to  some of the survey questions but did not complete the survey; therefore,  their responses were not included in our survey analyses. Two of the  territories, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, did not respond to any  of the survey questions.", "We analyzed the survey responses from the 50 completed surveys and  conducted follow up with respondents, as needed, to clarify certain survey  responses or obtain additional information.

Through the interviews with the board of pharmacy  officials, we obtained additional information on state laws and policies  related to drug compounding, as well as additional details for certain  survey responses. In our interviews with state medical board officials, we  obtained information on the medical board\u2019s role in the oversight of drug  compounding and other information, as available, related to compounding  by physicians in each state. Two of our three selected states\u2014North  Carolina and Texas\u2014had a separate state agency responsible for  overseeing FDA-registered outsourcing facilities licensed in the state;  therefore, we obtained information in these interviews specific to their  oversight responsibilities for these facilities.
