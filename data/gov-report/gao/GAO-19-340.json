IRS has not developed minimum information security requirements for the systems used by paid preparers or Authorized e-file Providers. According to IRS\u2019s Office of Chief Counsel, IRS does not have the explicit authority to regulate security for these systems. Instead, the Internal Revenue Code gives IRS broad authority to administer and supervise the internal revenue laws. The Department of the Treasury has previously requested additional authority to regulate the competency of all paid preparers; GAO has also suggested that Congress consider granting IRS this authority. Congress has not yet provided such authority. Neither the Department of the Treasury request nor the GAO suggestion included granting IRS authority to regulate the security of paid preparers\u2019 systems. Having such authority would enable IRS to establish minimum requirements. Further, having explicit authority to establish security standards for Authorized e-file Providers\u2019 systems may help IRS better ensure the protection of taxpayers\u2019 information.", "Tax Software Providers. As part of a public-private partnership between IRS and the tax preparation industry, 15 tax software providers voluntarily adhere to a set of about 140 information security controls developed using guidance from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). However, these controls are not required, and these providers represent only about one-third of all tax software providers. Additionally, IRS established six security, privacy, and business standards for providers of software that allows individuals to prepare their own tax returns (as opposed to software that paid preparers use). However, IRS has not substantially updated these standards since 2010, and they are, at least in part, outdated. For example, IRS cites an outdated encryption standard that NIST recommends not using due to its many known weaknesses.", "A key factor contributing to missed opportunities to address third-party cybersecurity is IRS\u2019s lack of centralized leadership.

According to IRS\u2019s Office of Chief Counsel, this ruling,  combined with the lack of explicit statutory authority, prevents IRS from  establishing system standards for paid preparers, because while 31  U.S.C. \u00a7 330 authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to regulate the  practice of practitioners before the Department of the Treasury, mere  return preparation, including through systems practitioners use to prepare  and transmit tax returns, is not considered practice before IRS.", "In contrast to paper filing of tax returns, certain security measures need to  be taken for e-filing returns to protect the integrity of the e-file system;  thus, IRS has implicit authority to regulate e-file providers insofar as their  activities relate to electronically filing returns with IRS, according to IRS  Office of Chief Counsel officials. These officials also noted that no single  provision of the Internal Revenue Code provides IRS explicit authority to  regulate the standards for e-file providers.

Additionally, IRS  officials that are a part of the Security Summit stated that they cannot  enforce the subset of NIST controls with the remaining Security Summit  partners because the controls were set up in a voluntary program. IRS  officials from multiple offices did not have a clear reason as to why this  subset of NIST controls has not been incorporated into the requirements  for the entire population of tax software providers in the Authorized e-file  Provider program, even though some security standards had been  incorporated into the Authorized e-file Provider program for a limited set  of providers (online providers) as discussed in the next section. In  addition, as previously discussed, IRS can prescribe the requirements to  which Authorized e-file Providers must adhere when e-filing returns for  taxpayers. Incorporating fundamental security controls into its  Authorized e-file Provider program would give IRS greater assurance that  tax software providers have identified and addressed information security  risks consistent with professional standards.", "This missed opportunity to update the requirements for tax software  providers by adopting the subset of NIST controls is due, in part, to IRS\u2019s  lack of a centralized leadership over the security of taxpayer information  collected by paid preparers and tax software providers.

In its written comments, which are  summarized below and reproduced in appendix III, IRS agreed with three  of the recommendations and disagreed with five of the recommendations.  IRS also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as  appropriate.", "IRS agreed with our recommendations to regularly review and update the  security requirements that apply to the tax software provider and other  Authorized e-file Providers; standardize the incident reporting  requirements for all types of Authorized e-file Providers; and document  intake, storage, and sharing of the security incident data across IRS  offices. IRS did not provide additional detail on the actions it plans to take  to address these recommendations.", "IRS disagreed with five of our recommendations, generally citing for all of  them the lack of clear and explicit authority it would need to establish  security requirements for the information systems of paid preparers and  others who electronically file returns.", "For our recommendation to develop a governance structure or other form  of centralized leadership, IRS stated it would require statutory authority  that clearly communicates its authority to establish security requirements  for the information systems of paid preparers and others who  electronically file tax returns. Further, IRS stated that without such  authority, implementing the recommendation would be an inefficient,  ineffective, and costly use of resources. We disagree that convening a  governance structure or other centralized form of leadership would  require additional statutory authority or be inefficient, ineffective, and  costly. As discussed in the report, IRS has seven different offices across  the agency working on information security-related activities that could  benefit from centralized oversight and coordination, such as updating  existing standards, monitoring Authorized e-file Provider program  compliance, and tracking security incident reports.", "We continue to believe that establishing a governance structure would  help provide this level of leadership, coordination, and collaboration to  IRS\u2019s current efforts and therefore help alleviate the missed opportunities  that we identified in the report, such as updating outdated security  standards. Further, IRS could choose a leadership mechanism that it  determines to be low cost and most efficient to gain a higher degree of  coordination. Without this structure, it is unclear how IRS will adapt to  changing security threats in the future and ensure those threats are  mitigated.", "In our draft report, we made a recommendation that IRS modify the  Authorized e-file Provider program to be consistent with the FTC  Safeguards Rule. In its response, IRS stated that it did not have explicit  authority to establish policy consistent with the FTC Safeguards Rule or  enforce compliance with it. However, IRS clearly states in its Revenue  Procedure 2007-40 that violations of the provisions of the Gramm-Leach- Bliley Act and the implementing rules and regulations promulgated by  FTC are considered violations of the revenue procedure and may subject  an Authorized e-file Provider to penalties or sanctions. Therefore, we  believe IRS has already incorporated compliance with the FTC  Safeguards Rule as part of its Authorized e-file Provider program.", "The intent of this recommendation is not to suggest that IRS develop new  policies related to the elements of the Safeguards Rule. Instead, we  believe IRS has the opportunity to explicitly state in its requirements for  Authorized e-file Providers the elements of an information security  program, as listed in the Safeguards Rule. This action will help third party  providers become aware of their specific legal obligations to protect  taxpayer data under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. As such, we clarified  text in the body of the report and the text of the recommendation to better  reflect our intent.", "For our recommendation to require all tax software providers that  participate in the Authorized e-file Provider program to follow the subset  of NIST Special Publication 800-53 controls that were agreed upon by the  Security Summit participants, IRS stated that it does not have the  statutory authority for such a requirement. However, under its existing  authority, IRS has already established some information security  requirements for a portion of tax software providers\u2014those that are online  providers. IRS has the opportunity to further establish standards for all tax  software providers by incorporating the subset of NIST controls into its  Authorized e-file Provider program, which would capitalize on the work it  has completed with the Security Summit members. We continue to  believe that without setting and requiring the same security standards for  all tax software providers, IRS does not have assurance that these  providers have an equivalent level of standards in place to adequately  protect taxpayer information.", "For our recommendation that IRS update its monitoring programs for  electronic return originators, IRS stated it does not have the statutory  authority to establish policy on information security and cybersecurity  issues, nor to enforce compliance if noncompliance is observed.  However, as we reported, IRS already monitors physical aspects of  information security, which goes beyond existing Authorized e-file  Provider program requirements. Since most individuals now file tax  returns electronically, having checks for physical security without  comparable checks for cybersecurity does not address current risks, as  cyber criminals and fraudsters are increasingly attacking third-party  providers, as IRS has noted. We believe that incorporating some basic  cybersecurity monitoring into the visits would provide IRS the opportunity  to help inform the most vulnerable third-party providers of additional  guidance and resources.", "For our recommendation to conduct a risk assessment to determine  whether different monitoring approaches are appropriate for all of the  provider types in the Authorized e-file Provider program, IRS stated that  changes to the monitoring program would not have value to the overall  program performance absent statutory authority. We disagree with this  conclusion. As discussed in the report, IRS does not currently  systematically monitor the existing security requirements for online  providers, nor does it conduct information security or cybersecurity  monitoring for all types of Authorized e-file Providers. We believe that IRS  could conduct a risk assessment of its current monitoring program within  existing statutory authority and make necessary changes that would  provide better assurance that all types of providers are receiving some  level of oversight and that IRS is addressing the greatest risk areas  appropriately.", "We are sending copies to the Chairmen and Ranking Members of other  Senate and House committees and subcommittees that have  appropriation, authorization, and oversight responsibilities for IRS.

This section of  the Internal Revenue Code prescribes the filing of income tax returns, as  well as the electronic filing requirements for returns prepared by paid  preparers. We reviewed 26 U.S.C. \u00a77803, which provides that the IRS  Commissioner has the authority to administer and manage the execution  and application of tax laws, while balancing the rights of, among other  things, confidentiality and privacy of the taxpayer. We also reviewed the  Federal Trade Commission\u2019s (FTC) Safeguards Rule, which requires  financial institutions, including tax return preparers, affiliates, and service  providers, to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records  and information. This rule applies to those who are significantly engaged  in providing financial products or services that include preparation and  filing of tax returns. We reviewed IRS Revenue Procedure 2007-40, which  informs Authorized e-file Providers of their obligations to IRS, taxpayers,  and other participants in the Authorized e-file Provider program and  outlines the rules governing filing electronically with IRS.", "We reviewed IRS publications describing the obligations in IRS\u2019s  Revenue Procedure 2007-40 and the requirements of the Authorized e- file Provider program, including IRS Publication 3112, IRS e-file  Application and Participation, and IRS Publication 1345, Handbook for  Authorized IRS e-file Providers of Individual Income Tax Returns. We  assessed these documents to determine if the requirements for third- party providers were incorporating the laws and following leading  practices as outlined by Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government (Internal Control Standards) and A Framework for Managing  Fraud Risk in Federal Programs (Fraud Risk Framework). The Fraud  Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015, and Office of Management  and Budget guidance implementing its provisions, affirm that agencies  should adhere to the leading practices identified in our Fraud Risk  Framework. We also compared the standards published in Publication  1345 for online providers to the National Institute of Standards and  Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-52: Guidelines for the  Selection, Configuration, and Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS)  Implementations to determine if the standards were following leading  practices.
