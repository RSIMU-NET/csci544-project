Under the Medicare Part D program, beneficiaries may choose from  competing prescription drug plans offered by plan sponsors (primarily  private health insurers), and those plan sponsors are responsible for  paying pharmacies. In addition, DOD and Medicaid are statutorily entitled  to certain refunds or rebates from drug manufacturers for drugs  dispensed to their beneficiaries, while Medicare Part D plan sponsors  negotiate with manufacturers for rebates and other price concessions.", "In fiscal year 2011, DOD provided prescription drug coverage to about   9.7 million beneficiaries through retail pharmacies, its military treatment  facilities, and its mail order pharmacy.

Most states require a nominal  beneficiary copayment for prescription drugs.", "State Medicaid programs reimburse retail pharmacies for drugs  dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and then report these payments to  CMS. The federal government provides matching funds to state programs  to cover a portion of these costs. Federal law requires manufacturers to  pay rebates to state Medicaid agencies for drugs dispensed to Medicaid  beneficiaries.

Specifically, Medicaid\u2019s average net price for the entire sample was   $0.62 per unit, while Medicare Part D paid an estimated 32 percent more  ($0.82 per unit) and DOD paid 60 percent more ($0.99 per unit). (See  fig. 1.) Similarly, Medicaid\u2019s average net price for the subset of brand- name drugs in our sample was $1.57 per unit, the lowest among the three  programs, while DOD paid 34 percent more ($2.11 per unit), and  Medicare Part D paid an estimated 69 percent more ($2.65 per unit).  Medicaid also paid the lowest net price for the subset of generic drugs in  our sample ($0.28 per unit), while Medicare Part D paid 4 percent more  ($0.29 per unit) and DOD paid 50 percent more ($0.42 per unit).", "When we examined the net prices that each program paid for the  individual drugs in the sample after subtracting all reported beneficiary- paid amounts and post-purchase price adjustments, we found that  Medicaid paid the lowest prices for 25 brand-name and 3 generic drugs,  while DOD paid the lowest net price for 5 brand-name and 22 generic  drugs, and Medicare Part D paid the lowest estimated net price for 3  brand-name and 20 generic drugs.", "We found that multiple factors affected the net prices paid by each  program, including the amount of post-purchase price adjustments each  program received, the gross prices paid to pharmacies, the beneficiary- paid amounts, and market dynamics. Of these, a key factor for the entire  sample and for the brand-name subset was the amount of manufacturer  post-purchase price adjustments received. (See fig. 2.) On average  across the entire sample, these price adjustments ranged from about 15  percent of the gross price for Medicare Part D to about 31 percent for  DOD, and nearly 53 percent for Medicaid. For the brand-name subset of  the sample, these rebates ranged from about 19 percent of the gross  price for Medicare Part D to nearly 39 percent for DOD and 62 percent for  Medicaid.", "The statutory framework allowing each program to obtain post-purchase  price adjustments contributes to the wide range of percentages observed.  Medicaid\u2019s federally mandated rebates apply to virtually all drugs, while  DOD\u2019s refunds only apply to certain drugs (i.e., primarily brand-name  drugs). Furthermore, we found that even when DOD received a refund for  a given drug, DOD\u2019s per-unit refund amount was less than Medicaid\u2019s  per-unit rebate for most of the drugs in our sample even though we  applied only the federally mandated (i.e., URA-based) rebates for the  calculation of Medicaid net prices. If we had been able to accurately apply  the Medicaid state supplemental rebates, the per-unit Medicaid rebate  amounts would be even larger (i.e., a greater percentage of the gross unit  price) than we report. Finally, we found that Medicare Part D obtained the  lowest per-unit price adjustments among the three programs. In contrast  to the statutory authority allowing DOD and Medicaid to collect specific  refunds and rebates, Medicare Part D plan sponsors rely on independent  negotiations to obtain price concessions from drug manufacturers. As we  have previously reported, plan sponsors have noted limitations on their  ability to negotiate price concessions for some drugs due to formulary  requirements set by CMS, lack of competitors for some drugs, or low  utilization for some drugs that limit incentives for manufacturers to provide  price concessions.", "The gross unit prices paid to retail pharmacies by each program and the  magnitude of beneficiary-paid amounts also contributed to the differences  in net prices, although to a lesser degree than post-purchase price  adjustments. As shown in figure 2, each of the three programs paid the  lowest gross unit price to pharmacies for one of the groups of sample  drugs: Medicare Part D for the sample as a whole, DOD for the subset of  brand-name drugs, and Medicaid for the subset of generic drugs. These  different gross unit prices act as a \u201cstarting point\u201d for determining net  prices paid by the programs\u2014a lower gross price negotiated between the  program and the pharmacy makes it easier for the program to achieve a  lower net unit price after accounting for beneficiary-paid amounts and  post-purchase price adjustments.", "Beneficiary-paid amounts also affected the net prices paid by each  program; larger beneficiary payments contributed to lower net prices paid  by the agency. The average beneficiary-paid amounts varied across the  three programs; for example, on average for all 78 drugs in our sample,  beneficiaries paid nearly 19 percent\u2014or $0.23\u2014of Medicare Part D\u2019s  gross price per unit, while DOD beneficiaries paid about 7 percent\u2014or  $0.12\u2014of DOD\u2019s average gross price per unit. Beneficiary-paid  amounts also varied depending on the category of drugs examined. For  the subset of brand-name drugs in our sample, beneficiary-paid amounts  ranged from 6 percent of the gross price for DOD to 17 percent for  Medicare Part D, while for the subset of generic drugs these amounts  ranged from 14 percent of the gross price for DOD to 21 percent for  Medicare Part D.", "Market dynamics\u2014such as manufacturer responses to offset discounts,  the number of competitors for a given drug, and varying utilization of  specific drugs by different programs\u2014can also affect the net prices paid  by these and other drug programs and thus the amount of savings the  programs might be able to achieve. For example, the DOD, Medicaid, and  Medicare Part D drug programs theoretically could have achieved savings  had they been able to pay the lowest price for each of the drugs in our  sample through having access to the post-purchase price adjustments  available to the program with the lowest net price for each drug. However,  market dynamics, such as manufacturer responses, likely would offset at  least some of the savings. Previous reports by GAO and the  Congressional Budget Office have noted that making rebates or other  discounts available to federal programs could provide savings for the  newly eligible programs but could result in higher prices for other  programs\u2014including those already eligible for the discounts\u2014as drug  manufacturers respond by raising their prices to offset the change.", "The magnitude of these potential offsetting price increases could depend  on a number of factors. For example, if a large federal program with many  beneficiaries became eligible for the discounts, manufacturers might  choose to raise prices by a greater amount than they would if a smaller  program with fewer beneficiaries became eligible. Manufacturers might  choose to raise prices more for drugs with fewer competitors than for  drugs with many competitors. Furthermore, because federal prices are  generally based on prices paid by nonfederal purchasers such as private  health insurers, manufacturers would have to raise prices to those  purchasers in order to raise the federal prices. The magnitude of these  potential effects would vary by drug and would depend on a number of  factors, including the relationship between the specific federal price  extended to newly eligible programs and the price paid by nonfederal  purchasers.", "Other factors that may affect the magnitude of savings, if any, which  could be achieved by DOD, Medicaid, and Medicare Part D include  differences between the programs with regard to: programs\u2019 formulary practices\u2014for example, in exchange for price  concessions, a program may offer a reduced copayment or preferred  placement of a manufacturer\u2019s drug in the formulary to encourage  beneficiaries to choose that drug rather than a similar alternative. In  addition, programs may differ in their ability to exclude certain drugs  from their formularies, which can limit their ability to negotiate; for  example, DOD officials told us that they must cover all drugs within a  class. number of beneficiaries enrolled\u2014that is, a program or plan with  more beneficiaries can generally negotiate lower gross prices with  pharmacies and more rebates from manufacturers through offering  greater anticipated utilization of drugs than a program with fewer  beneficiaries. utilization practices based on differences in beneficiary  populations\u2014for example, Medicare Part D\u2019s predominantly elderly  population is likely to use a different mix of drugs than a program such  as Medicaid, which serves a younger population, and these utilization  differences can affect each program\u2019s ability to obtain discounts on  certain drugs based on volume. copayment structure\u2014for example, one program may achieve lower  net prices on certain drugs by charging beneficiaries a higher  copayment for the drug.  type of pharmacy\u2014for example, the Medicare Part D net prices we  are reporting include data from prescriptions filled at mail order  pharmacies used by the plans, which typically charge the plans less  overhead than retail store-based pharmacies, while DOD prices are  limited to prescriptions filled at store-based pharmacies; if the mail  order prescriptions were excluded, the average Medicare Part D  prices would likely be higher than those we report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a copy of the draft report to DOD and the Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS) for comment.
