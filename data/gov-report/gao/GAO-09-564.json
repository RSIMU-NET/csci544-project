As the often-delayed launch of its demonstration satellite draws closer, these problems continue. GAO was asked to (1) identify the status and risks of key program components, (2) assess the NPOESS Executive Committee's ability to fulfill its responsibilities, and (3) evaluate efforts to identify an alternative system integrator for later NPOESS satellites. To do so, GAO analyzed program and contractor data, attended program reviews, and interviewed agency officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While selected components of the NPOESS program have made progress over the past year, the program is once again over budget and behind schedule. In terms of progress, three of the five instruments slated for a demonstration satellite (called the NPOESS Preparatory Project--NPP) have been delivered and integrated on the spacecraft; the ground-based satellite data processing system has been installed and tested at both of the locations that are to receive NPP data; and the satellites' command, control, and communications system has passed acceptance testing. However, the program's approved cost and schedule baseline are not achievable, and problems with two critical sensors continue to drive the program's cost and schedule. Costs could grow by $1 billion over the current $13.95 billion estimate, and the schedules for NPP and the first two NPOESS satellites are expected to be delayed by 7, 14, and 5 months, respectively. These delays increase the risk of a gap in satellite continuity. An independent review team established to assess key program risks recently reported that the constellation of satellites is extremely fragile, and that there could be a 3 to 5 year gap in satellite coverage if NPP, NPOESS, or other DOD satellites fail on launch. The NPOESS Executive Committee responsible for overseeing the program has made improvements over the last several years, but still has not effectively fulfilled its responsibilities. Responding to past concerns expressed by GAO and the Department of Commerce's Inspector General, the Committee now meets on a regular basis, and has sought and reacted to advice from external advisors to mitigate specific risks. However, the Committee lacks the membership and leadership needed to effectively and efficiently oversee and direct the program. Specifically, the DOD Committee member with acquisition authority does not attend Executive Committee meetings--and sometimes contradicts the Committee's decisions, the Committee does not track its action items to closure, and many of the Committee's decisions do not achieve desired outcomes. Program officials and external independent reviewers explained that it is extremely difficult for the Committee to navigate three agencies' competing requirements and priorities. Until these shortfalls are addressed, the Committee will remain ineffective. The NPOESS program has conducted two successive studies of alternatives to using the existing system integrator for the last two NPOESS satellites, but neither identified a viable alternative to the current contractor. Both studies assessed a variety of alternatives, including re-competing the entire prime contract, obtaining an independent system integrator while having the existing prime contractor continue to develop space and ground components, and having the government take over responsibility for the system's integration. The first study identified strengths and weaknesses and the second study identified high-level costs and benefits. Neither study identified an alternative that is viable. Program officials plan to conduct a final study prior to the June 2010 decision on whether to proceed with the existing prime contractor."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The planned National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite  System (NPOESS) program is expected to be a state-of-the-art,  environment-monitoring satellite system that will replace two existing  polar-orbiting environmental satellite systems.

These deliverables are grouped into four main categories:  (1) the space segment, which includes the satellites and sensors; (2) the  integrated data processing segment, which is the system for transforming  raw data into EDRs and is to be located at the four processing centers;   (3) the command, control, and communications segment, which includes  the equipment and services needed to support satellite operations; and   (4) the launch segment, which includes the launch vehicle services.", "When the NPOESS engineering, manufacturing, and development contract  was awarded in August 2002, the cost estimate was adjusted to $7 billion.  Acquisition plans called for the procurement and launch of six satellites  over the life of the program, as well as the integration of 13 instruments\u2014 consisting of 10 environmental sensors and 3 subsystems. Together, the  sensors were to receive and transmit data on atmospheric, cloud cover,  environmental, climatic, oceanographic, and solar-geophysical  observations. The subsystems were to support nonenvironmental search  and rescue efforts, sensor survivability, and environmental data collection  activities. The program office considered four of the sensors to be critical  because they provide data for key weather products; these sensors are in  bold in table 1, which describes each of the expected NPOESS  instruments.", "In addition, a demonstration satellite, called the NPOESS Preparatory  Project (NPP), was planned to be launched several years before the first  NPOESS satellite in order to reduce the risk associated with launching  new sensor technologies and to ensure continuity of climate data with  NASA\u2019s Earth Observing System satellites. NPP was to host three of the  four critical NPOESS sensors, as well as one other sensor and to provide  the program office and the processing centers an early opportunity to  work with the sensors, ground control, and data processing systems.  When the NPOESS development contract was awarded, the schedule for  launching the satellites was driven by a requirement that the NPOESS  satellites be available to back up the final POES and DMSP satellites  should anything go wrong during the planned launches of these satellites.  Early program milestones included (1) launching NPP by May 2006,   (2) having the first NPOESS satellite available to back up the final POES  satellite launch then planned for March 2008, and (3) having the second  NPOESS satellite available to back up the final DMSP satellite launch then  planned for October 2009.

Key provisions of the law require the Secretary of Defense to  notify Congress when a major defense acquisition is expected to overrun  its current baseline by 15 percent or more and to certify the program to  Congress when it is expected to overrun its current baseline by 25 percent  or more. In November 2005, NPOESS exceeded the 25 percent threshold,  and DOD was required to certify the program.

In addition, after the Executive Committee  members agreed to a revised tri-agency memorandum of agreement and it  was signed by the Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of NASA,  the Under Secretary of Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics refused to  approve the document, and it took over a year to finalize it. Crucially, this  year-long disagreement focused on whether the Under Secretary should  consult with or coordinate with members of the Executive Committee on  matters related to NPOESS. In August 2008, the Under Secretary of  Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere wrote to the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, expressing concern  that DOD did not recognize the management role of the tri-agency  NPOESS Executive Committee or its responsibility, authority, and  accountability to make decisions that represent the respective agency  positions.", "At the conclusion of our review, DOD agency officials stated that the  absence of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology,  and Logistics at Executive Committee meetings is not the root cause of the  Executive Committee\u2019s problems, but acknowledged that this individual\u2019s  presence at the meetings could be helpful in streamlining the flow of  information and the decision-making process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Committee Does Not Aggressively Manage Risks", "paragraphs": ["Best practices note that oversight of large investments is a critical part of  the investment life cycle and call for oversight boards to take corrective  actions at the first sign of cost, schedule, and performance problems.

To provide this oversight, the Executive  Committee holds quarterly meetings during which the program\u2019s progress  is reviewed using metrics that provide an early warning of cost, schedule,  and technical risks.", "Although the Executive Committee meets quarterly to review program  progress and risks, and the results of those meetings are recorded in  meeting minutes, the Committee does not routinely document action items  or track those items to closure. Specifically, in the four meetings held  between March 2007 and January 2008, the Committee explicitly  documented 12 action items, but did not explicitly document action items  in the three meetings from May to December 2008. Instead, 5 actions were  implied in the text of the meeting minutes and at least 1 action item to  proceed with a modified schedule for VIIRS was not recorded at all.  Further, the Executive Committee did not routinely track the closure of its  action items. Some action items were not discussed in later meetings and  in cases where an item was discussed, it was not always clear what action  was taken, whether it was effective, and whether the item was closed.  Specifically, of the 18 action items we identified between March 2007 and  December 2008, 7 were clearly closed and 11 were not. For example, in  May 2008, the Executive Committee asked DOD\u2019s Cost Analysis  Improvement Group and the program office to reconcile their cost  estimates, but it is not clear from the meetings that took place after this  one whether this action was taken and what the result was. Also in May  2008, the Committee directed the prime contractor and others to  investigate the root causes of technical issues; again, it is not clear  whether this was completed or what the results were.", "According to the Program Executive Officer, the closing of an action item  is not always explicitly tracked because it typically involves gathering  information that is presented during later Committee meetings.  Nonetheless, by not rigorously documenting action items\u2014including  identifying the party responsible for the action, the desired outcome, and  the time frame for completion\u2014and then tracking the action items to  closure, the Executive Committee is not able to ensure that its actions  have achieved their intended results and to determine whether additional  changes or modifications are still needed.

Government guidance calls for  oversight boards to take corrective actions at the first sign of cost,  schedule, and performance slippages in order to mitigate risks and achieve  successful outcomes. The NPOESS Executive Committee generally took  immediate action to mitigate the risks that were brought before them;  however, a majority of these actions were not effective\u2014that is, they did  not fully resolve the underlying issues or result in a successful outcome.  Specifically, of 22 significant risks forwarded to the Executive Committee  between January and December 2008, the Committee took some action to  mitigate 17 of the risks and decided to monitor the other 5 risks.  Committee actions included approving modifications to the VIIRS  schedule and directing the program to modify key acquisition documents  to resolve disagreements, to establish an onsite government manager at a  subcontractor\u2019s facility, and to develop a plan for the way forward for the  program once it was determined that the program could not execute its  baseline on time within its budget.", "However, the Committee\u2019s actions either did not result in successful  outcomes or were inefficient in achieving successful outcomes. Of the 22  risks presented to the Executive Committee, 18 involved cost, schedule,  and technical issues on the VIIRS and CrIS sensors, and 4 involved barriers  to gaining approval of key acquisition documents. The Committee\u2019s  actions on the sensor development risks accomplished interim successes  by improving the government\u2019s oversight of a subcontractor\u2019s activities  and guiding next steps in addressing technical issues\u2014but even with  committee actions, the sensors\u2019 performance has continued to falter and  affect the rest of the program. Independent reviewers reported that the tri- agency structure of the program complicated the resolution of sensor risks  because any decision could be revisited by another agency. In addition,  while the government\u2019s onsite program manager is responsible for  managing deliverables of a critical sensor, this individual reported that the  plurality of customers with different expectations and priorities made it  difficult to move the sensor development effort forward.", "As for the 4 risks involving barriers to gaining approval of key acquisition  documents, by the end of 2008, all of the acquisition documents had been  completed. However, the path to achieving this successful outcome was  inefficient. For example, it took over 2 years and countless iterations by  multiple levels of management in three different agencies to complete the  tri-agency memorandum of agreement. The leader of an independent  review team charged with reviewing key program risks recently reported  that the Executive Committee is \u201cat best\u2026 inefficient.\u201d Program officials  explained that interagency disagreements and differing priorities make it  difficult to effectively resolve issues.

While most risks are raised to the Committee within months of  the time they surface at the program level, selected interagency issues  lingered before being brought before the Executive Committee.  Specifically, an interagency disagreement regarding the appropriate level  of security requirements was discussed and studied for 2 years before the  Committee was notified\u2014and the Committee still has not been asked to  make a decision on this issue.", "At the conclusion of our review, DOD officials reported that part of the  problem in escalating risks is that, in violation of interagency agreements  and inconsistent with DOD acquisition policy, two senior NOAA officials  review and limit what the Program Executive Officer provides to the  Executive Committee.

In approving the restructured program,  DOD\u2019s decision authority noted that he reserved the right to use a different  satellite integrator for the final two satellites, and that a decision on  whether to exercise the option was to be made in June 2010. To prepare  for this decision, DOD required a tri-agency assessment of alternative  management strategies. This assessment was to examine the feasibility of  an alternative satellite integrator, to estimate the cost and schedule  implications of moving to an alternative integrator, and within one year, to  provide a viable alternative to the NPOESS Executive Committee.", "To address DOD\u2019s requirement, the NPOESS Program Executive Officer  sponsored two successive alternative management studies; however,  neither of the studies identified a viable alternative to the existing satellite  integrator. The first study, conducted in 2007, identified three alternatives  to the existing satellite integrator, including (1) re-competing the entire  prime contract, (2) obtaining an independent system integrator while  having the existing prime contractor continue to develop space and  ground components, and (3) having the government take over  responsibility for the system integration. The study identified the relative  strengths and weaknesses of the alternatives and recommended that the  program remain with the existing prime contractor for C3 and C4 because  doing otherwise would increase cost and schedule risks. It did not quantify  these costs or risks. The second alternative management study, conducted  in 2008, identified the same alternatives to the current system integrator  and assessed their relative cost, schedule, and performance risks to the  program. The study determined that the alternatives to the system  integrator were not viable options because of their potential costs, and  because the prime contractor\u2019s performance had been meeting  requirements. This study also recommended staying with the prime  contractor for C3 and C4. Both of these studies also assessed other  aspects of program management\u2014including the government\u2019s executive  and program management and the contractors\u2019 management\u2014and made  recommendations to improve them.", "The Program Executive Officer plans to conduct a final assessment of  alternatives prior to the June 2010 decision on whether to exercise the  option to have the current system integrator produce the next two  NPOESS satellites.
