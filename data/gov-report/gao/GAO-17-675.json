The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 established additional requirements for OSDBUs and required SBPAC to review OSDBU compliance with section 15(k) requirements.", "GAO was asked to review compliance with selected requirements of section 15(k). GAO examined (1) the extent to which selected federal agencies demonstrated compliance with 13 requirements for OSDBUs and (2) SBPAC review process results. GAO selected a sample of 10 agencies, based on contracting obligations, to review a reporting requirement for OSDBU directors. For the other 12 requirements, GAO surveyed OSDBU directors at 24 agencies, selected based on contracting obligations (100 percent response rate). To review and augment survey responses, GAO also analyzed guidance and documents and interviewed OSDBU directors."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Demonstrated compliance with selected section 15(k) requirements for the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) varied across the 24 agencies GAO surveyed.

Examples of GAO findings include the following:", "Four OSDBU directors did not report directly to the agency head or deputy (the one requirement for which GAO reviewed only 10 agencies).", "Five agencies did not demonstrate compliance with a requirement for collateral duties of OSDBU directors.", "Six agencies did not demonstrate compliance with a requirement for compensation and seniority of OSDBU directors.", "Twenty-three agencies demonstrated compliance for four requirements on OSDBU director experience, supervisory duties of the OSDBU director, identifying and addressing significant bundling of contracts (consolidation of two or more procurement requirements into a solicitation for a single contract), and providing assistance on payments.", "Fifteen agencies demonstrated compliance with a requirement to respond to notifications that solicitations unduly restricted the ability of small businesses to compete for contracts.", "Noncompliance with section 15(k) requirements may limit the extent to which an OSDBU can advocate for small businesses. For example, OSDBU influence in agencies might be limited if directors reported to lower levels of management. Directors with other duties might be less able to carry out all section 15(k) duties.", "Results of the Small Business Procurement Advisory Council's (SBPAC) annual review of compliance with section 15(k) requirements differed from GAO's assessments. The Small Business Administration (SBA) chairs SBPAC, and its members are nearly all OSDBU directors. All agencies in the most recent review scored 94\u201398 percent. But where GAO's review considered the same section 15(k) requirements as the SBPAC review, GAO found some agencies had not demonstrated compliance with multiple requirements. Other than reviewing documentation agencies choose to provide, SBA's guidance for the review panel does not indicate any other means by which reviewers could obtain or clarify information. GAO's review included follow-up discussions with agency officials to obtain or clarify information. SBA has been developing a new review process, but preliminary information GAO reviewed indicates the process will be similar to the current one. According to federal standards for internal control, management should use quality information to make informed decisions. Under the new process, the review results (which SBA uses in another process that determines an agency's overall grade for small business contracting) also will carry twice as much weight as under the current process\u2014underscoring the importance of the review results.

OSDBUs would be managed by a director. Section 15(k)(3)  of the act, as amended, requires that OSDBU directors generally be  responsible only to and report directly to agency heads or their deputies.  The purpose of this provision is to help ensure that OSDBU directors  have direct access to their agencies\u2019 top decision makers to advocate  effectively for small businesses. Subsequent amendments have specified  minimum seniority or pay levels for directors, enumerated qualifying prior  work experience, specified who would sign the director\u2019s performance  appraisals, and outlined the responsibilities of the position.", "Section 15(k), as amended, also establishes a number of functions for  which OSDBU directors are responsible. These functions include  identifying proposed solicitations that bundle contract requirements;   working with agency acquisitions officials to revise solicitations to  increase the probability of small business participation; and assisting  small businesses in obtaining payments from agencies. Additionally,  OSDBUs are to provide senior agency officials with advice and comments  on acquisition strategies and market research.", "In three earlier reports (2003, 2004, and 2011), we reviewed federal  agencies\u2019 compliance with the section 15(k)(3) requirement on reporting  to agency heads or their deputies.

In the 2011 report, we found that 7  of the 16 agencies in our review were not in compliance with the  requirement for the OSDBU director to report to the head or deputy head  of the agency. Since then, all 7 of the agencies have implemented our  recommendation to comply with the reporting requirement that was in  effect at the time of our review.", "You requested that we evaluate how OSDBUs have implemented the  requirements of section 15(k).

We selected the 10 agencies based  on contracting obligations (6 each had more than $10 billion in  obligations, and 4 each had fewer) and also for variety. Of the 6  agencies with more than $10 billion in obligations, we selected 3  Department of Defense (DOD) components and 3 non-DOD  agencies.

The Small  Business Reauthorization Act of 1997 further amended the Small  Business Act to increase the goal to at least 23 percent. To help meet this  goal, SBA annually establishes prime contract goals for various  categories of small businesses for each federal agency. Although SBA is  responsible for coordinating with executive branch agencies on this goal,  agency heads are responsible for achieving small business goals for their  agencies. As previously discussed, in 1978 Congress also established an  OSDBU in each federal agency with procurement powers.

Twenty-three of 24 OSDBUs demonstrated compliance with this  requirement. Most agencies indicated they had policies for the OSDBU to  review proposed solicitations and many cited having a certain dollar  threshold to review for any bundling. For example, OPM\u2019s survey  response and submitted policy documentation indicated that small  business specialists review all proposed procurements over $150,000.", "One agency did not demonstrate compliance. Within the Department of  Defense \u2013 Office of the Secretary, the OSDBU director has an oversight  role in relation to identifying proposed bundling, rather than an  implementation role. According to OSDBU officials, the Office of the  Secretary\u2019s small business staff work with contracting officers to review  proposed acquisitions and mitigate the effects of bundling.

For example, the  survey response from the Department of Justice indicated that the agency  has a policy to pay small businesses within 15 days of receiving an  invoice. An agency official thought this policy greatly reduced the  requests for assistance the OSDBU received, but the official noted that,  should a small business ask for assistance, the OSDBU would provide  assistance as needed. In contrast, SSA did not demonstrate compliance.

The Departments of the Army and Navy told us that  their OSDBU directors did not assign small business technical  advisers because the technical advisers were hired by and reported to  the head of the contracting activity at the procurement center in which  they were located. At Navy, an agency official stated that law and  regulation disagree on this requirement. The Defense Federal  Acquisition Regulation delegated the responsibility to hire technical  advisers to the head of contracting.

For instance, OSDBU officials at some  agencies told us that, after receiving a notification, the directors would  discuss the issue with the contracting officer working on the solicitation or  proposal and that they also would ensure the small business was aware  of resources to address the issue, but they would not consistently notify  the agency\u2019s advocate for competition (examples follow).", "NASA, USDA, and DLA. The OSDBU officials from these agencies  indicated that the goal was to resolve the competition issue at the  lowest level possible, meaning directly with the contracting officer, and  thus not inform the agency\u2019s competition advocate. Additionally, the  officials thought that it was more efficient to work to resolve issues at  the lowest levels rather than notifying the agency advocate for  competition. At USDA, OSDBU officials indicated that, if direct  resolution with the contracting officer was unsuccessful, the situation  could be elevated, possibly to the level of advocate for competition.  Additionally, an OSDBU official at NASA said it was rare to receive  notifications of this type because the agency proactively makes  solicitations work for small businesses.", "USAID.

An agency  official told us that the office goes directly to the procurement officer  and ombudsman to resolve competition issues.", "In addition to survey responses about individual functions, a few agencies  commented on how staffing levels affected their ability to fully carry out  section 15(k) functions. The Department of Commerce said the OSDBU  was significantly affected by low staffing levels, limiting it in efforts such  as creating and updating small business contracting policies, reviewing  broader acquisition policies that may affect small businesses, and  conducting training for small businesses. SSA stated that staffing levels  prevented the OSDBU from attending outreach events and meeting  individually with small business owners due to scheduling conflicts.

But continued demonstration of  noncompliance with these requirements may undermine the intent of the  provisions and may limit the extent to which OSDBUs can advocate for  small businesses.

The review assesses an  agency\u2019s progress plan by considering seven success factors for  achievement of and commitment to small business contracting. SBPAC  must report the results to the House and Senate Small Business  committees. The peer reviews are a form of internal control that is  intended to provide some assurance that OSDBUs comply with section  15(k) requirements.", "More specifically, for several agencies, our compliance determinations for  the section 15(k) requirements related to organizational structure did not  align with SBPAC\u2019s fiscal year 2016 scores for the \u201cOSDBU organization\u201d  success factor (see table 3). For example, the Department of Labor\u2019s  OSDBU organization score was 0.9 (classified by SBA as above  average), but we determined that the agency did not demonstrate  compliance with two of five section 15(k) requirements related to  organizational structure. Similarly, SSA received an OSDBU organization  score of 0.8 (satisfactory), but we determined that it had not  demonstrated compliance with four of five section 15(k) requirements  related to organizational structure. Table 3 provides additional examples  of inconsistencies between the SBPAC scores and our determinations. In addition, agencies in the most recent review received overall scores  (across the seven success factors) of 94\u201398 percent.", "For each success factor, agencies provide SBPAC reviewers with a brief  narrative explaining their efforts and can (but are not required to) submit  up to three supporting documents. The resulting assessment scores are  then used in developing SBA\u2019s annual scorecard grade for each  agency. According to federal standards for internal control,  management should use quality information to make informed decisions  and evaluate an entity\u2019s performance in achieving key objectives.  Additionally, these standards state that management should design  control activities to achieve objectives.", "For example, SBA provides guidance to peer reviewers and agencies that  lists two examples of documentation that agencies may submit to support  their compliance with the five 15(k) sections included under the success  factor for OSDBU organization. Section 15(k)(3) requires that the OSDBU  director\u2019s performance appraisal be signed by the agency head, deputy  head, or, in the case of DOD, the secretary or secretary\u2019s designee. But  the only two examples of documentation that are included in the SBA  guidance are an organizational chart and an employee job description.  Reviewing these two types of documents may allow for some  determination of the reporting chain at an agency, but it would not allow  for a determination of whether the required official signed a director\u2019s  performance appraisal.", "During our review, we requested these documents and also a copy of the  performance appraisal from each agency to support our determination of  whether the OSDBU director reported directly to the agency head or  deputy head as generally required in section 15(k)(3). Additionally, we  discussed the section 15(k) requirements with agency staff to clarify  information and assess the extent to which the OSDBU met this  requirement. Other than reviewing the documentation provided by  agencies, SBA\u2019s guidance for the peer review panel does not indicate any  other means by which peer reviewers could obtain or clarify information.  SBA officials told us they rely on members of SBPAC to oversee the  review of their peers and determine thresholds of evidence, and also on  the agencies to provide information in good faith. As a result of this  approach and as differences between the peer review scores and our  compliance determinations suggest, SBPAC scores may not accurately  reflect an agency\u2019s compliance with section 15(k) requirements.", "Planned changes to scoring in the peer review process also may affect  the reliability of the scores and information reported about agency  achievements in small business contracting. SBA has been updating its  SBPAC peer review process and also plans to update its scoring  methodology. SBA officials told us the updates to the peer review process  will result in an expanded review that addresses 18, and possibly as  many as 21, requirements of section 15(k). Officials said they expect that  updated peer review panel guidance will be finalized later this year for  use with the fiscal year 2017 scorecard and peer review. Preliminary  information that SBA provided in a description of changes to the fiscal  year 2017 scorecard suggests that the new review process will be similar  to the current process.", "In response to a requirement in the National Defense Authorization Act  for Fiscal Year 2016, SBA also will change its scorecard methodology for  fiscal year 2017. The provision specifies that an agency\u2019s performance  towards its prime contracting goals will account for 50 percent of an  agency\u2019s grade (versus 80 percent in the current formulation). The  remaining 50 percent is to be weighted in a manner determined by the  administrator of SBA based on certain legal requirements. SBA has  preliminarily determined that the remaining 50 percent will be allocated as  follows: 20 percent for the results of the peer review of section 15(k)  requirements (versus the current 10 percent), 20 percent for  subcontracting, and 10 percent for a comparison of awarded contracts on  a year-over-year basis.", "Applying similar standards to an updated peer review process that is  weighted more heavily in calculating agencies\u2019 overall SBA scorecard  grades could result in a greater lack of reliability in these scorecard  grades and information reported to Congress. And without reliable  information from the SBPAC peer review, Congress\u2019s ability to oversee  federal advocacy for small businesses through OSDBUs may be  hindered. When we spoke to SBA officials about the differences between  the results of the peer review and our review of compliance with section  15(k) requirements, the officials indicated that they have been developing  additional guidance and were considering increasing the threshold of  evidence used in the peer review but had no firm plans to do so."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Agencies generally demonstrated high levels of compliance with some  section 15(k) requirements but less so for others. For a few section 15(k)  requirements for which agencies did not demonstrate compliance, staff at  some agencies explained that their agencies had carried out the required  activities outside of the OSDBU or by using different processes than  specified in the requirements. In a few instances, some staff thought that  the differing processes were more efficient for their agency. We did not  assess whether these different approaches facilitated the execution of  required activities, but focused on whether agencies demonstrated  compliance with the requirements as described in section 15(k).  Continued demonstrated noncompliance with these requirements may  undermine the intent of the provisions and may limit the extent to which  OSDBUs can advocate for small businesses. If agencies still believe that  their procedures for certain activities are sufficient to advocate for small  business contracts, at a minimum agencies have the obligation to explain  their noncompliance to Congress and provide support for their views,  including requesting any statutory flexibilities to permit exceptions as  appropriate.", "With SBPAC reviews potentially constituting 20 percent of agency overall  SBA scorecard grades under the revised process, the reliability of the  SBPAC peer review takes on greater importance. However, the results of  our review often diverged from SBPAC\u2019s in areas that overlapped (our  review also included section 15(k) requirements that are not part of the  peer review). The divergence in results suggests that the process could  be enhanced. For instance, current SBA guidance is limited in describing  procedures and methods for the peer review.

Air Force demonstrated compliance with the requirements,  and DOD did not comment on our findings for Air Force. DOD partially  agreed with our recommendation to DLA and did not agree with our  recommendations to Army, Navy, and the Office of the Secretary. Of the  15 non-DOD agencies to which we made recommendations and which  provided comments, 5 agreed, 4 partially agreed, 1 agreed in principle,  and 5 neither agreed nor disagreed with our recommendations. The  agencies\u2019 comments and our responses are summarized below. Unless  otherwise noted, these agencies provided comment letters that are  reproduced in appendixes XXVIII-XXXXI. SBA and Commerce also  provided technical comments that we have incorporated, as appropriate.", "Commerce agreed with four of five parts of our recommendation  relating to sections 15(k)(2), compensation/seniority; 15(k)(8), assign  small business technical advisers; 15(k)(11), advise on in-sourcing;  and 15(k)(17), respond to a notification of an undue restriction on the  ability of a small business to compete. Commerce noted that, in  response, it intends to change the position of the OSDBU director to  an SES position in fiscal year 2018; the OSDBU director is in the  process of appointing small business technical advisers; and the  agency has been updating the Commerce Acquisition Manual to  address procedures for in-sourcing and unduly restrictive solicitations.", "However, Commerce disagreed with one part of our recommendation  for section 15(k)(5), identify and address bundling of contract  requirements. The agency stated that small business set-asides  valued over $150,000 are subjected to a review and approval process  that includes the bureau small business specialist, procurement  center representative, OSDBU director, and sometimes the senior  procurement executive. Commerce also said that when the review  package does not indicate a bundling action, the small business  specialist and OSDBU may investigate the possibility of bundling  based on supporting documentation submitted with the review form.  Commerce had not previously provided this information at the time of  our review. Based on this new information, we are no longer including  this part of our recommendation and have made the relevant changes  in the report.

However, DOD disagreed with the part of the recommendation for  section 15(k)(7), supervisory duties. The agency stated that the  headquarters DLA OSDBU director supervises all employees in the  headquarters OSDBU. The agency also stated that DLA is a relatively  large agency comprising many subordinate field activities, each of  which has a small business office, and a director in each of those  offices supervises all the small business professionals within that  activity. As noted in the report, a DLA OSDBU official explained that  the ODSBU director appointed small business associates to work in  the field, but did not directly supervise field staff.

It noted that no contracting or  bundling occurs at the level of the Office of the Secretary of Defense.  DOD stated that contracting and bundling occurs in acquisitions  conducted at the lower-level components of DOD. As noted in the  report, the OSDBU director has an oversight role in relation to  identifying proposed bundling, rather than an implementation role.  However, section 15(k)(5) requires OSDBUs to identify proposed  solicitations that involve significant bundling of contract requirements  and, where appropriate, work with agency officials to mitigate the  effects on small businesses. If DOD believes that the unique situation  of this office warrants its demonstrated noncompliance with this  provision, the agency should explain its demonstrated noncompliance  to Congress and provide support for the agency\u2019s views.

The agency also stated that its  performance appraisals are done at two levels: the initial appraisal  and the approval by a higher-level official. Education said that, in the  case of the OSDBU director, the deputy secretary was the second  level of approval. Education stated that, since January 2017, the  position of deputy secretary has been vacant, and, as noted in the  report, the director\u2019s performance appraisal was signed by the senior  policy adviser.

Education said that, due to limited OSDBU resources, the agency  delegated the responsibility to review in-sourcing to another office.  Education stated that, given anticipated budget reductions, the  agency would evaluate how best to implement section 15(k)(11). As  noted in the draft report, section 15(k)(11) requires that the person  heading the OSDBU office must review and advise the agency on any  decision to convert an activity performed by a small business to an  activity performed by a federal employee.

The agency stated that the OSDBU director\u2019s performance  appraisals will be completed by the secretary or deputy secretary; the  OSDBU will appoint at least one small business technical adviser for  each business line (three in total); and the OSDBU will complete a  data call to its small business program managers to determine if there  have been any undue restrictions on small business. We note that  completing a data call to retrospectively look at prior instances of  undue restrictions will not address the section 15(k)(17) requirement,  which requires the OSDBU director to respond to concerns of undue  restriction on an ongoing basis. The agency estimated that the actions  will be completed by September 30, 2017.

For section 15(k)(17), State said that its OSDBU  will affirm internal policy to refer all claims of unduly restricting the  ability of a small business to compete, regardless of their resolution at  a lower level, to the agency\u2019s competition advocate. This is consistent  with what we recommended.", "For section 15(k)(8), the agency asserted that it is currently in  compliance, noting that it assigns small business technical advisers at  the department level and that staffing each of its 46 bureaus with a  full-time qualified small business technical adviser would be  impractical, inefficient, and unnecessary. As noted in our report,  State\u2019s OSDBU director assigns a small business technical adviser as  a full-time employee of the OSDBU, rather than of the procuring  activity, which is not consistent with the section 15(k)(8) requirement.  We maintain our recommendation to State regarding section 15(k)(8).  The department\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix XXXIV.", "Treasury did not agree or disagree with our two-part recommendation  related to sections 15(k)(8), assign small business technical advisers,  and 15(k)(11), advise on in-sourcing. In an attachment to an e-mail,  Treasury stated that the authority to appoint a small business  technical adviser (termed small business specialist at Treasury) was  delegated to the chief procurement officer for a bureau. As noted in  the report, an agency official stated that the OSDBU does not assign  a small business specialist to each of its bureaus. Section 15(k)(8)  requires the OSDBU director to assign a small business technical  adviser to each office to which SBA has assigned a procurement  center representative. We maintain our recommendation. Treasury  also stated that, if conversions from private to federal performance  occurred, the department\u2019s human resources office would coordinate  this action with the OSDBU and the acquisition office. The department  plans to formally incorporate the small business provision in its  workforce planning guidance and develop and document procedures  for in-sourcing review as part of the OSDBU\u2019s effort to develop a  Human Capital Workforce Planning process.", "VA agreed with the part of our recommendation related to section  15(k)(11), advise on in-sourcing, and concurred in principle with the  other two parts of the recommendation related to sections 15(k)(3),  reporting requirement (head of the agency or deputy head), and  15(k)(8), assign small business technical advisers. For section  15(k)(11), VA stated that the agency\u2019s OSDBU has drafted language  for its review policy for procurements to address this requirement. VA  plans to implement the revised policy in fiscal year 2018.", "For section 15(k)(3), VA asserted that it is in compliance with this  requirement but acknowledged that its chief of staff is the rating  official for the OSDBU director. VA further noted that the deputy  secretary is the reviewing official and the secretary the appointing  official. VA said that federal law, regulation, and the VA handbook on  the performance appraisal system require this separation of duties  and roles. VA also said that, while the chief of staff prepares and  signs the initial summary rating and performance appraisal, the  appraisal is subject to review by the secretary and deputy secretary.  VA stated that removing the chief of staff from the performance  appraisal process would require merging some of the aforementioned  duties into the same person, eliminating the independent reviews  required by law and regulation. However, as we note in appendix II,  section 15(k)(3) requires that the OSDBU director report exclusively to  the agency\u2019s secretary or deputy secretary, including with respect to  performance appraisals. Therefore, we maintain our recommendation.  VA also said that it will report to Congress on the reasons for its  current reporting structure for the OSDBU director, with a target  completion date of September 30, 2017.", "For the part of the recommendation related to section 15(k)(8), VA  acknowledged the value of contract activities having a knowledgeable  on-site small business technical adviser who is able to collaborate  with the procurement center representative and noted that, to the  extent that the adviser addresses matters within the OSDBU\u2019s  responsibility, it is essential for the OSDBU to provide guidance and  direction. However, the agency stated that the requirement for the  OSDBU to select an employee of the contracting activity and direct  that person\u2019s principal work efforts to assist the procurement center  representative requires an unusual degree of matrixed reporting  relationships and will entail a high level of collaboration with the  contracting activity\u2019s leadership. VA said that its OSDBU will seek to  collaborate with the cognizant contracting activities through VA\u2019s  Senior Procurement Council and develop a memorandum of  understanding outlining roles and responsibilities. VA stated that its  target completion date for the memorandum is September 30, 2017  (so as to go into effect at the start of fiscal year 2018). We maintain  our recommendation, as VA\u2019s comments do not make it clear if the  OSDBU director will assign a small business technical adviser to the  procuring activity or if the assigned staff would be a full-time employee  of this activity. The department\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix  XXXVI.", "EPA did not say whether it agreed or disagreed with our  recommendation relating to requirements for section 15(k)(15),  collateral duties. As we noted in the report, EPA\u2019s OSDBU director  oversees two EPA-wide programs, the Disadvantaged Business  Enterprise Program and the Asbestos and Small Business  Ombudsman Program. EPA stated that we mischaracterized  provisions of the Clean Air Act of 1990 (as requiring EPA\u2019s OSDBU  director to serve as the ombudsman for the Asbestos and Small  Business Ombudsman Program) as part of our determination of  whether EPA demonstrated compliance. EPA stated that, instead, the  act requires that the relevant programs be monitored through the  ombudsman (not the OSDBU director). The agency stated that EPA  appointed an official other than the OSDBU director to serve as the  ombudsman and that our report should be revised to correctly indicate  that the OSDBU director does not hold the ombudsman position.  Based on EPA\u2019s comments, we removed references in the report to  the Clean Air Act requirements being inconsistent with section  15(k)(15) requirements. We also made it clear that the OSDBU,  through the program ombudsman, monitors the activities of the  Asbestos and Small Business Ombudsman Program. As noted in the  report, we did not consider the provisions of the Clean Air Act and the  corresponding responsibilities of the OSDBU as a factor for our  assessment of demonstrated compliance with section 15(k)(15).", "EPA also stated that the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program  is structured so that the OSDBU director does not serve as the  program manager or carry out the day-to-day programmatic  responsibilities in contravention of section 15(k)(15). However, as we  noted in the report, the OSDBU director oversees the Disadvantaged  Business Enterprise Program. This is inconsistent with section  15(k)(15), which requires that the OSDBU director not hold  responsibilities except as necessary to carry out responsibilities under  section 15(k). Thus, we maintain our recommendation to EPA. The  agency\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix XXXVII.", "NASA partially agreed with our recommendation related to section  15(k)(17), respond to a notification of an undue restriction on the  ability of a small business to compete. The agency agreed that, as our  report supports, it is currently in compliance with two required steps  under section 15(k)(17), subparagraphs (A) and (C), but not with the  third required step, subparagraph (B), which requires the OSDBU  director to inform the agency\u2019s advocate for competition when notified  by a small business of a solicitation that unduly restricts its ability to  complete. But NASA added that it believes that the most practical and  effective way to address such notifications is for the OSDBU, in  consultation with the contracting officer, to resolve issues at the  lowest level possible. However, to comply with the statute, the agency  said that the OSDBU will begin notifying the advocate for competition.  The agency also said that the OSDBU will notify the cognizant Center- level competition advocate. NASA said that the OSDBU, in  coordination with the agency\u2019s Office of Procurement, intends to issue  formal correspondence to the acquisition community on the new  procedures within 6 months and that it plans to begin carrying out the  new procedures the next time it receives a notification of an unduly  restrictive solicitation. The agency\u2019s comments are reprinted in  appendix XXXVIII.", "OPM agreed with one part of our recommendation and partially  agreed with two parts of the recommendation. OPM concurred with  the part of the recommendation regarding section 15(k)(17), respond  to a notification of an undue restriction on the ability of a small  business to compete. In response, OPM said it prepared draft  guidance (standard operating procedures) on the topic that would  address the issue of communicating such notices to the agency\u2019s  advocate for competition. OPM said that it is currently reviewing the  guidance.", "OPM partially agreed with the part of the recommendation regarding  section 15(k)(2), compensation/seniority of the OSDBU director. The  agency stated that, at the time it became a requirement for the  OSDBU director to be a member of the SES, the OSDBU director held  a General Schedule position (GS-15). OPM said that the current  nominee for OPM director, if confirmed, will evaluate and take  appropriate action to comply or report to Congress on why the agency  has not complied, including, if appropriate, seeking statutory flexibility  or an exception.", "OPM also partially concurred with the part of our recommendation  related to section 15(k)(8), assign small business technical advisers.  OPM stated that we did not take into account that the OSDBU has two  staff members qualified to work with the procurement center  representative who each spend 50 percent of their time working with  the procurement center representative, which equates to full-time  coverage. We maintain our recommendation as section 15(k)(8)  requires that the technical adviser must be a full-time employee of the  procuring activity. The agency\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix  XXXIX.", "SSA agreed with our recommendation relating to sections 15(k)(2),  compensation/seniority; 15(k)(3), reporting requirement (head of the  agency or deputy head); 15(k)(6), provide assistance on payments;  15(k)(8), assign small business technical advisers; 15(k)(11), advise  on in-sourcing; and 15(k)(15), collateral duties. SSA summarized the  actions it has taken or plans to take in response. For sections 15(k)(2)  and (k)(3), SSA stated that, given the OSDBU director\u2019s duties and  responsibilities and the agency\u2019s small size and structure, it intended  to explore obtaining an exception to keep the director position at the  GS-15 level and an exception to the reporting requirement. For  section 15(k)(6), SSA said it will refer small businesses seeking  assistance with payments to the OSDBU director. For section  15(k)(8), SSA said its OSDBU will officially assign a small business  technical adviser to the relevant office. For section 15(k)(11), SSA  noted an existing analysis it performs of contractor functions, which  helps ensure that SSA takes appropriate steps to guard against  improper reliance on contractors and that contractor personnel do not  perform inherently governmental functions. SSA said any proposed in- sourcing based on the analysis would be discussed with the  component, the Office of Acquisition and Grants, and the OSDBU if  warranted. Finally, for section 15(k)(15), SSA said that it would  delegate coordinating responsibilities for the Electronic  Subcontracting Reporting System from the OSDBU director to its  small business technical adviser. The agency\u2019s comments are  reprinted in appendix XXXX.", "USAID agreed with our recommendation relating to section 15(k)(15),  collateral duties, and 15(k)(17), respond to a notification of an undue  restriction on the ability of a small business to compete. For the part of  the recommendation relating to section 15(k)(15), collateral duties,  USAID said it would not gain efficiencies by moving responsibility for  the Minority Serving Institution (MSI) program from the OSDBU.  Instead, it would explore requesting statutory flexibility or an exception  to allow the OSDBU director to continue to advocate for the MSI. In  response to the other part of the recommendation relating to section  15(k)(17), USAID said the OSDBU director simultaneously will notify  the advocate for competition, contracting officer, and ombudsman in  instances in which a notice falls within the parameters of section  15(k)(17). The agency\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix XXXXI.", "In its comment letter, SBA agreed with our recommendation to include  more detailed guidelines for the SBPAC peer review to facilitate a  more in-depth review of agencies\u2019 compliance with section 15(k)  provisions. The agency said that it has begun to implement the  recommendation for fiscal year 2017 and that it has been developing  more detailed guidelines that provide more objective criteria than the  current guidelines, such as indicating whether agencies comply with  the 21 section 15(k) requirements. The agency also stated that the  new peer review process will count for a higher percentage of each  agency\u2019s overall scorecard grade (an increase from 10 percent to 20  percent). SBA said that the changes will be implemented for the fiscal  year 2017 peer review. The agency\u2019s comments are reprinted in  appendix XXXV.", "SBA provided additional comments, which the agency identified as  technical comments, in an e-mail from the program manager, GAO  liaison, Office of Congressional and Legislative Affairs. While these  comments did not address our recommendation to SBA, in some  instances they appeared to question our approach and the findings  that provided a basis for our conclusions and recommendation. In  particular, the comments stated that there is little value in a  comparison of SBA\u2019s success factor peer review (we refer to this in  the report as the SBPAC peer review) with the requirement for SBA to  conduct a full peer review of all of the requirements in section 15(k),  given that the success factors were developed before the 2013  statutory requirement was put in place. In addition, the comments  questioned the relevance of our findings for agency compliance with  its peer review process.", "However, as we state in the report, the SBPAC peer review assesses  compliance with certain section 15(k) requirements, particularly the  \u201corganization\u201d success factor focusing on five section 15(k) provisions.  Our analysis focuses primarily on the methods SBA used and the  guidance it provided for assessing OSDBUs\u2019 compliance with these  section 15(k) requirements. We also note that the documentation SBA  provided on its plans for the revised process suggests that similar  methods to assess compliance will be used in the new process as  under the current process. As in the current process, the  documentation indicates that compliance determinations will be made  based on a review of documents agencies voluntarily submit, rather  than on a more in-depth assessment. For these reasons, we maintain  that our discussion of the success factor peer review is relevant when  considering how SBA may implement the new review process. In  addition, our analysis does not equate our findings for agency  compliance with those of the success factor peer review. Rather, it  examines the alignment of the results. This allows for a valid  assessment of whether the scores generally correspond with our  findings. Our recommendation is intended to help ensure that SBA  implements a more robust approach to assessing section 15(k)  compliance through the SBPAC peer review, as compared to the  success factor peer review. SBA stated that our report will help inform  the structure of the new peer review checklist being developed.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

The officials said that the OSDBU does not have formal  procedures for providing payment assistance, and in cases in which a  small business sought payment assistance from a prime contractor, the  OSDBU generally would not get involved.  15(k)(8), assign small business technical advisers: SSA officials noted  that the agency has only one acquisition office; therefore, the OSDBU  director did not assign technical advisers and the requirement did not  make sense in the agency context. However, SSA has a specialist for  small and disadvantaged business utilization, who is managed by another  executive. Officials said that the specialist is a well-qualified, technically  trained, full-time employee and has a principal duty to assist the  procurement center representative, but is not assigned by the OSDBU.  15(k)(11), advise on in-sourcing: According to SSA officials, the  OSDBU is not generally involved in providing advice on a decision to  convert an activity performed by a small business to an activity performed  by a federal employee, although the budget office could contact the  OSDBU for input on an informal basis.
