However, it has established only a few of the management capabilities for effectively developing, maintaining, and implementing an architecture. For example, the agency reports that it has allocated adequate resources to the projects, and it has established project offices to be responsible for developing the architecture, designated a chief architect for each project, and released Version 5.0 of its NAS architecture. But the agency has yet to establish other key architecture management capabilities--such as designating a committee or group that represents the enterprise to direct, oversee, or approve the architecture, and establishing an architecture policy. FAA agreed that the agency needs an effective enterprise architecture program and stated that it plans to improve its management of both projects. For example, the agency intends to establish a steering committee; develop a policy that will govern the development, maintenance, and implementation of the architecture program; and have an approved architecture project management plan for the non-NAS architecture. GAO's experience in reviewing other agencies has shown that not having an effective enterprise architecture program can be attributed to, among other things, an absence of senior management understanding and support and cultural resistance to having and using one. It has also shown that attempting major systems modernization programs like FAA's without having and using an enterprise architecture often results in system implementations that are duplicative, are not well integrated, require costly rework to interface, and do not effectively optimize mission performance."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s (FAA) mission is to promote the  safe, orderly, and expeditious flow of air traffic in the U.S. airspace  system\u2014commonly referred to as the National Airspace System (NAS).

The air traffic control system, the  primary component of the NAS, is a vast network of computer hardware,  software, and communications equipment. This system consists of  automated information processing and display, communication, navigation,  surveillance, and weather resources that permit air traffic controllers to  view key information\u2014such as aircraft location, aircraft flight plans, and  prevailing weather conditions\u2014and to communicate with pilots. These  resources reside at, or are associated with, several air traffic control  facilities\u2014towers, terminal radar approach control facilities, air route  traffic control centers (en route centers), flight service stations, and the  System Command Center.

Since the 1980s, various frameworks have emerged and been  applied. For example, John Zachman developed a structure or \u201cframework\u201d  for defining and capturing an architecture. This framework provides for  six windows from which to view the enterprise, which Zachman terms  \u201cperspectives\u201d on how a given entity operates: those of (1) the strategic  planner, (2) the system user, (3) the system designer, (4) the system  developer, (5) the subcontractor, and (6) the system itself. Zachman also  proposed six abstractions or models associated with each of these  perspectives: these models cover (1) how the entity operates, (2) what the  entity uses to operate, (3) where the entity operates, (4) who operates the  entity, (5) when entity operations occur, and (6) why the entity operates.", "In September 1999, the federal CIO Council published the Federal  Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF), which is intended to provide  federal agencies with a common construct for their respective  architectures, to facilitate the coordination of common business processes,  technology insertion, information flows, and system investments among  federal agencies. FEAF describes an approach, including models and  definitions, for developing and documenting architecture descriptions for  multiorganizational functional segments of the federal government.

Among other  things, this guidance calls for products that describe the \u201cAs Is\u201d and \u201cTo Be\u201d  business, performance, information/data, applications/services,  technology, and security environments as well as a sequencing plan for  transitioning from the \u201cAs Is\u201d to the \u201cTo Be\u201d states. Other stage 3 core  elements nevertheless have not been met, such as having a written and  approved architecture development policy. Further, none of the stage 4 and  5 core elements have been met, although the CIO stated that FAA has  recently begun to take steps associated with meeting some of these core  elements. The detailed results of our assessment of the NAS project office\u2019s  progress in implementing the core elements associated with the five  maturity stages are provided in appendix II.", "In addition, FAA\u2019s senior enterprise architecture officials, including the  program director, stated that attention to and oversight of the enterprise  architecture program have been limited in the past and that the agency has  not documented its architecture management policies, procedures, and  processes. These officials stated that the agency recognizes the need to  establish an effective NAS architecture project and that it intends to do so.", "To this end, FAA currently plans to have, by September 2005, a framework  for developing the architecture and an approved enterprise architecture  policy requiring the development, maintenance, and implementation of an  enterprise architecture. The CIO also stated that the agency plans to update  its NAS architecture to reflect current architecture standards and guidance.", "Our research of successful organizations and our experience in reviewing  other agencies\u2019 enterprise architecture efforts show that not having these  controls is, among other things, a function of limited senior management  understanding of and commitment to an enterprise architecture and  cultural resistance to having and using one. Until such barriers are  addressed and effective architecture management structures and processes  are established, it is unlikely that an agency will be able to produce and  maintain a complete and enforceable architecture and thus implement  modernized systems in a way that minimizes overlap and duplication and  maximizes integration and mission support. Given the size and complexity  of FAA\u2019s air traffic control systems and their importance to FAA\u2019s ability to  achieve its mission, it is critical that FAA develop a well-defined  architecture that can be used to guide and constrain system investment  decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA Has Yet to Implement Key Best Practices for Managing Its Non-NAS Architecture Project", "paragraphs": ["Similar to its NAS architecture effort, FAA\u2019s attempt to develop, maintain,  and implement its non-NAS architecture needs to be grounded in the kind  of rigorous and disciplined management practices embodied in Version 1.1  of our architecture management maturity framework.

According to the framework,  effective architecture management is generally not achieved until an  enterprise has a completed and approved architecture that is being  effectively maintained and is being used to leverage organizational change  and support investment decision making; having these characteristics is  equivalent to having satisfied all of the stage 2 and 3 core elements and  many of the stage 4 and 5 elements.", "For stage 2 core elements, FAA reports that it has allocated adequate  resources, and it has established a project office and assigned a chief  architect. However, the agency has not satisfied several of the stage 2 core  elements that are critical to effective architecture management. For  example, the agency has not established a committee or group representing  the enterprise to guide, direct, or approve the architecture. Having such a  corporate entity is critical to overcoming cultural resistance to using an  enterprise architecture. As previously stated, the absence of such an entity  increases the risk that the architecture will not represent a corporate  decision-making tool and will not be viewed and endorsed as an  agencywide asset.", "Concerning stage 3, FAA has not satisfied three of the six core elements.  For example, although the agency is developing architecture products, it  does not have a written and approved policy for architecture development.  Without such a policy, which, for example, identifies the major players in  the development process and provides for architecture guidance, direction,  and approval, FAA will be challenged in overcoming cultural resistance to  using an enterprise architecture and achieving agencywide commitment  and support for an architecture.", "The agency has not implemented any of the stage 4 core elements, but it  has implemented one core element\u2014architecture products are periodically  updated\u2014associated with stage 5 of our framework.

For example, the agency\u2019s strategic plan includes the goal  of having an approved enterprise architecture policy requiring the  development, maintenance, and implementation of an enterprise  architecture by September 2005, and the agency intends to establish a  steering committee.
