Alaska's requirements are similar to those of some states but less explicit than those of other states, which create a fixed obligation to fully restore the land according to specific requirements. Until the state of Alaska defines the condition in which it would like its lands returned, there is no way to accurately estimate the cost of dismantling and removing the infrastructure and restoring the disturbed land on Alaska's North Slope. Existing financial assurances, such as bonding requirements, ensure the availability of only a small portion of the funds that are likely to be needed to dismantle and remove the infrastructure used for oil industry activities and to restore state-owned lands.

This  sparsely settled area consists primarily of public lands owned by the  federal government, state government, and Alaska Native corporations. To  date, oil production activity has occurred mostly on state land and, to a  limited extent, on Alaska Native lands. In the next couple of years,  however, oil industry activity on federal lands adjacent to the state and  Alaska Native corporation lands is expected to move from the exploration  phase to the production phase. As of January 2002, only two companies\u2014 BP and Phillips Petroleum\u2014operate producing oil fields on the North  Slope. Several other large oil companies, including ExxonMobil, Anadarko,  and Chevron, among others, also have ownership interests in this  production under various collective operating agreements. Since the state  lands were opened to oil industry activities, oil companies, federal, state  and local governments have all shared in the profits. Once oil production  ceases, responsibility for determining to what extent oil companies will  have to dismantle and remove their production facilities and associated  roads, pipelines, and airstrips, and restore the disturbed lands is generally  divided among federal, state, and native entities, depending, in part, on who  owns the land."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Alaska\u2019s North Slope Is a Sensitive Environment", "paragraphs": ["Alaska\u2019s arctic coastal plain, often referred to as the \u201cNorth Slope,\u201d extends  from the foothills of the Brooks Range to the Arctic Ocean and from the  Canadian border to Point Hope (see fig. 3). Covering approximately 89,000  square miles, this area is the boundary of the North Slope Borough\u2014 geographically the largest local government unit in the United States. The  North Slope is also one of the least populated areas in the world, with a  total population of about 7,400\u2014of which almost 70 percent are native  Inupiat Eskimo. It is a harsh climate with winter temperatures as low as  \u201360O Fahrenheit and average annual wind speeds of 12 to 13 mph. For  almost 2 months during the arctic winter, the sun never rises above the  horizon. Snow generally remains on the ground until the beginning of June  and begins accumulating again in September. Annual precipitation is quite  low, averaging less than 5 inches per year.", "The North Slope coastal plain is a vast treeless expanse of tundra  vegetation. Many lakes, streams, and rivers are scattered across this  generally flat terrain, despite the limited precipitation. Because the entire  area is underlain by permafrost (permanently frozen subsoil), which allows  no water absorption, the surface consists mostly of wetlands (see fig. 4).  Accordingly, this area provides excellent habitat for a variety of wildlife,  especially large numbers of breeding migratory birds and caribou that calve  on the coastal plain. In addition, the immediate coastal area is inhabited by  an estimated 2,000 polar bears that spend most of their time feeding,  resting, and denning on the drifting ice pack in the Beaufort Sea.  Permafrost is vulnerable to surface disturbance because such disturbance  usually results in thawing and the subsidence and erosion of soil. Damage  due to surface disturbance is very difficult to reverse. In order to prevent  thawing of the permafrost and provide a stable foundation, any  development, such as roads, airstrips, and production facilities, must occur  on gravel fill that is laid down to a depth of about 6 feet."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Oil Industry Activity Occurs Primarily on State-Owned Lands", "paragraphs": ["The current mix of federal, state, and Alaska Native lands on the North  Slope evolved after Alaska achieved statehood in 1959. Before Alaska  obtained statehood, the federal government owned almost all the land. The  Alaska Statehood Act of 1958 gave the new state government the right to  claim land in the newly formed state. In 1964, the state selected, among  other areas, a corridor of federal land on the North Slope that was about  100 miles wide. On the basis of geophysical surveys, this land was thought  to hold large oil deposits. In 1971, under the Alaska Native Claims  Settlement Act (ANCSA), the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation (ASRC)  claimed surface and subsurface mineral rights across the North Slope. In  addition, eight village corporations claimed surface lands surrounding their  villages. These claims resulted in Alaska Native corporation lands being  scattered across the North Slope.", "Soon after the state made its claims, it opened the North Slope lands to  commercial leasing for oil industry activities. At first, exploration yielded  only dry holes, but in 1968 Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO) and  Humble Oil (a predecessor of ExxonMobil Corporation) announced a  major oil find in the Prudhoe Bay area of the North Slope. A year later, the  companies announced plans to construct an 800-mile oil pipeline called the  Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS), which opened in 1977. The pipeline  is used to transport oil from Prudhoe Bay on the North Slope down the  length of the state to Valdez, where it is then carried by oil tankers to  markets primarily in the continental United States but also to other world  markets.", "The federal government retained ownership of the land on either side of the  state-owned lands on the North Slope; the National Petroleum Reserve- Alaska (NPR-A) lies to the west, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge  (Arctic Refuge or ANWR) lies to the east. Management of the NPR-A,  originally named the Naval Petroleum Reserve Number 4 Alaska, which is  roughly the size of Indiana, was transferred from the Navy to the  Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in 1977. In  1980, the Congress granted the Secretary of the Interior the authority to  lease land in the NPR-A for oil and gas exploration. While the BLM issued  some leases in the early 1980s, almost no exploration occurred. It was not  until leases were issued under the 1998 Integrated Activity  Plan/Environmental Impact Statement that the most current oil exploration  in the NPR-A was initiated. In 2001, Phillips Petroleum and Anadarko  announced the discovery of likely commercial quantities of oil in the  NPR-A.", "The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was created in 1960, enlarged in 1980,  and currently includes 19 million acres. In 1980, the Congress passed the  Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA), which  designated about 8 million acres of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as  wilderness and as such prohibited oil industry activities. However, the  coastal plain area of the refuge was not designated as wilderness. This area,  known as the \u201c1002 Area\u201d after section 1002 of the Alaska National Interest  Lands Conservation Act, was set aside for special study which would allow  the Congress to subsequently decide whether to permit oil and gas industry  activities, designate the area as wilderness, or make no changes. The  Congress is currently debating the future status of this area.", "The extent of North Slope industry activities has grown progressively since  the first oil was discovered there in 1968. Figure 5 shows the current range  of growth, which originally centered on Prudhoe Bay, the largest oil field  (as measured by volume) in North America. As exploration has yielded  additional finds, the network of wells, roads, pipelines, and production  facilities has expanded from the border of the NPR-A almost to the border  of the Arctic Refuge. As a result, state lands on the North Slope now  contain a web of industrial complexes spread across 1,500 square miles of  state and native lands.", "A complete inventory of current North Slope infrastructure is not available.  However, using information obtained from BP, the state, and data in a  recent environmental impact statement (EIS), we identified the following  infrastructure of wells, pipelines, roads, and facilities as presented in  table 1 below.", "North Slope oil production is organized by units, which are a collection of  leases. Each unit has a cooperative plan for oil exploration, development,  and operation within a geographic area covering one or more oil fields. The  reason for organizing leases owned by different companies into a unit is to  prevent waste and enhance oil recovery. Within each unit one leaseholder  is designated as the unit\u2019s operator and is responsible for all oil production  activities in the unit. The operator of a unit conducts oil field operations on  behalf of leaseholders and is responsible for field operations, maintenance,  and any current (but not future) DR&R expenses. As of 2001, two firms\u2014 BP and Phillips Petroleum\u2014were performing most North Slope oil  exploration and production activities. These two companies are also the  only two operators of oil-producing units on the North Slope. ExxonMobil  is the operator of the Point Thomson unit, but as of January 2002 that unit  was not in production.

The nation  has benefited from North Slope oil production in terms of jobs, corporate  taxes, and royalties provided by oil and associated companies, and a  reduction in oil imports and the balance of trade deficit. One estimate,  made by a consulting firm hired by the oil companies, attributed $40 billion  in federal taxes and rents collected between 1977 and 1999 to North Slope  oil production.", "The state of Alaska collects petroleum-based revenues from North Slope oil  production and transportation in a variety of taxes (principally corporate  income, severance, and property), royalty payments (generally 12.5 percent  of the value of the oil), and bonuses and rents from oil leases. Because of  the state\u2019s oil revenues, residents of Alaska pay no state income tax or state  sales taxes. Oil revenues also fund about 80 percent of the state\u2019s general  fund operating budget. In addition, in 1980, using mostly oil revenues, the  state was able to establish a permanent fund that provides an annual  dividend payment to every state resident.", "The North Slope Borough, the local municipality, also uses revenues from  North Slope oil production to fund its government services. Oil companies  pay nearly all of the borough\u2019s property taxes and provide about 60 percent  of borough revenues. A recent study developed by the Bureau of Land  Management for the renewal of federal rights-of-way for the Trans-Alaska  Pipeline System (TAPS) estimates that if the pipeline closed, the borough  would lose almost $1.9 billion (1998 dollars) in property tax revenues for a  30-year period starting in 2004.", "According to an analysis done by Alaska\u2019s Department of Revenue, for the  fiscal year period 1988 through 2000 accounting profits (i.e., all returns on  investment) for North Slope oil are split 41.6 percent to industry, 36.1  percent to the state, and 22.3 percent to the federal government. A number  of other studies support the level of revenues accumulated by industry, the  state, and the federal government. For example, a 1989 state- commissioned study found that for the period 1969 to 1987 oil companies  generated $42.6 billion in net profits after taxes on total gross revenues of  $131 billion from the production and transportation of North Slope oil. The  study estimated a similar split in accounting profits for this earlier period of  44 percent for industry, 30 percent to the state, and 26 percent to the  federal government."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Dwindling Production Focuses Greater Attention on the Disposition of Oil Company Infrastructure on the North Slope", "paragraphs": ["The production of oil on the North Slope peaked in 1988 at 2 million barrels  per day. By 1999, production had fallen to 1.1 million barrels per day, or  about 16 percent of total U.S. production. Total production on the North  Slope through 2000 was 13.3 billion barrels, while another 6.1 to 13.3 billion  barrels of technically recoverable oil from known and undiscovered  sources remain on the North Slope, according to the Department of  Energy. As a result of declining production on state lands, efforts to  develop federal lands on the North Slope have intensified.", "Overall production on the North Slope will most likely continue to decline  even as new fields are brought on line. According to the U.S. Department of  Energy, most North Slope oil has already been produced. The remaining life  of existing North Slope oil fields will depend partly on future economic  factors. As oil fields age, the per-barrel cost to extract additional oil  increases as each barrel requires greater effort to extract. Oil companies  will continue to produce oil from a field only as long as it is profitable and  will normally stop producing before an oil field is completely depleted.  Because the cost of transporting oil from the North Slope tends to be  higher than oil produced elsewhere in the United States, North Slope fields  must produce at a lower cost to remain competitive. The amount of oil that  can be produced at a profit, known as proven reserves, integrally depends  on the market price for the oil and its cost to produce. These two variables,  the price and cost, change over time. If the price of oil increases or new  technology makes extraction less costly, the amount of economically  recoverable oil will increase. Conversely, if the price of oil decreases or the  cost of oil production increases, the amount of economically recoverable  oil will decrease.", "The Trans-Alaska Pipeline is an additional and unique limiting factor in the  North Slope\u2019s oil production. TAPS carries all North Slope oil field  production and requires a minimum amount of oil flow to make it  economical to operate. While the exact minimum operating level for TAPS  depends on the mechanics of pumping decreasing quantities of oil through  the pipeline, the cost to operate TAPS, and the market price of oil, currently  the U.S. Department of Energy estimates the volume to be roughly 300,000  barrels per day. Once North Slope production falls below the minimum  economic operating level, producing oil on the North Slope will no longer  be profitable and TAPS will be shut down. Recent proposals to build a  natural gas pipeline from the North Slope could additionally extend the  projected life of North Slope fields because many of the existing fields  contain considerable natural gas reserves.", "In May 2001, the Department of Energy updated its estimates of North  Slope production based on current production, undiscovered reserves, and  future NPR-A production. These estimates exclude any production from  the Arctic Refuge or the development of natural gas reserves. The new  estimates, as shown in figure 6, have North Slope production falling below  the TAPS minimum operating level of 300,000 barrels per day sometime  between 2017 and 2031. In their application for lease renewal, the owners  of TAPS anticipate that the pipeline will operate at least through 2034."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Dismantlement and Removal of Infrastructure and the Restoration of Land Involves Many Agencies at Multiple Levels of Government", "paragraphs": ["The end of oil and gas production on the North Slope will likely render  much of the current infrastructure of production facilities, pipelines, and  roads unnecessary. Responsibility for regulating and overseeing the  dismantlement and removal of this infrastructure and restoring the land on  which it was built will be the shared responsibility of the state, federal, and  local governments, depending in part on which party owns the land.", "Oil production requires the construction of a considerable infrastructure  of, among other things, drilling pads, production facilities, pipelines, roads,  airstrips, and gravel mines. Because most of this infrastructure has been  built on state lands, the state is primarily responsible for regulating oil  industry activity, including any requirements for dismantling and removing  the infrastructure and restoring the land after oil production ceases.  However, new oil production in the Arctic Ocean, combined with new oil  discoveries in the NPR-A and the potential opening of the Arctic Refuge to  oil exploration, has elevated the importance of federal jurisdiction on the  North Slope.", "Alaska\u2019s regulation of dismantlement, removal, and restoration for the  North Slope oil industry is principally divided among four state agencies:   the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (AOGCC), the Alaska  Department of Natural Resources (ADNR), the Alaska Department of  Environmental Conservation (ADEC), and the Alaska Department of Fish  and Game. The Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission issues  permits for drilling oil wells throughout Alaska, regardless of land  ownership. AOGCC is primarily concerned with maintaining the subsurface  integrity of oil fields during exploration and production and the proper  plugging and abandoning of wells after their use. The Alaska Department of  Natural Resources leases state lands for oil and gas industry activities and  collects royalties on oil and gas production in the state. Such leases  stipulate how the land will be returned to the state after production ceases.  In addition, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, which  regulates waste management practices at exploration, development, and  production facilities on private, state, and federal lands, and the  Department of Fish and Game, which oversees habitat issues, have a  limited and principally advisory role in regard to DR&R.", "Municipal government and Alaska Native corporations also have control  over oil activities on the North Slope. The North Slope Borough, which  encompasses all of the North Slope, has zoning authority over industry  activities on non-federal lands on the North Slope. In addition, the borough  is consulted under the Coastal Zone Management Act for development on  federal lands. Alaska Native regional and village corporations own  significant portions of surface and subsurface rights on the North Slope.  These rights were the result of claims made under the Alaska Native Claims  Settlement Act of 1971. In particular, the Arctic Slope Regional  Corporation, a Fortune 500 Alaska Native corporation, owns 5 million acres  of surface lands and subsurface mineral rights on the North Slope. In  addition, eight Alaska Native village corporations own surface lands  surrounding their villages on the North Slope. For example, the Kuukpik  Village Corporation owns 146,000 acres of surface lands near the village of  Nuiqsut on the Colville River, site of the Alpine oil field (Colville River  Unit).", "Several federal agencies also have responsibility for regulating oil activities  on the North Slope. The Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land  Management (BLM) manages the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska and  also issues and oversees leases for oil activities on any federal lands. The  Department of the Interior\u2019s Minerals Management Service (MMS)  regulates oil activities on the Outer Continental Shelf, defined as 3 or more  miles from shore. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issues permits for  dredging or fill activities in U.S. waters, including wetlands. Almost the  entire North Slope is designated wetland and, because gravel underlies  most production facilities, airstrips, and roads, the Corps has a permitting  role in basically all oil company construction activities. Interior\u2019s Fish and  Wildlife Service (FWS), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and  the Department of Commerce\u2019s National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS)  can offer advisory comments to the Corps as part of the permit evaluation  process. Further, the EPA also has veto authority over Corps permits. In  addition, should the Congress decide to authorize oil industry activities in  the Arctic Refuge, the FWS would oversee the issuance of right-of-way  permits, while BLM would issue and oversee the federal leases. This  regulatory construct assumes that the Arctic Refuge would be managed  similarly to other refuges; various bills introduced in the 107th Congress to  open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas development were unclear on FWS\u2019s  role and regulatory authority."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, the Ranking Minority  Member of the House Resources Committee, and Representative Edward  Markey asked us to examine dismantlement, removal, and restoration  requirements for Alaska\u2019s North Slope.

Of these authorities, section  404 of the Clean Water Act, which allows for the placement of fill or  dredged material, such as gravel for the construction of roads, pads, and  airstrips, is the most common type of permit that the Corps issues in the  North Slope. The Corps\u2019 DR&R requirements are contained in its permits as  a general condition, which states that upon abandonment, the Corps \u201cmay  require restoration of the area.\u201d The level of restoration that may be  required is not specified in Corps regulations nor is it generally specified in  the permit. Corps of Engineers officials noted that Corps permits are issued  for all types of operations involving wetlands throughout the United States.  As such, they indicated that their permits\u2019 general restoration language  provides more flexibility to adapt the level of restoration to site-specific  needs. Corps officials told us that specific restoration requirements, such  as gravel removal upon abandonment of a site, are generally not  appropriate, but may be warranted under special circumstances. In these  instances, specific restoration requirements are established as special  conditions to the permit. For example, the permit for the placement of  gravel in the Alpine oil field in the Colville River Unit contains special  conditions specifying areas where the permittee will remove the gravel,  rehabilitate the gravel footprint area, and restore the hydrology of the  project area upon abandonment. For other permits, when special  circumstances do not occur, Corps officials stated that restoration  requirements are better determined at the time of abandonment. The Corps  was unable to determine how many of its more than 1,100 North Slope  permits carried special conditions regarding dismantlement, removal, and  restoration, though officials estimated that less than 1 percent of all their  permits contained such conditions.", "In addition to the permit itself, the Corps can also incorporate DR&R  requirements into abandonment plans. The Corps requires permit holders  to submit an abandonment plan when an oil company is planning to  abandon a site. As of May 2001, only seven abandonment plans have been  submitted, five of these stemming from offshore oil industry activities.  According to Corps officials, the initial requests for abandonment plans do  not contain minimum restoration requirements. Corps officials noted,  however, that approved plans do contain site-specific restoration  requirements. For abandonment of offshore facilities, such as gravel  islands, removal of gravel would likely only be required if the gravel were  found to be contaminated. For such projects in deep water, the  abandonment requirements call for the removal of gravel bags used for  erosion protection, removal of all hardware, plugging the well, and  allowing the gravel island to erode naturally into the sea.", "Corps of Engineers officials stated that the landowners or land manager  should bear the primary responsibility for establishing DR&R  requirements. In the case of current oil production on the North Slope, the  landowner is the state of Alaska. Corps officials state that the Corps  typically works with the state to determine appropriate dismantlement,  removal, and restoration requirements and generally accepts the state\u2019s  recommendations, provided that important aquatic resources are protected  and there are no overriding factors of national public interest. For example,  the Corps approved the abandonment of several offshore exploratory  islands that were subject to state leases and state-imposed DR&R  requirements. Alaska\u2019s Department of Natural Resources established the  DR&R requirements for the oil companies: plugging and abandoning the  wells, removing all equipment, and allowing the gravel islands to erode  naturally.

Although both BLM and MMS have the  authority to ensure that full funding be available for restoration activities,  only MMS has implemented a general bonding structure that provides for  higher bond amounts as the scope of oil industry activity increases. The  Corps has not required any financial assurance that funds will be available  to conduct DR&R requirements as part of its permit process on the North  Slope.", "In the NPR-A, the Bureau of Land Management requires oil companies to  post a bond for oil activities conducted on federally leased land. BLM  bonds are used to ensure compliance with all the terms of the lease,  including the payment of rentals and royalties and the performance of  DR&R. Specifically, BLM requires a minimum bond of $100,000 per lease, or  a $300,000 bond for all leases a company holds in the NPR-A, or a rider  upgrading a nationwide bond to $300,000. Currently, most companies  operating in the NPR-A have nationwide bonds; these bond amounts will  only cover a small fraction of the potential future DR&R liability.", "Although BLM has the authority to require full financial assurance to fund  the cost of DR&R, it has not yet done so. According to BLM officials, its  current bond amounts are not intended to cover the full cost of future  restoration activities, but instead serve as an assurance of performance.  Generally, BLM officials in Alaska do not believe it necessary for major oil  companies operating in the NPR-A to provide full financial assurance that  they will comply with their lease requirements, including DR&R. BLM  officials noted that these companies are large international firms whose  future business depends on the successful completion of all lease  requirements and whose total assets will easily cover the full cost of DR&R.  BLM\u2019s field manager in Alaska stated that when the companies go from  exploration to production in the NPR-A, BLM plans to determine whether  the existing bonding amounts are adequate. At that time, if BLM deems it  necessary, it can increase the required bond amounts. In addition, this  official noted that if a large company sells its NPR-A interests to a smaller  firm, BLM would again review the need to increase bond amounts.", "In national wildlife refuges, BLM also issues leases for oil exploration,  development, and production activities and requires companies to post a  bond. FWS may require additional bonding from companies operating in a  wildlife refuge as part of a right-of-way permit. Specifically, in wildlife  refuges, BLM requires a minimum bond amount of $10,000 per lease,  $25,000 for a statewide bond, or $150,000 for a nationwide bond. In  addition, if oil companies\u2019 activities such as the construction of roads or  pipelines disturb refuge lands outside the BLM leased area, FWS requires  the companies to post bonds as part of the process to obtain right-of-way  permits. The amounts of these bonds vary according to the scope and  type of activity. FWS does not prescribe a set amount for the bond.  According to an FWS official in Alaska, in the limited instances where FWS  has required bonds, the bonds have not exceeded $150,000. FWS officials  stated that they believe neither BLM\u2019s nor FWS\u2019s bonding requirements are  sufficient to cover the potential cost of future land restoration.", "Some of the bills recently considered by Congress regarding the opening of  the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas development also address the financial  assurance issue. For example, S. 388 included a bonding requirement to  ensure the financial responsibility of the lessee. Specifically, the Senate bill  required the Secretary of the Interior to establish bonding requirements \u201cto  ensure the complete and timely reclamation of the lease tract and the  restoration of any lands or surface waters adversely affected by lease  operations after the abandonment or cessation of oil and gas operations on  the lease.\u201d The bonding arrangement in S. 388 would have been in addition  to any existing bonding requirements that could be applied by the federal  agency or agencies responsible for managing oil industry activities in the  Arctic Refuge. Under S. 388, the Secretary of the Interior, in accordance  with an approved exploration or development and production plan, would  determine the specific amount of the bond or financial arrangement. In  contrast, H.R. 4 didn\u2019t address financial assurances or contain provisions  for bonding. Under this bill, bonding requirements for the Arctic Refuge  could be the same as those authorized for other refuges. As previously  discussed, requiring the minimum BLM and FWS bond amounts would not  be sufficient to cover the potential cost of future land restoration.", "MMS has the authority to require companies conducting operations in  federally regulated waters to provide full financial assurance that funds will  be available to conduct dismantlement, removal, and restoration activities.  MMS\u2019s bonding requirements for its offshore leases on the Outer  Continental Shelf are based on an escalating scale and depend on what  activity is occurring. Specifically, MMS regulations state that every owner  of an OCS oil and gas lease must maintain a $50,000 lease bond or a  $300,000 area-wide bond for all oil and gas leases in the state. The intended  purpose of these bonds is to ensure compliance with all the terms and  conditions of the lease. In addition, if exploration or development and  production activities occur, MMS requires total bond amounts to increase  to $200,000 and $500,000, respectively. Furthermore, under MMS  regulations, the regional director has the authority to require additional  bonding if a determination is made that additional financial assurances are  needed to cover potential underpayment of royalties or obligations to  remove infrastructure, such as drilling platforms, and clear the seafloor of  obstructions. According to MMS officials, the complete bonding package is  intended to cover the delinquent royalties, abandonment, and final site  clearance and takes into account, among other things, the company\u2019s  experience and financial viability, as well as  the estimated future cost of  restoration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Previously Abandoned Oil Exploration Sites on Federal Lands Remain a Problem", "paragraphs": ["The history of oil industry activities on federal lands of the North Slope  demonstrates the importance of adequate financial assurances for the  taxpayers. The federal government\u2019s oil exploration activities on the North  Slope have resulted in its current DR&R responsibility for many improperly  abandoned well sites. These well sites are now commonly known as legacy  wells. Starting in 1945 and continuing through 1981, the U.S. Navy and the  USGS drilled 126 wells in the area now known as the NPR-A. According to  BLM, the federal government is currently responsible for the cleanup of 102  of these wells. Ownership of the other 24 wells was transferred to the  North Slope Borough to assist in gas production for local use. According  to BLM, of the 102 wells, the Navy drilled 76 of them in the 1940s and 1950s,  and drilled a single well in 1975 that was properly plugged and abandoned.  The USGS was responsible for drilling the remaining 25 wells. According to  BLM, 3 of the 25 USGS wells have been properly plugged and abandoned, 1  has not been properly plugged and abandoned, and USGS is currently using  21 for climate studies. According to USGS, these study wells are extremely  valuable for long-term climate information and should remain unplugged.  As a result of inadequate dismantlement and restoration requirements,  about 80 wells drilled on federal lands under the federal government\u2019s  direction remain improperly plugged and abandoned.", "The federal government is responsible for cleaning up the improperly  abandoned wells and drill sites. In 1976, the Navy initiated a cleanup  program for its own well sites, which USGS assumed in 1977. In later years,  USGS assumed responsibility for cleaning up both the Navy\u2019s and its own  sites. Although no precise records exist, during a 7-year period the agencies  collected and removed thousands of tons of debris and over 50,000 55- gallon drums, at a cost of over $7 million (late 1970s and early 1980s  dollars) from NPR-A sites. Additionally, in 1995, the state\u2019s Department of  Environmental Conservation decided that no further cleanup work was  required on 27 NPR-A drilling waste sites to reduce their risk to the area\u2019s  surface waters. However, according to BLM officials, most of the  abandoned wells and surrounding sites still need additional work,  including the proper plugging of wells and restoration of the surface area.  The officials also noted that some of these legacy wells have leaked oil, gas,  and other substances, and have the potential to create a future  environmental hazard. However, remote locations and severe weather  make it difficult to access the well sites and very expensive to reclaim  them. For example, in 1999, BLM authorized a study of the cost to properly  plug and abandon 11 Navy well sites in the Umiat area of the NPR-A. The  contractor conducting the study estimated the cost to be almost $7 million.  However, in 2001, when the Corps of Engineers approved the plugging and  surface remediation of 2 of the 11 Umiat well sites under an existing  contract, the total cost had escalated to about $16 million. According to the  Corps, this cost escalation was caused primarily by increases in the cost of  accessing the area, unanticipated problems with plugging one of the wells,  and an increase in the amount of surface that needed to be rehabilitated.  Further insights on the cost of cleaning up of these old well sites are  provided in a September 2001 BLM draft internal working document. The  document estimates that just plugging the wells in NPR-A will cost more  than $100 million over the course of 10 to 20 years.", "Another example of an abandoned site on federal land is at Sagwon,  Alaska. Sagwon served as an oil company aviation base and staging area. It  was built in the 1960s and was used commercially until the mid-1970s.  However, it was not until 1975 that the owner obtained a lease from BLM to  operate an airport on the property. In 1985, after the site had been  abandoned, BLM approached the lessee, asking it to remove roughly 4,500  metal drums and several tons of scrap metal, clean up unused drilling  fluids, and remove other miscellaneous debris left on the site. The lessee  refused and later filed for bankruptcy. In 1993, BLM asked oil companies  that may have used the airfield to help clean up the site. In response, BP,  ARCO, and Alyeska (TAPS\u2019s operating company) voluntarily agreed to  clean up the 2,500-acre site. According to BP officials, by the time the  cleanup was finished in 2000, it cost $2 million to complete and required  the removal of 138 tons of waste from the site.

To date, most  oil production has occurred on state-owned land, and for this reason the  state of Alaska has borne responsibility for cleaning up these sites when oil  companies or their related industries have failed to do so. However, with oil  exploration activities underway in the NPR-A and on the Outer Continental  Shelf, and the Congress currently debating whether to open the Arctic  Refuge\u2019s coastal plain to oil and gas development activities, the need for  federal dismantlement, removal, and restoration requirements, and  assurances that funds will be available to implement those requirements, is  becoming increasingly important. Presently, the Bureau of Land  Management has not established specific DR&R requirements for oil  production activities in the NPR-A. In addition, its current minimum bond  amounts are fixed, do not reflect differences in company experience and  financial viability, and would only cover a fraction of the potential future  cost of DR&R. Furthermore, since the Congress has not yet authorized oil  and gas industry activities in the Arctic Refuge, neither the Bureau of Land  Management nor the Fish and Wildlife Service has developed specific  DR&R requirements for the refuge. The Fish and Wildlife Service, like the  Bureau, uses bond amounts that are not sufficient to meet the potential  future cost of restoration.

What  remains to be done is for the Bureau to establish specific DR&R  requirements that will allow companies to meet that goal. Should the  Congress decide to open the Arctic Refuge to oil industry activities, it  would be important for the Congress to consider establishing a legislatively  mandated restoration goal for the disturbed area. This would allow the  Secretary of the Interior to establish specific DR&R requirements aimed at  meeting that goal. In turn, specific requirements would provide oil  companies with another piece of information they need to make better  investment decisions on whether the potential benefits of oil industry  activities in the Arctic Refuge are worth the cost. Goals, like all plans, can  change over time. However, if a restoration goal for the Arctic Refuge is not  established before oil exploration begins, there will only be continued  debate similar to that faced by the state of Alaska on its restoration  requirements for state-owned land on the North Slope.

The state points out in its own comments that both oil  companies and environmentalists, two groups that are usually opposed,  would prefer to know what restoration activities the state has planned for  the North Slope because each currently perceives a risk that their view of  the appropriate level of DR&R may not be adopted by the state in the  future.  By recommending the establishment of restoration goals for federal  lands prior to the start of oil and gas activities, it is our intent to alleviate  such concerns and allow all interested parties the opportunity to make  informed decisions on these matters before the land is used.  Further,  establishing goals prior to oil and gas activities would provide for greater  transparency and allow for agreements to be reached on what restoration  will be required.", "The Department of the Interior also agreed with our recommendation that  the Bureau of Land Management review its existing financial assurances  for oil and gas activities in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska to  determine if they are adequate to ensure that funds will be available to  achieve its overall restoration goal.
