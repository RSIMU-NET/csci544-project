The agency has operated without a strategic plan since October 2002, and although SAMHSA officials are drafting a plan, they do not know when it will be completed. SAMHSA developed long-term goals and a set of priority issues that provide some guidance for the agency's activities, but they are not a substitute for a strategic plan. In particular, they do not identify the approaches and resources needed to achieve the agency's long-term goals and the desired results against which the agency's programs can be measured. SAMHSA also has not fully developed strategies to ensure it has the appropriate staff to manage the agency's programs. Although the proportion of SAMHSA's staff eligible to retire is increasing, the agency has not developed a detailed succession strategy to prepare for the loss of essential expertise and to ensure that the agency continues to have the ability to fill key positions. In addition, the proposed performance partnership grants will change the way SAMHSA administers its largest grant programs, but the agency has not completed hiring and training strategies to ensure that its workforce will have the skills needed to administer the grants. Finally, SAMHSA's system for evaluating staff performance does not distinguish between acceptable and outstanding performance, and the agency does not assess staff performance in relation to specific competencies--practices that would help reinforce individual accountability for results. SAMHSA has opportunities to improve its partnerships with state and community-based grantees. For example, grantees objected to SAMHSA's practice of rejecting discretionary grant applications that do not comply with administrative requirements--such as those that exceed page limitations--without reviewing them for merit. Rejecting applications solely on administrative grounds potentially prevents SAMHSA from supporting the most effective programs. SAMHSA's recent changes to the review process should reduce such rejections, but have not eliminated them. State officials are also concerned that SAMHSA has not finalized the performance data that states would be required to report under the proposed performance partnership grants. To comply, states will need to change their data systems, but they cannot complete these changes until SAMHSA finalizes the requirements. The Congress directed SAMHSA to submit a plan by October 2002 describing the final data reporting requirements and any legislative changes needed to implement the grants, but SAMHSA has not yet completed the plan. This delay could prevent the agency from meeting its current timetable for implementing the mental health and substance abuse performance partnership grants in fiscal years 2005 and 2006, respectively."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Mental illness and substance abuse are major national problems.

In  response to a requirement in the Children\u2019s Health Act of 2000, SAMHSA  is developing plans to transform its current block grants. The new grants\u2014 performance partnership grants\u2014would give states greater flexibility in  how they spend funds, while holding them more accountable for achieving  specific results.

(See table 1 for a description of each center\u2019s  purpose.) The centers receive support from SAMHSA\u2019s Office of the  Administrator; Office of Program Services; Office of Policy, Planning, and  Budget; and Office of Applied Studies. The Office of Program Services  oversees the grant review process and provides centralized administrative  services for the agency; the Office of Policy, Planning, and Budget  develops the agency\u2019s policies, manages the agency\u2019s budget formulation  and execution, and manages agencywide strategic and program planning  activities; and the Office of Applied Studies gathers, analyzes, and  disseminates data on substance abuse practices in the United States,  which includes administering the annual National Survey on Drug Use and  Health\u2014a primary source of information on the prevalence, patterns, and  consequences of drug and alcohol use and abuse in the country.", "In fiscal year 2003, SAMHSA\u2019s staff totaled 504 full-time-equivalent  employees, a decrease from 563 in fiscal year 1999. Thirteen of the  employees were in the Senior Executive Service, and the average grade of  SAMHSA\u2019s general schedule workforce was 12.5\u2014up from 11.7 in fiscal  year 1999. In addition, 25 of the employees were members of the U.S.  Public Health Service Commissioned Corps. SAMHSA\u2019s program staff are  almost evenly divided among its three centers (see fig. 1), and all are  located in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area.", "SAMHSA\u2019s budget increased from about $2 billion in fiscal year 1992 to  about $3.1 billion in fiscal year 2003. SAMHSA uses most of its budget to  fund grant programs that are managed by its three centers. (See fig. 2.) In  fiscal year 2003, 68 percent of SAMHSA\u2019s budget funded the Substance  Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant ($1.7 billion) and the  Community Mental Health Services Block Grant ($437 million). The  remaining portion of SAMHSA\u2019s budget primarily funded other grants;   $74 million (2.4 percent) of its fiscal year 2003 budget supported program  management."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Administration of SAMHSA\u2019s Block and Discretionary Grants", "paragraphs": ["SAMHSA\u2019s major activity is to use its grant programs to help states and  other public and private organizations provide substance abuse and  mental health services. For example, the substance abuse block grant  program gives all states a funding source for planning, carrying out, and  evaluating substance abuse services. States use their substance abuse  block grants to fund more than 10,500 community-based organizations.  Similarly, the mental health block grant program supports a broad  spectrum of community mental health services for adults with serious  mental illness and children with serious emotional disorders.", "In December 2002, SAMHSA released for public comment its initial  proposal for how it will transform the substance abuse and mental health  block grants into performance partnership grants. In administering the  block grants, the agency currently holds states accountable for complying  with administrative and financial requirements, such as spending a  specified percentage of funds on particular services or populations.  According to SAMHSA\u2019s proposal, the new grants will give states more  flexibility to meet the needs of their population by removing certain  spending requirements. At the same time, the grants will hold states  accountable for achieving specific goals related to the availability and  effectiveness of mental health and substance abuse services. For example,  SAMHSA has proposed that it would waive the current requirement that a  state use a certain percentage of its substance abuse block grant funds for  HIV services if that state can show a reduction of HIV transmissions  among the population with a substance abuse problem. The Children\u2019s  Health Act of 2000 required SAMHSA to submit a plan to the Congress by  October 2002 describing the flexibility the performance partnership grants  would give the states, the performance measures that SAMHSA would use  to hold states accountable, the data that SAMHSA would collect from  states, definitions of the data elements, obstacles to implementing the  grants and ways to resolve them, the resources needed to implement the  grants, and any federal legislative changes that would be necessary.", "In addition to the block grants that SAMHSA awards to all states, the  agency awards grants on a competitive basis to a limited number of  eligible applicants. These discretionary grants help public and private  organizations develop, implement, and evaluate substance abuse and  mental health services. In fiscal year 2003, the agency funded 73  discretionary grant programs, the largest of which was the $98.1 million  Children\u2019s Mental Health Services Program. This program helps grantees  integrate and manage various social and medical services needed by  children and adolescents with serious emotional disorders.", "Discretionary grant applications submitted to SAMHSA go through several  stages of review. When SAMHSA initially receives grant applications, it  screens them for adherence to specific formatting and other  administrative requirements. Applications that are rejected\u2014or screened  out\u2014at this stage receive no further review. Applications that move on are  reviewed on the basis of their scientific and technical merit by an initial  review group and then by one of SAMHSA\u2019s national advisory councils.  The councils, which ensure that the applications support the mission and  priorities defined by SAMHSA or the specific center, must concur with the  scores given to the applications by the initial review group. On the basis of  the ranking of these scores given by the peer reviewers and on other  criteria posted in the grant announcement, such as geographic location,  SAMHSA program staff decide which grant applications receive funding.  Center directors and grants management officers must approve award  decisions that differ from the ranking of priority scores, and SAMHSA\u2019s  administrator approves all final award decisions.", "SAMHSA\u2019s oversight of its block and discretionary grants consists  primarily of reviews of independent audit reports, on-site reviews, and  reviews of grant applications. SAMHSA\u2019s Division of Grants Management  provides grant oversight, which includes reviewing the results of grantees\u2019  annual financial audits that are required by the Single Audit Act. In  general, these audits are designed to determine whether a grantee\u2019s  financial statements are fairly presented and grant funds are managed in  accordance with applicable laws and program requirements. Furthermore,  SAMHSA is statutorily required to conduct on-site reviews to monitor  block grant expenditures in at least 10 states each fiscal year. The  reviews examine states\u2019 fiscal monitoring of service providers and  compliance with block grant requirements, such as requirements to  maintain a certain level of state expenditures for drug abuse treatment and  community mental health services\u2014referred to as maintenance of effort.  In addition, SAMHSA project officers\u2014grantees\u2019 main point of contact  with SAMHSA\u2014monitor states\u2019 compliance with block grant requirements  through their review of annual block grant applications. For example, in  the substance abuse block grant application, states report how they spent  funds made available during a previous fiscal year and how they intend to  obligate funds being made available in the current fiscal year; project  officers review this information to determine if states have complied with  statutory requirements. For discretionary grants, project officers monitor  grantees\u2019 use of funds through several mechanisms, including quarterly  reports, site visits, conference calls, and regular meetings. The purpose of  monitoring both block and discretionary grants is to ensure that grantees  achieve program goals and receive any technical assistance needed to  improve their delivery of substance abuse and mental health services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Federal Agencies and Departments That Collaborate with SAMHSA", "paragraphs": ["SAMHSA has partnerships with every HHS agency and 12 federal  departments and independent agencies that fund substance abuse and  mental health programs and activities.

For example, when SAMHSA develops grant programs  to increase substance abuse treatment capacity\u2014a priority issue\u2014staff  are to consider the priority principle of how the programs can be  implemented in rural settings. To ensure that the priority issues play a  central role in the work of its three centers, SAMHSA established work  groups for all the priority issues that include representation from at least  two centers. The work groups are to make recommendations to SAMHSA\u2019s  leadership about funding for specific programs and to develop cross- center initiatives.", "Although SAMHSA officials consider the agency\u2019s set of priority issues and  priority principles a valuable planning and management tool, it lacks  important elements that a strategic plan would provide.

Without a  strategic plan that includes the expected results against which the  agency\u2019s efforts can be measured, it is unclear how the agency or the  Congress will be able to assess the agency\u2019s progress toward achieving its  long-term goals or the adequacy and appropriateness of SAMHSA\u2019s grant  programs. Such assessments would help SAMHSA determine whether it  needs to eliminate, create, or restructure any grant programs or activities.  The priority issue work groups are developing multiyear action plans that  could support SAMHSA\u2019s strategic planning efforts, because the plans are  expected to include measurable performance goals, action steps to meet  those goals, and a description of external factors that could affect program  results.

These efforts  should help respond to the block grant reengineering team\u2019s finding that  project officers require additional training in substance abuse prevention  and treatment and block grant program requirements. They should also  help address the concerns of state officials who told us that project  officers for the block grants have not always had sufficient background in  mental health or substance abuse services or have provided confusing or  incorrect information on grant requirements. For example, one state  received conflicting information from its project officer about the  percentage of its substance abuse block grant that it was required to spend  for HIV/AIDS services.

On March 4, 2004,  SAMHSA announced revised requirements that are intended to simplify  and expedite the initial screening process for discretionary grants. For  example, SAMHSA will no longer automatically screen out applicants  because their application is missing a section, such as the table of  contents. Instead, the agency will consider whether the application  contains sufficient information for reviewers to consider the application\u2019s  merit.

SAMHSA asked states to voluntarily  report on performance measures related to these outcomes in their fiscal  year 2004 block grant applications and the agency provided states with  funding to help them make needed changes to their data collection and  reporting systems. Over fiscal years 2001 and 2002, SAMHSA awarded 3- year discretionary grants of about $100,000 per year to state mental health  and substance abuse agencies to develop systems for collecting and  reporting performance data.

Furthermore, while SAMHSA is in the process of  implementing its strategic workforce plan, the agency\u2019s workforce  planning efforts lack important elements\u2014such as a detailed succession  strategy\u2014to help SAMHSA prepare for future workforce needs. Because  future retirements and attrition could leave the agency without the  appropriate workforce to effectively carry out its programs, it would be  prudent for SAMHSA to have a succession strategy to help it retain  institutional knowledge, expertise, and leadership continuity.", "In addition, SAMHSA has not completed plans to ensure that its workforce  has the appropriate expertise to manage the proposed performance  partnership grants, which would represent a significant change in the way  SAMHSA holds states accountable for achieving results.

In addition,  the plan\u2019s information on the performance measures SAMHSA will use to  hold states accountable is needed by the states as they prepare to report  required performance data.
