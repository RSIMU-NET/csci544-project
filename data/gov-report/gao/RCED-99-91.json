Its 58 field offices assess financial penalties against storeowners who violate program regulations. In addition, federal, state, and local court actions can result in financial penalties against storeowners. Storeowners violate the program\u2019s requirements when they accept food stamps for nonfood items such as paper towels, accept food stamp benefits when they are not authorized to participate in the program, or traffick in food stamp benefits. FNS\u2019 seven regional offices are responsible for collecting the financial penalties and related interest charges, which are recorded as debts in FNS\u2019 accounting records.", "The states are responsible for handling the day-to-day operation and management of the program, including conducting such duties as certifying the eligibility of individuals or households to participate in the program, delivering benefits to recipients, and monitoring recipients\u2019 compliance with the program\u2019s requirements.", "Recipients use food stamp coupons or an electronic benefits transfer card to pay for allowable foods. Food stamp electronic systems use the same electronic fund transfer technology that many grocery stores use for their debit card payment systems. After a food stamp recipient receives a card and a personal identification number, the recipient purchases food by authorizing the transfer of the food stamp benefits from a federal account to a retailer\u2019s account. At the grocery checkout counter, the recipient\u2019s card is run through an electronic reader, and the recipient enters a personal identification number to access the food stamp account.", "The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 mandates that all states implement electronic benefits transfer systems by October 1, 2002, unless the USDA waives the requirement. As of October 1998, 26 states had implemented electronic systems statewide. Additionally, the District of Columbia is operating a District-wide electronic system. The remaining states are in various stages of implementing electronic systems. Collectively, electronic systems supplied about 47 percent of all food stamp benefits in 1998.", "Federal agencies\u2019 debt collection policies, practices, and procedures are based on legislation, regulations, and direction from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The principal statutes are the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, the Debt Collection Act of 1982, and the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996.

For example, two field offices further analyzed the data and took administrative action to penalize offending storeowners. However, four of the other five offices were not sure what to do with the data, and they either forwarded the report to the Compliance Branch or took no action at all. In the fifth office, the state was not using an EBT system. For example, the head of a field office told us that one monthly report indicated that over 100 of the stores in her area were probably engaged in trafficking, but she lacked the resources to further analyze the data on any of these stores and take action against them. Furthermore, FNS has no feedback system to inform headquarters of how many of the stores on the list of likely traffickers were actually reviewed in detail.

They noted that low collection rates reflect, among other things, (1) problems in locating storeowners that have been removed from the Food Stamp Program; (2) a lack of information relating to court-ordered restitution and unauthorized retailer/wholesaler debts; and (3) the refusal of some storeowners to pay their debts. We have revised the report to recognize such difficulties but continue to believe that weak debt collection practices also contribute to low collection rates.", "Second, agency officials questioned the extent to which fully implementing federal debt collection practices and procedures would significantly increase debt collections. In related concerns, FNS officials noted that the draft report did not compare FNS\u2019 performance in managing debt to other federal agencies\u2019 performance nor did it identify instances in which actual debt could have been collected and FNS failed to do so. Concerning the former, an analysis of FNS\u2019 relative performance was not within the scope of our work, nor would it have changed our basic conclusions and recommendations.

Because of the quality control program operated by FNS and our review of past financial reports conducted by U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Office of Inspector General, we accepted FNS\u2019 computerized debt collection data as reliable.", "To identify FNS\u2019 procedures and practices for assessing financial penalties against storeowners for program violations, we interviewed and obtained information from FNS officials in headquarters and in seven field offices\u2014Chicago and Springfield, Illinois; Columbia, South Carolina; Columbus, Ohio; Los Angeles and Sacramento, California; and Tallahassee, Florida. We reviewed (1) FNS legislation and guidelines relating to assessments, (2) the use of Office of Inspector General and FNS Compliance Branch investigation reports in the assessment process, and (3) 259 case files to determine the extent to which assessments were made by FNS staff.", "To identify the procedures and practices followed by FNS in collecting financial penalties levied against storeowners, we interviewed and obtained information from FNS officials in headquarters and three FNS regional offices\u2014Midwest, Southeast, and Western. We selected these regions because they had the best and worst debt collection ratios in relation to total storeowner debt and had the largest accounts receivable balances. We analyzed various FNS reports on debt collections for fiscal year 1993 through fiscal year 1998. We also reviewed (1) FNS\u2019 guidelines and practices for debt collection and (2) the Debt Collection Act of 1982, as amended; the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996; Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-129; and the Federal Claims Collection Standards. We also discussed debt collection management activities with officials of the departments of Agriculture, Justice, and the Treasury.", "Since the focus of this work was on assessing and collecting financial penalties, we did not evaluate the merits of FNS\u2019 reductions of financial penalties through adjustments, waivers, or write-offs. However, we did note and report that FNS had old uncollectible debts that it had not written off in a timely manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Resources, Community, and Economic Development Division, Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": ["Ron E.
