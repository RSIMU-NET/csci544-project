For example, in January 2012, GAO reported that TSA faced challenges developing and meeting key performance requirements for the acquisition of advanced imaging technology (AIT)--i.e., full-body scanners. Specifically, GAO found that TSA did not fully follow Department of Homeland Security (DHS) acquisition policies when acquiring AIT, which resulted in DHS approving nationwide AIT deployment without full knowledge of TSA's revised specifications. DHS required TSA to notify DHS's Acquisition Review Board (ARB) if AIT could not meet any of TSA's five key performance parameters or if TSA changed a key performance parameter during testing. However, GAO found that the ARB approved TSA for full-scale production without reviewing the changed parameter. DHS officials said that the ARB should have formally reviewed this change to ensure that TSA did not change it arbitrarily. GAO recommended that TSA develop a road map that outlines vendors' progress in meeting all key performance parameters. DHS agreed, and developed a road map to address the recommendation, but faces challenges implementing it--e.g., due to vendor delays. Additionally, in January 2013, GAO reported that TSA faced challenges related to testing and deploying passenger screening canine teams. Specifically, GAO concluded that TSA began deploying these canine teams to airport terminals in April 2011 prior to determining the canine teams' operational effectiveness. In June 2012, DHS and TSA began conducting operational assessments to help demonstrate canine teams' effectiveness. Also, TSA began deploying teams before it had completed an assessment to determine where within the airport the canine teams would be most effectively utilized. GAO recommended that on the basis of DHS assessment results, TSA expand and complete testing to assess the effectiveness of canine teams in areas of the airport deemed appropriate. DHS agreed and officials said that as of April 2013, TSA had concluded testing in collaboration with DHS of canine teams in airport sterile areas--in general, areas of an airport for which access is controlled through screening of persons and property--and is testing teams on its own in airport sterile and public areas.", "DHS has some efforts under way to strengthen its oversight of component investment and acquisition processes, but additional actions are needed. In September 2012, GAO reported that while DHS had initiated efforts to address the department's acquisition management challenges, most of DHS's major acquisition programs continue to cost more than expected, take longer to deploy than planned, or deliver less capability than promised. GAO identified 42 DHS programs that experienced cost growth, schedule slips, or both, with 16 of the programs' costs increasing from a total of $19.7 billion in 2008 to $52.2 billion in 2011--an aggregate increase of 166 percent. GAO concluded that DHS recognized the need to implement its acquisition policy more consistently, but that significant work remained. GAO recommended that DHS modify acquisition policy to better reflect key program and portfolio management practices and ensure acquisition programs fully comply with DHS acquisition policy. DHS agreed, and in September 2012 officials stated that it was in the process of revising its policy to more fully reflect key program management practices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO has made recommendations to DHS and TSA in prior reports to help strengthen its acquisition processes and oversight.

TSA\u2019s acquisition programs represent  billions of dollars in life cycle costs and support a wide range of aviation  security missions and investments, including technologies used to screen  passengers, checked baggage, and air cargo, among others. For  example, technologies used to screen passengers include advanced  imaging technology (AIT), commonly referred to as full-body scanners,  that screen passengers for metallic and nonmetallic threats such as  weapons, explosives, and other objects concealed under layers of  clothing, and passenger screening canines trained to detect explosives  being carried or worn by passengers. In addition, technologies used to  screen checked baggage include explosives detection systems (EDS),  which use X-rays with computer-aided imaging to automatically measure  the physical characteristics of objects in baggage.

TSA stated that AIT provides enhanced security  benefits compared with walk-through metal detectors, such as enhanced  detection capabilities for identifying nonmetallic threat objects and liquids.  In July 2011, TSA began installing ATR software on deployed AIT  systems designed to address privacy concerns by eliminating passenger- specific images. As of May 2013, TSA had deployed about 750 AIT  systems to more than 200 airports, most of which were equipped with  ATR software. In January 2012, we issued a classified report on TSA\u2019s  procurement and deployment of AIT that addressed the extent to which  (1) TSA followed DHS acquisition guidance when procuring AIT and (2)  deployed AIT units are effective at detecting threats. Pursuant to the FAA  Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, TSA was mandated to ensure  that all AIT systems used to screen passengers are equipped with and  employ ATR software by June 1, 2012.

Senior TSA officials acknowledged that TSA did not  comply with the directive\u2019s requirements, but stated that TSA still reached  a \u201cgood decision\u201d in procuring AIT and that the ARB was fully informed of  the program\u2019s changes to its key performance parameters. Further, TSA  officials stated that the program was not bound by AD 102 because it was  a new acquisition process and they believed that the ARB was not fully  functioning at the time. DHS officials stated that the ARB discussed the  changed key performance parameter but did not see the documents  related to the change and determined that TSA must update the  program\u2019s key acquisition document, the Acquisition Program Baseline,  before TSA could deploy AIT systems. However, we concluded that,  according to a February 2010 acquisition decision memorandum from  DHS, the ARB gave approval to TSA for full-scale production without  reviewing the changed key performance parameter. DHS officials stated  that the ARB should have formally reviewed changes made to the key  performance parameter to ensure that TSA did not change it arbitrarily.  According to TSA, it should have submitted its revised requirements for  approval, but it did not because there was confusion as to whether DHS  should be informed of all changes.

To help  ensure that TSA\u2019s checked baggage-screening machines are operating  most effectively, we recommended that TSA develop a plan to deploy  EDSs that meet the most recent explosive detection requirements  established in 2010 and ensure that new machines, as well as machines  already deployed in airports, will be operated at the levels established in  those requirements. DHS concurred with our recommendation and has  begun taking action to address it. Specifically, in April 2012, TSA reported  that it had awarded contracts to vendors to implement detection upgrades  across the currently deployed EDS fleet to meet the 2010 requirements.

In January 2013, we found that TSA began deploying  passenger screening canine teams to airport terminals in April 2011 prior  to determining the teams\u2019 operational effectiveness. According to TSA  officials, operational assessments did not need to be conducted prior to  deployment because canines were being used to screen passengers by  other entities, such as airports in the United Kingdom. In June 2012, the  DHS Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) and TSA began  conducting operational assessments to help demonstrate the  effectiveness of passenger screening canine teams. We recommended  that on the basis of the results of DHS\u2019s assessments, TSA expand and  complete operational assessments of passenger screening canine teams,  including a comparison with conventional explosives detection canine  teams before deploying passenger screening canine teams on a  nationwide basis to determine whether they are an effective method of  screening passengers in the U.S. airport environment, particularly since  they cost the federal government more than TSA\u2019s conventional canine  teams.screening canine teams before it had completed an assessment to   Additionally, we found that TSA began deploying passenger  determine where within the airport (i.e., the public, checkpoint, or sterile  areas) the teams would be most effectively utilized.

In January 2012, we found that TSA did not have clear plans to  require AIT vendors to meet milestones used during the AIT acquisition.  On the basis of our findings, we recommended that TSA develop a road  map that outlines vendors\u2019 progress in meeting all key performance  parameters because it is important that TSA convey vendors\u2019 progress in  meeting those requirements and full costs of the technology to decision  makers when making deployment and funding decisions. While TSA  reported that it hoped vendors would be able to gradually improve  meeting key performance parameters for AIT over time, we concluded  that TSA would have more assurance that limited taxpayer resources are  used effectively by developing a road map that specifies development  milestones for the technology and having DHS acquisition officials  approve this road map. DHS agreed with our recommendation and has  taken actions to address it. For example, in February 2012, TSA  developed a road map that specifies development and deployment  milestones, including the addition of ATR to existing deployed systems,  continued development of enhanced detection capabilities, and  acquisition plans for the next generation of AIT systems (AIT-2). In July  2012, DHS acquisition officials reviewed the AIT road map. However, on  the basis of our preliminary observations from our ongoing work  conducted in March 2013, we found that TSA has fallen behind schedule  as outlined in the AIT road map to install ATR software upgrades to  existing deployed AIT systems because of one of the vendors\u2019 inability to  develop this software in time for the installation of ATR software on all  units by June 2013. TSA subsequently decided to terminate its contract  with this vendor and remove all deployed units from airports. TSA has  also fallen behind schedule as outlined in the AIT road map to acquire  and test AIT-2 systems because of vendors\u2019 inability to provide required  documentation verifying that contractual requirements have been met and  the units are ready to begin testing. Although TSA updated the AIT road  map in October 2012, it subsequently missed some of the key deadlines  specified in the updated version as well.

In July 2011, we found that TSA had established a schedule for the  acquisition of EDS machines but it did not fully comply with leading  practices, and TSA had not developed a plan to upgrade its EDS fleet to  meet the current explosives detection requirements. These leading practices state that the success of a large-scale system acquisition, such  as TSA\u2019s EDS acquisition, depends in part on having a reliable schedule  that identifies when the program\u2019s set of work activities and milestone  events will occur, amongst other things. However, we reported that the  schedule for the EDS acquisition is not reliable because it does not reflect  all planned program activities and does not include a timeline to deploy  EDSs or plans to procure EDSs to meet subsequent phases of explosive  detection requirements. On the basis of our findings, we concluded that  developing a reliable schedule would help TSA better monitor and  oversee the progress of the EDS acquisition. DHS concurred with our  recommendation to develop and maintain a schedule for the entire  Electronic Baggage Screening Program in accordance with the leading  practices we identified for preparing a schedule. In July 2011, DHS  commented that TSA had already begun working with key stakeholders to  develop and define requirements for a schedule and to ensure that the  schedule aligns with the best practices we outlined.

Moreover, we reported that DHS leadership has  authorized and continued to invest in major acquisition programs even  though the vast majority of those programs lack foundational documents  demonstrating the knowledge needed to help manage risks and measure  performance. For example, we found that DHS leadership\u2014through the  Investment Review Board or its predecessor body, the ARB\u2014has  formally reviewed 49 of the 71 major programs.

We  recommended that DHS modify acquisition policy to better reflect key  program and portfolio management practices and ensure acquisition  programs fully comply with DHS acquisition policy. DHS concurred with  our recommendations and reported taking actions to address some of  them. For example, in September 2012, DHS stated that it was in the  process of revising its policy to more fully reflect key program  management practices to enable DHS to more rapidly respond to  programs\u2019 needs by facilitating the development, approval, and delivery of  more specific guidance for programs.", "In March 2012, we found that to enhance the department\u2019s ability to  oversee major acquisition programs, DHS realigned the acquisition  management functions previously performed by two divisions within the  Office of Chief Procurement Officer to establish the Office of Program  Accountability and Risk Management (PARM) in October 2011. PARM,  which is responsible for program governance and acquisition policy,  serves as the Management Directorate\u2019s executive office for program  execution and works with DHS leadership to assess the health of major  acquisitions and investments. To help with this effort, PARM is developing  a database, known as the Decision Support Tool, intended to improve the  flow of information from component program offices to the Management  Directorate to support its oversight and management efforts. However, we  reported in March 2012 that DHS executives were not confident enough  in the data to use the Decision Support Tool to help make acquisition  decisions. On the basis of our findings, we concluded that DHS had  limited plans to improve the quality of the data because PARM planned to  check the data quality only in preparation for key milestone meetings in  the acquisition process. We reported that this could significantly diminish  the Decision Support Tool\u2019s value because users cannot confidently  identify and take action to address problems meeting cost or schedule  goals prior to program review meetings.", "In February 2013, we reported that DHS updated its Integrated Strategy  for High Risk Management in June 2012, which includes management  initiatives and corrective actions to address acquisition management  challenges, among other management areas. In the June 2012 update, DHS included, for the first time, performance measures and progress  ratings for all of the management initiatives. The June 2012 update also  identified the resources needed to implement most of its corrective  actions, although we found that DHS needs to further identify its resource  needs and communicate and mitigate critical gaps. On the basis of our  findings, we concluded that the strategy, if implemented and sustained,  will provide a path for DHS to be removed from our high risk list. Going  forward, DHS needs to continue implementing its Integrated Strategy for  High Risk Management and show measurable, sustainable progress in  implementing its key management initiatives and corrective actions and  achieving outcomes including those related to acquisition management.
