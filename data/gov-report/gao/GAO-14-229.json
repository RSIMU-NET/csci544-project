As required by the Fiscal Year 2013 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), both agencies determined that their organizational structures were effective, though State created a new regional Contract Management Office to better support contracting efforts in Iraq. In October 2013, State approved a number of actions to improve policies and procedures, including specific initiatives in acquisition planning and risk management, among others, and intends to institutionalize these changes in its Foreign Affairs Manual in 2014. State generally has not, however, developed plans to assess the impact of these initiatives. Federal internal control standards highlight the importance of managers comparing actual performance to expected results. Accordingly, continued management attention is needed to ensure that these efforts achieve their intended objectives. USAID focused its efforts on areas such as improving contractor performance evaluations and risk management. GAO found that some USAID missions and offices that operate in contingency environments have developed procedures and practices, but USAID did not consider whether these should be institutionalized agency-wide because USAID officials interpreted the legislative requirement to include only a review of agency-wide policies. As a result, USAID may have missed opportunities to leverage its institutional knowledge to better support future contingencies. USAID established a new working group in October 2013 to develop lessons learned, toolkits, and training and is expected to complete its efforts in late 2014. This working group could further assess the policies and procedures developed by the missions and offices, thus potentially affording USAID an opportunity to better leverage its institutional knowledge. State and USAID have increased their acquisition workforce by 53 and 15 percent, respectively, from their 2011 levels and are in various stages of assessing their workforce needs for overseas contingency operations. Per Office of Management and Budget guidance, both agencies identified competency and skill gaps for their acquisition workforce in their 2013 acquisition human capital plans. State's 2013 plan noted that in response to growth in contracting activity in areas such as Iraq and Afghanistan, additional acquisition personnel are needed. In October 2013, State's Under Secretary for Management approved the formation of a multibureau working group that plans to further explore workforce needs for current and future contingency operations. USAID's 2013 plan cited its greatest challenge as providing training for its acquisition workforce, as many personnel have 5 years or less of contracting experience. USAID established a training division in 2013 for its acquisition workforce. State noted in its Section 850 report that it will increase its focus on conducting risk assessments on the reliance, use, and oversight of contractors through the establishment of risk management staff. USAID's Section 850 report did not address reliance on contractors, but in October 2013, USAID drafted a revision to its planning policy that will require a risk assessment and mitigation plan associated with contractor performance of critical functions in overseas contingency operations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that State assess whether identified changes achieve intended objectives, and that USAID further assess contingency contracting related procedures and practices.

From fiscal years 2002 through  2013, these agencies reported combined obligations of approximately  $26 billion for contracts with a principal place of performance in either  country. GAO and others in the accountability community have raised  issues related to State and USAID\u2019s ability to manage and oversee  contract support in contingency operations. For example, weaknesses  have been noted such as limited involvement in acquisition planning,  collection and reporting of performance evaluations, and overreliance on  contractors. While State and USAID are transitioning to more traditional  diplomatic and assistance missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, the agencies  will continue to be called upon to operate in challenging overseas  environments. For example, State and USAID recently responded to  instability in South Sudan and Libya. In its 2010 Quadrennial Diplomacy  and Development Review, State noted that an expeditionary capacity to  address complex conflicts and crises must become part of the \u201cnew  normal\u201d for the department and its personnel. Within this context, section  850(a) of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year  2013 directed State and USAID to assess the agencies\u2019 organizational  structures, policies, and workforces related to contract support for  overseas contingency operations.", "Section 850(c) of the Fiscal Year 2013 NDAA mandated that we report on  the progress State and USAID have made in identifying and implementing  improvements in those areas.

We also reviewed  State and USAID\u2019s March 2013 acquisition human capital plans, which  included data on the composition of State and USAID\u2019s acquisition  workforces from fiscal years 2011 to 2013. We collected updated data on  State and USAID\u2019s acquisition workforces as of November 2013. We  used this information to describe characteristics of each agency\u2019s  acquisition workforce and, as such, did not assess the reliability of the  data. Further, we compared the areas identified by State and USAID as  needing changes with challenges previously identified by GAO and others  in the accountability community to determine the extent to which the  agencies are addressing these challenges. We also interviewed officials  at State and USAID in the United States and Afghanistan with related  program, acquisition, or workforce planning responsibilities to discuss the  process for identifying changes and the implementation status of  identified changes.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2013 to February 2014  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

For example, in its 2010  Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review, State noted that more  than 25 percent of State and USAID personnel serve in 30 countries  classified as high risk for conflict and instability, including Yemen,  Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, and Kyrgyzstan.

In our  reports issued annually between 2008 and 2011, we consistently found  that State and USAID lacked reliable data and systems to report on their  contracts and contractor personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan. Having  reliable data on contracts and contractor personnel is a starting point for  informing agency decisions and ensuring proper management. In 2012,  we reported that the agencies had made improvements to their contractor  personnel data and related systems that could result in more reliable  data, but data comparability across years and agencies was limited. We  also reported in 2012 that State had not assessed the skills and  workforce mix needed to meet future contracting requirements in Iraq and  Afghanistan. Further, we found that State had insufficient personnel with  the necessary expertise to conduct acquisition planning and oversight  functions to support the department\u2019s mission in Iraq, and, as a result,  relied on the Department of Defense (DOD) for acquisition support. We  also found weaknesses in USAID\u2019s oversight and monitoring of project  and program performance in Afghanistan. Specifically, we reported that  USAID did not consistently follow its established performance  management and evaluation procedures for Afghanistan agriculture and   USAID subsequently issued new guidance, approved a  water projects.new performance management plan, and took steps to improve its third- party monitoring of projects.", "Similarly, others in the accountability community have reported on the  acquisition challenges faced by State and USAID in contingency  environments.

State\u2019s Inspector General found that the department continued to face  challenges managing contracts and procurements, and reported that it  has identified instances in Iraq and Pakistan in which poor contract  monitoring resulted in increased costs and poor performance. Similarly,  USAID\u2019s Inspector General identified USAID\u2019s work in high-threat  environments such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, and South Sudan, as  one of the agency\u2019s most serious management challenges, in part due to  audits that disclosed weak contract management in these environments.  In addition, the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction and the  Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction have reported  on similar contracting issues. Further, the statutorily established  Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan made a  number of recommendations directed to State and USAID in its final  report, issued in 2011.
