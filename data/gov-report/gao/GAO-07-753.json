The availability of reduced Social Security benefits at age 62 provides an incentive to retire well before the program's age requirement for full retirement benefits; however, the gradual increase in this age from 65 to 67 provides an incentive to wait in order to secure full benefits. The elimination of the Social Security earnings test in 2000 for those at or above their full retirement age also provides an incentive to work. Medicare's eligibility age of 65 continues to provide a strong incentive for those without retiree health insurance to wait until then to retire, but it can also be an incentive to retire before the full retirement age. Meanwhile, federal tax policy creates incentives to retire earlier, albeit indirectly, by setting broad parameters for the ages at which retirement funds can be withdrawn from pensions without tax penalties. Nearly half of workers report being fully retired before turning age 63 and start drawing Social Security benefits at the earliest opportunity--age 62. Early evidence, however, suggests small changes in this pattern. Traditionally, some workers started benefits when they reached age 65. Recently, workers with full retirement ages after they turned 65 waited until those ages to start benefits. Also, following the elimination of the earnings test, some indications are emerging of increased workforce participation among people at or above full retirement age. GAO's analysis indicates that retiree health insurance and pension plans are strongly associated with when workers retire. After controlling for other influences such as income, GAO found that those with retiree health insurance were substantially more likely to retire before the Medicare eligibility age of 65 than those without. GAO also found that men with defined benefit plans were more likely to retire early (before age 62) than those without, and men and women with defined contribution plans were less likely to do so."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The first wave of the 78 million member baby boom generation is now  reaching retirement age. The number of people age 62, the earliest age of  eligibility for Social Security retired worker benefits, is expected to be 21  percent higher in 2009 than in 2008. In addition, by 2030, the number of  workers supporting each retiree is projected to be 2.2, down from 3.3 in  2006. This demographic shift poses challenges to the economy, federal tax  revenues, the nation\u2019s old-age programs, and individuals\u2019 financial security  in retirement. For those who are able to work longer, later retirement can  strengthen the economy and also retiree incomes by postponing the time  at which people will start drawing retirement benefits rather than working.  A wide range of factors including the features of employers\u2019 benefit plans,  personal finances, social norms, health, and individual attitudes influence  workers\u2019 decisions about when to retire. Federal policies may also play a  role: these include Social Security, Medicare, and tax policies related to  certain private retiree health and defined benefit (DB) and defined  contribution (DC) pension plans. Identifying both the incentives posed by  these policies and the extent to which workers respond to them can help  to inform policy makers as they consider ways to address the demographic  challenges facing the nation.", "To determine the extent to which federal policies\u2014directly and indirectly  \u2014pose incentives and are influencing individuals\u2019 decisions about the age  at which they retire, we have pursued the following questions: (1) What  incentives do federal policies provide about when to retire? (2) What are  the recent retirement patterns, and is there evidence that recent changes  in Social Security requirements have resulted in later retirements? (3) Is  there evidence that tax-favored private retiree health insurance and  pension benefits have influenced when people retire?", "We have prepared this report under the Comptroller General\u2019s authority to  conduct evaluations on his own initiative as part of a continued effort to  provide Congress with relevant information on the aging of the American  workforce.", "To identify which federal policies may influence the age at which workers  retire, we reviewed the relevant literature and interviewed agency experts.  To answer our second and third objectives, we used two main data  sources: (1) Social Security Administration (SSA) data and (2) longitudinal  data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) conducted by the  University of Michigan, which looks at the circumstances under which  recent retirees or people who are approaching retirement are making their  decisions to retire. We used the SSA data to determine when workers who  reached ages 66 through 71 in 2006 started drawing Social Security retired  worker benefits. We conducted various statistical analyses of the HRS  survey data to determine which factors were associated with decisions to  retire at early ages (before age 62) and decisions to retire at later ages (at  or after age 65). We focused on workers who were born from 1931 to 1941  (reaching age 62 at some point between 1993 and 2003) and who were in  the labor force when the HRS survey began in 1992. To select appropriate  variables to consider in our analyses, we reviewed relevant literature and  interviewed experts in the field. We conducted reliability assessments of  these data and found them to be sufficiently reliable for our study. As is  the case with most statistical analyses, our work is limited by factors such  as the unavailability of information and the inability to account for  influences that cannot be quantified or observed. In addition, our analysis  of the HRS survey, which includes only one cohort of workers, may not  apply to older or younger groups of workers. In different parts of our  analysis we considered workers to be retired based on four different  definitions:", "Reported retirement:  Workers who described themselves as  completely retired in response to HRS interviews.", "Full retirement:  Workers who described themselves as fully retired in  response to HRS interviews and who were no longer working for pay.", "Partial retirement:  Workers who described themselves as retired in  response to HRS interviews who were working part-time or for a  portion of the year.", "Social Security retirement:  Workers who received Social Security  retired worker benefits as indicated in Social Security administrative  data.", "These definitions can be used to examine different aspects of retirement  whether it be the decision to leave the workforce or the decision to start  drawing Social Security benefits. These definitions are not mutually  exclusive. For further discussion of these definitions of retirement and  details concerning our scope and methodology, see appendix I. We  conducted our work between July 2006 and June 2007 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Demographic Changes", "paragraphs": ["In the 21st century, older Americans are expected to make up a larger  share of the U.S. population, live longer, and spend more years in  retirement than previous generations. The share of the U.S. population age  65 and older is projected to increase from 12.4 percent in 2000 to 19.6  percent in 2030 and continue to grow through 2050. In part, this is due to  increases in life expectancy. The average number of years that men who  reach age 65 are expected to live is projected to increase from just over 13  in 1970 to 17 by 2020. Women have experienced a similar rise\u2014from 17  years in 1970 to a projected 20 years by 2020. These increases in life  expectancy have not, however, resulted in an increase in the average  number of years people spend in the workforce. While life expectancy has  increased, labor force participation rates of older Americans only began to  increase in recent years. As a result, individuals are generally spending  more years in retirement. In addition to these factors, fertility rates at  about the replacement level are contributing to the elderly population\u2019s  increasing share in the total population and a slowing in the growth of the  labor force. Also contributing to the slowing in the growth of the labor  force is the leveling off of women\u2019s labor force participation rate. While  women\u2019s share of the labor force increased dramatically between 1950 and  2000\u2014from 30 percent to 47 percent\u2014their share of the labor force is  projected to remain at around 48 percent over the next 50 years. While  hard to predict, the level of net immigration can also affect growth in the  labor supply. Taking each of these factors into account Social Security\u2019s  trustees project that the annual growth rate in the labor force, about 1.2  percent in recent years, will fall to 0.3 percent by 2022.", "The aging of the baby boom generation, increased life expectancy, and  fertility rates at about the replacement level are expected to significantly  increase the elderly dependency ratio\u2014the estimated number of people  aged 65 and over in relation to the number of people aged 15 to 64 (fig. 1).  In 1950, the ratio was 12.5 percent. It increased to 20 percent in 2000 and is  projected to further increase to 33 percent by 2050. As a result, there will  be relatively fewer younger workers to support a growing number of  Social Security and Medicare beneficiaries. The age at which workers  choose to retire has implications for these trends. If workers delay  retirement, the ratio of workers to the elderly will decrease more slowly.", "The aging of the population also has potential implications for the nation\u2019s  economy. As labor force growth continues to slow as projected, there will  be relatively fewer workers available to produce goods and services. In  addition, the impending retirement of the baby boom generation may  cause the net loss of many experienced workers and possibly create skill  gaps in certain occupations. Without a major increase in productivity or  higher than projected immigration, low labor force growth will lead to  slower growth in the economy compared with growth over the last several  decades and potentially slower growth of federal revenues. Social  Security\u2019s trustees project that real (inflation-adjusted) GDP growth will  subside from 2.6 percent in 2007 to 2.0 percent in 2040, in part due to  slower growth in the labor force. The prospect of slower economic growth  is likely to accentuate the pressures on the federal budget from growing  benefit claims and the shrinking proportion of workers to beneficiaries.   Later retirement and increases in labor force participation by older  workers could help diminish those pressures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Retirement Dynamics", "paragraphs": ["Retirement has traditionally been thought of as a complete one-time  withdrawal from the labor force. However, such transitions are no longer  as common. A recent study found that only half of first-time retirees fully  retired from the workforce and remained fully retired after 3 to 5 years.  The other half chose to partially retire by reducing their work hours or  taking bridge jobs\u2014transitional jobs between career work and complete  retirement\u2014or they re-entered the labor force after initially retiring.  According to our analysis of the HRS, about one in five workers who fully  retire later re-enter the workforce on at least a part-time basis sometime  over the next 10 years. There are various reasons behind these trends. In  some cases, older workers need the income or benefits a job provides; in  other cases, they wish to start a new career in a different field. With no  universal definition of retirement, researchers use different definitions  depending on their purpose. Since our focus is on labor force  participation, we are using definitions of retirement that combine whether  or not people say they are retired with measures of their labor force  participation.", "Workers have generally been retiring at younger ages over the last several  decades, but over more recent periods, retirement ages appear to have  stabilized. This finding holds for a variety of definitions of retirement.  Census Bureau data indicate that the average age at which workers left the  labor force dropped from about 71 and 70 years for men and women  respectively in 1960, to about age 65 for both men and women in 1990 (fig.  2). Since that time, retirement trends appear to have stabilized for men,  with their retirement occurring on average between 64 and 65. The  retirement age for women continued to decline. Similar trends appear in  the age at which workers start drawing Social Security benefits. From 1960  to 1990, the average age of workers starting to draw Social Security  benefits declined 3 years for men (from 66.8 to 63.7) and about 2 years for  women (from 65.2 to 63.5). Since 1990, these averages have changed little.  The averages were 63.7 years for men and 63.8 for women in 2005. In  addition, in the 2007 Retirement Confidence Survey, workers responded  on average that they planned to retire at age 65, up from age 62 in 1996.  We, along with others, have suggested that increasing labor force  participation for older workers could lessen problems for the economy  and the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, and boost income  security for retirees as well.", "Workers retire for a variety of reasons, some of which are under their  control while others are not. Some personal reasons for retiring include  workers\u2019 job situation, their financial situation, and social norms regarding  retirement. In addition, there are often factors outside of a person\u2019s  control that may lead to retirement. According to focus groups that we  conducted in 2005 with workers and retirees, we found that health  problems and layoffs were common reasons to retire and that few focus  group members saw opportunities to gradually or partially retire. Workers  also cited what they perceived as their own limited skills and employers\u2019  age discrimination as barriers to continued employment. Similarly to our  focus group results, the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI) found  that an estimated 37 percent of workers retire sooner than they had  expected. Of those, the most often cited reasons were health problems or  disability, changes at their company, such as downsizing or closure, or  having to care for a spouse or another family member. The role federal  policies play in influencing retirement behavior needs to be considered as  well. Depending on workers\u2019 circumstances, these policies can provide  incentives to retire at certain ages, and send signals or set norms about  when it is appropriate to retire. In addition, many employers have  structured their own retirement benefits, such as pension eligibility ages,  based on federal policies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Policies Provide Incentives for both Early and Late Retirement", "paragraphs": ["Federal policies present a mix of retirement incentives, some of which  encourage individuals to retire well before their Social Security full  retirement age and others that promote staying in the workforce. (See fig.  3 below.) The effect of these incentives also varies substantially with  personal circumstances. In general, the availability of Social Security  benefits at age 62 offers an incentive to retire before full retirement age,  though changes in program rules are progressively weakening that  incentive. The recent elimination of the Social Security earnings test for  those at full retirement age and beyond, which had formerly reduced  benefits for those beneficiaries who had earnings above a certain  threshold, also may discourage drawing benefits early. The fact that most  individuals are eligible for Medicare at age 65 generally deters them from  leaving the labor force before then, especially if they are not covered by  retiree health insurance. Federal pension tax policies give employers  discretion to set pension plan rules that provide incentives for many  workers to retire somewhat earlier than the norms established by Social  Security, often age 55, or in some cases earlier. However, these incentives  to retire early apply to fewer workers, due to the diminished prevalence of  DB plans."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Social Security Policies Provide Mixed Incentives, While Recent Program Changes Reward Later Retirement", "paragraphs": ["Several characteristics of the Social Security program\u2014including  eligibility ages and the earnings test\u2014provide incentives to retire at  different ages. The Social Security full retirement age, which has  traditionally been age 65, is gradually rising to 67. However, workers can  begin receiving reduced benefits at 62; benefits are progressively larger for  each month workers postpone drawing them, up to age 70. In general,  benefits are \u201cactuarially neutral\u201d to the Social Security program; that is,  the reduction for starting benefits before full retirement age and the credit  for starting after full retirement age are such that the total value of  benefits received over one\u2019s lifetime is approximately equivalent for the  average individual. However, Social Security creates an incentive to start  drawing early retirement benefits for those who are in poor health or  otherwise expect to have a less than average lifespan. If a worker lives  long enough\u2014past a \u201cbreak-even\u201d age\u2014he or she will receive more in life- long retired worker benefits by starting benefits at a later, rather than an  earlier date. (See figure 4 below for examples of the kinds of  considerations workers face in making a decision about when to begin  drawing Social Security benefits.)", "The increase in full retirement age and the larger penalty for early  retirement reduce the incentive to start drawing Social Security benefits  and retiring early. Because the early retirement age has remained fixed at  62 while full retirement age is gradually rising to 67, workers taking early  retirement benefits are progressively incurring bigger reductions. For  example, workers who reached 62 in 1999 and started drawing benefits  that year faced a reduction of 20 percent because their full retirement age  was 65. In contrast, workers drawing benefits when they turn 62 in 2022,  when their full retirement age will be 67, will face a 30 percent reduction.  On the other hand, workers with health problems may now have a greater  incentive to apply for Social Security Disability Insurance as these benefits  are not based on age.", "Social Security rules can pose different incentives for married workers  because their decision about when to start drawing benefits has important  implications for the surviving spouse. For example, if a retired worker  who is entitled to a larger benefit than his spouse starts drawing early  benefits and dies shortly thereafter, his widow may be left for many years  with a relatively small survivor benefit since her payment would be limited  to what he was receiving. This risk affects female survivors in particular.  Widow beneficiaries are one of the largest and most vulnerable groups  with a relatively high incidence of poverty.", "The Social Security earnings test gives some workers a disincentive to  earn more than a specified amount.  Because of the earnings test, people  collecting Social Security benefits before their full retirement age who  continue to work are subject to further reduction or withholding in their  benefits if they earn above a threshold. For example, in 2007, $1 of benefits  is withheld for every $2 of earnings over $12,960. Although early  beneficiaries generally recoup the amounts withheld because of the  earnings test in the form of higher recalculated benefits after they reach  full retirement age, workers typically view the earnings test as a tax on  work. As such, it provides an incentive to reduce the number of hours  worked or stop working altogether. Since 2000, beneficiaries who reach  their full retirement age are exempt from the earnings test. The elimination  of the test for these individuals is an incentive to start benefits at full  retirement age and continue working."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medicare\u2019s Age Requirement Generally Provides an Incentive Not to Retire Before 65", "paragraphs": ["Because Medicare provides health insurance coverage for virtually all  individuals 65 and older, it has important implications for the decision  about when to retire. The Medicare eligibility age, fixed at 65 since the  program\u2019s inception, is a strong incentive not to retire before that age,  particularly for people who do not have employer-sponsored health  benefits as retired workers. These individuals would either have to  purchase expensive private coverage if they retired before 65, or remain  uninsured until they qualify for Medicare because private health insurance  may be difficult to obtain at older ages, especially for those with pre- existing medical conditions. Given the steep rise in health care costs and  the high health risks older people face, Medicare\u2019s eligibility age  encourages them to delay retirement until age 65. Workers with no  employer-based health insurance during their working years are arguably  less affected by Medicare eligibility rules because their decision to retire  does not affect their health coverage. However, to the extent that they are  exposed to the same potentially expensive health problems as they get  older, Medicare does provide an incentive to postpone retirement until age  65 because retirement often involves a significant drop in income.", "The incentive posed by Medicare may become more important if the  proportion of workers with no retiree health insurance continues to  increase. The share of large private employers offering retiree health  insurance declined from an estimated 66 percent in 1988 to 35 percent in  2006. Similarly, a 2003 study found that only about one-quarter of private  sector employees worked for companies that offered retiree health  insurance. Further, the value of the coverage for retirees is eroding  because of higher costs, eligibility restrictions, and other benefit changes.  A recent study estimated that the percentage of after-tax income spent on  health care by the typical older married couple will almost double from 16  percent in 2000 to 35 percent in 2030.", "On the other hand, Medicare\u2019s availability at 65 can be an incentive to  retire before Social Security\u2019s rising full retirement age.

For example, IRS  rules on tax-qualified pensions put an upper limit on what may be treated  as a \u201cnormal retirement age\u201d (NRA). For a DB plan, this can be no greater  than age 65. In practice, some employers have set their NRA lower.", "According to the Department of Labor\u2019s 2003 National Compensation  Survey, 17 percent of private workers with DB plans had an NRA less than  65 and 6 percent had no age requirement. Many workers with DB plans  could retire with reduced benefits at age 55. IRS rules also state that  payouts with specified minimum amounts must generally begin by about  age 70 \u00bd. Additionally, tax rules generally permit withdrawals without  penalty from both DB and DC plans (including IRAs) as early as age 59 \u00bd.  Exceptions to this rule allow for even earlier withdrawals. For example,  participants can access their funds without penalty beginning at age 55 if  they leave their current employer. Workers taking distributions prior to  age 59 \u00bd may do so without the tax penalty if they receive the distribution  in the form of a fixed annuity.  For those who are no longer working for  the plan\u2019s sponsor, tax law generally requires at a minimum that such a  series of payments begin at about age 70 \u00bd at the latest or that they receive  a lump sum payment of the entire amount. If a plan participant is working  for the plan sponsor at age 70 \u00bd the required distributions must generally  begin in the calendar year in which he or she stops working for the  employer maintaining the plan.", "Workers who have employer-sponsored pension plans from their current  employer constitute only about half of full-time private sector workers.  Employers have increasingly shifted from traditional DB to DC pension  plans. Specifically, in 1992, about 29 percent of heads of household had a  DB plan; by 2004, the figure had dropped to 20 percent. Over this same  period, the proportion of household heads with DC plans increased from  about 28 percent to 34 percent.", "As the prevalence of DC plans has increased relative to DB plans, workers  face a different set of incentives. The benefits of a worker covered by a  DB plan often reach their high value when the worker attains a specific  age, and as a result, may offer little incentive to work past that age. The  predetermined retirement benefit generally depends on years of service  and wages or salaries, and changes little after its peak value, especially if  subsequent salary increases are not substantial. Additional years of work  after the NRA, often age 65 for private sector workers in 2003, do not  necessarily change lifetime retirement benefits because of the shortened  retirement period. (See table 1 for an example showing the effect of  another year of work with a hypothetical DB pension.)", "With DC plans, benefit levels depend on total employer and employee  contributions and investment earnings; as such, DC plans do not offer the  same age-related retirement incentive as DB plans. Individuals typically  allocate the balance of their DC accounts among bonds, stocks, and  money market funds, bearing all of the investment risks. In addition, since  at retirement most DC plans allow people to receive the accumulated  value of the funds in their account as a lump sum, individuals also bear the  risk of outliving their resources. The fact that different people will make  different contribution and investment decisions is likely to lead to a  greater variability in retirement ages. (See table 2 below for an example  showing the effect of another year of work on lifetime benefits with a DC  pension.)", "While a DB pension plan generally does not encourage continued work  after a certain age, recent changes in DB pension provisions have created  an incentive to remain in the workforce somewhat longer.  First, recent  IRS regulations permit workers to receive money from their DB plans  while still working after they have reached the plan\u2019s NRA.  These  regulations also include rules restricting a plan\u2019s NRA. Those reaching a  plan\u2019s NRA or age 62 who want to reduce the number of hours they work  for a particular employer may be able to do so and at the same time  receive prorated pension benefits. As a result, these workers are able to  ease out of their jobs while maintaining their previous level of income by  combining paycheck and pension. The new provisions are likely to  encourage longer careers by formally allowing more flexible work  arrangements and the opportunity to gradually transition into retirement  rather than make a sudden shift. By comparison, participants in DC plans  can often begin receiving their pension at age 59 \u00bd while continuing to  work (if allowed by their plan administrator), so they often face fewer  limitations to phased retirement."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Half of Workers Retire Well before Their Full Retirement Age, Although Early Evidence Points to Some Changes Following Recent Implementation of Social Security Policies", "paragraphs": ["About half of those in the HRS study group reported being fully retired by  the time they reached age 63, and over the last several years SSA data  indicate that nearly half started drawing benefits at age 62 and 1 month,  their earliest opportunity to do so.

After controlling for other  factors associated with retirement, one study concluded that the labor  force participation rate among those 65 to 69 increased by 0.8 to 2  percentage points and that earnings for this group increased. The authors  hypothesized that this increase resulted from the retention of older  workers who were still in the workforce instead of attracting retirees to  return to work. This study also found that applications for Social Security  benefits among individuals at ages 65 or above increased and that earnings  for this group increased as well. A second study also concluded that the  elimination of the earnings test had increased labor force participation  among older workers, and that there was some indication that  participation rates among younger workers increased in anticipation of  this policy change. A third study found that men aged 66 to 69 had an  increase in annual earnings of $1,326 following the earnings test  elimination. This study did not find that labor force participation  increased overall, but rather that the hours per week worked by men  increased.

In deciding  when to retire, workers weigh their personal circumstances, the features  of employers\u2019 benefit plans as well as the mix of incentives and  disincentives posed by federal policies. Some of these policies encourage  earlier retirement; others encourage later retirement; and different groups  of workers face differing incentives. While preliminary evidence indicates  that some workers subject to full retirement ages after their 65th birthday  are drawing Social Security benefits a little later and working more after  age 65 than their predecessors, more time is needed to determine whether  these changes foretell any substantial shifts. With so many factors  influencing workers\u2019 decisions about when to retire, changes may be  gradual and limited. Moreover, changes made to one program have the  potential to create an inconsistent set of incentives. For example, as Social  Security\u2019s full retirement age rises to age 67, Medicare\u2019s eligibility age  remains at 65. Medicare\u2019s eligibility age may become increasingly  important in workers\u2019 decisions about when to retire as the availability of  employer-sponsored retiree health insurance declines.", "In recent years, federal policy makers have considered various options to  modify policies in hopes of promoting later retirements and continued  work in later years.

At the same time, trends in employer- provided retirement benefits have clear implications for workers\u2019  retirement decisions. Our results suggest that with declining access to  retiree health insurance and DB pension plans, those individuals who can,  may indeed choose to work longer. This trend suggests the need for  federal initiatives to help support workers who make that choice. These  may include policies that encourage employers to hire or retain older  workers and provide them with flexible options for continued work. In  addition, there will be a continued need for federal policies to ensure that  workers are informed about the advantages of continued work, as well as  to protect and support those who, due to poor health or disability, are  unable to work at older ages.", "Given the increased pressures that demographic shifts will place on  entitlement programs, the mix of incentives offered by programs such as  Social Security and Medicare, as well as pension law, becomes more  questionable.

We restricted our  attention to workers who had been in the labor force for at least 10 years  prior to age 62.

In addition, we excluded  those individuals who were not part of the labor force in the first wave of  data collection (1992); see comparison of samples in appendix I.", "The HRS dataset is a longitudinal dataset, meaning there are multiple  observations per respondent.  Respondents were interviewed every 2  years.  Each observation is called a wave. In our data set there were seven  waves of data (1992 to 2004).  For our analysis we limited the data set to  one observation per respondent.  We selected the observation by taking  the first wave the respondent was noted as retiring in the age specific  analysis (62 and 65).  If the respondent did not retire in that time frame, we  selected the wave closest to when the participant was age 62 or 65.  For  each observation we calculated an age of retirement if the respondent  noted that he or she retired. For example, if the respondent noted retiring  in wave five and reported a retirement date that fell between waves four  and five, we used the reported retirement date as the age of retirement and  used wave 4 responses in our analysis.  However, if the respondent did not  report a retirement date or if the retirement date did not fall between two  previous waves of data collection and the current wave, then we imputed  the retirement date using the midpoint between the waves.  For example,  if a respondent noted retiring in wave six but did not report a retirement  date and had data for wave five we imputed their age of retirement as the  midpoint between wave five and six.  For those respondents who did not  retire by the specified age used in our analyses (by age 62 or by age 65),  we used their age at the end of the interview to select the observation  closest to that specified age.", "These restrictions meant we had samples of 2,840 men and 2,519 women in  our analyses of whether retirement occurred by age 62, and 1,978 men and  1,779 women in our analyses of whether retirement occurred by 65.  It  should be noted that the sample sizes represent unweighted samples.  Our  samples differed slightly from the overall HRS sample (see appendix 1 for  comparison).    The data are from a complex sample, and all analyses were  performed using statistical weights and adjusting the standard errors for  the sample design.  Only respondents with statistical weights greater than  zero were included in the analyses (based on HRS documentation for  statistical weights).  The (weighted) percentages reported in some of the  tables of this appendix do not exactly match what would be derived from  the (unweighted) numbers reported.", "The factors or independent variables we considered in the two sets of  analyses are shown in table 7, along with the unweighted numbers and  weighted percentages of men and women in each category of those  factors.  These factors included selected demographic characteristics,  including occupation, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, age  difference with spouse, income (specifically earnings), work tenure, and  birth year.  Occupation was divided into three categories:  white collar,  services, and blue collar.  White collar included managerial, professional,  sales, clerical, and administrative support occupations.  Services included  cleaning business services, protection, food preparation, health services,  and personal services.  Blue collar included farming, forestry, fishing,  mechanics and repair, construction and extraction, precision production,  operators, and members of the armed forces.  We based these categories  on a previous GAO report that utilized the HRS data. The income  variable\u2014the respondent\u2019s earned income\u2014was adjusted for inflation  using CPI values to make all dollars comparable to 2003 dollars.  The  factors also included a general measure of health status, an indicator of  whether health limited the ability to work, and measures indicating  whether the workers in our sample had any health insurance.  In addition,  we considered whether the spouse or respondent had retiree health  insurance, a DB plan, and a DC plan.  For many of our variables, we lagged  them to the prior wave to capture workers\u2019 preretirement characteristics.   For example, if the respondent is noted as retiring in wave 4, the income  variable from wave 3 was used in the regression.  If the prior wave was  missing, that respondent was not included in the analysis.  For all of the  lagged variables the data collected from 2 years prior was used in the  analysis (the HRS respondents were interviewed every two years). Table 7  also shows the numbers and percentages of men and women who had and  had not retired by ages 62 and 65.  An estimated 25 percent of the men and  28 percent of the women in our sample had retired by age 62, and of those  who had reached age 65 by 2004, an estimated 48 percent of the men and  53 percent of the women had retired.  The following results are based on  our full retirement definition (see appendix I for definition of full  retirement).", "We used bivariate (one variable) and multivariate (multiple variables)  logistic regression models to estimate the likelihood of men and women  being retired, first at age 62 and then at age 65. Logistic regression is a  widely accepted method of analyzing dichotomous outcomes\u2014variables  with two values such as retired or not\u2014when the interest is in determining  the effects of multiple factors that may be related to one another. While it  is somewhat more common to consider how different categories of  workers differ in their likelihoods of being retired by calculating and  comparing differences in the percentages of retired and non-retired  workers across categories, the use of these models in our analysis requires  us to express differences in the likelihoods of being retired using odds  ratios.  An \u201codds ratio\u201d is generally defined as the ratio of the odds of an  event occurring in one group compared to the odds of it occurring in  another group\u2014the reference group. While odds and odds ratios are  somewhat less familiar than percentages and percentage differences, they  have certain advantages, and can be readily derived from the underlying  percentages or from the numbers from which those percentages were  calculated.  Moreover, odds ratios are amenable to a reasonably simple  interpretation, as we show in Table 8. In addition, unadjusted and adjusted  odds ratios are the parameters that underlie our logistic regression  models.", "Table 8 shows the numbers and percentages of men who were retired by  age 62, first across marital status categories, and then across categories  defined by race/ethnicity. Typically we would compare groups by  contrasting the percentages of retired or not retired individuals in each  group and noting, in this case for example, that the percentage of  individuals retired by age 62 is greater among unmarried men (30.1  percent) than married men (23.3 percent), and lower for Hispanic men  (17.4 percent) than for Black men (25.4 percent) and white men (25.1  percent).  Alternatively, we can calculate the odds on retiring for each  group by simply taking the percentage who retired in each group and  dividing it by the percentage who had not retired.  The odds on retiring  were 30.1/69.9 = 0.43 for unmarried men, and 23.3/76.7 = 0.30 for married  men. Making similar calculations, the odds were virtually identical for  white men and Black men (0.34, apart from rounding) but lower for  Hispanic men (0.21).  We can compare groups directly by taking the ratios  of these odds, given in the \u201cOdds Ratios\u201d column in table 8.  As can be  seen, the odds on retiring were higher for unmarried men than for married  men, by a factor of 0.431/0.304 = 1.42.  To compare race/ethnicity  categories, we choose (arbitrarily) one group (white men in this case) as  the reference category, make similar calculation by taking the ratios of the  odds for the other two groups to the odds for white men, and find that  Black men have odds on retiring that are only slightly different than white  men (higher by a factor of 1.02), while Hispanic men are less likely than  white men to retire, by a factor of 0.63.", "Table 9 shows the gross effects of each of the factors we considered on  the odds on men and women retiring before age 62 (in the first two  columns) and before age 65 (in the last two columns).  By gross effects, we  mean the effects of each factor estimated from bivariate regressions, or  regressions that ignore or fail to take account of the effects of other  factors which may be related to retirement.  Table 10, by contrast, shows  the adjusted effects of the factors that we found to be significantly related  to retiring at age 62 or age 65 after adjusting for other factors.", "In developing our multivariate models, we controlled for income in the  previous wave, birth year categories, DB, and DC pension plans in the  previous wave, and retiree health insurance in the previous wave even if  the overall p-value for these variables is not statistically significant.  We  adjusted for income in the previous wave because it is a very strong  demographic characteristic, and we adjusted for birth year to account for  any possible cohort effect in the HRS data.  Similarly, we adjusted for  pension type (both DB and DC) and retiree health insurance because we  are interested in assessing the impact of these policy variables on a  respondent\u2019s decision to retire.", "In order to assess factors associated with the retirement decisions at  specific ages in a multivariate setting, we wanted the most parsimonious  model without adding additional noise by factors that were not  statistically significant. To do this we iteratively fit a model by first  adjusting for all of the variables of interest (see Table 9).  After keeping in  the five variables mentioned above (income, birth year, and DB and DC  pension, and retiree health insurance) we then selected the variables that  were statistically significant (p-value <0.05) one at a time.  Then after the  reduced model was fit we re-entered the variables that we excluded to see  if any became statistically significant in the presence of the variables from  the reduced model. The results from the multivariate models retain the  statistically significant associations (p-value <0.05) and exclude those that  reflected insignificant effects, or difference in the sample that could  reasonably be assumed to be due to chance or random fluctuations.  Some  factors that were correlated with other variables and were statistically  significant in the bivariate analysis were not statistically significant in the  final multivariate model when we adjusted for these other factors.  We  assessed our final model for goodness of fit using the Hosmer Lemeshow  goodness of fit statistic, which tests the hypothesis that the data fit the  specified model.  All our multivariate models fit the data appropriately (p- values for model fit >0.05).  We provide the gross or unadjusted effects in  table 9 in order to show what effect each factor has when other factors  with which they are associated are ignored, or left uncontrolled.  By gross  effects, we mean the effects of each factor estimated from bivariate  regressions, or regressions which ignore or fail to take account of the  effects of other factors which may be related to retirement.  We focus our  discussion here however, as well as in the body of the report, on the  adjusted odds ratios from the multivariate models, shown in table 10.  The  results in the table 10 only reflect the statistically significant adjusted odds  ratios.  However, all models include income, birth year, retiree health  insurance, and DB and DC pension plans.  In addition, some of the factors  in the multivariate models have missing data; therefore, the overall sample  size from the multivariate models differs from the sample size noted in  table 9.  We have assumed that the missing values are missing at random.", "The HRS is based on a probability sample and therefore the estimates are  subject to sampling error. The HRS sample is only one of a large number  of samples that could have been drawn of this population. Since each  sample could have provided different estimates, we express our  confidence in the precision of the analysis results as 95 percent confidence  intervals. These are intervals that would contain the actual population  values for 95 percent of the samples that could have been drawn. As a  result, we are 95 percent confident that each of the confidence intervals in  this report will include the true values in the study populations.", "All multivariate models were run using an alternative definition that  included partial and full retirement (see appendix I for definitions).

The authors examined these data for the years 1996 to  2003 and restricted their sample to those who are fully insured under  Social Security. One of the limitations of these data is that they lack  information on wages, hours worked, health status, education, and family  characteristics for workers. The authors ran two sets of regression models   on the following dependent variables: claiming Social Security benefits,  work participation, and earnings. They used a \u201cdifference in difference\u201d  approach for which they compared treatment groups who were affected  by this policy change (those turning 65 and those aged 65 to 69) with  control groups that were not affected (those aged 62 to 64 and 70 to 72).  One of the key assumptions the authors make in running these models is  that there was no shock other than the earnings test removal in 2000 that  affected treatment groups relative to the control groups. After running  these models, the authors concluded that: 1) earnings increased among  higher income workers; 2) workforce participation increased among those  aged 65 to 69; 3) applications for Social Security benefits among those  aged 65 to 69 increased following the test\u2019s removal.", "Leora Friedberg and Anthony Webb, \u201cPersistence in Labor Supply and the  Response to the Social Security Earnings Test,\u201d Working Paper 2006-27  (Boston, Mass.: Center for Retirement Research at Boston College,  December 2006).", "The authors used data from the HRS and Current Population Survey (CPS)  to examine the impact on labor supply of changes made to the earnings  test in 1996 and 2000.

The authors ran regressions on  several dependent variables\u2014employment, full-time employment, and  earnings. In their regression analysis, the authors focus on those aged 62  to 74 to capture any effect that the earnings test might have on younger  workers. Two key assumptions the authors make are that people view the  earnings test as a tax instead of a deferral of benefits and that people can  choose the number of hours they work. The authors conclude that the  earnings test changes in both 1996 and 2000 increased labor force  participation for those both aged 65 to 69 along with younger workers who  are anticipating its removal. They also found that earnings increased,  particularly for higher-income workers, following the 2000 change.", "Steven J. Haider and David S.

They found that the age at which workers adjust their  earnings has risen as the earnings test threshold has risen. In addition,  they found that the extent of bunching is higher with the administrative  data from NBDS and BEPUF.
