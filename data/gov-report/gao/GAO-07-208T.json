Today's testimony highlights GAO's key findings with regard to the following objectives: (1) Were the two key assumptions made in the September 2003 economic analysis reasonable? (2) Was DOD taking action to ensure full utilization of DTS and gathering the data needed to monitor DTS utilization? and (3) Has DOD resolved several functional problems associated with weak system requirements and testing?

Two cost components represent the majority of the over $56 million in estimated net savings--personnel savings and reduced commercial travel office (CTO) fees. In regard to the personnel savings, GAO's analysis found that the $24.2 million of personnel savings related to the Air Force and the Navy were not supported. Air Force and Navy DTS program officials stated that they did not anticipate a reduction in the number of personnel, but rather the shifting of staff from the travel function to other functions. The Naval Cost Analysis Division stated that the Navy will not realize any tangible personnel cost savings from the implementation of DTS. In regard to the CTO fees, the economic analysis assumed that 70 percent of all DTS airline tickets would either require no intervention or minimal intervention from the CTOs, resulting in an estimated annual net savings of $31 million. However, the sole support provided by the DTS program office was an article in a trade industry publication. The article was not based on information related to DTS, but rather on the experience of one private sector company. Furthermore, the economic analysis was not prepared in accordance with guidance prescribed by the Office of Management and Budget and DOD. DOD guidance stated that the life-cycle cost estimates should be verified by an independent party, but this did not occur. The economic analysis did not undertake an assessment of the effects of the uncertainty inherent in the estimates of benefits and costs. Because an economic analysis uses estimates and assumptions, it is critical that the imprecision in both the underlying data and assumptions be understood. Such an assessment is referred to as a sensitivity analysis. DOD acknowledged that DTS is not being used to the fullest extent possible, but lacks comprehensive data to effectively monitor its utilization. DOD's utilization data are based on a model that was developed in calendar year 2003. However, the model has not been completely updated to reflect actual DTS usage. The lack of accurate utilization data hinders management's ability to monitor progress toward the DOD vision of DTS as the standard travel system. GAO also found that the military services have initiated actions that are aimed at increasing the utilization of DTS. Finally, GAO found that DTS still has not addressed the underlying problems associated with weak requirements management and system testing. While DOD has acted to address concerns GAO previously raised, GAO found that DTS's requirements are still ambiguous and conflicting. For example, DTS displaying up to 25 flights for each inquiry is questionable because it is unclear whether this is a valid requirement. Until DOD improves DTS's requirements management practices, the department will not have reasonable assurance that DTS can provide the intended functionality."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss our recent report related to  problems encountered by the Department of Defense (DOD) in its efforts  to successfully implement the Defense Travel System (DTS). As you know,  DOD envisions DTS as the department\u2019s standard end-to-end travel  system. The department estimates that DTS will be fully deployed at all  11,000 intended locations during fiscal year 2007. The September 2003  economic analysis noted that DTS, when fully implemented, would result  in annual net savings of over $56 million. The economic analysis noted that  savings would be realized by the department during fiscal years 2009\u20132016.  In December 2003, the department\u2019s Chief Information Officer approved a  DTS funding level of approximately $564 million. Of this amount, the  contract for the design, development, and deployment of DTS was for  about $264 million. The remaining costs are associated with areas such as  the operation and maintenance of DTS, operation of the Program  Management Office-Defense Travel System (PMO-DTS), the voucher  payment process, and management and oversight of the numerous  contracted commercial travel offices (CTO).", "My testimony today is based on our September 2006 report, which  followed up on our September 2005 testimony and January 2006 report.  One of the major findings in our previous work was that DOD did not have  reasonable assurance that flight information was properly displayed for  DOD travelers because the department failed to properly test the system  interfaces through which the data are accessed for display. We further  noted that the continued use of the existing legacy travel systems at  locations where DTS has been deployed results in underutilization of DTS  and reduces the envisioned savings.", "Today, I will highlight three key findings from our September 2006 report:    Two key assumptions related to the estimated cost savings in the  September 2003 DTS economic analysis were not reasonable.

We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for this  purpose. We did not review the accuracy and reliability of the specific  dollar amounts shown in the September 2003 economic analysis. To  address our objectives we also (1) reviewed the September 2003 economic  analysis and met with cognizant officials, (2) analyzed DTS utilization data  and obtained an overview of the method and data used by DTS program  officials to report the rate of DTS utilization for the various DOD  components, and (3) analyzed DTS flight information.

Consequently, the economic analysis did not serve to help  ensure that the funds invested in DTS were used in an efficient and  effective manner. Two primary areas\u2014personnel savings and reduced  CTO fees\u2014represented the majority of the over $56 million of estimated  annual net savings DTS was expected to realize. However, the estimates  used to generate these savings were unreliable. Further, DOD did not  effectively implement the policies relating to developing economic  analyses for programs such as DTS. Effective implementation of these  policies should have highlighted the problems that we found and allowed  for appropriate adjustments so that the economic analysis could have  served as a useful management tool in making funding decisions related to  DTS\u2014which is the primary purpose of this analysis. While the  department\u2019s system acquisition criteria do not require that a new  economic analysis be prepared, the department\u2019s business system  investment management structure provides an opportunity for DOD  management to assess whether DTS is meeting its planned cost, schedule,  and functionality goals."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Personnel Savings Are Unrealistic", "paragraphs": ["The economic analysis estimated that the annual personnel savings was  over $54 million, as shown in table 2.", "As shown in table 2, approximately 45 percent of the estimated savings, or  $24.2 million, was attributable to the Air Force and Navy. The assumption  behind the personnel savings computation was that there would be less  manual intervention in the processing of travel vouchers for payment, and  therefore fewer staff would be needed. However, based on our discussions  with Air Force and Navy DTS program officials, it is questionable as to  how the estimated savings will be achieved. Air Force and Navy DTS  program officials stated that they did not anticipate a reduction in the  number of personnel with the full implementation of DTS, but rather the  shifting of staff to other functions. According to DOD officials responsible  for reviewing economic analyses, while shifting personnel to other  functions is considered a benefit, it should be considered an intangible  benefit rather than tangible dollar savings since the shifting of personnel  does not result in a reduction of DOD expenditures. Also, as part of the  Navy\u2019s overall evaluation of the economic analysis, program officials  stated that \u201cthe Navy has not identified, and conceivably will not  recommend, any personnel billets for reduction.\u201d Finally, the Naval Cost  Analysis Division (NCAD) October 2003 report on the economic analysis  noted that it could not validate approximately 40 percent of the Navy\u2019s  total costs, including personnel costs, in the DTS life-cycle cost estimates  because credible supporting documentation was lacking. The report also  noted that the PMO-DTS used unsound methodologies in preparing the  DTS economic analysis.", "The extent of personnel savings for the Army and defense agencies, which  are reported as $16 million and $6.3 million respectively, is also unclear.  The Army and many defense agencies use the Defense Finance and  Accounting Service (DFAS) to process their travel vouchers, so the  personnel savings for the Army and the defense agencies were primarily  related to reductions in DFAS\u2019s costs. In discussions with DFAS officials,  they were unable to estimate the actual personnel savings that would  result since they did not know (1) the number of personnel, like those at  the Air Force and Navy, that would simply be transferred to other DFAS  functions or (2) the number of personnel that could be used to avoid  additional hiring. For example, DFAS expects that some of the individuals  assigned to support the travel function could be moved to support its  ePayroll program. Since these positions would need to be filled regardless  of whether the travel function is reduced, transferring personnel from  travel to ePayroll would reduce DOD\u2019s overall costs since DFAS would not  have to hire additional individuals.", "DOD strongly objected to our finding that the personnel savings are  unrealistic. In its written comments, the department stated that it is facing  an enormous challenge and continues to identify efficiencies and eliminate  redundancies to help leverage available funds. We fully recognize that the  department is attempting to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its  business operations. The Comptroller General of the United States  testified in August 2006 that increased commitment by the department to  address DOD\u2019s numerous challenges represents an improvement over past  efforts.", "The fact remains, however, that the results of an economic analysis are  intended to help management decide if future investments in a given  endeavor are worthwhile. In order to provide management with this  information, it is imperative that the underlying assumptions in an  economic analysis be supported by valid assumptions. The September  2003 economic analysis noted that personnel savings of $54.1 million  would be realized by the department annually for fiscal years 2009 through  2016. However, based on our review and analysis of documentation and  discussion with department personnel, we found that the underlying  assumptions in support of the $54.1 million were not valid, particularly in  regard to the amounts estimated for the Navy and Air Force. For example,  we agree with the statements of DOD officials who indicated that the  shifting of personnel to other functions cannot be counted towards  tangible dollar savings, since such actions do not result in a reduction of  DOD expenditures. Moreover, the department did not provide any new  data or related documentation in its comments that were counter to our  finding.

These are commonly referred to as \u201cno touch\u201d  transactions. However, DOD did not have a sufficient basis to estimate the  number of transactions that would be considered \u201cno touch\u201d since the   (1) estimated percentage of transactions that can be processed using the  \u201cno touch\u201d was not supported and (2) analysis did not properly consider  the effects of components that use management fees, rather than  transaction fees, to compensate the CTOs for services provided.

Since that analysis, DOD has awarded one contract that  specifically prices transactions using the same model as that envisioned by  the economic analysis. This contract applies to the Defense Travel Region  6 travel area. During calendar year 2005, the difference in fees for \u201cno  touch\u201d transactions and the transactions supported by the current process  averaged between $10 and $12, depending on when the fees were incurred  because the contract rates changed during 2005. In analyzing travel  voucher data for Region 6 for calendar year 2005, we found that the  reported \u201cno touch\u201d rate was, at best 47 percent\u2014far less than the 70  percent envisioned in the economic analysis.", "PMO-DTS program officials stated they are uncertain as to why the  anticipated 70 percent \u201cno touch\u201d was not being achieved. According to  PMO-DTS program officials, this could be attributed, in part, to the DOD  travelers being uncomfortable with the system and with making  reservations without using a CTO. Although this may be one reason, other  factors may also affect the expected \u201cno touch\u201d fee. For example, we were  informed that determining the airline availability and making the  associated reservation can be accomplished, in most cases, rather easily.  However, obtaining information related to hotels and rental cars and  making the associated reservation can be more problematic because of the  limitations in the data that DTS is able to obtain from its commercial  sources. Accordingly, while a traveler may be able to make a \u201cno touch\u201d  reservation for the airline portion of the trip, the individual may need to  contact the CTO in order to make hotel or rental car reservations. When  this occurs, rather than paying a \u201cno touch\u201d fee to the CTO, DOD ends up  paying a higher fee, which eliminates the savings estimated in the  economic analysis.", "The economic analysis assumed that (1) DOD would be able to modify the  existing CTO contracts to achieve a substantial reduction in fees paid to a  CTO when DTS was fully implemented across the department and (2) all  services would use the fee structure called for in the new CTO contracts.  The first part of the assumption is supported by results of the CTO  contract for DOD Region 6 travel. The fees for the DTS \u201cno touch\u201d  transactions were at least $10 less than if a CTO was involved in the  transactions. However, to date, the department has experienced difficulty  in awarding new contracts with the lower fee structure. On May 10, 2006,  the department announced the cancellation of the solicitation for a new  contract. According to the department, it decided that the solicitation  needed to be rewritten based on feedback from travel industry  representatives at a March 28, 2006, conference. The department  acknowledged that the \u201cDTS office realized its solicitation didn\u2019t reflect  what travel agency services it actually needed.\u201d The department would  not say how the solicitation would be refined, citing the sensitivity of the  procurement process.

Using these data, the assumption was made in the economic analysis that  a fee of $5.25 would be assessed for each ticket, resulting in an average  savings of $13.46 per ticket for the Navy ($18.71 minus $5.25). While this  approach may be valid for the organizations that pay individual CTO fees,  it may not be representative for organizations such as the Navy that pay a  management fee.

For instance, our analysis identified 44 flights  appearing on other DTS listings or airline sites that did not appear on the  9:00 am DTS listing even though those flights (1) met the 12-hour flight  window and (2) were considered GSA city pair flights\u2014two of the key  DTS requirements the system was expected to meet.", "After briefing PMO officials on the results of our analysis in February 2006,  the PMO-DTS employed the services of a contractor to review DTS to  determine the specific cause of the problems and recommend solutions. In  a March 2006 briefing, the PMO-DTS acknowledged the existence of the  problems, and identified two primary causes. First, part of the problem  was attributed to the methodology used by DTS to obtain flights from the  Global Distribution System (GDS). The PMO-DTS stated that DTS was  programmed to obtain a \u201climited\u201d amount of data from GDS in order to  reduce the costs associated with accessing GDS. This helps to explain why  flight queries we reviewed did not produce the expected results. To  resolve this particular problem, the PMO-DTS proposed increasing the  amount of data obtained from GDS. Second, the PMO-DTS acknowledged  that the system testing performed by the contractor responsible for  developing and operating DTS was inadequate and, therefore, there was  no assurance that DTS would provide the data in conformance with the  stated requirements. This weakness was not new, but rather reconfirms  the concerns discussed in our September 2005 testimony and January 2006  report related to the testing of DTS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Planned Corrective Actions Will Not Address Fundamental Requirements Management Problems", "paragraphs": ["While DOD\u2019s planned actions, including a recent technology upgrade,  should address several of the specific weaknesses we identified related to  flight displays, they fall short of addressing the fundamental problems that  caused those weaknesses\u2014inadequate requirements management. DTS\u2019s  requirements continue to be ambiguous. For example, DOD has retained a  requirement to display 25 flights for each inquiry. However, it has not  determined (1) whether the rationale for that requirement is valid and   (2) under what conditions flights that are not part of the GSA city pair  program should be displayed. For example, we found that several DTS  flights displayed to the user \u201coverlap\u201d other flights. Properly validating  the requirements would allow DOD to obtain reasonable assurance that its  requirements properly define the functionality needed and the business  rules necessary to properly implement that functionality. As previously  noted, requirements that are unambiguous and consistent are fundamental  to providing reasonable assurance that a system will provide the desired  functionality. Until DOD improves DTS requirement management  practices, it will not have this assurance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Recommendations to Improve DTS Management and Oversight", "paragraphs": ["Our recent report included four recommendations to improve the  department\u2019s management and oversight of DTS. We recommended that  DOD (1) evaluate the cost effectiveness of the Navy continuing with the  CTO management fee structure versus adopting the revised CTO fee  structure, once the new contracts have been awarded, (2) develop a  process by which the military services develop and use quantitative data  from DTS and their individual legacy systems to clearly identify the total  universe of DTS-eligible transactions on a monthly basis, (3) require the  PMO-DTS to provide periodic reports on the utilization of DTS, once  accurate data are available, and (4) resolve inconsistencies in DTS  requirements by properly defining the functionality needed and business  rules necessary to properly implement the needed functionality. DOD  concurred with three and partially concurred with one of the  recommendations. In regard to the recommendations with which the  department concurred, it briefly outlined the actions it planned to take in  addressing two of the three recommendations. For example, the  department noted the difficulties in obtaining accurate utilization data  from the existing legacy systems, but stated that the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness) and BTA will evaluate  methods for reporting actual DTS utilization.", "Additionally, DOD noted that the Defense Travel Management Office  developed and implemented a requirements change management process  on May 1, 2006. In commenting on the report, the department stated that  this process is intended to define requirements and track the entire life  cycle of the requirements development process. While we fully support the  department\u2019s efforts to improve its management oversight of DTS\u2019s  requirements, we continue to believe that the department needs to have in  place a process that provides DOD reasonable assurance that   (1) requirements are properly documented and (2) requirements are  adequately tested as recommended in our January 2006 report. This  process should apply to all existing requirements as well as any new  requirements. As discussed in this report, we reviewed in May 2006 some  of the requirements that were to have followed the new requirements  management process and found problems similar to those noted in our  January 2006 report. Although we did not specifically review the new  process, if it does not include an evaluation of existing requirements, the  department may continue to experience problems similar to those we  previously identified.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation to evaluate the cost  effectiveness of the Navy continuing with the CTO management fee  structure. However, DOD\u2019s response indicated that the Defense Travel  Management Office is currently procuring commercial travel services for  DOD worldwide in a manner that will ensure evaluation of cost  effectiveness for all services. If DOD proceeds with the actions outlined in  its comments, it will meet the intent of our recommendation.", "Effective implementation of these recommendations as well as those  included in our January 2006 report will go a long way towards improving  DTS functionality and increasing utilization. Furthermore, the shift of DTS  to the BTA, which makes DTS an enterprisewide endeavor, should help in  making DTS the standard integrated, end-to-end travel system for business  travel. Management oversight is essential for this to become a reality. As I  stated previously, in written comments on a draft of our report, the Under  Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness), strongly objected to our  finding that the estimated personnel savings included in the economic  analysis are unrealistic. Because none of the military services could  validate an actual reduction in the number of personnel as a result of DTS  implementation, and DOD\u2019s comments did not include any additional  support or documentation for its position, we continue to believe that the  estimated annual personnel savings of $54.1 million are unrealistic.  Although the department\u2019s criteria do not require that a new economic  analysis be prepared, the fiscal year 2005 defense authorization act  requires the periodic review, but not less than annually, of every defense  business system investment. If effectively implemented, this annual review  process provides an excellent opportunity for DOD management to assess  whether DTS is meeting its planned cost, schedule, and functionality goals.  Going forward, such a review could serve as a useful management tool in  making funding and other management decisions related to DTS.", "In conclusion, overhauling the department\u2019s antiquated travel management  practices and systems has been a daunting challenge for DOD. While it  was widely recognized that this was a task that needed to be accomplished  and savings could result, the underlying assumptions in support of those  savings are not based on reliable data and therefore it is questionable  whether the anticipated savings will materialize. Even though the overall  savings are questionable, the successful implementation of DTS is critical  to reducing the number of stovepiped, duplicative travel systems  throughout the department. We have reported on numerous occasions that  reducing the number of business systems within DOD can translate into  savings that can be used for other mission needs. As noted above,  management oversight will be an important factor in DTS achieving its  intended goals. Equally important, however, will be the department\u2019s  ability to resolve the long-standing difficulties that DTS has encountered  with its requirements management and system testing. Until these issues  are resolved, more complete utilization of DTS will be problematic.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
