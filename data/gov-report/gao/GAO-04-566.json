These requirements include verifying professional credentials; completing background investigations for certain practitioners, including fingerprinting to check for criminal histories; and checking national databases that contain reports of practitioners who have been professionally disciplined or excluded from federal health care programs. GAO found adequate screening requirements for certain practitioners, such as physicians, for whom all licenses are verified by contacting state licensing boards. However, screening requirements for others, such as currently employed nurses and respiratory therapists, are less stringent because they do not require verification of all licenses and national certificates. Moreover, they require only physical inspection of the credential rather than contacting state licensing boards and national certifying organizations. Physical inspection alone can be misleading; not all credentials indicate whether they are restricted, and credentials can be forged. VA also does not require facility officials to query, for other than physicians and dentists, a national database that includes reports of disciplinary actions involving all licensed practitioners. In addition, many practitioners with direct patient care access, such as medical residents, are not required to undergo background investigations, including fingerprinting to check for criminal histories. VA has not conducted oversight of its facilities' compliance with the key screening requirements. This pattern of mixed compliance and the gaps in key VA screening requirements creates vulnerabilities to the extent that VA remains unaware of practitioners who could place patients at risk."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is responsible for safeguarding  veterans receiving health care in its facilities by ensuring that its health  care practitioners are qualified to provide care to their patients. VA  employs about 190,000 individuals including physicians, nurses,  pharmacists, and therapists at its facilities, and it supplements these  practitioners with contract staff, medical consultants, and medical  residents. VA has screening requirements intended to help ensure that its  health care practitioners\u2019 professional credentials are verified and their  personal backgrounds checked for evidence of incompetence or criminal  behavior. According to medical forensic experts, the deliberate harm of  patients by health care practitioners is a problem in the health care sector,  and VA\u2019s requirements are intended to minimize the chance of veterans  receiving care from someone who is incompetent or may intentionally  harm them.", "Events at VA facilities have raised concerns about VA\u2019s screening of the  professional credentials and personal backgrounds of health care  practitioners at its facilities. In 1993, Dr. Michael Joseph Swango entered  the VA health care system as a medical resident, although before entering  the residency program he had been convicted and imprisoned for 2 years  for aggravated battery against his fellow employees. Dr. Swango had  admitted to medical school officials that he had a prior arrest and  conviction, but lied about the nature of the crime. In 2000, he pleaded  guilty to murdering three veterans at the VA facility located in Northport,  New York, and received a sentence of three consecutive life terms without  the possibility of parole. In another case, in 2000, events at the VA facility  in Albany, New York, raised concerns about VA\u2019s process for checking the  credentials of individuals employed at its facilities. VA hired a research  assistant to help administer several cancer studies. The research assistant  had lost his medical license because he had forged his medical credentials.  Once at VA, the research assistant allegedly falsified data that were used  to qualify veterans for cancer studies, and this may have resulted in the  untimely deaths of several veterans. In 2003, the researcher was indicted  in federal court on charges including manslaughter, criminally negligent  homicide, and fraud.", "You asked that we examine VA\u2019s policies and practices intended to ensure  that health care practitioners at its facilities have appropriate professional  credentials and personal backgrounds to provide care to veterans.  Specifically, we (1) identified key VA screening requirements for its health  care practitioners, (2) determined the adequacy of these screening  requirements, and (3) assessed the extent to which selected VA facilities  complied with these screening requirements.", "We reviewed health care occupations in VA and selected 43 occupations in  which practitioners have direct patient care access or have an impact on  patient care. See appendix I for a list of the 43 health care occupations  included in our study. We reviewed VA employment screening policies and  practices to identify those requirements that applied to the selected  occupations and were key requirements for safeguarding veterans  receiving health care in VA facilities. To determine the adequacy of the  key screening requirements, we examined whether they were complete,  and whether VA applied them to all applicants, current employees,  contract staff, medical residents, and volunteers. We also interviewed VA  human resource officials, VA headquarters and VA facility officials, and  facility practitioners; representatives of state licensing boards and national  certifying organizations; and officials and representatives of organizations  that operate national databases containing information on state licenses  and national certificates. We also reviewed VA\u2019s policy on background  investigations to determine its criteria for conducting background  investigations. To assess the extent to which VA facilities complied with  the key screening requirements, we visited four VA facilities and reviewed  personnel files for practitioners at each site. From VA\u2019s automated pay  system, we selected a statistically random sample of 100 current  practitioners in the 43 occupations for each facility we visited. We  reviewed these practitioners\u2019 files to determine whether the facilities had  documentation that demonstrated compliance with key VA screening  requirements. We visited facilities located in Big Spring, Texas; New  Orleans, Louisiana; Seattle, Washington; and the District of Columbia,  based on geographic variation, affiliations with medical schools to train  residents, and types of health care services provided. Of the four facilities  we visited, three are large facilities located in major metropolitan areas  and are affiliated with at least one medical school. The remaining facility is  small, providing mainly primary care and long-term care services to  veterans and is located in a rural area. Additionally, from the four facilities  we visited and from six other facilities we selected based on geographic  variation, we obtained documentation on how quickly facilities took  action after obtaining the results of background investigations. Our results  cannot be generalized to other facilities. For a complete description of our  scope and methodology, see appendix I.

Current and unrestricted licenses are licenses that are in  good standing in the states that issued them, and licensed practitioners  may hold licenses from more than one state. To keep a license current,  practitioners must renew their licenses before they expire and meet  renewal requirements established by state licensing boards, such as  continuing education. Renewal procedures and requirements vary by state  and occupation. When licensing boards discover violations of licensing  practices, such as the abuse of prescription drugs or the provision of poor  quality of care that results in adverse health effects, they may place  restrictions on licenses or revoke them. Restrictions from a state licensing  board can limit or prohibit a practitioner from practicing in that particular  state. Some, but not all, issued state licenses are marked in such a way as  to indicate that the licenses have had restrictions placed on them.

Figure 1 illustrates VA\u2019s process for credentials  verification with state licensing boards and national certifying  organizations for these groups for applicants VA intends to hire and for  employed practitioners, whose credentials are checked periodically.   Groups A and B represent practitioners who must be licensed to work in  VA. However, the requirements and process VA uses to verify professional  credentials is different for each of these groups. Group C represents  practitioners who must have a national certificate to work in VA and may  also have a state license.", "The process used to screen applicants in all three groups has two stages.  First, applicants are required to disclose, if applicable, their state licenses  and national certificates. Second, VA facility officials are required to verify  whether applicants\u2019 state licenses or national certificates are current and  unrestricted. To verify applicants\u2019 credentials, VA officials are required to  either contact state licensing boards or to physically inspect an applicant\u2019s  national certificate. Officials are also required to document that they  verified the status of the professional credentials.", "VA also has requirements for verifying the credentials of its employed  practitioners. Like the verification process for applicants, this process  involves employed practitioners\u2019 disclosures and VA verification of that  information. VA employed practitioners in group A are required to disclose  all of their current licenses, while those in group B must disclose only one  license. For employed practitioners in group A, facility officials are also  required to determine if any expired licenses disclosed as current and  unrestricted at the beginning of employment had restrictions placed on  them prior to their expiration. VA depends on its employed practitioners in  group B to inform facility officials of any change in the status of their  license, including any that have expired. Employed practitioners in group  C must disclose a national certificate. VA officials must confirm that the  disclosed licenses and certificates are current and unrestricted. For group  A practitioners, VA facility officials contact the appropriate state licensing  boards directly; for groups B and C they physically inspect the state  license or national certificate. VA officials verify these credentials  periodically depending on the occupation and the requirements of the  state or national organization that issued the license or certificate. For  example, a registered nurse with a state license from Virginia must renew  the license every 3 years, while a respiratory therapist must renew the  national certificate every 5 years. VA officials are required to document  these verifications.", "If VA\u2019s verification process identifies that a state licensing board or  national certifying organization took disciplinary action against a  practitioner, facility officials are required to determine the circumstances  of the disciplinary action. Licensing boards and certifying organizations  have various options for disciplining practitioners.

In  contrast, a physician whose treatment results in the death or the  permanent disability of a patient may have a license revoked.

However, gaps in VA\u2019s existing screening requirements allow  some practitioners access to patients without a thorough screening of  their professional credentials and personal backgrounds. For example,  although the screening requirements for verifying professional credentials  for some occupations, such as physicians, are adequate, VA does not apply  the same screening requirements for all occupations with direct patient  care access. Specifically, VA does not require that all licenses be verified,  or that licenses and national certificates be verified by contacting state  licensing boards or national certifying organizations. VA relies on two  national databases to identify physicians and dentists who have had  disciplinary actions taken against them. In addition, VA accesses a third  national database, HIPDB, for physicians and dentists, because HIPDB is  linked to one of the two national databases VA currently accesses. HIPDB  is a national database that contains reports of disciplinary actions and  criminal convictions involving all licensed practitioners, not just  physicians and dentists. However VA does not require facility officials to  query HIPDB for all licensed practitioners. As a result, practitioners such  as nurses, pharmacists, and physical therapists do not have their state  licenses checked against a national database. In addition, VA does not  require all practitioners with direct patient care access, such as medical  residents, to have their fingerprints checked against a criminal history  database. These gaps create vulnerabilities that could allow incompetent  practitioners or practitioners with the intent to harm patients into VA\u2019s  health care system.", "In addition to these gaps, compliance with the existing key screening  requirements was mixed at the four facilities we visited. None of the four  facilities complied with all of the key VA screening requirements.

Although VA created the Office of Human Resources  Oversight and Effectiveness in January 2003 expressly to provide oversight  of VA\u2019s human resources practices at its facilities, it has not provided  resources for this office to conduct oversight of VA facilities\u2019 compliance  with these requirements. Without such oversight, VA cannot provide  reasonable assurance that its facilities comply with requirements intended  to ensure the safety of veterans receiving health care in VA facilities. In  light of the gaps we found and mixed compliance with the key screening  requirements by VA facilities, we believe effective oversight could reduce  the potential risks to the safety of veterans receiving health care in VA  facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To better ensure the safety of veterans receiving health care at VA  facilities, we recommend that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs direct the  Under Secretary for Health to take the following four actions:    expand the verification requirement that facility officials contact state  licensing boards and national certifying organizations to include all state  licenses and national certificates held by applicants and employed  practitioners,    expand the query of the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank to  include all licensed practitioners that VA intends to hire and periodically  query this database for continued employment,  require fingerprint checks for all health care practitioners who were  previously exempted from background investigations and who have direct  patient care access, and    conduct oversight to help ensure that facilities comply with all key  screening requirements for applicants and current employees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on a draft of this report, VA generally agreed with our  findings and conclusions. VA acknowledged that we identified gaps in its  process for conducting background and credentialing checks and that we  provided what appeared to be reasonable recommendations to close those  gaps. VA stated that it would provide a detailed action plan to implement  our recommendations when the final report was issued.", "VA said that our draft report inaccurately omitted VA\u2019s querying HIPDB for  practitioners who practice independently. We revised our report to clarify  that NPDB queries performed by VA automatically check HIPDB for these  practitioners because the databases are linked. However, VA does not  perform queries of HIPDB for the majority of its licensed practitioners,  which includes nurses, pharmacists, physical therapists, and dental  hygienists. VA also incorrectly stated that the draft report did not include  VA\u2019s requirement to query FSMB for physicians. In addition, VA said that it  planned to implement fingerprint-only checks for all contract health care  practitioners, medical residents, medical consultants, and practitioners  that work without direct compensation from VA, as well as certain  volunteers. However, VA has not issued guidance to its facilities  instructing them to implement fingerprint-only checks for all these  practitioners. Further, VA stated that the title of the report implied that  veterans are receiving inadequate care on a broad basis. We disagree. The  title reflects vulnerabilities created by the gaps in the screening of  practitioners that could place veterans at risk by allowing incompetent  practitioners or those with the intent to harm patients into VA\u2019s health  care system. VA provided technical comments which we incorporated, as  appropriate. VA\u2019s written comments are reprinted in appendix III.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days after its  date. We will then send copies of this report to the Secretary of Veterans  Affairs and other interested parties. We also will make copies available to  others upon request. In addition, the report will be available at no charge  at the GAO Web site at http://www.gao.gov.", "If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please call me at  (202) 512-7101.

Specifically, we (1) identified  key VA screening requirements for its health care practitioners, (2)  determined the adequacy of these screening requirements, and (3)  assessed the extent to which selected VA facilities complied with these  screening requirements.", "To identify key VA screening requirements for its health care practitioners,  we reviewed VA\u2019s policies and VA Handbook 5005, which explains how to  implement the screening policies. We limited our review to 43 occupations  in VA that have direct patient care access or have an impact on patient  care. See table 3 for a list of the occupations included in our review. To  identify the 43 occupations, we consulted with VA human resource  officials. We interviewed human resource officials at VA headquarters and  at each facility we visited. We classified the practitioners who are required  to have professional credentials\uf8e7a state license or a national  certificate\uf8e7into three groups according to VA\u2019s requirements for verifying  these credentials. Groups A and B represent practitioners who must be  licensed to work in VA. However, the requirements and process VA uses to  verify professional credentials is different for each of these groups. Group  C represents practitioners who must have a national certificate to work in  VA and may also have a state license. Practitioners not included in the  three groups are not required to have either a license or a national  certificate to work in VA facilities.", "To determine the adequacy of the key VA screening requirements, we  analyzed VA\u2019s policies and procedures to identify whether there were  inconsistencies in how the requirements were applied among various  types of practitioners. We interviewed VA headquarters and facility  officials and practitioners at the facilities we visited to determine how  VA\u2019s policies are implemented in facilities. In addition, we interviewed  representatives from 13 state licensing boards and the District of Columbia  Board of Nursing and 2 national certifying organizations to determine if  VA\u2019s requirements for verifying professional credentials are adequate for  identifying practitioners without valid and unrestricted state licenses and  national certificates.", "To assess the extent to which VA facilities we visited complied with the  key screening requirements, we chose a judgmental sample of four VA  facilities that varied in size, location, and medical school affiliations to  assess the extent to which these selected facilities complied with these  requirements. The four facilities are located in Big Spring, Texas; New  Orleans, Louisiana; Seattle, Washington; and the District of Columbia. We  chose these facilities based on geographic variation, affiliations with  medical schools to train residents, and types of health care services  provided. Of the four facilities we visited, three are large facilities located  in major metropolitan areas and each are affiliated with at least one  medical school. The remaining facility is small, providing mainly primary  care and long-term care services to veterans and is located in a rural area.  For each facility, VA provided, from its automated pay system, a list of  current practitioners in the 43 occupations. As a result of using VA\u2019s  automated pay system, our sample does not include those practitioners  providing care through a contract or training agreement or without direct  compensation from VA. For each of the four facilities, we selected a  random sample of 100 practitioners either hired or assigned to their  current position no earlier than January 1, 1993. We chose to limit our  review to approximately the last 10 years because VA changed its process  for credentials verification in the early 1990s. For each of these  practitioners, we reviewed their personnel files to check that the facility  had complied with the following key VA screening requirements:    verify state licenses and national certificates for applicants;    verify state licenses and national certificates for employed practitioners;    query the List of Excluded Individuals and Entities (LEIE) prior to hire;    ensure completion of background investigations, including fingerprints;    ensure completion of the Declaration for Federal Employment form, also  known as form 306; and    verify that the educational institutions listed by a practitioner VA intends  to hire are checked against lists of diploma mills.", "In order to show the variability in the level of compliance among the four  VA facilities we visited, we distinguished between facilities that had a  compliance rate of at least 90 percent for each of five of the six screening  requirements and those that did not. For each facility and key screening  requirement, we compared the percentage of personnel files found in  compliance to an acceptance level of 90 percent. In order to confirm that a  requirement had a compliance rate less than 90 percent, we performed a  one-sided significance test at the 95 percent confidence level. See  appendix II for detailed information on the four VA facilities\u2019 compliance  with each of the key VA screening requirements. Our results from these  four facilities cannot be generalized to other facilities. In order to  determine compliance with the key screening requirement to verify that  the educational institutions listed by a practitioner are not fraudulent, we  asked facility human resources staff if they performed this screening and  asked them to produce their lists of diploma mills.", "Additionally, we reviewed VA facilities\u2019 response times to 214 background  investigation results returned from OPM with questionable issues, from  August 1, 2002, to August 23, 2003, at the four locations we visited and six  other VA facilities selected based on geographic location. The six  additional facilities were located in Boston, Massachusetts; East Orange,  New Jersey; Indianapolis, Indiana; Palo Alto, California; Portland, Oregon;  and San Diego, California. For these 10 facilities, we asked officials to  provide the date they took action on cases returned from OPM, and from  VA headquarters we obtained the dates when OPM returned the cases to  the facility. We determined the average number of days it took each  facility to take action after these cases were returned from OPM with  questionable issues.
