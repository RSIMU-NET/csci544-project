GAO was subsequently asked to examine six other DOE laboratories and determine (1) whether differences exist for managerial and professional women and minorities compared with men and Whites in salaries, merit pay increases, separation patterns, and promotion rates; (2) what EEO concerns laboratory women and minorities have raised; and (3) what DOE and OFCCP have done to implement GAO's earlier recommendation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["For fiscal years 2001 through mid-2004, GAO found some statistically significant differences in salaries, merit pay increases, and separation patterns for managerial and professional women and minorities when compared with men and Whites, and differences in promotion rates when compared with White men. These differences remained despite holding constant factors such as age, education, and occupational category. Women were paid 2 to 4 percent less than men at five of the six laboratories, while minorities were paid about 2 percent less than Whites at one laboratory. Merit pay increases were comparable for all groups at three of the six laboratories. At the other three laboratories, merit pay increases were higher for women and minorities at one, higher for women at another, and lower for minorities at the third. Separation patterns for women and minorities were generally comparable to men and Whites. However, at one laboratory, women were more likely to leave than men, and at another laboratory, minorities were more likely to leave than Whites. At one laboratory, selected minority groups were promoted at a rate less than 80 percent of the rate for White men (a \"rule of thumb\" used by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and OFCCP). Statistically significant differences do not prove or disprove discrimination; rather, they provide information at an aggregate level and may indicate a need for further investigation into their practical significance. Concerns of women and minority staff at the laboratories focused primarily on underrepresentation, the lack of career development opportunities, and the need for an improved laboratory work environment. Complaints investigated or resolved within the laboratories varied among the laboratories and included issues such as sexual harassment and a hostile work environment. Complaints filed with outside agencies such as EEOC most often cited concerns with pay and terminations. The highest number of external complaints filed dealt with sex or race matters. As a result of GAO's April 2002 recommendation, OFCCP and DOE staff met to discuss the possible creation of a more formal relationship through a memorandum of understanding. While reviewing OFCCP's draft memorandum, the Department of Labor raised questions about DOE's authority and responsibility for EEO matters at the laboratories, and as a result, OFCCP has not sent the draft memorandum to DOE for coordination. OFCCP maintains that Executive Order 11246, as amended, made DOL solely responsible for enforcing federal contractors' compliance with EEO requirements, and this authority has been delegated to OFCCP by DOL. DOE officials agree, but maintain that DOE's requirement for its contractors to promote diversity through diversity plans is independent from OFCCP's jurisdiction. Accordingly, GAO believes that the departments of Labor and of Energy need to clarify and reach agreement about DOE's role concerning its contractors' diversity activities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Energy (DOE) is the largest civilian contracting agency  in the federal government, with about 90 percent of its annual budget spent  on contracts. As part of its contract costs, DOE can reimburse its  contractors for litigation costs associated with cases brought against  them. Since fiscal year 1998, DOE has approved nearly $57 million for  reimbursement to its contractors for equal employment opportunity (EEO)  litigation costs. About $10 million of the $57 million is attributable to six of  DOE\u2019s multiprogram laboratories, and pending lawsuits could increase this  amount substantially. These six laboratories\u2014Argonne, Brookhaven,  Lawrence Berkeley, Oak Ridge, and Pacific Northwest National Laboratories,  and Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory\u2014are  managed and operated for DOE by contractors that perform basic scientific  research and environmental remediation. These laboratories employ about  21,000 staff, of which approximately 66 percent are managers and  professionals. Both former Secretaries Abraham and Richardson issued  policies calling for all DOE managers, including contractors, to foster a  culture that embraces diversity and to ensure that all employees have equal  opportunity with respect to hiring, promotions, and professional  development.", "Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII), as amended,  employers cannot discriminate against their employees or job applicants  on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has primary responsibility  for enforcing compliance with the act for the U.S. workforce.", "Executive Order 11246, as amended, which applies to federal contractors,  such as those that manage and operate many of DOE\u2019s laboratories,  prohibits the same type of discrimination as prohibited by Title VII, and  also requires that employers take affirmative action to ensure that  employees and job applicants are treated fairly without regard to race,  color, religion, sex, or national origin. The Department of Labor enforces  the executive order and has assigned this responsibility to its Office of  Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP). OFCCP investigates  complaints of employment discrimination, conducts compliance  evaluations, and takes administrative and enforcement actions when  necessary. Under an agreement between EEOC and OFCCP, EEOC  generally investigates individual complaints of discrimination against  federal contractors, while OFCCP generally investigates discrimination complaints filed against federal contractors involving groups of people or  patterns of discrimination.", "Under the executive order, DOE is responsible for ensuring that its  contracts contain the EEO provisions OFCCP requires, for cooperating  with OFCCP, and for providing information and assistance as needed. In  addition, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires DOE to ensure  that it carries out the requirements of the subpart of the FAR concerning  EEO and that it cooperates with and assists OFCCP in fulfilling that office\u2019s  responsibilities. The primary responsibility for complying with EEO  requirements rests with the laboratory managers. In addition to  implementing its responsibilities concerning EEO, DOE has a policy to  promote diversity in its contractors\u2019 workforce. The DOE Acquisition  Regulation (DEAR), which supplements the FAR, requires that  management and operating contracts contain a clause requiring  contractors to prepare diversity plans. DOE\u2019s policy in pursuit of diversity  is also reflected in its contracting officers\u2019 guidance.", "In an April 2002 report, GAO identified the need to strengthen EEO  oversight at three of DOE\u2019s nine multiprogram laboratories\u2014Los Alamos,  Sandia, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories----and  recommended that DOE and OFCCP work more collaboratively to ensure  the laboratories\u2019 compliance with EEO.", "As agreed with your office, this report examines the status of women and  minorities at DOE\u2019s other six multiprogram laboratories. Specifically, for  fiscal years 2001 through mid-2004, we examined (1) whether statistically  significant differences exist between women and minorities when  compared with men and Whites in their salaries, the amount of their merit  pay increases, and their separation patterns, and whether there were  substantial differences in the promotion rates of groupings of laboratory  staff by race/ethnicity and sex when compared with White men; (2) what  EEO concerns women and minorities raised at these laboratories; and (3)  what actions DOE and OFCCP have taken to implement GAO\u2019s  recommendation to work collaboratively. We did not draw conclusions  about whether the laboratories have or have not discriminated against any  employee or group of employees. Our analysis of differences in salaries,  merit pay increases, separations, and promotions focuses on managers and  professionals, while our review of employee concerns includes all  laboratory staff.", "To determine whether there were differences in salaries, merit pay  increases, and separation patterns for women and minorities when  compared with men and Whites, and in promotion rates of groupings of  laboratory staff by race/ethnicity and sex when compared with White men,  we used data from each laboratory\u2019s personnel database for fiscal years  2001 through mid-2004. For our analyses of statistically significant  differences in salaries, merit pay increases, and separations, we developed  laboratory-specific regression models. By statistically significant  differences, we mean that we are 95 percent confident that these  differences are too large to have been produced by chance or random  fluctuations and that they reflect real differences in the populations being  compared. Our analyses of statistically significant differences are not  designed to prove or disprove discrimination in a court of law like analyses  conducted by OFCCP or EEOC, nor do they establish whether the  differences are of practical significance that would require corrective  action by the laboratories. Rather, our analyses use a standard method  designed to provide information at an aggregate level about differences in  personnel actions, such as salaries, merit pay increases, and separation  patterns, for women and minorities at the laboratories that may need  further investigation. Because the laboratories have somewhat different  personnel systems and practices, our analyses of salaries, merit pay  increases, and separation patterns included variables specific to each  laboratory, as well as those common to all six. For example, we included  laboratory-specific controls for organizational structure and occupational  classification systems. Additionally, we included controls for age; tenure at  the laboratory or within grade; employment status (postdoctoral, part-time  and temporary status); management status; citizenship; and education level  where data were available. Consequently our analyses of statistically  significant differences are not exhaustive, nor do they prove or disprove  discrimination. Rather they are designed to identify issues or problems that  may need to be investigated further.", "To determine whether promotion rates of groupings of laboratory staff by  race/ethnicity and sex were substantially different from White men, we  applied the 80 percent rule set out in the federal government\u2019s Uniform  Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. We determined that the  laboratories\u2019 personnel data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To determine the EEO concerns of women and minorities at the  laboratories, we interviewed representatives from employee groups for  women and minorities at the laboratories and reviewed recent DOE and  laboratory surveys and studies. We also collected data from each  laboratory on complaints filed and investigated within the laboratory  (internal complaints). Finally, we examined complaints filed with  organizations outside of the laboratory, such as EEOC, OFCCP, or a state  and local fair employment practices agency (external complaints). We did  not attempt to prove or disprove the validity of these concerns, nor did we  assess the laboratories\u2019 efforts to address them. We determined that the  data we collected were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To determine the actions DOE and OFCCP have taken to implement our  2002 recommendation, we met with DOE and OFCCP officials responsible  for implementing our recommendation and for EEO oversight at DOE\u2019s  laboratories.

The order states that  federal contractors will not discriminate against an employee or applicant  for employment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.  In addition to the requirements of Title VII, the order further states that  federal contractors will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants  and employees are treated without regard to their race, color, religion, sex,  or national origin in personnel actions, including recruitment and hiring,  pay, benefits, promotion, selection for training, demotions and transfers,  lay-offs, and termination. Under OFCCP regulations, the contractors must  develop affirmative actions plans that spell out the steps they will take to  ensure EEO.", "OFCCP\u2019s regulations implementing the executive order require  contractors, including the laboratories, to submit data annually to EEOC on specific job categories, by race/ethnicity and sex. Private-sector  employers provide annual employment statistics by sex for each of nine  major job categories and for each of five population groups: Whites,  Blacks, Hispanics, Asians or Pacific Islanders, and American Indians or  Alaskan Natives.

Before the executive order was amended in 1978, responsibility  for compliance with EEO obligations was dispersed among 11 different  agencies, including DOE. Because agency standards, procedures, and  reporting requirements were not uniform, contractors faced differing  agency requirements. The amended executive order concentrated full  responsibility for EEO contractor compliance, including the authority to  issue regulations and binding orders with the Secretary of Labor, who  delegated this responsibility to OFCCP. Under the executive order, the  contracting agencies are responsible for including the EEO clause in each  nonexempt contract, cooperating with the Secretary of Labor by  providing the information and assistance the Secretary requires, and  complying with the terms of the executive order and implementing  regulations and orders. The obligations of contracting agencies,  contractors, and subcontractors under the executive order are set out in  OFCCP regulations and provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation  (FAR).", "OFCCP maintains that DOE lacks authority as part of contract  administration to evaluate a laboratory contractor\u2019s compliance under the  contract with the EEO requirements of the executive order and its  implementing regulations.

In OFCCP\u2019s view, DOE\u2019s reduction of a contractor\u2019s fee would be  tantamount to imposing a monetary penalty on the contractor, which is not  authorized under the terms of the executive order and its implementing  regulations. In addition, according to OFCCP, to permit DOE to impose  standards or sanctions beyond those administered by OFCCP could  reintroduce inconsistencies and the conflicts between EEO objectives and  procurement objectives that led to the 1978 centralization of EEO  enforcement within the Department of Labor.", "DOE officials agree that OFCCP is solely responsible for the administration  and enforcement of the EEO provisions of government contracts. In this  regard, DOE states that its EEO responsibilities are limited to those  conferred by the FAR, that is, to include the appropriate provisions and  clauses in solicitations and contracts and to refer complaints to and  cooperate with OFCCP, as prescribed by the FAR.", "In addition to the FAR requirements for EEO, DOE has diversity policies  that are reflected in the DEAR requirement that each management and  operating contract contain a diversity clause, and in provisions of DOE\u2019s  reference guidance for contracting officers. DOE views its activities with  regard to the inclusion of the DEAR diversity clause and pursuit of diversity  as independent of OFCCP\u2019s jurisdiction. However, OFCCP has pointed out  several areas in the DEAR and DOE\u2019s guidance as possibly infringing on  OFCCP\u2019s EEO enforcement authority. For example:  The DEAR requires each management and operating contract to contain  a clause requiring that the contractor submit a diversity plan to the DOE  contracting officer within 90 days of the effective date of the contract.This plan, at a minimum, is to address the contractor\u2019s approach for  promoting diversity through its workforce, education and community  outreach, subcontracting, economic development, and the prevention of  racial profiling. DOE\u2019s policy guidance for contracting officers states  that this plan may discuss how the contractor has or plans to establish  and maintain result-oriented EEO and affirmative action programs in  accordance with the requirements of EEO and affirmative action  contract clauses and how the contractor\u2019s organization includes or plans  to include elements/dimensions of diversity that might enhance such  programs. OFCCP told us that these provisions raised concerns about  DOE\u2019s implementation of the diversity plan requirement.", "According to DOE\u2019s policy guidance for contracting officers, each DOE  contracting officer is to evaluate the contractor\u2019s performance in  implementing its diversity plan.

DOE states,  however, that its efforts to promote diversity under its contracts through  the diversity clause are independent of enforcement of the EEO clause and  OFCCP\u2019s authorities under the executive order.

DOE also expressed concern about  the accuracy of our analyses stating that the criteria that we used differed  from that used by the laboratories and OFCCP. Actually, the methodology  that we use is similar to the methodology that OFCCP has recently  proposed that federal contractors with more than 250 employees use to  conduct annual self-evaluations of compensation practices. Our analyses  of salaries, merit pay, and separation patterns at each of the laboratories  included factors that OFCCP\u2019s proposed guidance identifies as legitimately  affecting compensation, such as experience, education, and performance,  as well as several other factors that some of the laboratories specifically  identified. In fact, we tested a number of modifications to our models in  response to questions posed by several of the laboratories. None of these  modifications resulted in significant changes to our findings.

DOE suggested that if similar vigor were  applied to all the report\u2019s statistics, other changes might result. We  disagree. The revisions to the Idaho statistics were not the result of a  change to our methodology, but resulted from including additional data  provided by the laboratory during the report\u2019s comment period. The other  laboratories had provided this data earlier. Instead of undermining the  validity of our analyses, our actions reflect our commitment to reporting  complete and accurate information.", "Lastly, DOE restated its position that its role in fostering contractors\u2019  workforce diversity does not conflict with OFCCP\u2019s role in enforcing  contractors\u2019 equal employment obligations.", "In its written comments, the Department of Labor pointed out that  OFCCP\u2019s methods of statistical analysis differ from the analysis methods  we used in this report and that OFCCP\u2019s methods are designed to  determine if a contractor is engaged in unlawful employment  discrimination.

Our report clearly  states that our analyses are designed to provide information at an aggregate  level about differences in personnel actions that may need further  investigation. Because our analyses identified statistically significant  differences in salaries, merit pay increases, and separation patterns, and  substantial differences in promotion rates for women and minorities at the  six laboratories, we have recommended that OFCCP work with the  laboratories to determine the causes of these differences and take the  necessary corrective steps, if appropriate, to address any EEO problems  identified.

We  interviewed and obtained data and documentation from relevant officials at  DOE\u2019s, OFCCP\u2019s, and EEOC\u2019s headquarters offices in Washington, D.C.;  DOE officials in the Chicago, Idaho, Oak Ridge, and Richland operations  offices and the Berkeley and Brookhaven site offices; and laboratory  officials at the six laboratories. We performed our statistical analysis of  salaries, merit pay increases, and separation patterns by comparing women  to men, and minorities to Whites. For our analysis of promotions, we  compared men and women in each racial/ethnic group to White men. Our  statistical analysis of laboratory staff includes all exempt management and  professional staff at the laboratories.  Limited-term staff (such as  postdoctoral students who hold professional occupations on a temporary  basis) were included in the analysis of salaries, but not in the analyses of  merit pay increases, promotions, or separations. We reviewed only exempt  employees because they represent the majority of laboratory staff,  laboratories maintain personnel data for these employees, and their  salaries and benefits are not negotiated by a union.", "To determine whether there were differences in salaries, merit pay  increases, and separation patterns for women and minorities when  compared with men and Whites, and in promotion rates for women and  minorities in each racial/ethnic group compared with White men, in fiscal  years 2001 through mid-2004, we applied statistical tests to the  laboratory-provided employee data on personnel actions. We requested  data for all exempt management and professional staff for the period we  reviewed. Because many of the laboratories were undergoing changes in  size, funding, and structure, we chose to analyze the most recent 3-1/2   years of personnel actions, rather than just 1 year. We believed the  3-1/2-year period would provide a more accurate picture of laboratory  compensation practices because unique funding or organizational effects  could produce marked differences in separations, merit pay increases, and  promotions in a particular year. Because we were combining information  across years, we reviewed the data to ensure individuals\u2019 demographic  information remained constant (e.g., race, sex, education level). Where  necessary, we either excluded inconsistent cases or included variables in  the models to adjust for nonconstant data. We assessed the reliability of  each laboratory\u2019s data by (1) using advanced electronic testing, (2)  reviewing documentation on the data systems, and (3) interviewing  knowledgeable staff about the data and data system internal controls and  quality reviews. Based on our assessment, we determined that the  personnel data from all laboratories were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes.", "The federal government\u2019s Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection  Procedures direct agencies to analyze personnel actions of groups  protected by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Under the guidelines, agencies  analyze personnel actions separately by race/ethnicity and by sex. At  congressional request, we performed our statistical analyses in accordance  with these guidelines. We analyzed the laboratory data at the individual  level using the complete population of exempt management and  professional laboratory staff. The laboratories have somewhat different  personnel systems and practices, and although we applied the same  modeling techniques for each laboratory, we performed the analyses  separately for each laboratory. We consulted with the laboratories  regarding our analytical approach to ensure that we were receiving the  appropriate data for the analyses. Additionally, we consulted with OFCCP  about our methodology. Our analyses are not designed to prove or disprove  discrimination in a court of law; rather, they are designed to provide  information at an aggregate level about race/ethnicity and sex differences  in personnel actions at the laboratories. Therefore, our results do not  indicate whether discrimination has occurred."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Determining Statistical Differences in Salaries, Merit Pay Increases, and Separations", "paragraphs": ["To determine whether there were statistically significant race/ethnicity and  sex differences in salaries, merit pay increases, and separations at each  laboratory, we used multivariate regression techniques. Salaries and merit  pay increases were modeled with Ordinary Least Squares regression, and  separations were modeled with Logistic regression. Race/ethnicity and sex  differences in salaries, merit pay increases, and separations were  considered statistically significant if the probability of the t-statistic or  chi-square value associated with the coefficient was 0.05 or lower. In other  words, we regard race/ethnicity and sex differences in salaries, merit pay  increases, and separations as significant if they have less than a 5 percent  probability of resulting from chance or random fluctuations. Although a  probability of .05 was used as a minimum indicator of statistical  significance, results for women\u2019s salaries at all five laboratories had  probabilities of .001 or less. That is, the observed sex differences in salaries  have, at most, a 1 in 1,000 chance of reflecting only random fluctuations in  salaries. We chose this analytic design because it (1) is widely used in  human capital literature to evaluate differences in compensation and other  employment-related subjects, (2) allowed for the most straightforward and  parallel analysis of the laboratories\u2019 personnel data, and (3) is an  appropriate statistical method for answering our first objective.", "The models for salaries, merit pay increases, and separations included  variables commonly used to explain variation in personnel actions, such as  education level, age, and laboratory tenure. In addition, we included  laboratory-specific variables, such as occupational category and  organizational division, to control for the laboratory\u2019s unique classification  system for comparing similarly situated individuals. Including these  variables allowed us to determine whether pay differences between women  and men and minorities and Whites existed despite their equality in  position and in other human capital characteristics, such as tenure and  education level. We controlled for these factors because they are widely  used in human capital models, are generally used by the laboratories in  their compensation analysis, and are available from all six laboratories. We  also included model-specific adjustment variables. For example, we  included a salary variable in the merit pay increase model because merit  pay increases are proportional to salary. Additionally, because we were  analyzing 3-1/2 years of data, we included variables to adjust for  nonconstant demographic data in the salary and merit pay increase models.  The variables included in the salary models account for 88, 88, 95, 91, 85,  and 96 percent of the variance in salaries at Argonne, Brookhaven, Idaho,  Lawrence Berkeley, Oak Ridge, and Pacific Northwest, respectively. The  variables included in the merit pay increase models account for 76, 74, 78,  69, 75, and 63 percent of the variance in merit pay increases at Argonne,  Brookhaven, Idaho, Lawrence Berkeley, Oak Ridge, and Pacific Northwest,  respectively.", "Salary and merit pay increases represent an average for the 3-1/2-year  period, adjusting for the length of time employees were on board during  that period. In accordance with economic analysis literature, we used the  natural log of salary and merit pay increases in our models. Separations  from the laboratory include voluntary actions, such as retirements and  resignations, and nonvoluntary actions, such as terminations for cause. If  employees terminated their employment at a laboratory for any reason in  the 3-1/2-year period, they were coded as having separated. Temporary and  term employees were not included in the separation analyses.", "We reviewed our final models with the laboratories and performed  additional analyses in response to some of their concerns. In particular, for  the salary analysis of one laboratory, the laboratory considered  performance score an important factor in determining pay and includes  that control in its own analyses of pay. Because we included both  temporary staff\u2014who typically do not receive performance scores\u2014and  permanent staff in our analyses, we did not include performance score. To  address the laboratory\u2019s concerns, we analyzed permanent staff only and  included a control for average performance score. No material changes in  the estimate for women\u2019s salaries resulted from the inclusion of average  performance score. Additionally, the laboratory considered tenure within  grade to be an important control, so we included this control in the salary  analysis for the same laboratory, which also resulted in no material change  to the estimate for women\u2019s salaries. Finally, one laboratory did not have  tenure within grade in their database, but considered it an important factor  in their pay equity studies. Consequently, we included a control indicating  whether someone received a promotion in the 3-1/2-year period in the  salary analysis as a proxy for tenure within grade. Our assumption was that  more recent changes in pay grade should show the greatest effect on salary  within grade, if tenure within grade is an important explanatory factor in  salary differences. There were no material changes in the estimate of  women\u2019s salaries when including this control for promotion. Because there  were no material changes in the results of these additional analyses, we  reported the results of our original analyses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Promotions and the 80 Percent Rule", "paragraphs": ["To determine whether promotions of management and professional women  and minorities reflect the diversity of the potential applicant pool (other  managers and professionals), we applied the 80 percent rule set out in the  federal government\u2019s Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection  Procedures. We did not analyze promotions of nonmanagerial or  nonprofessional staff because the applicant pools were either external to  the laboratories or were from job categories within the laboratories that we  did not examine. The potential applicant pool consists of exempt,  permanent laboratory staff in managerial or professional positions at any  time in the 3-1/2-year period.", "Using the 80 percent rule, we first determined the proportion of  promotions for each race/ethnicity and sex group based on the number of  promotions received in the 3-1/2-year period and the total number of  laboratory staff in each group. We then determined whether the  proportions for minority men and women and White women represented at  least 80 percent of the proportion for White men. Since there are a limited  number of promotions every year, we examined promotions for the entire  3-1/2-year period. We did not include postdoctoral and limited-term  employees in our promotion analysis because they do not receive  promotions. If a personnel action denoted either a competitive or career  promotion, the race/ethnicity and sex of the employee receiving the  promotion was recorded. If an individual received more than one  promotion in the 3-1/2-year period, the individual was counted as having  one promotion. The number of individuals needed to reach 80 percent of  the White male promotion rate was rounded down. For example, where a  minority group was short of the 80 percent promotion rate by 2.8 people,  that group would be reported as being 2 people short. Unlike the analyses  of salaries, merit pay increases, and separations, we did not control for any  factors that might influence the likelihood of promotion.
