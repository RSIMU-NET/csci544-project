DOD Comptroller and military service financial management and comptroller officials responsible for the department's ADA programs have stated that because of weaknesses in DOD's business operations, knowledgeable personnel are critical to improving the department's funds control, and these officials have or are developing training courses. However, only the Army has attempted to identify and determine whether key funds control personnel have received appropriate training to provide them with the knowledge and skills to fulfill their responsibilities, including the ADA, required by DOD regulations. GAO's analysis of the 54 ADA cases and other documentation provided by the military services disclosed that the military services did not fully comply with DOD regulations intended to ensure that ADA reviews and investigations were conducted by qualified and independent personnel and were completed in a timely manner. More specifically, GAO found the following: (1) Only 6 of the 66 investigating officers assigned to the 54 ADA cases reviewed had received all of the required training. (2) Nineteen of the 54 ADA cases lacked documentation needed to determine whether the investigating officer was organizationally independent. Further, because the military services focused on organizational independence, they could not be assured that investigating officers were free of personal or external impairments to independence. ? ADA investigations were generally not completed within the 15 months and 25 days set forth by DOD. Of the 54 ADA cases reviewed, 22 cases took over 30 months to complete and only 16 were completed on time. GAO also noted that DOD, as required, reported the 34 cases in which it had concluded that an ADA violation had occurred to the President and the Congress, with a copy to GAO. For the remaining 20 cases, DOD concluded that an ADA violation had not occurred and therefore external reporting was not required. Further, DOD has taken steps to improve transparency over the ADA investigation process by requiring DOD components to report status information when an ADA investigation is initiated. Additionally, for the 34 ADA cases in which DOD concluded that an ADA violation had occurred, the nature of the disciplinary actions taken and reported to the President and the Congress was consistent with the criteria set forth in the DOD regulations. The ADA requires that employees who are responsible for ADA violations be subject to appropriate administrative discipline. The DOD regulations specify that administrative discipline can range from no action to the termination of the individual's employment."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies, including the Department of Defense (DOD), are  responsible for ensuring that appropriated funds are used only for  purposes, and within the amount and time frames, prescribed by the  Congress.

To comply with legal and regulatory requirements, DOD must  implement and maintain administrative controls that ensure the proper  use of its appropriated funds, including the use of accounting and funds  control systems that are able to accurately record obligations, collections,  and disbursements against appropriations and the accounts established to  track the status of appropriations. DOD financial management has been on  our high-risk list since 1995 because of the department\u2019s continuing  inability to provide accurate, timely, and complete financial and  performance information for management use and reporting.", "The Antideficiency Act (ADA) prohibits any DOD officer or employee  from incurring obligations or making expenditures in excess or in advance  of appropriations or apportionments.

Further, when DOD  determines that a violation of one of the ADA\u2019s proscriptions has  occurred, the ADA requires DOD to \u201creport immediately to the President  and Congress all relevant facts and a statement of actions taken\u201d and to  submit a copy to the Comptroller General at the same time.", "On January 17, 2007, the DOD Acting Inspector General testified before  the Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support, Senate  Committee on Armed Services, on potential violations of the ADA at DOD.  Based on the DOD Acting Inspector General\u2019s testimony, the committee  expressed concerns about the volume of potential ADA violations, the  pace and transparency of ADA investigations, and DOD\u2019s process for  preventing, identifying, investigating, and reporting potential ADA  violations. Senate Report No. 110-77, which accompanied the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, directed GAO to review  the department\u2019s ADA procedures for preventing, identifying,  investigating, and reporting ADA violations and the disciplinary actions  taken when violations occur. More specifically, the Senate report  identified seven areas of congressional interest, which we have grouped  into three objectives, as outlined in table 1.", "This report presents more details regarding the preliminary observations  we provided on July 28, 2008, in response to the Senate report. To address  the first objective, we reviewed prior GAO and DOD Inspector General  audit reports and OMB and GAO guidance to obtain an understanding of  the deficiencies in DOD\u2019s funds control systems, processes, and internal  controls that impede its ability to prevent or identify ADA violations. DOD  has acknowledged the financial management weaknesses reported by  GAO and DOD auditors and the impact these weaknesses have on the  reliability of the department\u2019s financial information. As a result, we did not  perform additional work to substantiate the adequacy of DOD\u2019s financial  management environment and internal controls. We interviewed DOD and  military service personnel and reviewed documentation, such as the DOD  Financial Management Regulation (FMR) and military service training  curricula, to ascertain whether the military services had processes in place  to identify and ensure that key funds control personnel are trained.", "To address the second objective, we reviewed the DOD FMR and  interviewed appropriate officials within the DOD Comptroller and military  services\u2019 financial management and comptroller offices responsible for the  ADA programs at DOD or the military services to identify DOD criteria  pertaining to the qualifications, training, and independence requirements  of investigating officers and the reporting of ADA cases. Additionally, we  reviewed the President\u2019s Council on Integrity and Efficiency/Executive  Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE/ECIE) Quality Standards for  Investigations to obtain an understanding of qualification, independence,  and due professional care standards applicable to investigations. To  assess investigating officers\u2019 qualifications, we focused our review on  whether the investigating officers had received training and if there was an  internal control in place to ensure that the investigating officers did not  have any personal, organizational, or external impairments to their ability  to conduct impartial and independent investigations.", "To address the third objective, we interviewed DOD Comptroller and  military service financial management and comptroller officials  responsible for ADA programs at DOD or the military services and  reviewed DOD\u2019s metrics for tracking and reporting on preliminary reviews  and formal investigations of potential ADA violations and the results of all  54 Army, Navy, and Air Force formal ADA investigations closed by DOD  in fiscal years 2006 and 2007. We did not assess whether the conclusions  reached by DOD for the 54 closed ADA cases or the disciplinary actions  taken on the 34 cases for which DOD concluded that an ADA violation had  occurred were appropriate.

As late as the  post-Civil War period, it was not uncommon for agencies to incur  obligations in excess, or in advance, of appropriations. Perhaps most  egregious of all, some agencies would spend their entire appropriations  during the first few months of the fiscal year, continue to incur  obligations, and then return to the Congress for appropriations to fund  these \u201ccoercive deficiencies.\u201d These were obligations to others who had  fulfilled their part of the bargain with the United States and who now had  at least a moral\u2014and in some cases also a legal\u2014right to be paid. The  Congress felt it had no choice but to fulfill these commitments, but the  frequency of deficiency appropriations played havoc with the United  States\u2019 budget. The Congress expanded the ADA several times throughout  the 20th century to require and enforce apportionments and agency  subdivisions of apportionments to achieve more effective control and  conservation of funds.", "The ADA contains both affirmative requirements and specific prohibitions,  as highlighted below. The ADA:    Prohibits the incurring of obligations or the making of expenditures in  advance or in excess of an appropriation. For example, an agency officer  may not award a contract that obligates the agency to pay for goods and  services before the Congress makes an appropriation for the cost of such a  contract or that exceeds the appropriations available.", "Requires the apportionment of appropriated funds and other budgetary  resources for all executive branch agencies. An apportionment may divide  amounts available for obligation by specific time periods (usually  quarters), activities, projects, objects, or a combination thereof.

As a result, DOD could not determine whether any of the write-off  amounts, had they been charged to the proper appropriation, would have  caused an ADA violation.", "Pervasive business system, process, and control weaknesses  acknowledged by the department have hindered DOD\u2019s ability to prevent,  identify, investigate, and report ADA violations. Recent reports by the  DOD Inspector General indicate that the weak control environment  continues to exist today. For instance:  In November 2006 and 2007, the DOD Inspector General reported, and the  department acknowledged, that it continues to have significant internal  control deficiencies that impede its ability to produce accurate and  reliable information on the results of its operations. These deficiencies  adversely affect the ability of the department\u2019s financial management  systems to reliably and accurately record accounting entries and report  financial information, such as its fund balance with Treasury, accounts  payable, and accounts receivable.

The DOD Inspector General noted numerous internal  control weaknesses in contract formation and funding, funds control,  vendor payment, and financial accounting. According to the report, these  weaknesses represent a high risk that violations of laws and regulations  not only occurred, but will likely continue to occur if corrective action is  not taken.", "As part of its long-term initiative to address such weaknesses, the  department has embarked upon a massive effort to transform its business  operations, including financial management. Over the next several years,  the department will be spending billions of dollars to implement these  systems. However, it will be a number of years before the department\u2019s  business system modernization efforts are complete, and as we have  previously reported, DOD has encountered challenges in developing  systems that meet time frame, cost, and functionality goals. Until DOD  can successfully transform its business operations, including  implementation of effective business processes, controls, and systems, the  department\u2019s ability to ensure proper funds control and compliance with  the ADA will continue to be impaired. Until then, mitigating controls,  including knowledgeable personnel, will be key to effective funds control.
