According to SBA guidance, lenders making 7(a) loans must take steps to ensure and document that borrowers meet the program's credit elsewhere requirement. However, GAO noted a number of concerns with SBA's monitoring efforts. Specifically, GAO found the following:", "Over 40 percent (17 of 40) of the on-site lender reviews performed in fiscal year 2016 identified lender noncompliance with the requirement.", "On-site reviewers identified several factors, such as weakness in lenders' internal control processes that were the cause for lender noncompliance.", "Most on-site reviewers did not document their assessment of lenders' policies or procedures, because SBA does not require them to do so. As a result SBA does not have information that could help explain the high noncompliance rate.", "Federal internal control standards state that management should design control activities, including appropriate documentation, and use quality information to achieve the entity's objectives. Without better information on lenders' procedures for complying with the documentation requirement, SBA may be limited in its ability to promote compliance with requirements designed to help ensure that the 7(a) program reaches its target population.", "SBA does not routinely collect or analyze information on the criteria used by lenders for credit elsewhere justifications. SBA recently began collecting some information on lenders' use of the criteria, but this information is limited, and SBA does not analyze the information that it does collect to better understand lenders' practices. Federal internal control standards state that management should use quality information to achieve the entity's objectives. Without more robust information and analysis, SBA may be limited in its ability to understand how lenders are using the credit elsewhere criteria and identify patterns of use by certain lenders that place them at a higher risk of not reaching borrowers who cannot obtain credit from other sources at reasonable terms.", "In general, representatives from 8 of 11 lenders that GAO interviewed stated that SBA's credit elsewhere criteria are adequate for determining small business eligibility for the 7(a) program. These criteria help them target their lending to small businesses that would otherwise have difficulty obtaining conventional credit because they are often new businesses or have a shortage of collateral. However, they also said that other factors\u2014such as lender policies and economic conditions\u2014can affect their decisions to offer 7(a) loans. In January 2018, SBA issued revised guidance for the 7(a) program and has provided training on this new guidance to lenders and trade associations.

In July 2015, SBA was forced to  suspend 7(a) lending after the program hit its $18.75 billion annual loan  ceiling with more than 2 months left in the fiscal year. Congress  subsequently raised the loan ceiling to $23.5 billion and further to $27.5  billion in fiscal year 2017. In response to this growth, members of  Congress have raised concerns about guaranteed loans going to  borrowers that are able to obtain conventional credit at reasonable terms  and whether the criteria currently used to satisfy the credit elsewhere  requirement provide reasonable assurance that guaranteed loans are  approved for only qualified borrowers.", "The Joint Explanatory Statement of the Consolidated Appropriations Act,  2017, includes a provision for us to conduct a study of the credit  elsewhere requirement, including the sufficiency of the credit elsewhere  criteria.

The  guarantee assures the lender that if a borrower defaults on a loan, the  lender will receive an agreed-upon portion (generally between 50 percent  and 85 percent) of the outstanding balance. For a majority of 7(a) loans,  SBA relies on lenders with delegated authority to approve and service  7(a) loans and to ensure that borrowers meet the program\u2019s eligibility  requirements. To be eligible for the 7(a) program, a business must be an  operating for-profit small firm (according to SBA\u2019s size standards) located  in the United States and must meet the credit elsewhere requirement.", "Because the 7(a) program is required to serve borrowers who cannot  obtain conventional credit at reasonable terms, lenders making 7(a) loans  must take steps to ensure that borrowers meet the program\u2019s credit  elsewhere requirement. Because SBA relies on lenders with delegated  authority to make these determinations, SBA\u2019s oversight of these lenders  is particularly important. However, we found in a 2009 report that SBA\u2019s  lack of guidance to lenders on how to document compliance with the  credit elsewhere requirement was impeding the agency\u2019s ability to  oversee compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement. To improve SBA\u2019s oversight of lenders\u2019 compliance with the credit elsewhere  requirement, we recommended in 2009 that SBA issue more detailed  guidance to lenders on how to document their compliance with the credit  elsewhere requirement. As a result, SBA revised its standard operating  procedure to state that each loan file must contain documentation that  specifically identifies the factors in the present financing that meet the  credit elsewhere test, which we believe met the spirit of our  recommendation.", "SBA\u2019s current credit elsewhere criteria for determining 7(a) loan eligibility  include the following factors:  1.  the business needs a longer maturity than the lender\u2019s policy permits;  2.  the requested loan exceeds the lender\u2019s policy limit regarding the  amount that it can lend to one customer;  3.  the collateral does not meet the lender\u2019s policy requirements;  4.  the lender\u2019s policy normally does not allow loans to new businesses or  businesses in the applicant\u2019s industry; or  5.  any other factors relating to the credit which, in the lender\u2019s opinion,  cannot be overcome except for the guarantee.", "When the 7(a) program was first implemented, borrowers were generally  required to show proof of credit denials from banks that documented,  among other things, the reasons for not granting the desired credit.  Similar requirements remained in effect until 1985, when SBA amended  the rule to permit a lender\u2019s certification made in its application for an  SBA guarantee to be sufficient documentation. This certification  requirement remained when the rule was rewritten in 1996. SBA stated  that it believed requiring proof of loan denials was demoralizing to small  businesses and unenforceable by SBA.", "SBA and lender roles vary among 7(a) program categories\u2014including  regular 7(a), the Preferred Lenders Program, and SBA Express. Under  the regular (nondelegated) 7(a) program, SBA makes the loan approval  decision, including the credit determination. Under the Preferred Lenders  Program and SBA Express, SBA delegates to the lender the authority to  make loan approval decisions, including credit determinations, without  prior review by SBA. For each 7(a) program category, lenders are  required to ensure that borrowers meet the credit elsewhere requirement  for all 7(a) loans. The maximum loan amount under the SBA Express  program is $350,000, as opposed to $5 million for other 7(a) loans. The  program allows lenders to utilize, to the maximum extent possible, their  own credit analyses and loan underwriting procedures. In return for the  expanded authority and autonomy provided by the program, SBA Express  lenders agree to accept a maximum SBA guarantee of 50 percent. Other  7(a) loans generally have a maximum guarantee of 75 percent or 85  percent, depending on the loan amount.

The office is responsible for  managing all activities regarding lender reviews; preparing written reports;  evaluating new programs; and recommending changes to existing  programs to assess risk potential. Generally, the office oversees SBA  lenders to identify unacceptable risk profiles using its risk rating system  and enforce loan program requirements. According to SBA\u2019s standard  operating procedures, one of the agency\u2019s purposes of its monitoring and  oversight activities is to promote responsible lending that supports SBA\u2019s  mission to increase access to capital for small businesses.", "In the federal budget, the 7(a) program is generally required to set fees  that it charges to lenders and borrowers at a level to cover the estimated  cost of the program associated with borrower defaults (in present value  terms). To offset some of the costs of the program, such as default costs,  SBA assesses lenders two fees on each 7(a) loan. First, depending on  the term of the loan, the guarantee fee must be paid by the lender within  either 90 days of loan approval or 10 business days of the SBA loan  number being assigned. This fee is based on the amount of the loan  and the level of the guarantee, and lenders can pass the fee on to the  borrower. Second, the servicing fee must be paid annually by the lender  and is based on the outstanding balance of the guaranteed portion of the  loan.", "The 7(a) program accounts for a small portion of total small business  lending. According to a May 2017 report by the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau, the total debt financing available to small businesses  was estimated to be $1.4 trillion. Of that amount, the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau estimated that about 7 percent was SBA loans,  including 7(a) loans.", "SBA and some other researchers have suggested that there may be  disparities in credit access among small businesses, based on  characteristics of the borrower and firm.
