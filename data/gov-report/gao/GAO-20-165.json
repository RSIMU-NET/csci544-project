GAO found that for 21 of the 27 physician and dental specialties, the maximum cash compensation was less than the private sector civilian median within four officer pay grades (O-3 to O-6) (see figure for number of physician specialties by pay grade).

Of this $1.8 billion, $710.1 million, or 40 percent of the total, was used to  recruit and retain DOD\u2019s nearly 15,000 active-duty physicians and  dentists. DOD also invests in programs to create a pipeline of future  military physicians and dentists. For example, to educate medical and  dental students in its Health Professions Scholarship Program (the  scholarship program), DOD spent approximately $212 million in fiscal  year 2018. Despite these investments, DOD has faced challenges in  recruiting and retaining the desired number of physicians and dentists in  required critical specialties, including those needed for wartime or  operational deployments. Such challenges include national shortages in  certain specialties and competition with the private sector. Moreover, the  Association of American Medical Colleges projects national shortages to  continue.", "DOD\u2019s primary method of meeting its needs for physicians and dentists is  to recruit medical students through the scholarship program and the  Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (the University).  DOD pays for recruits\u2019 medical or dental school and provides additional  financial incentives, such as a stipend for its scholarship program  students or salary for those attending the University. In return for this  investment, participants accrue an active-duty service obligation.  Recently, DOD has begun to consider changes to the active-duty service  obligation as a means to address personnel shortages. For example, in  its February 2019 interim report on developing a personnel management  plan for trauma-related wartime medical specialties, DOD stated that  some actions, such as increased service obligations paired with  increased benefits, may be required in order to close the gaps between  authorized and filled positions.", "Our recent work reviewing the recruitment and retention of physicians  assessed the extent to which DOD was able to fill its authorized positions.  Specifically, in February 2018 we found that each of the three military  departments experienced gaps for a number of active-duty military  physician specialties, including those considered critically short wartime  specialties. Specifically, we found that DOD\u2019s use of its recruitment and  retention programs was not fully addressing military physician gaps in  certain critical specialties, in part because DOD did not have targeted and  coordinated strategies for reducing such gaps. We recommended that  each of the military departments develop targeted strategies to use their  recruitment and retention programs collectively to address key military  physician gaps in a coordinated manner, and develop metrics to monitor  the effectiveness of their programs in reducing gaps. DOD concurred with  the recommendations and, according to DOD officials, a DOD working  group has been formed to produce a plan by June 2020 to address  recruitment and retention of critical specialties.", "We also recently assessed DOD\u2019s recruitment and retention of dentists.  Specifically, in December 2018 we found that the three military  departments experienced gaps in certain dental specialties, including  critically short wartime specialties. Moreover, we reported that while the  military departments rely on incentives such as special pays to recruit and  retain military dentists, they did not know the extent to which some of  these programs have been effective in achieving their goals because they  have not evaluated their effectiveness. We recommended, among other  things, that the military departments ensure that their Surgeons General  evaluate the effectiveness of their respective recruitment and retention  programs for military dentists. DOD concurred with the recommendation  and, according to DOD officials, efforts are underway and a study will be  done to determine the effectiveness of the recruitment and retention  programs for military dentists, including the need for the incentives  currently offered.

To  compare cash compensation for military physicians and dentists to  comparable private sector civilian specialties, we estimated military cash  compensation using information reported in DOD\u2019s Greenbook  publication and Health Professions Officer Special and Incentive Pay  Plan and compared that to private sector civilian compensation  information reported in surveys from the American Medical Group  Association and American Dental Association. We selected 2017  because it was the most recent year of available data amongst all of our  sources. To determine the reliability and accuracy of private sector civilian  compensation information, we checked these data for reasonableness  and the presence of any obvious or potential errors in accuracy and  completeness. We believe the data are sufficiently reliable for the  purpose of this report. To describe the deferred and noncash benefits  available to military physicians and dentists, we reviewed our reports,  other relevant research, and DOD reports. To develop estimates of the  value of DOD\u2019s two retirement benefit programs, we used DOD\u2019s  publically-available retirement calculators. To help determine the reliability  and accuracy of DOD\u2019s retirement calculators, we checked the data for  reasonableness and the presence of any obvious or potential errors in  accuracy and completeness and interviewed DOD officials  knowledgeable about the data. We believe the data are sufficiently  reliable for the purpose of this report. We also interviewed DOD officials  to confirm our understanding of military cash compensation, and to obtain  their perspectives on our approach to comparing military and private  sector civilian cash compensation and estimating retirement benefit  estimates.", "To address our second objective, we reviewed pay plans, policies, and  other documents developed by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Health Affairs (ASD(HA)) and the respective military  departments concerning DOD\u2019s approach to recruitment and retention of  military physicians and dentists. We also interviewed officials from the  Office of the ASD(HA) and the military departments concerning their  decision-making process in managing this package of incentives. We  compared this information with seven key principles of effective human  capital management which we identified in our February 2017 report on  military compensation. As we stated in that report, to identify key  principles of effective human capital management, we reviewed a  compilation of GAO\u2019s body of work on human capital management,  DOD\u2019s Report of the Eleventh Quadrennial Review of Military  Compensation, and the DOD Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan 2012  - 2017. In addition to these key principles, we also compared aspects of  DOD\u2019s approach to recruitment and retention of military physicians and  dentists against federal internal control standards, which state  management should use quality information to achieve an entity\u2019s  objectives, and highlighted areas where DOD\u2019s approach differed from  these principles.", "To address our third objective, we conducted two web-based surveys with  medical students who have either accepted the scholarship or are  attending the University to obtain information on the students\u2019 perceptions  on their willingness to accept different lengths of service obligations,  among other topics. We selected scholarship program and University  participants from a stratified random sample of medical students in their  first, second, or third year of school, by military department. Our  unweighted survey response rate was 60.5 percent for scholarship  program participants and 80 percent from University students, with 624  and 259 respondents, respectively. Based on this, we determined that the  data collected from the surveys are generalizable. We developed  sampling weights per stratum and adjusted for any potential bias. All  survey estimates, including margin of errors, presented in this report  reflect the sample design and use the adjusted sampling weights.", "We also conducted eight focus group meetings at three military treatment  facilities\u2014two each with Army, Navy, and Air Force medical residents and  two cross-departmental pilot focus groups\u2014with military medical  residents who had previously either accepted the scholarship or attended  the University. We conducted these focus groups to obtain participants\u2019  perspectives on issues related to (1) the nature of active-duty service  obligations, including their willingness to accept different lengths of active- duty service obligations; (2) the relative importance of the service  obligations in relation to other factors at different decision points,  including accepting the scholarship or attending the University; (3)  participating in a military residency program; and (4) choosing a medical  specialty to pursue. To identify focus group participants, we considered  gender, number of residents who had accepted the scholarship or  attended the University, medical specialties, military department  affiliation, number of years in a military residency training program, and  prior service as a General Medical Officer. The focus groups involved a  range of seven to 15 participants during each meeting. We did not select  focus group participants using a statistically representative sampling  method, and therefore the information collected from the focus groups is  not generalizable and cannot be projected across DOD, a military department, or any single military treatment facility the team visited. We  also conducted interviews with DOD officials from each of the military  departments to understand their perceptions of active-duty service  obligations and the effect of these obligations on the recruitment and  retention of military physicians and dentists.

Specifically, scholarship program participants  enrolled in a civilian medical or dental school receive paid tuition, books  and fees, and a monthly stipend. In some cases, participants are also  offered an accession bonus. In exchange, scholarship program  participants incur a 6- month active-duty service obligation for each 6  months of benefits received, with a 2-year minimum service obligation.  Students at the University are enrolled in the DOD-sponsored medical  school at no cost, enter active-duty service as medical students and  receive the pay and benefits of an officer at the O-1 pay grade. In  exchange, University medical students accrue a 7-year service obligation.", "Career paths for medical and dental school graduates can differ. For  example, Army and Air Force medical school graduates typically become  specialized before practicing medicine, while 55 percent of Navy  physicians complete a General Medical Officer tour before becoming  specialized, according to department officials. Moreover, dental school  graduates typically practice as general dentists after completing licensure  requirements before choosing to specialize. To become specialized,  medical and dental school graduates apply to a medical or dental  residency training program, which may require or include a 1-year  internship, depending on the program or specialty. After residency, some  physicians or dentists may decide to pursue further training, known as  \u201cfellowships,\u201d in order to become subspecialists. For example, to become  a cardiologist, a physician must complete an internal medicine residency  followed by a cardiology fellowship. Residency training typically requires 3  to 7 years for physicians and 1 to 6 years for dentists. Fellowship  training typically is 1 or more years in length for physicians and dentists.  The required number of years depends on the specialty or subspecialty.  After residency or fellowship training\u2014hereafter referred to collectively as  residency training\u2014physicians and dentists become credentialed and  privileged to practice the specialty or subspecialty that they trained in, and  they are also eligible for board certification. Figure 2 portrays possible  paths to becoming a military physician or dentist.", "As noted earlier, scholarship program medical and dental students incur 6  months of an active-duty service obligation for each 6 months of benefits  received, with a 2-year minimum service obligation; University medical  students accrue a 7-year service obligation. While training in a military  residency program, residents receive the pay and benefits of an officer at  the O-3 pay grade or higher, depending on prior years of service, and  earn creditable years of service toward retirement. In exchange,  participants incur an additional 6 months of an active-duty service  obligation for each 6-months of residency training, with a minimum 2-year  service obligation. However, according to DOD officials, the first year of  postgraduate training (i.e., internship or 1 year of advanced education in  general dentistry and general practice residency) does not accrue a  service obligation and is considered obligation neutral. Currently, the two  sets of obligations\u2014the obligation for medical or dental school and the  obligation for military residency training\u2014are served concurrently, or at  the same time, effectively resulting in the servicemember serving the  longer of the two obligations. For example, a student who accepts a 4- year scholarship, trains in a 1-year internship, and then trains in a 4-year  residency program will serve a total of 9 years. The first 5 years would be  spent in internship and residency, and the final 4 years of this service  would be spent discharging the active-duty service obligations  concurrently (see figure 3, scenario 2).

According to senior military department medical corps officials, the first  unobligated year of service is a key point of retention for military  physicians. A 2012 study of military physicians found that compensation  had a large impact on the decision to remain in the military in the first  unobligated year of service and just a small impact on retention in the  years afterward. For DOD\u2019s scholarship program participants, which  constitute the majority of recruited military physicians, we estimate that  initial service obligation fulfillment typically occurs about 4 years after  successful completion of their residency, or at about 9 years of service.", "We also calculated cash compensation for military medical officers who  (a) completed a 3-year General Medical Officer tour prior to specializing  in a residency, or (b) attended the University and accrued a 7-year active- duty service obligation and found that all but three specialties (pediatrics,  family medicine, and psychiatry) had cash compensation less than the  20th percentile for private sector civilian compensation, and all specialties  were compensated below the median.", "We reviewed 2017 cash compensation for typical military dental officers  across six dental specialties and found that at each of these retention  points, military cash compensation was less than the median private  sector civilian compensation, three of which were below the 25th  percentile (orthodontics, endodontics, and periodontics). According to  senior military department dental corps officials, two key points of  retention for military dentists are (1) after they fulfill their scholarship  service obligation by practicing as a general dentist for several years, and  (2) after they have completed residency training for a dental specialty,  such as orthodontics, and fulfill their residency service obligation. Unlike  their physician counterparts, dental students typically do not begin  residency immediately after graduation. According to military department  dental corps Chiefs, dental student graduates generally complete a 1- year advanced education in general dentistry certificate, which does not  incur a service obligation, then fulfill their dental school active-duty  service obligation as general dentists before taking a general dentist\u2019s  retention bonus and beginning residency training.", "Cash compensation is just one factor that servicemembers may consider  when making the decision to stay with or separate from the military.

Similarly, data from the 2017 DOD  Status of Forces Survey show that among all officers, the most important  factors that would be considered in a decision of whether to stay on  active-duty were the military retirement system and personal  choice/freedoms (e.g. control of where to work), as well as factors such  as opportunities to be assigned to station of choice, family concerns, and  pay and allowances. Moreover, a 2019 study of Army physician service  obligations showed that military physicians who were most likely to  continue serving after completion of their obligation and ultimately retire  were those who had the most years of service accumulated when  obligations were completed.

The services and  officials from the Office of the ASD(HA) participate in the Health  Professions Incentives Working Group to review recruitment and  retention special pay and incentives and recommend adjustment to  amounts offered as necessary. For example, as a result of working  group discussions, DOD officials stated that they established a new 6- year retention bonus in the fiscal year 2019 pay plan for select  medical and dental specialties, in part to ensure greater stability in the  numbers of physicians and dentists within these specialties. Military  department officials stated they plan to identify potential impacts and  determine adjustments, if any, that need to be made. DOD\u2019s report on  military compensation advises officials to identify opportunities for  improvement using analytical tools to model how changes in  compensation might alter the force or career profile. It further states  that taking a structured approach to determining both incentive pay  eligibility criteria and amounts helps force managers optimize their  limited special and incentive pay budgets. Such an approach also  provides a mechanism to periodically conduct a rigorous assessment  of such pays to ensure that they keep pace with changing conditions.", "Identified and evaluated unique staffing issues. According to  military department officials, medical corps and dental corps  community managers, specialty leaders, consultants, and others  actively discuss military physicians\u2019 and dentists\u2019 career plans to help  inform future staffing needs. Moreover, to attract physicians and  dentists in specialties which DOD has identified as a critically short  wartime specialty, DOD offers a Critical Wartime Skills Accession  Bonus. However, as we reported in 2018, military department officials  cited a number of challenges that make it difficult to attract and retain  military physicians and dentists, including national shortages and  competition with the private sector. Incentive pay and retention  bonus amounts are specific to each specialty. DOD\u2019s report on  military compensation states that evaluation of unique staffing issues  identified by community managers should be a core part of a  systematic approach to assessing the application of a special or  incentive pay.

Similarly, we reported in 2018 that DOD and  the military departments had established a set of minimum  qualifications for medical school applicants applying to the scholarship  program and the University.

Specifically, no military department was able  to provide us with a comprehensive assessment of the replacement  cost for military physicians and dentists. Replacement cost  assessments can be found in other occupations within DOD. For  example, in 2017, we reported that the Navy considers the high  replacement costs of its nuclear propulsion personnel\u2014up to  $986,000 per trainee\u2014in justifying a strategy that prioritizes  investment in retention initiatives over new accessions or recruits.  Moreover, DOD requires that the training investment and replacement  cost for those qualified in the skill be considered when justifying the  need for the critical skills retention bonus.

However, it was not collected and used to help inform  investment decisions on a consistent basis. According to officials from  the Office of the ASD(HA) and the military departments, an  assessment of civilian wages is not a driving factor when considering  adjustments to special and incentive pays, in part because DOD  cannot always match civilian sector compensation for military  physicians and dentists.", "Officials from the Office of the ASD(HA) and the military departments  acknowledged the disparity between military and civilian cash  compensation varies by specialty; however, incentive pay and  retention bonus amounts have largely remained the same for over a  decade.

Based on our  comparison of military and civilian cash compensation pay previously  discussed, we found that the gap between military and private sector  civilian varies by specialty and many fall below the civilian private  sector median. Moreover, based on our review of cash compensation  for medical officers who completed their residency directly after  medical school across 21 medical specialties, we found that at their  first unobligated year of service, all 21 specialties had cash  compensation below the private sector civilian median. Additionally,  all but one specialty (psychiatry) were compensated at less than the  20th percentile of private sector civilian compensation.", "Use of assessments of private sector civilian compensation can be  found in other communities within DOD. For example, in 2017, we  reported that the Navy justified its use of selective reenlistment  bonuses for cyber-related occupations by noting the specific level of  starting salaries for comparable civilians. DOD\u2019s report on military  compensation states that reviewing civilian wages is a key element in  assessing the application of a special or incentive pay. Further, it  states that periodic reviews, which should include the use of an  analytical tool or model, will ensure that resources are directed at the  most pressing staffing needs. For example, professions that  consistently command higher pay in the civilian sector\u2014such as the  medical professions\u2014may merit predictable pays over the long term.  Yet in other areas, evolving mission needs, changing conditions in the  civilian market, and other factors may call for increasing an incentive  or, in some cases, may show that additional pay can be reduced or  eliminated.", "According to a former Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and  Readiness and a noted expert on defense personnel issues, DOD  would benefit from analysis to determine the point at which cash  compensation for military physicians, including special and incentive  pays, reaches a minimum threshold of attractiveness compared to the  private sector. Assessing civilian wages could help DOD understand  the relationship of any military and civilian pay discrepancies to its  ability to fill particular specialties. For example, we found that in fiscal  year 2018, all but three of the specialties we reviewed were below 90  percent of authorization by at least one of the services\u2019 active  components. By consistently collecting civilian wage information and  using it to inform its package of incentives, DOD will be better  positioned to make the most effective use of its recruitment and  retention incentives.", "DOD officials stated that their approach to managing the package of  incentives to recruit and retain military physicians and dentists is driven  by a number of considerations. Specifically, DOD officials stated that the  rates of special and incentive pays represent amounts that are affordable  and that the military departments generally believe have allowed them to  meet their personnel needs. Further, military department officials stated  that budget considerations and statutory limitations hinder their ability to  change the rate of special and incentive pays. Current statutory limits to  the amount of the retention bonus, incentive pay, and board certification  pay are $75,000, $100,000, and $6,000, respectively; there is currently no  statutory limit on the critical skills retention bonus for health professionals,  which can be paid in addition to other pays. While we believe these are  valid considerations, collecting information on replacement costs,  retention, and civilian wages would allow the Office of the ASD(HA) and  the military departments to provide greater stewardship of available  funding by ensuring its efficient application. Specifically, Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government state that management  should use quality information to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives. For  example, further analysis of replacement costs could reveal that retention  of fully trained physicians is highly economical for DOD, and provide  strong support for changes to retention incentives to safeguard significant  investment in physicians and dentists.

For  example, information on the replacement costs of physicians and dentists  would help DOD make decisions about whether it is more cost effective to  train or retain these personnel. Further, consistent collection of  information on the extent to which eligible physicians and dentists accept  retention bonuses will help DOD monitor the effectiveness of an incentive  that represents a significant investment by DOD. Our comparison of  military to private sector cash compensation highlighted that military  physicians and dentists generally receive less cash compensation than  their private sector civilian counterparts for most specialties we reviewed.

We performed  our calculations twice, first assuming no tour as a General Medical Officer  and second assuming that physicians completed a 3-year tour as a  General Medical Officer\u2014adding 3 years to their years of service at  service obligation fulfillment. According to Navy medical corps officials, 55  percent of Navy physicians perform such a tour. When assuming no  General Medical Officer tour, the majority of physicians reached this  decision point at the O-4 pay grade with the exception of neurosurgeons  and cardiac/thoracic surgeons, who were at the O-5 pay grade due to  longer residency and fellowship lengths. When assuming a 3-year  General Medical Officer tour, physicians in 12 specialties reached this  point at the O-5 pay grade, with the remaining nine specialties at the O-4  pay grade. We also conducted this analysis for Uniformed Services  University of the Health Sciences (University) students who accrued a 7- year active-duty service obligation. We found that assuming a 7-year  obligation for University students produced the same results as assuming  a 3-year tour as a General Medical Officer for Health Professions  Scholarship Program (scholarship) participants.", "For dentists, we assumed that the dental school and residency  obligations were not served concurrently because, according to the  military department Dental Corps Chiefs, dental student graduates  typically complete a 1-year advanced education in general dentistry  certificate, which does not incur a service obligation, then fulfill their  dental school active-duty service obligation as general dentists before  taking a general dentist\u2019s retention bonus and beginning residency  training. We completed an analysis to understand how the pay grade at  the first year of unobligated service may vary for general dentists who  worked as a general dentist immediately after completing dental school or  completed a 1-year advanced education residency. We found that  general dentists generally reached this decision point at the O-3 pay  grade; endodontists, orthodontists, pedodontists, and periodontists  reached it at the O-4 pay grade, and; oral and maxillofacial surgeons  reached it at the O-5 pay grade.", "Estimates of retirement benefit. To develop estimates of the value of  the defined benefit portion for DOD\u2019s two retirement benefit programs\u2014 the Blended Retirement System (BRS) and the High-Three\u2014we  developed two scenarios for a hypothetical officer who either chose to  remain in the High-Three System or to opt into the BRS.  We used DOD\u2019s  publically-available, online retirement calculators to generate an estimate  for each scenario, which Office of the Under Secretary for Personnel and  Readiness officials described as the best available tools to determine the  value of military retirement benefits.  Specifically, the estimates were for  a physician or dentist who was commissioned as an O-3 officer in 2015  and assumed separation from service at 20 years. For these scenarios,  we developed reasonable estimates to enter into the calculators. For  example, in the personal information section of the calculators we  estimated the pay entry base date assuming that the officer began  earning creditable years of service toward retirement after medical or  dental school and that they began active-duty service as an officer at the  O-3 pay grade in the month of June after the completion of medical or  dental school. The calculators produced an estimate of the present value  estimated retirement benefit at 20 years of service, which is when the  defined benefit portion becomes effective. Estimates were as of August  2019 and included a specific value for the defined benefit. DOD\u2019s  publically available retirement calculators use a discount rate of 5 percent  per year, as of July 2018. We also consulted with a senior DOD official  from the Office of the Under Secretary for Personnel and Readiness to  corroborate the reasonableness of our approach. To help determine the  reliability and accuracy of DOD\u2019s retirement calculators, we checked the  data for reasonableness and the presence of any obvious or potential  errors in accuracy and completeness and interviewed DOD officials  knowledgeable about the data. We believe the data are sufficiently  reliable for the purpose of this report.", "Description of deferred and noncash benefits. To describe deferred  and noncash benefits available to military physicians and dentists, we  reviewed our prior reports, other relevant research, and publically  available reports and information from DOD.

We also interviewed officials from OASD(HA)  and the military departments concerning their decision-making processes  in managing this package of incentives. We compared this information  with seven key principles of effective human capital management, which  was reported in our February 2017 report on military compensation. As  we reported in that report, to identify key principles of effective human  capital management, we reviewed a compilation of our body of work on  human capital management, DOD\u2019s Report of the Eleventh Quadrennial  Review of Military Compensation, and the DOD Diversity and Inclusion  Strategic Plan 2012 - 2017. The seven key principles of effective human  capital management include (1) criteria for making human capital  investments are clearly defined, well-documented, consistently applied,  and transparent; (2) replacement costs of personnel are considered when  deciding to invest in recruitment and retention programs; (3) decisions  regarding human capital investments are based largely on expected  improvement in agency results and implemented in a manner that fosters  top talent; (4) unique staffing issues are identified and evaluated as part  of establishing the incentive structure; (5) opportunities for improvement  are identified and incorporated into the next planning cycle; (6) current  and historical retention data are collected and reviewed as part of efforts  to evaluate effects and performance of human capital investments; and  (7) civilian wages are assessed and plans are updated as needed. In  addition to using the key principles, we also compared aspects of DOD\u2019s  approach to recruitment and retention of military physicians and dentists  with federal internal control standards, which state management should  use quality information to achieve an entity\u2019s objectives, and highlighted  areas where DOD\u2019s approach differed from these principles."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objective 3 \u2013 Perceptions Regarding Active-Duty Service Obligations", "paragraphs": ["For our third objective, to obtain perceptions of (1) military medical  students, (2) residents, and (3) DOD officials regarding active-duty  service obligations, including their effect on recruitment and retention, we  utilized, respectively, (1) web-based surveys of military medical students,  (2) focus groups with military medical residents, and (3) interviews with  knowledgeable officials.", "Surveys. For our third objective, to obtain perceptions of military medical  students regarding active-duty service obligations, including their effect  on recruitment and retention, we conducted two web-based surveys with  a generalizable sample of current scholarship and University medical  students to obtain information on the students\u2019 knowledge of the current  program and willingness to accept different lengths of service obligations  or a change to a consecutive service obligation model (see table 1). One  survey was administered to current scholarship medical students, while  the other was administered to current University medical students. The  questions in both surveys were largely the same. The main differences  reflected the different pay and benefits from accepting a scholarship or  attending the University and the differences in length of active-duty  service obligation. For example, scholarship students receive a monthly  stipend and, sometimes, an accession bonus, while University students  receive the pay and allowances for commissioned officers in the O-1 pay  grade. Scholarship participants incur 6 months of an active-duty service  obligation for each 6 months of scholarship benefits they receive, with a  2-year, minimum  service obligation, while University medical students  accrue a 7-year active-duty service obligation. A full listing of survey  questions is provided in appendix III.", "We worked with our social science survey specialists to develop our  survey questionnaires, applying generally accepted survey design  standards. We conducted pretests of the survey with scholarship and  University students who varied by number of years in medical school and  military service. Pretesting is necessary to ensure common understanding  of terms used and to minimize errors that might occur from respondents  interpreting the questions differently than we intended. During each  pretest, the subject was not provided the draft survey in advance, but  instead was either provided the draft survey at the meeting, or the survey  was emailed to the subject at the beginning of the teleconference. After  the pretester completed the survey, we discussed all survey questions  and response options with the pretester to ensure clarity. We revised the  survey instruments based on the feedback we received during each of the  pretests until clarity issues were reasonably addressed.", "We determined fourth-year medical students were less likely to participate  in the survey for three reasons: (1) they were close to graduating from  medical school at the time the survey instrument was launched; (2) they  lose their school email addresses shortly after graduation; and (3) once  they are out of medical school, they are further removed from the decision  point about either accepting the scholarship or attending the University.  Therefore, we excluded them from the sample population. Dental  students were also excluded from the sample population because they  generally practice as general dentists after graduating from dental school  and before training in a residency program, which differs significantly from  the career paths of scholarship and University medical students.", "We defined our target population to be all medical students in their first,  second, or third school year under the scholarship program or enrolled at  the University. By stratifying, as shown in table 1, the sample allowed us  to estimate any population figure across the service with a predetermined  statistical precision. We determined the target sample size needed to  achieve precision levels of plus or minus 10 percentage points or fewer,  at the 95 percent confidence level. We then increased the sample size  within each stratum for an expected response rate of 25 percent.", "The resulting sample frame included 2,972 students, and we selected a  stratified random sample of 1,355. We stratified the sampling frame into  four mutually exclusive strata based on medical program and service.  One survey was administered to current scholarship medical students  from June 26, 2019 through August 26, 2019; the survey of current  University medical students was administered from June 25, 2019  through August 6, 2019.  We created two administrative email accounts,  one for scholarship medical students and one for the University medical  students, through which we sent an announcement email to the medical  students in our sample population. We administered the survey through a  web-based application and sent an email from the administrative email  accounts stating that the survey was ready to complete. When we  received bounce-back messages, we used secondary email addresses if  available or called students to request updated contact information. To  maximize our response rate, we sent two reminder emails and contacted  nonrespondents by telephone to encourage them to complete the survey.  Also, we took steps in the development of the survey, data collection, and  data analysis to minimize nonsampling errors and help ensure the  accuracy of the answers that were obtained. For example, a social- science survey specialist helped to design the questionnaire, in  collaboration with analysts having subject-matter expertise. Then, as  noted earlier, the draft questionnaire was pretested to ensure that  questions were relevant, clearly stated, and easy to comprehend.", "Our unweighted survey response rate was 60.5 percent for scholarship  students and 80 percent for University students, with 624 and 259  respondents, respectively. Per Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  Standards and Guidelines for Statistical Surveys, a nonresponse bias  analysis should be conducted for a survey with a response rate less than  80 percent (Guideline 3.2.9). The response rate for the survey of  University students met this threshold, and we did not assess the  potential for nonresponse bias. With respect to scholarship students, after  conducting an analysis of propensity of responding to the survey to  identify potential sources of nonresponse bias, we identified differential  student response patterns by military department and marital status.", "We developed sampling weights based on the population size, divided by  the number of sample students within each stratum. Weights were  adjusted for overall nonresponse in University students and nonresponse  by military department and marital status among scholarship students so  that statistical estimates for survey response percentages are  generalizable to the population of students.", "We expressed the precision of our particular sample\u2019s survey responses  as a 95 percent confidence interval. This is the interval that would contain  the actual population value for 95 percent of the samples we could have  drawn. As a result, we were 95 percent confident that each of the  confidence intervals in this report included the true percentages of survey  responses in the study population. All survey response percentage  estimates presented in this report from this survey had a margin of error  of plus or minus 6 percentage points or fewer, unless otherwise noted.", "Focus groups. We also conducted eight focus group meetings with a  nongeneralizable sample of 79 military medical residents at three military  treatment facilities to obtain the perspectives of military medical residents  on issues related to: (1) the nature of active-duty service obligations,  including their willingness to accept different lengths of active-duty service  obligations; (2) the relative importance of the service obligations in  relation to other factors at different decision points, including accepting  the scholarship or attending the University; (3) participating in a military  residency program, and; (4) choosing a medical specialty to pursue.  These meetings involved structured small-group discussions designed to  gain more in-depth information about specific issues that cannot easily be  obtained from single or serial interviews.", "Consistent with typical focus group methodologies, our design included  multiple groups with varying characteristics but some similarity in  experience and responsibility. To identify focus group participants, we  considered gender, number of residents who had accepted the  scholarship or attended the University, medical specialties, military  department affiliation, number of years in a military residency training  program, and prior service as a General Medical Officer. The focus  groups involved a range of seven to 15 participants during each meeting.  We did not select participants using a statistically-representative sampling  method, so the information collected from the focus groups is not  generalizable and, therefore, cannot be projected across DOD, a military  department, or any single military treatment facility we visited.", "The eight focus group sessions included two pilot focus groups at Walter  Reed National Military Medical Center and two sessions for each of the  three military departments (Army, Navy, and Air Force). To identify the  focus group locations, we selected military treatment facilities that  included a diverse mix of medical specialties and a large pool of residents  from which to select participants in order to ensure sufficient participation  in the focus groups. We traveled to military treatment facilities in  Bethesda, Portsmouth, and San Antonio to conduct the focus groups.  Table 2 illustrates the total number of focus group participants  categorized by military treatment facility, military department, and whether  they accepted the scholarship or attended the University.", "To conduct the focus groups, one of our trained facilitators moderated  each of the sessions, following a protocol that included discussion  guidelines and a set of eight questions (see table 3). The focus group  protocol was validated by one of our methodologists with a social science  background and knowledge of small group methods. The same focus  group protocol was used at all military treatment facilities the engagement  team visited, with some minor modifications made after the pilot sessions  at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. We assured participants  that their names would not be directly linked to their responses, and that  the results would generally be reported in the aggregate. Because of the  limitations on the use of data derived from the focus group meetings,  including the nongeneralizable sample and results reported in the  aggregate, we did not rely entirely on focus groups, but rather used  several different methodologies to corroborate and support our  conclusions, including web-based surveys with medical students who  either accepted the scholarship or attended the University, and interviews  with DOD officials.", "We performed a content analysis on the responses to identify common  themes from across the responses to determine their frequencies. For the  qualitative analysis, we developed a standard coding scheme to identify  common themes and determine their frequencies. We also identified  other themes that we determined to be important based on our surveys  with scholarship and University medical students and interviews with  DOD officials.", "To obtain information concerning military dental residents\u2019 views,  perceptions, and feelings on issues related to the nature of active-duty  service obligations, including their willingness to accept different lengths  of service obligations and a change from a concurrent to a consecutive  model of service obligation fulfillment, we conducted two focus group  sessions with 20 Air Force dental residents who were in training at the Air  Force Postgraduate Dental School, Joint Base San Antonio. The focus  group participants had previously accepted the scholarship and varied by  gender, rank, prior military service, dental specialty, and number of years  in dental residency training. These discussions were conducted using a  method and protocol that was similar to the approach for the medical  students.", "After analyzing the results of these two focus groups with military dental  residents and taking into consideration the interviews we conducted with  DOD officials, we determined it was not necessary to conduct further  focus groups with military dental residents or include dental students in  our survey of current scholarship students. Dental students\u2019 career paths  differ in significant ways from medical students\u2019 career paths. According  to DOD officials and residents in the dental focus groups, military dentists  are generally already serving consecutive service obligations by fulfilling  their active-duty service obligation from dental school while serving as  general dentists before training in a military residency program. As a  result, a change from a concurrent to a consecutive service obligation  model may not affect military dentists in a similar way that it would military  physicians.", "Interviews. In addition, we conducted interviews with relevant DOD  officials to understand their position on the effect of the length of active- duty service obligations on recruitment and retention of military physicians  and dentists. Specifically, we interviewed officials from the Office of the  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs; the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness; the Defense Health  Agency, and; various areas within the military departments with  responsibilities related to medical or dental corps recruitment, retention,  and education, such as the Offices of the Surgeons General, Manpower  and Reserve affairs, and medical and dental corps or commands.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2018 to December  2019 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
