All 10 demonstrations were approved to use different coverage strategies or impose new cost sharing requirements, including limiting benefits or imposing deductibles for certain populations.", "The Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) budget neutrality policy and process did not provide assurances that all recently approved demonstrations will be budget neutral. For 4 of 10 demonstrations GAO reviewed, HHS approved spending limits that were based on assumptions of cost growth that were higher than its benchmark rates, and that, in some cases, included costs states never incurred in their base year spending. HHS's benchmark growth rates are the lower of the state's recent growth rates or projections for Medicaid program growth nationwide. For example, HHS approved a spending limit for Arizona's demonstration using outdated information on spending--1982 data that was projected forward--that reflected significantly higher spending than what the state's Medicaid program had actually cost. For Texas, HHS approved a spending limit using a base year that included billions in costs the state had not incurred. GAO found limited support and documentation for the higher-than-benchmark limits HHS approved. If HHS had held the 4 demonstrations' spending to levels suggested by its policy, the 5-year spending limits would have been an estimated $32 billion lower than what was approved; the estimated federal share of this reduction would be about $21 billion.", "For 6 other demonstrations, the approved spending limits reflected the states' actual historical costs or criteria that were specified in law, which HHS followed. In examining HHS's current written budget neutrality policy, GAO found that the policy is outdated and does not include a process for assuring the reliability of the data used to set spending limits. GAO has previously suggested that Congress require HHS to improve its budget neutrality process, in part, by improving the review criteria and methods, and by documenting and making clear the basis for approved limits. In addition to these suggestions, GAO believes HHS needs to take further actions to address the findings in this report."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that HHS update its budget neutrality policy and reexamine spending limits for the Arizona and Texas demonstrations.

Budget neutrality generally is not a statutory  requirement; however, HHS\u2019s policy requires states to show that their  demonstrations will be budget neutral as part of their application to HHS.  Once approved, each demonstration operates under a negotiated budget  neutrality agreement that places a limit on federal Medicaid spending over  the life of the demonstration. In assessing a state\u2019s projected spending  limit, HHS\u2019s policy calls for using estimates of growth that are the lower  of: (1) the state\u2019s historical growth for Medicaid in recent years, or   (2) the President\u2019s budget Medicaid trend rate projected for the nation.  The lower rate is referred to as the benchmark growth rate.", "We have had long-standing concerns with HHS\u2019s policy, process, and  criteria for reviewing and approving section 1115 demonstrations,  including the absence of a federal process for obtaining public input and a  lack of transparency in the basis for approved spending limits. For example, we previously found that although some demonstrations had the  potential to significantly affect beneficiaries, advocates and others had not  had an opportunity to review and provide input prior to the  demonstrations\u2019 approval. In recent years, Congress and HHS, however,  have taken significant steps to improve the review and approval process,  by establishing a public input process at the federal level before  demonstrations are approved. We have also reported that HHS had  approved spending limits that included impermissible costs in the  baselines, that included hypothetical costs in the baselines, or that  exceeded benchmark growth rates. As a result of these findings, we  made recommendations to HHS in 2002 and 2004 to take certain steps to  improve the budget neutrality process, such as (1) clarifying the criteria  for reviewing and approving states\u2019 demonstration spending limits,   (2) better ensuring that valid methods are used to demonstrate budget  neutrality, and (3) documenting material explaining the basis for any  approvals and making the material public.

We also excluded  demonstrations that extended coverage to new populations in response  to Medicaid expansion, which can begin in 2014 under the Patient  Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). We identified  demonstrations submitted by 10 states that met these criteria: Arizona,  the District of Columbia, Idaho, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, New Mexico,  Rhode Island, Texas, and Wisconsin. We reviewed application and  approval documents for each demonstration, and interviewed HHS  officials.

We  also reviewed the documentation for the 10 new comprehensive  demonstrations selected for the first objective and budget neutrality  analyses prepared by the states and submitted to HHS. We examined the  basis of HHS\u2019s approved federal and state combined spending limit for  each demonstration, and determined whether HHS followed its policy for  determining budget neutrality. We then compared the spending limits  approved by HHS with our estimates of the spending limits. We  calculated our estimate of the spending limits in accordance with HHS\u2019s  policy by using the most recent year of expenditures provided by the state  for the base year, and the lower of either the state\u2019s historical average  cost growth rate or the estimate of the Medicaid national growth rate  developed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)  actuary. We then estimated the federal share of the spending limits using  the 2012 Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for each  state. In our assessment, we did not trace the underlying spending and  enrollment data used to develop spending limits to source documentation  on spending or determine whether the baseline expenditures included  impermissible costs. To the extent baseline spending or enrollment were  overstated or understated, our estimates of benchmark spending limits  could also be overstated or understated. We determined that the data  were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of examining the information that  HHS used in making its decisions about budget neutrality.

These demonstrations provide a way for states to innovate  outside of many of Medicaid\u2019s otherwise applicable requirements.

Arizona has operated a comprehensive section 1115  demonstration for many years, under which the majority of the Medicaid  population is enrolled in managed care. Under its previous demonstration,  the state made DSH payments to hospitals, but did not make UPL  payments to its providers because the majority of services were provided  under managed care contracts. UPL payments for services provided  under managed care are generally prohibited under federal regulations. In  March 2011, the state requested to terminate its existing section 1115 demonstration in order to limit coverage of certain adult populations.Subsequently, the state received approval for a new demonstration that  continued the existing managed care delivery system, granted the  authority for the state to make new types of supplemental payments to  providers through a Safety Net Care Pool (SNCP), and expanded  coverage to certain populations.", "Under the demonstration, the state obtained the authority to claim federal  matching funds for new types of supplemental payments made to  providers from SNCP. The state did not commit any state funds for these  supplemental payments and instead relied on the contributions of eligible  government entities for the nonfederal share of payments. According to  HHS officials, because these supplemental payments were created under  the authority of the demonstration, they were not subject to certain federal  requirements that would otherwise apply. For example, officials reported  that they did not consider these to be DSH payments and therefore the  federal reimbursement for SNCP payments exceeds the maximum  amount Arizona is allowed to receive under its DSH allotment. They  were not considered to be UPL payments and therefore could be made  even when services were provided under a managed care contract.  According to HHS officials, the terms and conditions of the demonstration  defined requirements for these payments. For example, under the terms  and conditions, as the SNCP payments were Medicaid payments, HHS  required they be subject to certain requirements when made to DSH  hospitals. Specifically, SNCP payments received for inpatient or  outpatient hospital costs were required to be counted against each  hospital\u2019s annual DSH payment limit.", "The terms and conditions of Arizona\u2019s demonstration also included other  federal requirements and limits for the SNCP payments.

Specifically, the state was approved to  make payments to hospital trauma centers, hospital emergency  departments, and rural hospitals across the state for clinical,  professional, and operational costs.

Prior to the demonstration, the state provided services to most of the  state\u2019s Medicaid population on a fee-for-service basis. Under this system,  hospitals provided services to Medicaid-covered individuals and then  submitted bills to the state for reimbursement based on the state\u2019s regular  Medicaid payment rates. In addition, the state made DSH payments and  UPL payments for hospital services provided on a fee-for-service basis.", "Under the demonstration, HHS approved two new types of supplemental  payments to be distributed through two funding pools. In creating these  pools, the state did not commit any state funds and instead relied on the  contributions of eligible government entities for the nonfederal share of  payments.

Under the second pool, called the Delivery System Reform Incentive  Payment (DSRIP) pool, the state could obtain federal matching funds on  provider payments totaling up to $11.4 billion over the 5-year term of the  demonstration. The demonstration significantly increased the amount of  federal funding Texas could claim for the two new types of supplemental  payments. For example, in fiscal year 2011\u2014the year prior to the  demonstration\u2014the state claimed federal matching funds on about   $2.6 billion in UPL payments.

Officials told us the UC pool payments also were not considered to be UPL payments and could be  made for services provided to individuals enrolled in managed care.

At the time Texas\u2019s demonstration was approved, PPACA  required all states to expand Medicaid coverage to a new mandatory  category of low-income individuals, and states were eligible to receive  enhanced federal funding for this population beginning in January of  2014. However, subsequent to this approval, the U.S. Supreme Court  ruled that any state that chooses not to expand Medicaid coverage will  not be subject to a penalty of losing Medicaid funding for the entire  program, and instead will only forego the enhanced funding for that  population, therefore making the expansion a choice for the states. In  June 2013, a state law was enacted that would prohibit the state Medicaid  agency from expanding Medicaid coverage. In general, HHS can  withdraw authorities to claim federal funding for expenditures under  demonstrations in certain circumstances, including if it determines that  the approval no longer promotes the objectives of the Medicaid program.  However, HHS officials stated that the delivery system improvements that  will result from the DSRIP pool payments will benefit low-income and  Medicaid populations, whether the state expands Medicaid or not.

If HHS had held spending  limits in the four demonstrations to levels suggested by its policy, we  estimate that the spending limits would have been $32 billion lower over  the 5-year term of the demonstrations.

HHS officials reported that their policy and process allow for  negotiations in determining spending limits, including adjustments to the  benchmark policy. However, HHS\u2019s policy does not specify criteria and  methods for such adjustments or the documentation and support needed  for adjustments. We found that the criteria and methods for making the  adjustments in these states were not always clear or well supported. Our  estimates show that, had HHS used benchmark growth rates and actual  base year costs, the 5-year spending limits would have been almost   $32 billion dollars lower than what was actually approved. The federal  share of the $32 billion reduction would constitute an estimated   $21 billion. (See table 1.)", "HHS departed from its policy in selecting base year expenditures and  benchmark growth rates for the approved Arizona spending limit without a  clear rationale. Had actual base year expenditures and benchmark  growth rates been used, the 5-year spending limit would have totaled  about $26 billion less. HHS established the largest portion of the Arizona  spending limit, per person spending, using an outdated baseline of  projections of the costs of operating the program without the  demonstration. The projections were based on the estimated costs of  operating the program developed for the state\u2019s previous demonstration\u2014 initially approved in 1982\u2014and adjusted forward to 2011. HHS\u2019s policy  indicates that the spending limits for new demonstrations should be  based on actual expenditures in the base year. Arizona\u2019s actual  expenditures in 2011\u2014the base year for the demonstration had HHS  approved a spending limit based on its policy\u2014were much lower than the  projected costs used by HHS as the basis of the spending limit. HHS  officials said that the agency was not able to estimate the cost of the  Arizona Medicaid program without the demonstration using recent actual  expenditure data, because the state\u2019s Medicaid program had operated  under a demonstration since 1982. We found that HHS\u2019s rationale for  relying on 30-year-old projections of what the Medicaid program would  have cost without the demonstration was unsupported. Actual  expenditure data were available and would more accurately reflect state  spending under Medicaid than the old projections that were based on the  state operating without a Medicaid program. We estimate that HHS\u2019s use  of projected costs rather than actual expenditures for the base year  increased the spending limit by about $22 billion.", "HHS\u2019s approved spending limit for Arizona also used growth rates for  certain populations that were higher than the benchmark growth rates  suggested by agency policy. The rates HHS used reflected national  growth rates, which were higher than the state historical growth rates  based on actual state historical expenditures. (See table 2.) Instead, HHS  compared national growth rates to the projected state growth approved as  part of the state\u2019s previous demonstration, developed 30 years earlier.  Officials also told us that they did not consider comparing the national  growth rates to the state\u2019s historical growth rates derived from actual state  expenditures because it was unclear if these expenditures would have  occurred absent the demonstration. However, without the demonstration,  Arizona would not have a Medicaid program. In addition, the previously  approved rate does not appear to be a valid substitute given the large  difference between that rate and the growth rates indicated by actual  historical expenditure data. We estimate that HHS\u2019s use of the previously  projected growth rates rather than actual state expenditures to derive the  benchmark growth rate increased the approved 5-year spending limit by  about $4.2 billion.", "For the Indiana demonstration, HHS approved a spending limit that was  based on a projected growth rate that exceeded the benchmark growth  rate without clear support for doing so. Had HHS used the benchmark  growth rate, the demonstration\u2019s 5-year spending limit would have been  an estimated $416 million lower. While HHS developed growth rates  based on only 3 of the 5 years of historical data, HHS documented that  the most recent 2 years of data reflected large decreases in spending  from the state\u2019s increased use of managed care and that these changes  in spending were a onetime effect that likely would not continue. We  determined that HHS had adequately explained and documented its  reason for making this adjustment. However, we found that HHS did not  have adequate support for approving a 4.4 percent growth rate for all four  populations included in the demonstration, when the historical data  provided by the state showed benchmark growth rates that were lower  than 4.4 percent for three of those populations. (See table 3.) HHS  officials stated that a policy decision was made to use the average state  historical growth rates because it was believed that it was more likely to  reflect cost trends in the future. Officials added that one of the individual  populations had a zero growth rate historically and it was decided that as  a result of regular health care inflation, costs would grow. Approving an  average growth rate does not appear to be a valid substitute for the state  historical growth rates for each population given the significant difference  for the adult caretaker populations, and the fact that health care inflation  was present during prior years and would have also affected population- specific growth rates. Had HHS used benchmark growth rates for each  population, the spending limit would have been about $416 million lower  than the approved spending limit.", "HHS approved an aggregate spending limit of about $12.1 billion for the  Rhode Island demonstration based on a growth rate that exceeded the  benchmark growth rate without clearly supporting the use of a higher  growth rate. Had HHS used the benchmark growth rate, we estimate that  the spending limit would have been about $772 million lower than the  approved limit. According to HHS officials, the spending limit was  developed using the 2006 base year average national growth rate of   7.8 percent; however, the state\u2019s historical growth rate in the 5 years prior  to applying for the demonstration was 7.0 percent. HHS officials told us  that though the state provided data for 2007 to be used as the base year,  HHS instead chose 2006 as the base year, because negative trends in  the 2007 data were not representative, did not appear reliable, and  contained what they called outliers. So while HHS based the Rhode  Island spending limit on the lower of the two growth rates for 2006, the  agency could not provide clear support for using that base year. (See  table 4.)", "In Texas, the HHS-approved spending limit included two types of  hypothetical costs in the state\u2019s base year expenditures. These costs  represented higher payment amounts the state could have paid to  providers, but did not actually pay. We estimated that, had the state only  included actual expenditures as indicated by HHS\u2019s policy, the spending  limit would have totaled about $4.6 billion less. HHS\u2019s decision sets a  precedent that a state can increase a demonstration spending limit on the  basis that it could have hypothetically paid Medicaid providers more than  it actually chose to pay them, without a clear basis for doing so.", "First, Texas\u2019s spending limit was based, in part, on hypothetical costs as  opposed to actual incurred expenditures with respect to UPL payments  that could be made for inpatient hospital services but were not actually  made. Prior to applying for this demonstration, about 1.3 million of the  state\u2019s Medicaid population received inpatient hospital services under  managed care, and the state did not make UPL payments for these  services. In its spending limit estimate, however, Texas included costs  for UPL payments and fee-for-service payments for beneficiaries  previously receiving inpatient hospital services under a managed care  delivery model. In its proposal, the state said it would take certain actions  in response to directives from its state legislature. Specifically, the state  said that if the demonstration was not approved by HHS it would carve  out inpatient hospital services previously provided under managed care  and pay for these services on a fee-for-service basis and also make UPL  payments for these services. These actions would increase costs  because fee-for-service payments and UPL payments to hospitals would  greatly exceed capitation payments made to managed care plans. HHS  officials stated that, given a directive of the Texas legislature, they  believed the state would do so, and they allowed the estimated increased  costs of such an arrangement to be factored into the spending limit even  though Texas had not changed its payment model. As a result,   $3.8 billion of the demonstration spending limit was based on what Texas  estimated it could pay providers in the future but had not been paying  prior to the demonstration.", "Second, Texas proposed including additional hypothetical costs in the  base year expenditures by using the maximum amount of UPL payments  the state could have paid rather than the actual amount of payments the  state did make. In its proposal, the state documented that during each of  the 4 years leading up to and including the base year, the state\u2019s actual  hospital inpatient UPL payments were less than the maximum amount the  state could have paid. HHS officials noted that because the actual  payments were accounting for an increasing percentage of the maximum  UPL payments the state could have made, they allowed the state to use  this larger amount. As a result of HHS\u2019s decision, about $796 million of  the demonstration spending limit was based on a hypothetical  expenditure that did not represent actual expenditures of the state under  its program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS Approved Spending Limits for Three Demonstrations Based on Actual DSH Expenditures and Followed Statutory Criteria in Approving Spending Limits for Three Other Demonstrations", "paragraphs": ["HHS approved spending limits for three demonstrations that redirected  federal DSH funds, which were consistent with its policy.

This approach  helps provide assurances that the federal government will spend no more  under the demonstrations than what it would have spent without them.  For the District of Columbia and Missouri, HHS limited federal spending to  a specific dollar amount, which represented a portion of the states\u2019 DSH  expenditures in the year prior to the demonstrations\u2019 approvals. The  Wisconsin spending limit was set at the total DSH allotment, which also  represented the amount of expenditures in the year prior to the  demonstration\u2019s approval.

These states applied and received approval for new  section 1115 demonstrations, through which they continued to cover  childless adults using Medicaid funds instead of CHIP funds. CHIPRA  also defined the budget neutrality process for such demonstrations by  identifying the base year and growth rates for demonstration spending  limits. For each of the three demonstrations, HHS followed the budget  neutrality procedures outlined in CHIPRA in setting the spending limit on  an annual basis. The initial annual spending limits were based on  expenditure projections of about $80,000 for Idaho, about $137 million for  Michigan, and about $177 million for New Mexico.

In addition,  while the policy requires that states submit 5 years of historical data in  developing spending limits\u2014and HHS officials told us that this is their  preference\u2014the agency\u2019s current processes allow states to use data  based on the state\u2019s estimate of spending or enrollment.

While section 1115 Medicaid  demonstrations serve as an important mechanism for states to implement  projects that allow for innovation while promoting Medicaid objectives,  HHS policy requires that they not expose the federal government to  additional financial liability. The Secretary of Health and Human Services  has an important responsibility for ensuring that comprehensive  demonstrations will not increase federal costs above what would be  incurred without these demonstrations. HHS\u2019s long-standing budget  neutrality policy for these demonstrations, on its face, recognizes that  states should not be given access to additional federal funding at the  same time they are provided with greater program flexibility. However,  neither the policy, nor HHS\u2019s implementation of it, ensures the prudent  stewardship of federal Medicaid spending.", "After examining HHS\u2019s approach for approving spending limits of recently  approved demonstrations, we have three main concerns regarding the  budget neutrality policy and process. First, HHS\u2019s policy is not reflected in  its actual practices and, contrary to sound management practices, is not  adequately documented. Second, the policy and processes lack  transparency regarding criteria and the supporting evidence required to  justify deviations from historical spending and established benchmark  growth rates. We recognize that forecasting spending during changing  economic times is challenging and a state\u2019s circumstances may warrant  such deviations. Nonetheless, we believe that approved spending limits  that are based on baselines and growth rate expectations that greatly  deviate from HHS\u2019s current benchmarks should be well-supported and  documented. HHS\u2019s policy is currently silent as to when deviations are  allowed and does not require that reliable evidence be provided to justify  deviations. Transparency around the basis for spending limit decisions is  important not only for assurances of the ongoing fiscal integrity and  sustainability of the program, but also for assurances of consistency of  approvals among states. Third, the policy as implemented allows  methods for establishing spending limits that we believe are inappropriate  for such purposes, such as allowing states to include hypothetical costs in  the baseline for spending limits. The second and third concerns parallel  those we have raised in earlier reports. In 2008, because HHS disagreed  that changes to the budget neutrality policy and review process were  needed, we suggested that Congress consider requiring increased  attention to fiscal responsibility in the approval of section 1115 Medicaid  demonstrations and require the Secretary of Health and Human Services  to improve the demonstration review process by, for example, clarifying  the criteria for approving spending limits and documenting and making  public the basis for such approvals. Thus far Congress has not acted on  this suggestion. On the basis of the findings in this report, we believe the  Secretary needs to take additional actions to ensure that HHS\u2019s budget  neutrality policy reflects current practices and that the spending limits for  the Texas and Arizona demonstrations are appropriate, well supported,  and based on clear criteria."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve the transparency of the process for reviewing and approving  spending limits for comprehensive section 1115 demonstrations, we  recommend that the Secretary of Health and Human Services take the  following two actions:  1.  update the agency\u2019s written budget neutrality policy to reflect actual  criteria and processes used to develop and approve demonstration  spending limits, and ensure the policy is readily available to state  Medicaid directors and others; and  2.  reconsider adjustments and costs used in setting the spending limits  for the Arizona and Texas demonstrations, and make appropriate  adjustments to spending limits for the remaining years of each  demonstration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS for comment.

The Department suggested that recent steps to  increase transparency\u2014such as publishing a new section 1115  application template and implementing a federal public input process\u2014 reflect updated policy on how HHS sets spending limits and ensures  demonstrations are budget neutral. While the application template may  contain guidance on some of the data elements commonly used to  demonstrate budget neutrality, we do not believe that it addresses how  HHS reviews the applications or the criteria used for setting spending  limits. We have revised our report to clarify how this template falls short of  clarifying HHS\u2019s budget neutrality policy. HHS did not otherwise identify  any written policy it has issued since 2001 either during the course of our  review or in its comments.", "HHS did not concur with our recommendation that its budget neutrality  policy should be updated to reflect the actual criteria and processes used  to develop and approve demonstration spending limits, and ensure that  the policy is readily available. HHS stated that our findings that four  states\u2019 spending limits would have been lower had the agency followed its  policy were flawed. HHS said that we used only a subset of the best  available data that the Department used to assess budget neutrality and  that we relied on an outdated policy issued in 2001. We disagree with  these assertions. It is important to note that, to do our analysis, we relied  on extensive documentation and information that HHS officials specifically  provided us as the basis for the selected states\u2019 budget neutrality  determinations. For example, we obtained the spreadsheets with the data  and calculations that HHS used to determine each state\u2019s demonstration  spending limits. We reconciled these spreadsheets with the spending  limits and documentation in each state\u2019s demonstration approval and had  numerous discussions with HHS officials to confirm our understanding of  the data and the basis for the final spending limits. At no time did officials  tell us that they had provided us only with a subset of the data used to  assess budget neutrality or cite additional information or data that we had  not considered. HHS\u2019s assertion that we relied on an outdated budget  neutrality policy that did not reflect the Department\u2019s current policy also  conflicts with information provided to us during the course of this review.  On multiple occasions, we discussed with officials the policy used to  establish demonstration spending limits, including the applicability of the  2001 written policy. HHS officials told us\u2014both verbally and in writing\u2014 that the 2001 written policy generally reflected the Department\u2019s current  policy toward budget neutrality. They told us that this document was the  most recent document capturing the budget neutrality policy. However, as  we described in the draft report, HHS officials told us that some parts of  the 2001 written policy were outdated. The Department did not have any  plans to update the 2001 policy.", "HHS did not concur with our recommendation that it should make  adjustments to the spending limits for the remaining years of the Arizona  and Texas demonstrations. In its comments, HHS said that the  adjustments and costs it used were justified. However, HHS did not  provide any new information or support beyond what was considered and  discussed in the draft report. For example, HHS did not respond to our  concerns that Texas\u2019 spending limit included $3.8 billion in costs that the  state could hypothetically pay providers in the future but did not actually  pay them prior to the demonstration. We continue to believe HHS\u2019  decisions were not clear or well supported. HHS also stated that it had  significantly strengthened the accountability in Texas by requiring HHS  approval before federal matching funds can be drawn down for state  expenditures made under the demonstration, and by instituting robust  reporting requirements.

Similarly, the completeness of the application can affect review times.  Applications may have lacked important details, such as data on how the  program will be implemented, its effect on relevant beneficiary  populations, or how budget neutrality is achieved.
