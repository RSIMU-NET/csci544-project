As requested, this report provides (1) an overview of the goals, funding status, and types of projects and activities funded by the three programs; (2) advantages and challenges identified by program stakeholders; and (3) potential program enhancements. GAO reviewed pertinent federal laws and rules; examined plans for selected projects; conducted site visits; and interviewed officials, stakeholders, and experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The goals of the projects funded by the three national and regional infrastructure programs--Projects of Regional and National Significance (PNRS), the National Corridor Infrastructure Improvement Program (NCIIP), and the Coordinated Border Infrastructure (CBI) program--are varied, most projects have been reviewed and funded, most projects are for highway improvements, and funds have been applied toward various related activities. PNRS and NCIIP funds were distributed by congressional directive, and CBI funds were distributed by formula. The states GAO visited or whose officials GAO interviewed had established a variety of project goals, including increasing capacity and enhancing mobility. As of December 2008, the Federal Highway Administration had reviewed most projects submitted by states and had obligated $1.2 billion, or about 33 percent of the $3.6 billion authorized for the three programs through September 30, 2008. However, some states had not initiated efforts to obtain available funding. The officials GAO interviewed cited various reasons for not pursuing the funds, such as trying to complete an environmental impact statement and trying to identify a project that met the program's funding criteria. The programs' contributions to projects' estimated total costs varied, from less than 30 percent of the estimated total costs for the majority of reviewed PNRS projects and about half of the reviewed NCIIP projects to 80 percent or more of the estimated total costs for almost half of the reviewed CBI projects. Furthermore, for high-cost projects--those expected to cost over $500 million--the programs' funding contributions ranged from about 4 to 13 percent of the estimated total project cost. States have used the program funds mainly for highway projects and for various related activities, such as conducting environmental studies and expanding ongoing projects. In discussing the three programs, stakeholders cited advantages less often than challenges. The most frequently cited advantage was the funding the programs provided to support and move projects forward. The most commonly cited challenge also involved funding and included funding uncertainty. This was a challenge because project sponsors did not know whether they would receive additional federal funds to complete their projects--especially high-cost projects. According to GAO's interviews and prior work, clearly defining the federal role in surface transportation is an important step in enhancing these programs. Two historical approaches could then be used to distribute federal funds--a criteria-based competition or a formula-based distribution. GAO's interviews and prior work suggest that a criteria-based competition could enhance these programs. Some interviewees also called for a wide range of other enhancements, from broad proposals to increase investment in different transportation modes to specific suggestions, such as using cost-benefit analysis in selecting projects. The Department of Transportation generally agreed with the report's information and conclusions and offered to work with Congress on GAO's three proposed matters."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As traffic congestion increases and our nation\u2019s transportation  infrastructure ages, governments at the federal, state, and local levels face  growing demands for infrastructure improvements. To help address these  demands, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity  Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), enacted in August 2005,  established three federal transportation programs to target funds to  infrastructure projects that have high costs, involve national or regional  impacts, and cannot easily or specifically be addressed within existing  federal surface transportation programs. The programs, which the Federal  Highway Administration (FHWA) administers, are as follows:    The Projects of National and Regional Significance (PNRS) program  provides funding for high-cost transportation projects that are of national  or regional importance in enhancing the surface transportation system.", "The National Corridor Infrastructure Improvement Program (NCIIP)  provides funding for highway construction projects in corridors of  national significance to promote economic growth and international or  interregional trade by enhancing freight mobility.", "The Coordinated Border Infrastructure (CBI) program provides funding to  support the safe movement of motor vehicles across the land borders of  the United States with Canada and Mexico.", "To fund these three programs, SAFETEA-LU authorized spending of over  $4.5 billion from the federal Highway Trust Fund during fiscal years 2005  through 2009. According to the latest data available from FHWA, these  three programs have contributed federal funds to 153 projects in 35 states  and the District of Columbia. The act did not define the terms \u201cprojects of  national or regional importance\u201d or \u201ccorridors of national significance,\u201d  but it established a competitive, criteria-based process for FHWA to follow  in selecting PNRS and NCIIP projects. However, this process was never  implemented because, in different sections of SAFETEA-LU, all of the  available funds for these two programs were directed to 24 PNRS and 31  NCIIP projects. CBI funds were distributed to 15 border states, by formula,  for these states to allocate to projects that met CBI criteria described in  SAFETEA-LU. As of September 30, 2008, states had allocated CBI funds to  98 projects. The projects that received federal funds through the three  programs vary in complexity and size\u2014from replacing a major highway  bridge to rehabilitating a highway rest area. While CBI differs in some  ways from PNRS and NCIIP, we included it in our analysis at your request  and because it provides federal funds to improve transportation  infrastructure projects on our borders with Canada and Mexico. Such  projects could have national and regional implications.", "While demands for transportation infrastructure investment are  increasing, the purchasing power of revenues to the Highway Trust Fund  continues to erode with inflation and the introduction of more fuel- efficient and alternative-fuel vehicles. In addition, federal surface  transportation programs are due for reauthorization at the end of fiscal  year 2009. Hence, Congress will soon face the challenge of allocating  federal resources to meet demands for a wide range of surface  transportation infrastructure projects. You asked us to review the three  programs established in SAFETEA-LU and to identify possible  enhancements that could be applied to future authorizations. To do so, we  addressed the following questions: (1) What are the goals, funding status,  and types of projects and activities funded for the three programs?   (2) What advantages and challenges did stakeholders say were associated  with these three programs? (3) What approaches are available for  enhancing the three programs?", "To address these questions, we (1) reviewed federal law, proposed  regulations, and a Department of Transportation (DOT) report on the  PNRS program; (2) reviewed pertinent documentation, including some of  the project proposals, plans, and information submitted to DOT for  projects funded by these programs; and (3) interviewed officials from 56  \u201cstakeholder\u201d entities to understand the programs\u2019 advantages, challenges,  and possible enhancements. Stakeholders broadly have interest and  expertise in one or more of the three programs, in a specific transportation  project funded by one of these programs, or in federal surface  transportation policy generally. The stakeholders we interviewed included  officials from the following entities:    DOT headquarters in Washington, D.C., including the Office of the  Secretary; FHWA; the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA); and the  Maritime Administration (MARAD), as well as FHWA division offices in  eight states for a total of 12 DOT entities; and   16 state transportation departments, 16 local government agencies, and 12  transportation associations or other expert organizations. We conducted  some of these interviews as part of our site visits to eight states\u2014 California, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Illinois, Wisconsin,  Washington, and Oregon\u2014where we met with officials who manage  projects funded through the three programs. The 16 state transportation  departments we selected for interviews included 14 states that collectively  accounted for 86 projects funded by the three programs and 2 states,  Florida and Wyoming, that did not have projects funded by these three  programs.", "In selecting our sites, we considered geographic diversity, the funding  authorized by states for these programs, and the characteristics of the  projects funded. In addition, for comparison, we contacted Transport  Canada, the transportation department of the federal Canadian  government, and the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure of the  Canadian province of British Columbia, to obtain information about  similar infrastructure investment programs. (See app. I for a full list of the  entities we contacted during our work on this report.)", "We also reviewed FHWA\u2019s data on amounts authorized, appropriated, and  obligated for PNRS, NCIIP, and CBI. To assess the reliability and quality of  FHWA\u2019s financial data, we analyzed related documentation and  interviewed knowledgeable agency officials. Through these efforts, we  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for this report. We  conducted this performance audit from December 2007 to February 2009  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. (See app. I for further details  about our objectives, scope, and methodology.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["While PNRS, NCIIP, and CBI all provided federal funds for transportation  infrastructure projects, they differed somewhat in their goals, methods  used for selecting projects, and methods used for distributing the federal  funds to states, as indicated in table 1. (See app. V for a list and  description of the 153 projects funded by the three programs.)", "SAFETEA-LU authorized different funding levels for the three programs in  each fiscal year of the 5-year authorization period, as shown in table 2;  however, the amounts ultimately distributed to the states for those years  were adjusted downward for several reasons.", "The funds authorized for these programs, which come from the federal  Highway Trust Fund, represent funds that can be made available to the  Secretary of Transportation, acting through FHWA, to carry out these  programs. These funds are subject to limitation through the annual  appropriations process and deductions may be made for rescissions,  among other things. In fiscal years 2005 and 2006, the funding for these  three programs was 14 percent less than the authorizations for those 2  years and in fiscal years 2007 and 2008 the funding was 8 percent less than  the authorizations for those years. After funds are allocated for these  programs and FHWA has reviewed project documentation for  completeness and consistency with congressional language, funds may be  obligated, or set aside, for the projects. These three programs, like most  federal-aid highway programs, distribute federal funds by reimbursement  to the states. States spend other funds for eligible project expenses and  submit claims to FHWA for review and approval before they receive the  federal funds under these programs as reimbursement.", "Before federal funds are distributed to a state for a project under these  three programs, the state must submit a proposal for a PNRS or an NCIIP  project, or a project eligibility form for a CBI project, to FHWA. FHWA  compares information about the project against the project description  included in SAFETEA-LU for PNRS or NCIIP projects and against  eligibility criteria as defined in SAFETEA-LU for CBI projects. In addition,  FHWA follows the normal steps for reviewing a project application for the  use of federal-aid highway program funds. For example, FHWA ensures  that the state agrees to apply federal laws as a condition of receiving funds  under these and other federal-aid highway programs, such as the  environmental assessment provisions of the National Environmental  Policy Act (NEPA)  and the Davis-Bacon Act\u2019s prevailing wage  requirements.", "SAFETEA-LU directed all of the PNRS and NCIIP funds to specific  projects. SAFETEA-LU also contained other provisions that set forth a  criteria-based, competitive process for selecting PNRS and NCIIP projects;  however, this process was superseded by the congressional directives.  According to SAFETEA-LU\u2019s competitive process, PNRS projects selected  for federal funding were to have national and regional significance and  benefits that the act described as improving economic productivity by  facilitating international trade and relieving congestion, among other  things. The criteria for selecting NCIIP projects were that they be located  in \u201ccorridors of national significance\u201d and that their selection be based on  the extent to which a corridor links two existing segments of the Interstate  System, is able to facilitate major multistate or regional mobility, and  promotes economic growth. Additional criteria for NCIIP funding included  the value of commercial vehicle traffic cargo in the corridor and economic  costs arising from congestion.", "Federal funds distributed through the CBI program to states had to be  used generally for infrastructure or operational improvements on  highways within 100 miles of a border with Canada or Mexico. In addition,  states can transfer up to 15 percent or $5 million (whichever is less) of the  state\u2019s yearly amount of CBI funds to the General Services Administration  (GSA), which owns and leases facilities at U.S. land border ports of entry.  GSA can use these funds for CBI-eligible projects on its property.

As we have previously reported, FHWA has determined that it  typically takes from 9 to 19 years to plan, gain approval for, and construct  a new, major, federally funded highway project that has significant  environmental impacts. As many as 200 major steps can be involved in  developing such a project, from identifying the need for it to starting  construction.", "While states have submitted complete project descriptions to FHWA for  most projects and have received funds for them, some states have not  done so, including the following:    Three states had not submitted descriptions or requested funds for 3 of the  24 PNRS projects, as of December 2, 2008. Transportation officials in  Michigan and Minnesota told us they were waiting to complete the  environmental impact statement before submitting a project description  and requesting PNRS funds for 2 of these projects (Blue Water Bridge  Border/Port Huron Plaza project in Michigan and the Union Depot  Multimodal Transit Facility in Minnesota).

Officials we interviewed in two of those states offered varied  reasons for not using the funds. For example, Arizona DOT officials said  they did not submit a description for the State Route 85 project because  they were trying to identify an appropriate project segment that could  meet the NCIIP funding criteria. Wisconsin DOT officials told us they had  not yet requested the NCIIP funds for the U.S. 41 project since the NCIIP  funds do not have to be used by a specified date. In addition, FHWA has  not received NCIIP project descriptions for the Frederick Douglas  Memorial Bridge in the District of Columbia and I-80 improvements in  Indiana.", "One of 15 border states (New Hampshire) had not used any of its  distribution of CBI funds, as of September 30, 2008.

Under NCIIP, the federal funding contributions  represented less than 30 percent of the estimated total project cost for  about half of the reviewed NCIIP projects (i.e., for 13 of 27 NCIIP  projects). The federal shares for the congressionally directed PNRS  projects that received funding from FHWA varied widely, ranging from  about 2 percent for the construction of I-73 between North and South  Carolina to 104 percent for a project to relocate freight rail operations  from El Paso, Texas, to New Mexico. In contrast, CBI funds represented  80 percent or more of the estimated total project cost for almost half (44 of  98) of reviewed CBI projects selected by the states.

The following examples from projects in table 3 illustrate how states have  used their project funds:    Oregon DOT officials told us PNRS funds enabled the state to undertake  additional I-5 bridge repair projects beyond those possible with the  previous level of state funding.

One stakeholder reported that the  rising cost of right-of-way acquisition has increased project planning  uncertainty. Some stakeholders reported that inflation has also greatly  increased the cost of construction materials over time. According to the  Bureau of Labor Statistics, the producer price index for highway and  street construction increased by about 41 percent from August 2005 to  August 2008 (the latest month for which these data are available).", "The second most frequently cited challenge was difficulty in complying  with federal requirements. For example, the stakeholders who cited  compliance with federal and environmental requirements as a challenge  noted the additional time and expense involved. In the view of some state  and local transportation officials, these requirements may be too onerous  to justify the use of the program funds. One stakeholder stated that the  environmental review process, established under NEPA, takes a long time  and that the Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirements require higher- than-market wages, resulting in increased project costs. Stakeholders  also reported that it can be difficult to obtain state and local funds to  match the federal funds, as required.

In addition, we have found  that having more federal programs operate competitively could help tie  funds to performance.", "Canada\u2019s Asia-Pacific Gateway and Corridor Initiative (APGCI) offers an  example of how the three programs discussed here could be restructured  as criteria-based, competitive programs. The Canadian government\u2019s  vision for its program is to invest in critical freight transportation projects  that facilitate the movement of freight from Asia to Canada and through to  the United States. Transport Canada, the federal Canadian government\u2019s  transportation agency, identifies key transportation projects through  analytical studies or decides to fund projects submitted by provinces or  towns using program criteria and freight transportation data. The criteria  that were developed focused on objectives in support of the program\u2019s  vision, such as enhancing efficiency, safety, and security and minimizing  environmental impacts. According to a Transport Canada official, using  data on freight flows assisted Transport Canada in determining the extent  to which specific projects would support international trade with Asia.  The official further noted that the specific criteria enabled Transport  Canada to take a rigorous approach, be selective, and thus deliver on the  key objectives. Additionally, the official said, previous programs had less  focused objectives, allowing a considerably wider variety of projects to be  funded.", "Transport Canada works with public and private stakeholders to define  what a project will entail, identify other nonfederal funding sources,  complete a cost-benefit analysis, monitor the project, and evaluate the  impact of the project after it is complete. Since October 2006, APGCI has  leveraged a federal investment of $860 million into a total federal and  nonfederal investment of $2.3 billion in 20 transportation projects. The  federal share for these projects has ranged between 33 and 50 percent of  total project costs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Our national transportation network faces many challenges. As demands  for greater passenger and freight mobility increase and transportation  infrastructure continues to show signs of age, fatigue, and congestion,  governments at the federal, state, and local levels need to prioritize their  limited resources to meet these demands. The three programs established  in SAFETEA-LU were intended to address national and regional priorities  by helping to fund a range of high-cost infrastructure projects or could not  easily or specifically be addressed within existing federal surface  transportation programs. As Congress prepares for the reauthorization of  federal surface transportation programs in 2009, it will need to reexamine  the relative contributions of these three programs and all other surface  transportation programs to solving our nation\u2019s transportation problems  and achieving federal goals. With regard to PNRS and NCIIP, the relatively  small federal share, especially for higher-cost projects, the number of  projects, and the distribution of projects across the country, have raised  concerns that the federal government did not maximize the impact of its  limited transportation funds. We have similar concerns about the CBI  program in that it was used by states for smaller-scope, lower-cost  projects. In addition, some of the program enhancements mentioned by  stakeholders could also improve all three programs. However, without a  clearly defined federal role and a competitive, criteria-based process for  distributing federal funds, it is unclear whether or how these programs can  meet national or regional transportation priorities or maximize the  benefits of investing increasingly scarce federal funds in our  transportation infrastructure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matters for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["In order to enhance these three programs, we concluded that Congress  should consider taking the following three actions when considering the  reauthorization of federal surface transportation programs:    Define the federal role in surface transportation in accordance with the  national and regional transportation priorities that these three programs  are designed to meet.", "Implement a criteria-based, competitive project selection process for these  three programs, in concert with other selection criteria.", "Work with the Secretary of Transportation to develop any specific  program enhancements that could help these programs meet identified  priorities and achieve the highest return on federal investments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOT for review and comment.

The  programs, administered by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA),  include the Projects of National and Regional Significance (PNRS), the  National Corridor Infrastructure Improvement Program (NCIIP), and the  Coordinated Border Infrastructure (CBI) program. As requested, we  addressed the following questions: (1) What are the goals, funding status,  and types of projects and activities funded for the three programs?   (2) What advantages and challenges did stakeholders say were associated  with these three programs? (3) What approaches are available for  enhancing the three programs?", "In addressing these questions, our overall approach was to (1) review  federal law, proposed regulations, FHWA\u2019s program guidance and  information, FHWA status reports on each program, and a Department of  Transportation (DOT) report on the PNRS program; (2) review pertinent  documentation, including some of the project proposals, plans, and  information submitted to DOT for projects funded by these programs; and  (3) interview officials from 56 \u201cstakeholder\u201d entities to understand the  programs\u2019 advantages, challenges, and possible enhancements.  Stakeholders broadly have interest and expertise in one or more of the  three programs, in a specific transportation project funded by one of these  programs, or in federal surface transportation policy generally. The  stakeholders we interviewed included officials from the following entities,  which are also listed in table 10 at the end of this appendix:    DOT headquarters in Washington, D.C., including the Office of the  Secretary; FHWA; the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA); and the  Maritime Administration (MARAD); as well as FHWA division offices in  eight states, for a total of 12 DOT entities; and   16 state transportation departments, 16 local government agencies  (including port authorities and metropolitan planning organizations), and  12 transportation associations or other expert organizations. We  conducted some of these interviews as part of our site visits to eight  states\u2014California, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Illinois,  Wisconsin, Washington, and Oregon\u2014where we met with officials who  manage projects funded through the three programs.", "In selecting our sites, we considered geographic diversity, the funding  authorized by states for these programs, and the characteristics of the  projects funded. The 16 state transportation departments we selected for  interviews included 14 states that collectively accounted for 86 projects  funded by the three programs and 2 states, Florida and Wyoming, that did  not have projects funded by these three programs. Also, for comparison,  we contacted Transport Canada, the transportation department of the  federal Canadian government, and the Ministry of Transportation and  Infrastructure of the Canadian province of British Columbia, to obtain  information about similar infrastructure investment programs.", "In addition, to address the first question on funding status, we reviewed  FHWA\u2019s data on amounts authorized, appropriated, and obligated for  PNRS, NCIIP, and CBI. To assess the reliability and quality of FHWA\u2019s  financial data, we analyzed related documentation and interviewed  knowledgeable agency officials. Through these efforts, we determined that  the data were sufficiently reliable for this report. We relied extensively on  our interviews with transportation stakeholders and our prior work on  surface transportation to identify not only the goals and types of projects  and activities funded by these programs and the characteristics of  individual restructuring approaches for them, but also a wide array of  program enhancements. To address the second question on advantages  and challenges, we analyzed our stakeholder interviews, and to respond to  the third question, we relied on both our prior work and our stakeholder  interviews to identify potential enhancements to the three programs.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2007 to February  2009, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
