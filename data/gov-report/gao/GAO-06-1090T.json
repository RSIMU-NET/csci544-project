It facilitates travel for millions of people and eases consular workload, but poses challenges to border inspectors, who, when screening visa waiver travelers, may face language barriers or lack time to conduct in-depth interviews. Furthermore, stolen passports from visa waiver countries are prized travel documents among terrorists, criminals, and immigration law violators, creating an additional risk. While the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has intercepted many fraudulent documents at U.S. ports of entry, DHS officials acknowledged that an undetermined number of inadmissible aliens may have entered the United States using a stolen or lost passport from a visa waiver country. DHS's process for assessing the risks of the Visa Waiver Program has weaknesses. In 2002, Congress mandated that, every 2 years, DHS review the effect that each country's continued participation in the program has on U.S. law enforcement and security interests, but did not set a reporting deadline. In 2004, DHS established a unit to oversee the program and conduct these reviews. We identified several problems with the 2004 review process, as key stakeholders were not consulted during portions of the process, the review process lacked clear criteria and guidance to make key judgments, and the final reports were untimely. Furthermore, the monitoring unit cannot effectively achieve its mission to monitor and report on ongoing law enforcement and security concerns in visa waiver countries due to insufficient resources. DHS has taken some actions to mitigate the program's risks; however, the department has faced difficulties in further mitigating these risks. In particular, the department has not established time frames and operating procedures regarding timely stolen passport reporting--a program requirement since 2002. Furthermore, DHS has sought to require the reporting of lost and stolen passport data to the United States and the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol), but it has not issued clear reporting guidelines to participating countries. While most visa waiver countries report to Interpol's database, four do not. Further, DHS is not using Interpol's data to its full potential as a border screening tool because U.S. border inspectors do not automatically access the data at primary inspection."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here to discuss our observations on the Visa Waiver  Program. In fiscal year 2005, nearly 16 million travelers entered the United  States under this program, which facilitates international travel and  commerce, and eases workload for consular officers at overseas posts, by  enabling citizens of 27 participating countries to travel to the United  States for tourism or business for 90 days or less without first obtaining a  visa. Participating countries were selected because their citizens had  demonstrated a pattern of compliance with U.S. immigration laws, and the  governments of these countries granted reciprocal visa-free travel to U.S.  citizens. The Visa Waiver Program was created as a pilot program in 1986,  and it became permanent in 2000, about 1 year prior to the 9-11 terrorist  attacks. After the attacks, the potential risks of the program became more  of a concern. In particular, convicted terrorist Zacarias Moussaoui and  \u201cshoe-bomber\u201d Richard Reid both boarded flights to the United States with  passports issued by Visa Waiver Program countries. Moreover, the foiled  alleged terrorist plot to board planes at London\u2019s Heathrow Airport and fly  to the United States with explosive materials highlights the importance of  having effective tools to ensure that only legitimate travelers enter the  United States. In May 2002, Congress mandated that the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) evaluate and report to Congress at least every  two years on the effect that each country\u2019s continued participation in the  program has on U.S. law enforcement and security interests. Effective  oversight of the Visa Waiver Program is essential to find the right balance  between facilitating legitimate travel and preventing potential terrorists,  criminals, and others that may pose law enforcement and immigration  concerns from entering the United States.", "Earlier this week, we released two reports on the Visa Waiver Program:  the first discusses the process by which the United States assesses and  mitigates the program\u2019s risks, and the second describes the process by  which additional countries may be admitted into the program. My  statement will focus on the first of these reports. Specifically, I will discuss  (1) the Visa Waiver Program\u2019s advantages and potential risks; (2) the U.S.  government\u2019s process for assessing the program\u2019s risks; and (3) the  actions that have been taken to mitigate these risks. In addition, we have  ongoing work examining international aviation passenger prescreening,  including DHS\u2019s use of passport and reservation data to screen travelers  and the pilot Immigration Advisory Program at several airports overseas,  and expect to report on our findings later this fall.", "In conducting this work, we reviewed documentation, including the laws  governing the program, relevant regulations and agency operating  procedures, and DHS\u2019s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) reports. We  also examined 15 of the 25 completed reports from the 2004 review  process that assessed the participation of Visa Waiver Program countries.  Additionally, we interviewed political, economic, consular, commercial,  and law enforcement officials at U.S. embassies in six Visa Waiver  Program countries, as well as foreign government officials in three of  these countries. We met with officials from several DHS component  agencies and offices; the Department of State (State); and the International  Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) in Lyon, France. We conducted our  work in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards (see app. I for a list of related GAO products and ongoing  reviews)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 created the Visa Waiver  Program as a pilot program. It was initially envisioned as an immigration  control and economic promotion program, according to State.  Participating countries were selected because their citizens had a  demonstrated pattern of compliance with U.S. immigration laws, and the  governments of these countries granted reciprocal visa-free travel to U.S.  citizens. In recent years, visa waiver travelers have represented about one- half of all nonimmigrant admissions to the United States. In 2002, we  reported on the legislative requirements to which countries must adhere  before they are eligible for inclusion in the Visa Waiver Program. In  general, to qualify for visa waiver status, a country must:    maintain a nonimmigrant refusal rate of less than 3 percent for its citizens  who apply for business and tourism visas.   certify that it issues machine-readable passports to its citizens; and    offer visa-free travel for U.S. citizens.", "Following the 9-11 attacks, Congress passed additional laws to strengthen  border security policies and procedures, and DHS and State instituted  other policy changes that have affected the qualifications for countries to  participate in the Visa Waiver Program. For example, all passports issued  after October 26, 2005, must contain a digital photograph printed in the  document, and passports issued to visa waiver travelers after October 26,  2006, must be electronic (e-passports). In addition, the May 2002  Enhanced Border Security and Visa Reform Act required that participating  countries certify that the theft of their blank passports is reported to the  U.S. government in a timely manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Visa Waiver Program Has Benefits and Risks", "paragraphs": ["The Visa Waiver Program has many benefits. The program was created to  facilitate international travel without jeopardizing the welfare or security  of the United States, according to the program\u2019s legislative history.  According to economic and commercial officers at several of the U.S.  embassies we visited, visa-free travel to the United States boosts  international business travel and tourism, as well as airline revenues, and  creates substantial economic benefits to the United States. Moreover, the  program allows State to allocate its resources to visa-issuing posts in  countries with higher-risk applicant pools. In 2002, we reported that  eliminating the program would increase State\u2019s resource requirements as  millions of visa waiver travelers who have benefited from visa-free travel  would need to obtain a visa to travel to the United States if the program  did not exist. Specifically, if the program were eliminated, we estimated  that State\u2019s initial costs at that time to process the additional workload  would likely range between $739 million and $1.28 billion and that annual  recurring costs would likely range between $522 million and $810 million.  In addition, visa waiver countries could begin requiring visas for U.S.  citizens traveling to the 27 participating countries for temporary business  or tourism purposes, which would impose a burden of additional cost and  time on U.S. travelers to these countries."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Visa Waiver Program Can Pose Risks to U.S. Security, Law Enforcement, and Immigration Interests", "paragraphs": ["The Visa Waiver Program, however, can also pose risks to U.S. security,  law enforcement, and immigration interests because some foreign citizens  may exploit the program to enter the United States. First, visa waiver  travelers are not subject to the same degree of screening as travelers who  must first obtain a visa before arriving in the United States (see fig. 1). Visa  waiver travelers are first screened in person by a DHS Customs and  Border Protection (CBP) inspector once they arrive at the U.S. port of  entry, perhaps after having already boarded an international flight bound  for the United States with a fraudulent travel document. According to the  DHS OIG, primary border inspectors are at a disadvantage when screening  Visa Waiver Program travelers because they may not know the alien\u2019s  language or local fraud trends in the alien\u2019s home country, nor have the  time to conduct an extensive interview. In contrast, non-visa-waiver  travelers, who must obtain a visa from a U.S. embassy or consulate,  receive two levels of screening before entering the country\u2014in addition to  the inspection at the U.S. port of entry, these travelers undergo an  interview by consular officials overseas, who conduct a rigorous screening  process when deciding to approve or deny a visa. As we have previously  reported, State has taken a number of actions since 2002 to strengthen the  visa issuance process as a border security tool. Moreover, consular  officers have more time to interview applicants and examine the  authenticity of their passports, and may also speak the visa applicant\u2019s  native language, according to consular officials. Therefore, inadmissible  travelers who need visas to enter the United States may attempt to acquire  a passport from a Visa Waiver Program country to avoid the visa screening  process.", "Another risk inherent in the program is the potential exploitation by  terrorists, immigration law violators, and other criminals of a visa waiver  country\u2019s lost or stolen passports. DHS intelligence analysts, law  enforcement officials, and forensic document experts all acknowledge that  misuse of lost and stolen passports is the greatest security problem posed  by the Visa Waiver Program. Lost and stolen passports from visa waiver  countries are highly prized travel documents, according to the Secretary  General of Interpol. Moreover, Visa Waiver Program countries that do not  consistently report the losses or thefts of their citizens\u2019 passports, or of  blank passports, put the United States at greater risk of allowing  inadmissible travelers to enter the country.", "Fraudulent passports from Visa Waiver Program countries have been used  illegally by travelers seeking to disguise their true identities or  nationalities when attempting to enter the United States. For example,  from January through June 2005, DHS reported that it confiscated, at U.S.  ports of entry, 298 fraudulent or altered passports issued by Visa Waiver  Program countries that travelers were attempting to use for admission into  the United States. Although DHS has intercepted some travelers with  fraudulent passports at U.S. ports of entry, DHS officials acknowledged  that an undetermined number of inadmissible aliens may have entered the  United States using a lost or stolen passport from a visa waiver country.  According to State, these aliens may have been inadmissible because they  were immigration law violators, criminals, or terrorists. For example:  In July 2005, two aliens successfully entered the United States using lost or  stolen Austrian passports. DHS was not notified that these passports had  been lost or stolen prior to this date; the aliens were admitted, and there is  no record of their departure, according to CBP. In October 2005, CBP  referred this case to DHS\u2019s Immigration and Customs Enforcement for  further action.", "In June 2005, CBP inspectors admitted into the United States two aliens  using Italian passports that were from a batch of stolen passports. CBP  was notified that this batch was stolen; however, the aliens altered the  passport numbers to avoid detection by CBP officers.

In response to these findings, DHS established OIE\u2019s  Visa Waiver Program Oversight Unit in July 2004, and named a director to  manage the office. The unit\u2019s mission is to oversee Visa Waiver Program  activities and monitor countries\u2019 adherence to the program\u2019s statutory  requirements, ensuring that the United States is protected from those who  wish to do it harm or violate its laws, including immigration laws.

For the 2004 assessments, we found the following:    Some key stakeholders were excluded from the process. After conducting  the site visits and contributing to the reports on the site visits, DHS and  the interagency working group did not seek input from all site visit team  members while drafting and clearing the final country assessments and  subsequent report to Congress. For example, DHS\u2019s forensic document  analysts, who participated in the site visits in 2004, told us that they did  not see, clear, or comment on the draft country assessments, despite  repeated attempts to obtain copies of them. Additionally, at the time of our  visits, ambassadors or deputy chiefs of mission in each of the six posts  told us that they were not fully aware of the extent to which assessments  for the country where they were posted discussed law enforcement and  security concerns posed by the continued participation of the country in  the program. Without this information, key stakeholders could not be  effective advocates for U.S. concerns.", "The reviews lacked clear criteria to make key judgments. We found that  DHS did not have clear criteria to determine at what point security  concerns uncovered during their review would trigger discussions with  foreign governments about these concerns and an attempt to resolve them.  State officials agreed that qualitative and/or quantitative criteria would be  useful when making these determinations, although DHS stated that the  criteria should be flexible.", "DHS and its interagency partners neither completed the 25 country  assessments nor issued the summary report to Congress in a timely  manner. The interagency teams conducted site visits as part of the country  assessments from May through September 2004, and transmitted the final  summary report to Congress more than 1 year later, in November 2005.  OIE, State, and Justice officials acknowledged that the assessments took  too long to complete. The teams collecting information about the visa  waiver countries\u2019 risks in 2004 used, in some cases, information that was  two years old; by the time the summary report was issued in November  2005, some of the data was over 3 years old.
