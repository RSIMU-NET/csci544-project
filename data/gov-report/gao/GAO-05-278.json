While many commercial microelectronics advances apply to defense systems, DOD has some unique microelectronics needs not met by industry. Therefore, to maintain military superiority, DOD has the challenge of exploiting state-of-the-art commercial microelectronics technology and focusing its research investments in areas with the highest potential return for defense systems. Given the importance of advanced microelectronics to defense systems and the rapid changes in these technologies, Congress asked GAO to (1) identify and describe DOD and federally funded research and development center (FFRDC) facilities that receive funding from DOD for microelectronics production or research prototyping and (2) describe how DOD coordinates investments in microelectronics research."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["At the time of our review, eight DOD and FFRDC facilities that received funding from DOD were involved in microelectronics research prototyping or production. Three of these facilities focused solely on research; three primarily focused on research but had limited production capabilities; and two focused solely on production. The research conducted ranged from exploring potential applications of new materials in microelectronic devices to developing a process to improve the performance and reliability of microwave devices. Production efforts generally focus on devices that are used in defense systems but not readily obtainable on the commercial market, either because DOD's requirements are unique and highly classified or because they are no longer commercially produced. For example, one of the two facilities that focuses solely on production acquires process lines that commercial firms are abandoning and, through reverse-engineering and prototyping, provides DOD with these abandoned devices. During the course of GAO's review, one facility, which produced microelectronic circuits for DOD's Trident program, closed. Officials from the facility told us that without Trident program funds, operating the facility became cost prohibitive. These circuits are now provided by a commercial supplier. Another facility is slated for closure in 2006 due to exorbitant costs for producing the next generation of circuits. The classified integrated circuits produced by this facility will also be supplied by a commercial supplier. DOD has several mechanisms in place aimed at coordinating and planning research conducted by the military services and defense agencies. One key mechanism is identifying defense technology objectives--the specific technology advancements that will be developed or demonstrated across multiple joint capabilities and technology areas. As of February 2004, there were almost 400 defense technology objectives; five of these were identified as microelectronics. DOD also collaborates with industry to review and assess special technology areas and make recommendations about future electronics and microelectronics research."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Advanced microelectronics are an enabling technology for many U.S.  defense systems. Satellites and communications equipment, for example,  are reliant on advanced microelectronics that must meet stringent military  requirements such as withstanding radiation and extreme-temperature  environments, operating for longer periods of time, and performing at  higher power levels. The Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) ability to provide  superior capabilities to the warfighter is dependent on its ability to  incorporate rapidly evolving, cutting-edge microelectronic devices into its  defense systems. While many commercial advances are applicable to  defense systems, DOD has some unique microelectronics research and  production needs not met by industry. Therefore, to maintain military  superiority, DOD faces the challenge of exploiting state-of-the-art  commercial microelectronics technology while focusing DOD research  investments in areas with the highest potential return for defense systems.", "Given the importance of advanced microelectronics to DOD\u2019s defense  systems and the rapid changes in these technologies, you asked us to   (1) identify and describe DOD and federally funded research and  development center (FFRDC) facilities that receive funding from DOD for  microelectronics production or research prototyping and (2) describe how  DOD coordinates investments in microelectronics research.", "We visited and toured all DOD and FFRDC facilities identified by DOD as  having capability to produce or prototype microelectronics, interviewed  facility officials, and obtained documentation to describe each facility. We  interviewed the Executive Staff of the Defense Science and Technology  Reliance process and other DOD officials and obtained and reviewed  applicable documentation to determine how DOD coordinates investments  in microelectronics research. Because microelectronics is a part of a much  broader area of research, we looked at DOD\u2019s overall research  coordination in addition to microelectronics-specific areas. We performed  our review from November 2003 to January 2005 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Microelectronics focuses on the study and manufacture of micro devices,  such as silicon integrated circuits, which are fabricated in submicron  dimensions and form the basis of all electronic products. In DOD research,  microelectronics extends beyond silicon integrated circuits and cuts  across scientific disciplines such as biological sciences, materials  sciences, quantum physics, and photonics. DOD research also covers  many different types of materials, devices, and processes. For example,  DOD service laboratories conduct research in materials other than silicon,  such as gallium nitride, indium arsenide, and silicon carbide\u2014materials  that could provide higher performing or more reliable devices to meet  DOD needs.", "DOD\u2019s overall budget authority for fiscal year 2005 was approximately  $400 billion. About $69 billion, or 17 percent of the overall budget, was  directed toward research and development activities. The vast majority of  this funding goes to development programs for major systems such as the  Joint Strike Fighter and the Space Based Infrared System High. About   $5.2 billion, or about 1.3 percent of the overall budget, was directed  toward research (see fig. 1). Because DOD tracks funding by funding  category, not by specific technology area, the microelectronics portion of  this funding category cannot be broken out.", "DOD research and technology development is conducted by universities,  DOD laboratories, industry, and other organizations. Universities and  DOD laboratories are primarily involved in research. Once a new device is  proven and has potential application for DOD, the technology is  transferred to industry to further develop and ultimately produce and  integrate into defense systems. These organizations may collaborate on  microelectronics projects through various arrangements, such as  cooperative research and development agreements and collaborative  technology alliances. Figure 2 shows the distribution of DOD research and  advanced technology development funding by performing organizations.", "Microelectronics production and research prototyping require specialized  equipment and facilities. To prevent flaws in production, microelectronic  devices are produced in clean rooms where the air is constantly filtered,  and temperature, humidity, and pressure may be regulated. Clean rooms  are rated according to a federal standard. For example, a class 1000 clean  room has no more than 1000 particles larger than 0.5 microns in a cubic  foot of air, while a class 100 clean room has no more than 100 particles.", "The people who work in clean rooms wear special protective clothing that  prevents workers from contaminating the room (see fig. 3).", "The equipment found at research facilities and at production facilities are  similar but are used for different purposes. Because research facilities  focus on developing new device concepts, materials, and processes, the  equipment is set up for flexibility because it is used for different  experiments to prove concepts and validate theories. Once a technology is  sufficiently developed, a small quantity is prototyped in a production  environment to prove the design. Production facilities are set up to  produce higher volumes of microelectronics and have more automation  and multiple sets of equipment to increase productivity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD and FFRDC Facilities Receiving DOD Funding Have Varying Microelectronics Research and Production Focuses", "paragraphs": ["At the time of our review, eight DOD and FFRDC facilities that received  funding from DOD were involved in microelectronics research prototyping  or production. Three military facilities focused solely on research; three  primarily focused on research but had limited production capabilities; and  two focused solely on production (see fig. 4).", "The three military facilities provide basic and applied research covering a  wide spectrum of microelectronic devices and materials. For example, the  Naval Research Laboratory facility is conducting basic research on the  potential application of nonsilicon materials in microelectronic devices.  Through its applied research, the Air Force Research Laboratory facility  developed a process to improve the performance and reliability of  microwave devices needed for military radar and communications  systems. This technology was ultimately transferred from the Air Force to  various contractors and used in a number of systems, including the Joint  Strike Fighter. The Army Research Laboratory facility conducts both basic  and applied research, primarily on multifunction radiofrequency,  optoelectronics, and power conversion.", "Three other facilities also conduct research but can produce prototypes or  limited numbers of devices if commercial sources are not available. For  example, the Lincoln Laboratory\u2019s facility\u2014which primarily focuses on  applied research in sensing and signal processing technologies\u2014has  developed components for the space-based visible sensor because no  commercial source was available to meet this DOD need. Sandia\u2019s facility  primarily focuses on research and design of radiation hardened  microelectronics. However, because the number of commercial producers  able to meet the radiation requirements of the Department of Energy and  DOD has dwindled to two suppliers, Sandia maintains limited in-house  production capability to fill near-term critical needs. According to Sandia  officials, they have not been called upon to produce microelectronics for  DOD in recent years. The SPAWAR facility, which recently closed,  primarily conducted research on radiation-hardened microelectronics, but  at one time produced these devices for the Navy\u2019s Trident missile system.  When production of these devices was transferred to a commercial  supplier, the facility maintained capability to produce microelectronics as  a back-up to the commercial supplier.", "Two facilities focused only on production\u2014one on leading edge  technology and one on lagging edge technology. NSA\u2019s microelectronics  facility focuses on producing cryptographic microelectronics\u2014devices not  readily obtainable on the commercial market because of their unique and  highly classified requirements. DMEA fills a unique role within DOD by  providing solutions to microelectronics that are no longer commercially  available. DMEA acquires process lines that commercial firms are  abandoning and, through reverse-engineering and prototyping, provides  DOD with these abandoned devices. In some cases, DMEA may produce  the device.", "The type and complexity of research conducted or device produced  largely determines a facility\u2019s clean room class and size and its equipment  replacement costs. For example, to produce cryptographic electronics,  NSA has a 20,000 square foot class 10 clean room facility. In contrast, the  Naval Research Laboratory conducts research in a 5,000 square foot class  100 clean room facility, with some class 10 modules where greater  cleanliness is required. In general, research does not require state-of-the- art equipment to prove concepts, and tools can be purchased one at a time  and are often second-hand or donated.", "Table 1 summarizes the eight facilities\u2019 microelectronics focus, clean room  class and size, and equipment replacement costs.", "Since we began our review, the SPAWAR facility closed on October 31,  2004, making Sandia the only backup to the two remaining commercial  radiation-hardened suppliers to DOD. Officials from the facility told us  that without funds from the Trident program, operating the facility became  cost prohibitive. Further, NSA\u2019s microelectronics facility is slated for  closure in 2006. NSA estimated that it would cost $1.7 billion to upgrade its  equipment and facility to produce the next generation of integrated  circuits. NSA is contracting with IBM to take over production of the  microelectronic devices produced at its facility. Part of the contract costs  includes security requirements for IBM to produce classified circuits.  There may be changes to other facilities pending the review of the Base  Realignment and Closure Commission for 2005. As a result of prior  commission recommendations, the Army constructed a new facility to  consolidate Army specialized electronics research into one location."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Several Mechanisms for Coordinating Research", "paragraphs": ["DOD has several mechanisms in place aimed at coordinating and planning  research conducted by the Air Force, Army, Navy, and defense agencies.
