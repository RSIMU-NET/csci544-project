In recent years, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has made efforts to improve the transparency, oversight, and management of the federal government's IT investments. More recently, in June 2009, OMB deployed the IT Dashboard, a Web-based system that provides detailed performance information on federal IT investments. GAO was asked to (1) describe the current number and types of IT investments reported by federal agencies on the IT Dashboard, (2) evaluate the adequacy of OMB's guidance to federal agencies in reporting on IT investments, and (3) evaluate efforts to identify and address potentially duplicative investments. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed data from the IT Dashboard, analyzed 10 federal agencies' investment guidance and reports, and interviewed agency officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["According to data reported on OMB's IT Dashboard in July 2011, 26 federal agencies plan to spend almost $79 billion on 7,248 IT investments in fiscal year 2011. OMB often uses the $79 billion figure in referring to annual federal investments in IT; however, it is important to note that this figure does not reflect the spending of the entire federal government. It does not include IT investments by 58 independent executive branch agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency, or by the legislative or judicial branches. A closer look at the $79 billion in investments for the 26 agencies reveals that (1) the expenditures are split almost evenly between major and nonmajor (in terms of cost, risk, and other factors) investments; (2) about two-thirds of the expenditures are for systems in an operational state, while about one-third of the expenditures provide for the development of new systems; and (3) there are hundreds of investments providing similar functions across the federal government. For example, agencies reported 1,536 information and technology management investments, 781 supply chain management investments, and 661 human resource management investments. OMB provides guidance to agencies on how to report on their IT investments, but this guidance does not ensure complete reporting or facilitate the identification of duplicative investments. Specifically, agencies differ on what investments they include as an IT investment; for example, 5 of the 10 agencies GAO reviewed consistently consider investments in research and development systems as IT, and 5 do not. As a result, the 26 federal agencies' annual IT investments are likely greater that the $79 billion reported in fiscal year 2011. In addition, OMB's guidance to federal agencies requires each investment to be mapped to a single functional category. This limits OMB's ability to identify duplicative investments both within and across agencies because similar investments may be organized into different categories. OMB and federal agencies have undertaken several initiatives to address potentially duplicative IT investments. For example, OMB has efforts under way to consolidate similar functions through its \"line of business\" initiatives and has reduced the scope of three duplicative systems identified during executive reviews of high-priority projects. In addition, most of the agencies GAO reviewed established guidance for ensuring new investments are not duplicative with existing systems. However, most of OMB's recent initiatives have not yet demonstrated results. Further, agencies do not routinely assess operational systems to determine if they are duplicative. Until agencies routinely assess their IT investment portfolios to identify and reduce duplicative systems, the government's current situation of having hundreds of similar IT investments will continue to exist."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that OMB clarify its reporting on IT investments and improve its guidance to agencies on identifying and categorizing IT investments.

Among its provisions, this  law establishes agency responsibility for maximizing the value and  assessing and managing the risks of major information systems  initiatives. It also requires that OMB develop and oversee policies,  principles, standards, and guidelines for federal agency information  technology functions, including periodic evaluations of major  information systems. \uf0b7  The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996\u2014The act places responsibility for  managing investments with the heads of agencies and establishes  chief information officers (CIO) to advise and assist agency heads in  carrying out this responsibility. Additionally, this law requires OMB to  establish processes to analyze, track, and evaluate the risks and  results of major capital investments in information systems made by  federal agencies and report to Congress on the net program  performance benefits achieved as a result of these investments. \uf0b7  The E-Government Act of 2002\u2014The act establishes a federal e- government initiative, which encourages the use of Web-based  Internet applications to enhance the access to and delivery of  government information and service to citizens, to business partners,  to employees, and among agencies at all levels of government. The  act also requires OMB to report annually to Congress on the status of  e-government initiatives. In these reports, OMB is to describe the  administration\u2019s use of e-government principles to improve  government performance and the delivery of information and services  to the public.", "OMB subsequently began several initiatives to help fulfill these  responsibilities:  In February 2002, OMB established the Federal Enterprise  Architecture (FEA) program. According to OMB, the FEA is intended  to facilitate governmentwide improvement through cross-agency  analysis and identification of duplicative investments, gaps, and  opportunities for collaboration, interoperability, and integration within  and across agency programs. The FEA is composed of five \u201creference  models\u201d describing the federal government\u2019s (1) business (or mission)  processes and functions, independent of the agencies that perform  them; (2) performance goals and outcome measures; (3) means of  service delivery; (4) information and data definitions; and (5)  technology standards. The reference models are intended to inform  agency efforts to develop their agency-specific enterprise  architectures and enable agencies to ensure that their proposed  investments are not duplicative with those of other agencies and to  pursue, where appropriate, joint projects.", "In April 2003, OMB established the Office of E-Government to  promote better use of the Internet and other information technologies  to improve government services for citizens, internal government  operations, and opportunities for citizen participation in government.  In recent years, OMB e-government initiatives have fostered the  establishment of centralized systems across the government. Key  efforts target electronically filing annual tax returns, providing a one- stop portal for emergency response information, developing a  governmentwide electronic travel system, and consolidating the  number of payroll systems to a small number of providers.", "In March 2004, OMB established multiple \u201cLine of Business\u201d (LOB)  initiatives to consolidate redundant IT investments and business  processes across the federal government in areas including case  management, grants management, human resources management,  federal health architecture, information systems security, budget  formulation and execution, geospatial information, financial  management, and IT infrastructure. Each LOB initiative is led by an  individual agency and supported by other relevant agencies.

Specifically,  OMB requires 26 key federal departments and agencies (agencies) to  provide information related to their IT investments, including agency IT  investment portfolios (called exhibit 53s) and capital asset plans and  business cases (called exhibit 300s). The 26 federal agencies are listed in  table 1 and the exhibits are described below.  \uf0b7  Exhibit 53. The purpose of the exhibit 53 is to identify all IT  investments\u2014both major and nonmajor\u2014and their associated costs  within a federal organization. Information included on agency exhibit  53s is designed, in part, to help OMB better understand what  agencies are spending on IT investments. The information also  supports cost analyses prescribed by the Clinger-Cohen Act. As part  of the annual budget, OMB publishes a report on IT spending for the  federal government representing a compilation of exhibit 53 data  submitted by the 26 agencies. \uf0b7  Exhibit 300. The purpose of the exhibit 300s is to provide a business  case for each major IT investment and to allow OMB to monitor IT   investments once they are funded. Agencies are required to provide  information on each major investment\u2019s cost, schedule, and  performance.", "To help carry out its oversight role and assist the agencies in carrying out  their responsibilities as assigned by the Clinger-Cohen Act, OMB  developed a Management Watch List in 2003. This list included mission- critical projects that needed improvements in performance measures,  project management, IT security, or their overall justification. Further, in  August 2005, OMB established a High-Risk List, which consisted of  projects identified by federal agencies, with the assistance of OMB, as  requiring special attention from oversight authorities and the highest  levels of agency management.", "More recently, in June 2009, to further improve the transparency into and  oversight of agencies\u2019 IT investments, OMB publicly deployed a website,  known as the IT Dashboard, which replaced its Management Watch List  and High-Risk List. The Dashboard displays information on the cost,  schedule, and performance of 828 major federal IT investments at 26  federal agencies. In addition, the Dashboard allows users to download  exhibit 53 data, which includes information on both major and nonmajor  investments. According to OMB, these data are intended to provide a  near real-time perspective of the performance of these investments, as  well as a historical perspective. Further, the public display of these data  are intended to allow OMB, other oversight bodies, and the general public  to hold the government agencies accountable for results and progress.", "According to OMB officials, the agency\u2019s analysts use the IT Dashboard  to identify IT investments that are experiencing performance problems  and to select them for a TechStat session\u2014a review of selected IT  investments between OMB and agency leadership that is led by the  Federal CIO. As of December 2010, OMB had held 58 of these sessions.  Further, OMB officials told us that, in mid-2011, TechStat reviews began  to occur at the agency level, and as of September 2011, each of the  agencies that participated in the IT Dashboard held agency-level  TechStat meetings.

In January 2006, we issued a report on the accuracy and  reliability of agencies\u2019 exhibit 300s. We found that underlying support for  the information in the exhibit 300 was often inadequate. Specifically, we  reported that the exhibit 300s had three types of weaknesses: (1)  underlying documentation either did not exist or disagreed with the exhibit  300, (2) agencies did not always demonstrate that they complied with  federal or departmental requirements or policies with regard to  management and reporting processes, and (3) cost data were generally  unreliable. We recommended that OMB direct agencies to identify and  disclose weaknesses in data accuracy and reliability. We also  recommended that OMB develop more explicit guidance for the exhibit  300s and provide training to agency personnel for completing exhibit  300s. In response, OMB issued guidance directing agencies to ensure  that they are complying with OMB guidance on information quality,  modified exhibit 300 guidance to make it more explicit in certain sections,  and provided training to agencies on how to complete their exhibit 300s.", "More recently, we issued two reports on the IT Dashboard. In July 2010  we reported that the Dashboard had increased the transparency and  oversight of federal IT investments; however, the cost and schedule  ratings on the Dashboard were not always accurate for selected  investments. Specifically, of the eight investments selected for review,  we found that four had notable discrepancies on either their cost or  schedule ratings. We noted that a primary reason for the data  inaccuracies was that while the Dashboard was intended to represent  near real-time performance information, the cost and schedule ratings did  not take into consideration current performance. As a result, the ratings  were based on outdated information. Another issue with the ratings was  the wide variation in the number of milestones agencies reported, which  was partly because OMB\u2019s guidance to agencies was too general. We  recommended that OMB report on its planned changes to the Dashboard  to improve the accuracy of performance information and provide guidance  to agencies that standardizes milestone reporting. OMB agreed with our  recommendations and initiated work to address them.", "Subsequently, in March 2011, we reported that OMB had initiated several  efforts to increase the Dashboard\u2019s value as an oversight tool, and had  used the Dashboard\u2019s data to improve federal IT management. These  efforts include streamlining key OMB investment reporting tools,  eliminating manual monthly submissions, coordinating with agencies to  improve data, and improving the Dashboard\u2019s user interface. However,  we also noted that while the efforts contributed to data quality  improvements, performance data inaccuracies remained. The ratings of  selected IT investments on the Dashboard did not always accurately  reflect current performance, which is counter to the website\u2019s purpose of  reporting near real-time performance. Specifically, we found that cost  ratings were inaccurate for 6 of the 10 investments that we reviewed, and  schedule ratings were inaccurate for 9. These inaccuracies can be  attributed to weaknesses in how agencies report data to the Dashboard,  such as providing erroneous data submissions, as well as limitations in  how OMB calculates the ratings. Accordingly, we recommended that  heads of each of the five selected agencies with inaccurate ratings take  steps to improve the accuracy and reliability of Dashboard information  and OMB improve how it rates investments relative to current  performance and schedule variance. In response, four of the selected  agencies agreed with our recommendation, and one agreed to consider it.

As a result, not all IT  investments are included in the federal government\u2019s estimate of annual  IT spending.

Both NASA and Commerce include a  spacecraft\u2019s ground systems (such as satellite command-and-control  systems and satellite data-processing systems) in their exhibit 53s.  However, neither agency includes the technology components on the  spacecraft itself\u2014including instruments, computers, and transponders\u2014 even though these components acquire, manage, and transmit data.

These include its E-government, LOB,  and FEA initiatives, as well as targeted IT modernizations and TechStat  reviews. However, the results of these initiatives are mixed. A discussion  of each follows:  \uf0b7  E-government initiatives. OMB and agency officials have reported that  several of the e-government initiatives were successful at reducing  duplication across the government. According to OMB, the E-payroll  initiative consolidated 26 separate payroll systems down to 4 e-payroll  providers. Similarly, 21 agencies now use the E-gov travel service and  have seen a reduction in costs. For example, according to OMB, the  Department of Housing and Urban Development decreased travel  voucher costs from $75 per voucher to about $13.75. According to  OMB officials, their shared services initiative\u2014still in its planning  stages\u2014is a continuation of these e-government initiatives. \uf0b7  LOB initiatives. OMB currently has nine LOB initiatives to consolidate  redundant IT investments and business processes across the federal  government in the areas of case management, grants management,  human resources management, federal health architecture,  information systems security, budget formulation and execution,  geospatial information, financial management, and IT infrastructure.  According to OMB\u2019s annual reports on e-government and LOB  initiatives as of fiscal year 2010, since 2006, federal agencies have  reported spending about $445 million on LOB initiatives. However, the  benefits of these initiatives are mixed. In its 2011 annual report, OMB  stated that agencies had made progress in developing guidance and  obtaining buy-in from multiple agencies. For example, OMB reported  that the federal health architecture LOB allowed federal agencies to  coordinate with each other and with tribal, state, local, and private  sectors to begin developing standards for health information  exchanges. Similarly, OMB reported that the budget formulation and  execution LOB allowed the federal budget community to begin to  develop common tools and best practices. However, the 2011 annual  report described demonstrated cost savings for only three LOBs, of  which only two provided the estimated amount of savings.  Specifically, OMB reported that the geospatial and the information  systems security LOBs resulted in cost avoidance or savings of about  $9 million and $7.6 million, respectively, by allowing for blanket  purchase agreements. OMB also reported that the grants  management LOB allowed agencies and other organizations to  reduce the number of systems, but it did not provide a number or  specify which systems were eliminated. \uf0b7  FEA. When originally developed in 1999, the FEA was intended to  provide federal agencies with a common construct for their  architectures and thereby facilitate the coordination of common  business processes, technology insertion, information flows, and  system investments among federal agencies. As part of the fiscal year  2004 budget cycle, OMB required agencies to align proposed IT  investments to the FEA reference models; this information was then  used to develop the initial LOB initiatives. Since that time, agencies  have established individual enterprise architectures and used them to  characterize their IT investments and to guide plans for the future. In  2004, we reported that the FEA was a work in progress and was still  evolving. To this point, the Federal Chief Enterprise Architect  recently began planning changes to the FEA framework\u2014such as  updating existing reference models and adding reference models for  software applications, infrastructure, and security\u2014to further assist  agencies in reducing duplication and improving mission performance.  OMB\u2019s Chief Architect reported that comprehensive changes to the  FEA are planned for fiscal year 2012.  \uf0b7  Targeted IT initiatives. OMB officials reported that ongoing IT  initiatives, including efforts to consolidate federal data centers and to  develop trusted Internet connections, could help reduce duplication  across government. Specifically, in February 2010, OMB began an  initiative meant to consolidate federal data centers and hardware and  software assets through virtualization, cloud computing, and  consolidation. In July 2011, OMB reported that the federal  government had already closed 81 centers and was on track to close  137 centers by December 2011 and 800 by 2015. However, in July  2011, we reported that federal agencies\u2019 data center inventories and  consolidation plans were incomplete and recommended that agencies  complete their data center consolidation inventories and plans, and  that OMB\u2019s data center task force oversee these efforts. Separately,  in November 2007, OMB announced its trusted Internet connection  initiative to improve security by reducing and consolidating external  network connections. However, we reported in March 2010 that none  of the 23 participating agencies had yet met all of the initiative\u2019s  requirements and recommended steps to improve communication and  performance measures. In addition, we recently reported on other  governmentwide initiatives and found that the FedRAMP project,  which is to provide, among other functions, continuous security  monitoring of cloud computing systems for multiagency use, is  currently behind schedule, and has not yet defined all performance  metrics. Similarly, the FedSpace project, which is to provide federal  employees and contractors collaboration tools for cross-agency  knowledge sharing, is also behind schedule and has not defined all of  its performance metrics. We recommended establishing metrics so  that the benefits of these initiatives can be effectively measured. \uf0b7  TechStat reviews. OMB works with federal agencies to identify IT  projects that need increased visibility in the agency; high-risk projects  are then selected for a TechStat session. This program enables the  government to improve or terminate IT investments that are  experiencing performance problems. According to OMB officials,  based on the TechStat reviews held as of March 2011, OMB reduced  the scope of three investments that agencies identified as  duplicative. While promising, only a small fraction of the over 7,000  investments that were identified by agencies for fiscal year 2011 have  undergone TechStat reviews."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Federal Agencies Evaluate New Investments to Ensure They Are Not Duplicative, but Do Not Routinely Assess Legacy Systems", "paragraphs": ["Highly performing organizations manage investments in a portfolio  approach, selecting and evaluating investments by how well they support  the agency mission and \u201cde-selecting\u201d obsolete, high-risk, and low-value  IT investments. Our prior work has shown that major federal agencies  have guidance for the selection and oversight of IT investments. This  guidance generally calls for establishing a department-level investment  review board to select the projects to be included in the agency\u2019s IT  investment portfolio. In this way, selection decisions can be made in the  context of all other investments, thus minimizing duplication across  investments.", "Officials from several of the federal agencies we reviewed stated that they  routinely evaluate new investments to ensure that they are not duplicative  with existing systems. For example, investment review guidance at  NASA, Justice, and Agriculture requires officials to assess whether an  investment is duplicative before it is approved. Further, Commerce  officials explained that finding duplication is a challenge, but they attempt  to identify duplication through their investment selection process and  through their Commerce IT review board.", "However, several of the agencies do not routinely assess legacy systems  to determine if they are duplicative. Specifically, officials from several  agencies with billions of dollars in investments noted that they have  limited staff resources for performing all of the investment control  processes\u2014including reviewing exhibit 300s and IT Dashboard data\u2014for  the entire agency. However, given the sheer number of similar  investments identified earlier in this report, such as Energy\u2019s 172  information and technology management investments, and DOD\u2019s 657  supply chain management investments, and the large amount of funds  spent on these investments, it appears that thorough assessments are  justified. Until agencies routinely assess their entire IT portfolios  (including both developmental and operational systems) to identify and  reduce duplicative systems, such duplication will continue to exist."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies spend tens of billions of dollars on IT investments each  year. However, because OMB does not enforce the definition of IT  provided in the Clinger-Cohen Act, agencies exclude key categories of IT  investments\u2014such as space systems\u2014in their annual reports on IT  investments. These excluded investments are not subjected to OMB\u2019s IT  oversight process, and their associated costs are not included in OMB\u2019s  annual estimate of IT investments. As a result, the nation\u2019s actual annual  investment in IT is much higher than the $78.8 billion identified by  agencies. In addition, OMB\u2019s guidance on identifying investments\u2019 primary  functions has led to a situation in which similar systems could be in  different categories. With clearer categorizations, agencies and OMB  would be better positioned to identify and address duplication in their  system development efforts.", "OMB and federal agencies have initiatives under way to help address  potentially duplicative systems. While selected initiatives have had  success in consolidating systems, most have not yet demonstrated  results. Further, the agencies we evaluated do not routinely evaluate  legacy systems to determine if they are duplicative and can be eliminated  or consolidated. Until OMB and federal agencies consistently target  potentially duplicative investments within and across agencies, federal  agencies may continue to spend taxpayer funds developing systems that  perform similar functions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that IT investments are adequately identified and categorized,  we recommend that the Director of OMB take the following four actions:  specify which executive branch agencies are included when  discussing the annual federal IT investment portfolio; clarify guidance to federal agencies in reporting on their IT  investments by specifying whether certain types of systems, such as  those in research and development and space systems, should be  included; revise guidance to federal agencies on categorizing IT investments to  ensure that the categorizations are clear and allow agencies to  choose secondary categories, where applicable, which will aid in  identifying potentially duplicative investments; and require federal agencies to report the steps they take to ensure that  their IT investments are not duplicative as part of their annual budget  and IT investment submissions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We received oral comments on a draft of our report from OMB officials,  including the Federal Chief Enterprise Architect, a senior policy analyst,  and a representative from the office of the General Counsel. In those  comments, OMB generally disagreed with the first two recommendations  and agreed with the second two recommendations. Specifically, OMB  officials requested that GAO remove the first and second  recommendations because they believe that the agency has already  addressed them. Regarding our recommendation to clearly identify which  agencies are included when discussing the federal IT investment  portfolio, agency officials noted that both the A-11 guidance and the  \u201cFrequently Asked Questions\u201d section of the IT Dashboard clearly indicate  which agencies are included in the portfolio of IT investments. However,  we believe that the recommendation is warranted because on its website  and in presentations, OMB frequently refers to \u201cthe federal government\u2019s  $80 billion annual investment in IT\u201d without clarifying that this $80 billion  investment does not represent the entire federal government. Regarding  our recommendation to OMB to clarify its guidance to federal agencies on  reporting on IT investments, agency officials noted that existing guidance  (including OMB circular A-11 and OMB memo 11-29) already discusses  how to identify IT investments. We believe that the recommendation is  appropriate because the existing guidance does not address key  categories of IT investments (such as space systems and systems in  research and development) where we found inconsistencies among  agencies.", "OMB officials stated that the agency is working to address the third and  fourth recommendations. Specifically, OMB plans to update the Federal  Enterprise Architecture reference models in fall 2011 to provide additional  clarity on how agencies should characterize investments in order to  enhance the identification of potentially duplicative investments. Also,  OMB\u2019s IT Reform Plan includes several initiatives to reduce duplicative  investments, including efforts in data center consolidation, cloud  computing, and shared services. Officials noted that these initiatives will  continue to be pursued with agencies through the annual budget process  and related reporting requirements. While we acknowledge that these  initiatives offer promise in identifying and reducing duplicative  investments, we believe that OMB can do more to encourage agencies to  look internally for duplicative investments.", "We also sought comments on a draft of our report from the 10 agencies in  our review. While none of the agencies agreed or disagreed with our  recommendations to OMB, several provided comments. Each agency\u2019s  comments are discussed in more detail below.", "In an e-mail, Agriculture\u2019s Associate CIO for Technology Planning,  Architecture, and E-Government stated that the department had no  formal comments on the report.", "In written comments, the Acting Secretary of Commerce noted that  the report thoroughly assessed OMB\u2019s policy and guidance, and fairly  assessed Commerce\u2019s IT information and data.

The agency believes  that this distinction is an issue that needs to be addressed by OMB  and all federal agencies. We agree that it is appropriate for OMB and  federal agencies to work together to determine if there is to be a  meaningful distinction between OMB\u2019s policies and its guidance to  agencies. However, this distinction does not detract from our  recommendation that OMB clarify its guidance to agencies on  reporting on their IT investments. HHS\u2019s written comments are  provided in appendix V.", "In written comments, DHS\u2019s Director of the Departmental GAO/OIG  Liaison Office noted that the agency remains committed to continuing  its work with OMB and other relevant stakeholders to address  challenges related to identifying and eliminating potentially duplicative  systems.

We used this system as an example of a system in research  and development that is not included in the federal portfolio of IT  investments. Because the agency is expending funds on this system  and it is meant to integrate command, control, communications, and  information systems, we believe that it should be reported as an IT  investment. This example reinforces our recommendation to OMB to  clarify its guidance to federal agencies to specify whether such  investments should be included.", "In an e-mail, Treasury\u2019s Audit Liaison stated that the department had  no comments on the report.", "In an e-mail, an official from VA\u2019s Office of Congressional and  Legislative Affairs reported that the agency had no comments on the  draft report.", "In an e-mail, NASA\u2019s GAO/OIG Audit Liaison stated that the agency  had no comments or technical corrections to add to the report.", "OMB and several agencies also provided technical comments, which we  incorporated as appropriate.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.
