At this time, the federal regulatory community is exploring further changes. To contribute to the discussion surrounding these changes, GAO's objectives were to determine (1) according to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data, how many Fortune 500 companies obtained tax shelter services from their auditor; (2) according to IRS data, in how many Fortune 500 companies did the auditor provide the services to individual company officers or directors; and (3) whether selected Fortune 500 case study companies changed how they obtain tax services from their auditor in recent years. For the first two objectives, GAO used IRS and Standard and Poor's data after finding they were sufficiently reliable for our work. GAO counted a company, officer, or director as obtaining a tax shelter service from the company's external auditor when an auditor that IRS identified as promoting a tax shelter also audited the company in at least one year that the shelter was in effect. For the third objective, independent of any IRS information, GAO selected case studies on the basis of geographic location and previous GAO contact. The companies are illustrative in nature and not intended to be representative of other companies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["IRS data available on tax shelter services sometimes predate legislative and regulatory changes reflecting a heightened focus on auditor independence. However, both during this earlier period covered by some of the data and also following the recent changes, auditors were allowed to provide tax services, including tax shelter services, to firms they audited. According to IRS data, 61 Fortune 500 companies obtained tax shelter services from their external auditor during 1998 through 2003 for transactions generally reportable on tax returns sent to IRS. IRS considered some reportable transactions abusive, with tax benefits subject to disallowance under existing law, and other transactions to possibly have some traits of abuse. Estimated multi-year potential tax revenue lost to the federal government from the 61 companies' auditor-related transactions was about $3.4 billion (about $1.8 billion in categories IRS considered abusive). In 17 companies, at least one officer or director used the company's auditor to obtain individual tax shelter services. These numbers are imprecise because they have important limitations. These limitations, such as some transactions in IRS's database without tax shelter providers listed, are fully discussed in this report. Commenting on a draft of this report, IRS said that ongoing changes and recent legislation will enable it to address the data limitations noted. According to their representatives, all eight case study companies adopted or refined policies or practices in 2002 or 2003 for pre-approving tax services or governing the tax services provided, such as who would provide them. All eight reported using their auditor for tax services during 2000 through 2003. Two told us of obtaining tax shelter services from their auditor, but one of them obtained the services before this period. Six of the eight reported officers or directors obtaining individual tax services from the auditor at some time since 2000, with four disallowing the practice later. None reported officers or directors using the auditor for individual tax shelter services."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Independent public accountants play a critical role in capital and credit  markets by auditing companies\u2019 financial statements that millions of people  rely on when investing in the nation\u2019s securities markets.  Previous and  current auditor independence rules have allowed accounting firms to  provide tax services, including tax shelter services, to audit clients.  However, in May 2003, federal rules began requiring that clients\u2019 audit  committees pre-approve the services. Pre-approval requirements were  adopted pursuant to legislation that was precipitated by various corporate  accountability breakdowns.", "The Internal Revenue Code has defined tax shelters in various detailed and  complicated ways for purposes of having them registered, for applying  certain penalties, or for certain tax accounting rules. Although IRS has no  single, authoritative definition of abusive shelters, it has generally  characterized them as complex techniques promoted by sophisticated tax  professionals that companies and wealthy individuals use to exploit tax  loopholes and reap unintended tax benefits. Tax services include services  involving tax compliance, tax planning, and tax advice as described by the  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).", "In November 2003, the minority staff of the Permanent Subcommittee on  Investigations reported that selling potentially abusive and illegal tax  shelters was a lucrative business, with some professional firms, including  accounting firms, mass marketing generic tax products to multiple clients.   Such generic tax products are potentially illegal depending on how buyers  use them and calculate their tax liabilities.  In October 2003, we testified  that Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data sources, with their various  limitations, suggested that abusive tax shelters totaled tens of billions of  dollars of potential tax losses over about a decade.  More recently, the  federal regulatory community has proposed more changes relating to the  effect of auditor-provided tax services on auditor independence. In that  context, we are providing information on auditor-provided tax services,  including tax shelter services.", "As discussed with your office, our objectives were to obtain information on  both tax shelter services and other tax services provided by auditors of  Fortune 500 companies. Specifically, our objectives were to determine (1)  according to IRS data, how many Fortune 500 companies obtained tax  shelter services from their auditor; (2) according to IRS data, in how many  Fortune 500 companies did the auditor provide the services to individual  company officers or directors; (3) whether selected Fortune 500 case study  companies changed how they obtain tax services from their auditor in  recent years; and (4) how many of our case study companies provided  company funds to their auditor for tax shelter or other tax services for  company officers or directors, and what the minimum and maximum  amounts of the funds provided were.", "To accomplish our first two objectives, we matched data disclosed to or  discovered by IRS on tax shelter acquisitions and promoters of the tax  shelters to information we acquired from Standard and Poor\u2019s (S&P) on the  auditors, top officers, and directors of the April 2003 Fortune 500. We  considered a company, officer, or director as obtaining tax shelter services  from the company\u2019s auditor when, for at least one of the tax years for  which the company, officer, or director received a tax shelter benefit, the  company\u2019s auditor was identified as a promoter of the tax shelter by IRS.  We used the company\u2019s fiscal year 1998 through 2003 auditors for  performing our analysis and analyzed information from other years to  provide context.", "Although we found the data elements we used from the IRS and S&P  information were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our work, as will  be described later, the IRS data had important limitations and should be  used with caution. Despite these limitations, the information in this report  provides a general indication of the extent to which Fortune 500 companies  and their officers or directors used their external auditor for tax shelter  services. Our results are imprecise in reflecting the universe of companies,  officers, and directors that might have obtained tax shelter services from  the companies\u2019 auditors. For example, IRS\u2019s data may not include all tax  shelters because some taxpayers may not have disclosed all abusive or  other reportable transactions to IRS, and IRS likely has not identified all  such transactions on its own. On the other hand, the data also might  include some tax shelters that could later be determined nonabusive and  did include some items that needed to be reported to IRS but unexpectedly  turned out to be nonabusive. Although not all transactions turned out to be  abusive, we have included in our analysis those transactions that IRS or  taxpayers believed needed to be reported to the federal government.", "To accomplish our last two objectives, independent of any IRS information,  we studied eight Fortune 500 companies that were not intended to be  representative of other companies, and we collected information from their  management and audit committee chairs on tax services, including tax  shelter services, the eight companies obtained. We chose companies that  were geographically diverse and whose audit committee chair had not been  recently contacted for other GAO studies.", "We did our work between December 2003 and January 2005 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. A later section of  this report contains a complete discussion of our scope and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Both SEC and IRS have had an interest in the tax services, particularly tax  shelter services, that accounting firms provide taxpayers. In terms of SEC,  according to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, before an SEC registrant  company\u2019s auditor can provide non-audit services such as tax services to  the company, the company\u2019s audit committee must approve them. Effective  May 6, 2003, SEC adopted rules required by the act to strengthen conflict of  interest standards and clarify the relationship between the independent  auditor and the audit committee.", "In adopting these rules, SEC said it was enhancing the independence of  accountants that audited financial statements and prepared related reports  to be filed with SEC. It also said that accounting firms could provide tax  services to their audit clients, subject to each client\u2019s audit committee pre- approval, without impairing their independence. However, accountants  would impair their independence if they represented audit clients before a  tax or district court or a federal court of claims. Further, according to the  rules, audit committees should carefully scrutinize an accountant\u2019s  involvement in a transaction if the accountant initially recommended the  transaction, the transaction\u2019s sole business purpose might be tax  avoidance, and its tax treatment might not be supported in the Internal  Revenue Code and related regulations.", "The Sarbanes-Oxley Act established the Public Company Accounting  Oversight Board (PCAOB) and authorized it to establish standards and  rules for auditor independence. In exercising its responsibilities under the  act, PCAOB determined it was appropriate to consider the impact on  auditor independence of providing tax services to audit clients. In July  2004, it convened a roundtable discussion on the effect of tax services  provided by auditors on auditor independence. Participants at the  roundtable, including representatives of accounting firms, public  companies, investors, and regulators, discussed many different topics, with  suggestions including more PCAOB guidance to audit committees and a  rule barring auditors from providing at least some tax services to audit  clients.", "On December 14, 2004, PCAOB proposed new ethics and independence  rules, with comments due by February 14, 2005, and an effective date of no  earlier than October 20, 2005. The proposed rules would treat an  accounting firm registered with PCAOB as not independent in certain  instances for purposes of doing a financial statement audit and for other  purposes. For example, the firm would be considered not independent if it  provided services related to planning or giving an opinion on the tax  treatment of a listed (described later) or confidential transaction under  Department of the Treasury regulations. Similarly, the firm would be  considered not independent if it provided these services for a transaction  that was based on an aggressive interpretation of the applicable tax laws  and regulations. Such a transaction is one that satisfies three criteria: it was  initially recommended by a tax advisor; it has tax avoidance as a significant  purpose; and it \u201cis not at least more likely than not to be allowed under;  applicable tax laws.\u201d The proposal would also treat the firm as not  independent if the firm provided tax services to officers who oversee an  audit client\u2019s financial reporting. It would not prohibit the audit firm from  providing the audit client with routine tax return preparation and tax  compliance, general tax planning and advice, international assignment tax  services, and employee personal tax services. In addition, the proposal  would expand on current SEC pre-approval requirements to require an  auditor seeking audit committee pre-approval of tax services to give the  committee certain information, discuss with the committee the services\u2019  potential effects on the firm\u2019s independence, and document the  discussion\u2019s substance.", "Treasury regulations address IRS\u2019s oversight of tax shelters. Under the  regulations, there are six categories of transactions for which investors  must report, or disclose, the transactions into which they have entered, and  promoters must maintain lists of investors who have entered into the  transactions.", "At IRS, the Office of Tax Shelter Analysis (OTSA) maintains a database  containing information on tax shelter investors and promoters, including  accounting firms. Created in February 2000 to centralize and coordinate  IRS\u2019s response to abusive tax shelter activity nationwide, OTSA includes in  its database the amount of potential federal tax loss estimated by the  taxpayer or IRS to result from both listed and nonlisted transactions. These  losses, which also represent benefits to the taxpayer, may or may not be  disallowed by IRS upon further review of each transaction. IRS considers  listed transactions, which must be reported on tax returns sent to IRS, to be  abusive. The Joint Committee on Taxation has described listed  transactions as having a tax avoidance purpose, with the tax benefits  subject to disallowance under existing law. For a transaction to be listed,  IRS must issue a notice, regulation, or other form of published guidance  informing taxpayers of the details of the transaction. In October 2004, IRS  had 30 types of listed transactions, a number that had grown more quickly  in recent years than earlier. Nonlisted transactions generally are  transactions reportable to IRS that may have some characteristics of  abusive shelters but are not, and may never be, listed. At times, IRS  questions whether some nonlisted transactions should be moved into the  category of listed transactions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To address our first two objectives\u2014relating to Fortune 500 companies,  officers, and directors obtaining tax shelter services from their company  auditors--we matched data from two sources\u2014S&P and IRS. We acquired  specific S&P data elements for the 497 companies on the April 2003  Fortune 500 list that, according to S&P, either were publicly owned or had  to file with SEC for another reason, such as having publicly-traded debt.  The data elements included the company\u2019s employer identification number,  the names of company officers and directors, and the name of the  company\u2019s auditor for each year from 1998 through 2003. The number of  Fortune 500 companies for which we actually received S&P data varied; for  instance, we received names of directors and officers for 471 companies  and employer identification numbers for 492.", "As shown in table 1, the officers for 441 of the 471 companies were those  listed in the company\u2019s proxy statement section on most highly  compensated officers, as filed with SEC for either 2000 or 2002. We used  the years 2000 and 2002 because those were years when the federal  government was significantly enhancing its presence to counter tax shelter  activity that might have been going on for years. Because S&P did not have  similar top officer information for the other companies in the Fortune 500,  or 2000 or 2002 director information for any of them, it gave us the names  reflecting current officers and directors as of March 2004\u2014the date we  obtained the data. Obviously, some of the March 2004 officers for 30  companies and the March 2004 directors for all 471 might have been  different from those working in 2000 or 2002, which was closer to the time  when most of the tax benefits related to the shelters were taken.  Consequently, our analysis of the March 2004 information omits any  officers and directors who left the relevant companies after 2002.", "We matched the S&P data to tax shelter information in IRS\u2019s OTSA  database as of May 28, 2004. IRS\u2019s database included information disclosed  to or discovered by IRS on companies, individuals, and other taxpayers  who used tax shelters. It also included information on as many as three  entities, including accounting firms, which IRS said promoted the shelter to  the investor. We considered both listed and nonlisted transactions in the  database because from an auditor independence standpoint, in both cases  the promoters were involved with transactions that IRS or taxpayers  believed needed to be reported to the federal government.", "To determine to what extent the 497 companies obtained tax shelter  services, we matched the employer identification numbers in the S&P and  IRS databases. When we found a match, we checked the promoter  information in the IRS database against the audit firm information in the  S&P database to see if the same accounting firm was listed as a promoter  for a particular transaction and as the company\u2019s auditor for one or more  years that the shelter benefited the company. Although we do not know for  sure that a company obtained tax shelter and auditing services from an  accounting firm at exactly the same time, we considered it a match when at  least one of the tax years for which the company received a tax benefit  matched a fiscal year from 1998 through 2003 for which the accounting firm  was the company\u2019s auditor. We did this because IRS did not have  information on exactly when taxpayers obtained tax shelter services, and  1998 was the year before the Department of the Treasury reported that the  proliferation of corporate tax shelters was unacceptable. We analyzed  information from other years to provide context.", "We also matched the names of company officers and directors in the S&P  data to the names of the tax shelter investors in the IRS database.", "Whenever we found a match, we tried to verify if the same person was  actually involved, as opposed to two people with the same first and last  names. If the person appeared to be the same (for example, had the same  middle initial), we matched the promoter name for that individual and,  similar to what was just described, the tax benefit dates in the IRS database  to the auditing firm of the individual\u2019s company for 1998 through 2003 in the  S&P data. Our matching methodology did not allow us to detect instances  in which a spouse or other relative of the officer or director was the tax  shelter investor or instances in which the investing entity was a partnership  or other unit formed by the officer or director.", "As part of our work, we tested the reliability of IRS\u2019s database and the data  we received from S&P. For the IRS database, we reviewed related  documentation, interviewed knowledgeable officials, and did electronic  testing. For the information received from S&P, we reviewed S&P  information on its controls over the data and verified sample data to  publicly available documents obtained from SEC\u2019s Web site or elsewhere.  For both types of data, we found that the required data elements were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our work. However, as we will  describe later, the IRS database had important limitations and therefore  our results are imprecise in reflecting the universe of companies, officers,  and directors that might have obtained tax shelter services from the  companies\u2019 auditors.", "To deal with our last two objectives--those on case study companies  obtaining tax shelter and other tax services from their auditor and funding  these services for officers and directors--we selected publicly traded  companies among the Fortune 500 to study in depth. Independent of any  IRS information, we reviewed the April 2003 Fortune 500 list and chose  companies that were headquartered in three geographically diverse parts of  the country and whose audit committee chair worked or lived in one of  those areas. We excluded companies whose audit committee chairs had  been contacted in other recent GAO studies. Of the 23 companies that met  our criteria, 8 agreed to provide information in response to a structured  interview guide we used. For 5 of these 8 companies, we interviewed the  audit committee chair. For the other 3, we relied only on written answers  we received from the companies. Because we studied so few companies  and because of the method of selection, we cannot say that the responses  we received represent any larger group of companies. Further, the  companies that we did study might have agreed to participate because they  had special reasons for wanting to share their tax services experiences  with us. Although they were not representative of change overall, we  believe that the 8 companies illustrate some of the changes that have  occurred in recent years related to auditors providing tax services.", "We did our work between December 2003 and January 2005 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "According to Available but Limited Data, 61 Fortune 500 Companies Used Tax Shelters That Had Been Promoted by Their Auditor", "paragraphs": ["As shown in table 2, 61 Fortune 500 companies used a tax shelter that was  promoted by an accounting firm that was their external auditor for one or  more years from 1998 through 2003 in which the company received benefits  from the tax shelter. The 61 companies had 82 transactions worth about  $3.4 billion in estimated potential tax losses over many years for  transactions that were generally reportable on tax returns sent to IRS.

For instance, including  the 61 companies just described, 67 companies with about $4.1 billion in  tax shelter benefits obtained tax shelter services from a firm that was their  auditor sometime, but not necessarily in the same year the company  received some or all the related tax shelter benefits. We include the 6  additional companies because some analysts have questioned the propriety  of accounting firms promoting tax shelters even to companies they are not  currently auditing. For example, recent press reports described a company  that employed an accounting firm as its auditor sometime after the year for  which the company claimed a tax shelter benefit from the shelter provided  by the accounting firm. According to the reports, the auditor began auditing  financial statement items resulting from the tax shelter that it had  previously provided, a task the auditor said was within SEC rules.", "For further context, table 3 shows that including the 67 companies, 114  Fortune 500 companies and almost 4,400 total taxpayers obtained tax  shelter services from accounting firms, including firms they had not ever  used as auditors but might one day. The estimated potential tax losses  involved were about $9 billion for the 114 companies for any year in IRS\u2019s  database and about $24 billion for all taxpayers. Although we did not have  enough information to know whether taxpayers obtained fewer tax shelter  services from accounting firms as time went on, several accounting firms  testified in November 2003 before the Permanent Subcommittee on  Investigations of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs that they  had scaled back their tax shelter activities in general.", "Including the 114 companies, 207 Fortune 500 companies, regardless of  who their promoters were, used tax shelters accounting for about $56  billion in estimated potential tax losses, about 44 percent of it related to tax  years 1998 through 2003. To break out the $56 billion further, of the 492  Fortune 500 companies for whom S&P supplied employer identification  numbers, 139 appeared in IRS\u2019s database to have engaged in listed  transactions with estimated potential tax losses of about $16 billion. The  number of companies engaged in nonlisted transactions estimated to be  potentially worth about $40 billion was 129, and because some companies  were involved in both kinds of transactions, the number engaged in either  listed or nonlisted transactions was 207.", "The 207 Fortune 500 companies\u2019 transactions are part of IRS\u2019s total tax  shelter database. As of May 28, 2004, for all taxpayers, the database  contained listed and nonlisted transactions with estimated potential tax  losses of about $129 billion, about half of it related to tax years 1998  through 2003. Most of the dollar amounts related to nonlisted, as opposed  to listed, transactions, and some of the amounts shown as listed might  represent transactions that taxpayers entered into before IRS had  designated them as listed.
