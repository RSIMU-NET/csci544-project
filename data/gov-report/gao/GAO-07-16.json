The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which has responsibility for safety and industry promotion, licenses operations of commercial space launches and launch sites. To allow the industry to grow, Congress prohibited FAA from regulating crew and passenger safety before 2012, except in response to high-risk events. GAO evaluated FAA's (1) safety oversight of commercial space launches, (2) response to emerging issues, and (3) challenges in regulating and promoting space tourism and responding to competitive issues affecting the industry. GAO reviewed FAA's applicable safety oversight processes and interviewed federal and industry officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Several measures indicate that FAA has provided a reasonable level of safety oversight for commercial launches. For example, none of the 179 commercial launches that FAA licensed over the past 17 years resulted in fatalities, serious injuries, or significant property damage. However, FAA shared safety oversight with the Department of Defense (DOD) for most of these launches because they took place at federal launch sites operated by DOD. In addition, FAA's licensing activities incorporate a system safety process, which GAO recognizes as effective in identifying and mitigating risks. GAO's analysis of FAA records indicates that the agency is appropriately applying management controls in its licensing activities, thereby helping to ensure that the licensees meet FAA's safety requirements. In response to emerging issues in the commercial space launch industry, such as the potential development of space tourism, FAA has developed safety regulations and training for agency employees. The industry has raised concerns about the costs of complying with regulations and about the flexibility of the regulations to accommodate launch differences. However, FAA believes it has minimized compliance costs by basing its regulations on common safety standards and has allowed for flexibility by taking a case-by-case approach to licensing and by providing waivers in certain circumstances. FAA faces several challenges and competitive issues in regulating and promoting space tourism. For example, FAA expects to need more experienced staff for safety oversight as new technologies for space tourism evolve, but has not estimated its future resource needs. Other challenges for FAA include determining the specific circumstances under which it would regulate space flight crew and passenger safety before 2012 and balancing its responsibilities for safety and promotion to avoid conflicts. Recognizing the potential conflict in the oversight of commercial space launches, Congress required the Department of Transportation (DOT) to commission a report by December 2008 on several issues, including whether the promotion of human space flight should be separate from the regulation of such activity. In addition, U.S. commercial space launch industry representatives said that they face competitive issues concerning high launch costs and export controls that can affect their ability to sell services overseas. The federal government has provided support to the industry to help lower launch costs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2004, the successful launches of SpaceShipOne raised the possibility of  an emerging commercial space tourism industry that would make human  space travel available to the public for the first time. Previously, human  space travel in the United States was limited to the National Aeronautics  and Space Administration\u2019s (NASA) flights. SpaceShipOne is a reusable  launch vehicle that resembles an airplane. It was launched from an  airplane into space, where it traveled nearly 70 miles above the earth (an  altitude known as suborbital space), and returned to the original launch  site. Designed to carry two crew members and one passenger,  SpaceShipOne is the first commercial reusable launch vehicle licensed by  the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Several companies in addition  to SpaceShipOne\u2019s designer, Scaled Composites, LLC, are developing  reusable launch vehicles for commercial space tourism and plan to start  operations within the next few years. Historically, commercial space  launches carried payloads, generally satellites, into orbit using expendable  launch vehicles that did not return to earth.", "In 2004, the U.S. commercial space launch industry accounted for $1.7  billion in economic impact, according to FAA. At that time, the industry  consisted of a few FAA-licensed launch companies that operated primarily  from Department of the Air Force launch sites. Currently, the industry  appears to be expanding\u2014more firms are applying to FAA for launch  licenses, and several commercial spaceports are being planned. One space  tourism company, Virgin Galactic, which intends to start operations in  2009 and to initially charge $200,000 per passenger, plans to carry 3,000  passengers over the subsequent 5 years on space flights, with 100  individuals having already paid the full fare. In addition, the U.S.  commercial space launch industry faces strong competition from  international companies, primarily from Russia and Europe, offering  satellite launches on expendable launch vehicles. Russia is also the only  nation that has commercially launched humans into space, with four  individuals having paid an estimated $20 million each for orbital space  flights.", "The federal government regulates and supports the commercial space  launch industry to varying degrees. In 1984, the Commercial Space Launch  Act gave the Department of Transportation (DOT) the authority to license  and monitor the safety of commercial space launches and to promote the  industry. In 2004, the Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act gave  FAA the specific responsibility of overseeing the safety of space tourism,  but the act prohibits FAA from regulating crew and passenger safety  before 2012, except in response to high-risk incidents, serious injuries, or  fatalities. The Department of Defense (DOD), through the Air Force,  provides infrastructure, operations support, and safety oversight for  government and commercial launches at its launch sites. The Department  of Commerce (Commerce) is also responsible for promoting the  commercial space industry.", "This report discusses the federal role in commercial space launches and  the government\u2019s response to emerging industry trends\u2014both  domestically and internationally. In this review, we addressed the  following questions:    How well does FAA oversee the safety of commercial space launches?", "To what extent is FAA responding to key emerging issues in the  commercial space launch industry?", "What challenges does FAA face in regulating and promoting the  commercial space launch industry?", "What are the key competitive issues affecting the U.S. commercial space  launch industry, and to what extent are the industry and government  responding to them?", "To determine how well FAA is overseeing the safety of commercial space  launches, we reviewed the agency\u2019s safety oversight processes, including  the documentation of its licensing and safety monitoring processes,  internal guidance and policies, applicable regulations, and memoranda of  agreement with other federal agencies. We also reviewed FAA\u2019s use of  system safety procedures and interviewed industry experts and FAA  officials. Because FAA relies on the Air Force to conduct safety oversight  at the Air Force\u2019s two primary launch sites in Florida and California, we  reviewed Air Force launch safety requirements and interviewed FAA and  Air Force officials about their respective responsibilities and interaction.  In addition, we examined FAA\u2019s application of certain management  controls in its licensing and monitoring processes using our guidelines for  management controls at federal agencies, such as documentation and  timeliness of the review process and communication and consultation  with relevant federal agencies. To determine the extent to which FAA is  responding to key emerging issues in the commercial space launch  industry, such as space tourism, we identified these issues through  literature reviews and assessed the extent of FAA\u2019s response through  interviews with federal government officials and industry representatives.  These industry representatives were from associations that represent the  commercial space launch industry and from entities that had received  launch or launch-site licenses from FAA or were consulting with FAA  about receiving such licenses as of September 2005. We also interviewed  these officials and representatives to identify the challenges FAA faces in  regulating and promoting the commercial space launch industry. To  determine the key competitive issues affecting the U.S commercial space  launch industry and the extent to which the industry and the federal  government are responding to them, we conducted a literature review that  included applicable laws affecting industry competitiveness and  interviewed agency officials, industry representatives, and industry  experts to obtain their views. We conducted our review from August 2005  through October 2006 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.

National security launches are by DOD for defense purposes,  and civil launches are by NASA for scientific and exploratory purposes.  Many commercial launches are internationally competed and carry  payloads, such as satellites, that generate revenue. In 1984, the  Commercial Space Launch Act required the Secretary of Transportation to  \u201cencourage, facilitate, and promote commercial space launches by the  private sector.\u201d At that time, the U.S. government was the sole entity  launching civil and commercial payloads into orbit from the United States.  However, as a result of the Space Shuttle Challenger accident in January  1986, the U.S. government transferred responsibilities for commercial  payload launches to the private sector. Space launches by private sector  companies grew as U.S. commercial launch companies responded to the  increase in global demand for commercial satellite launch services in the  mid-1990s. Nonetheless, following a downturn at the beginning of this  century in the business of the commercial space launch industry\u2019s primary  commercial customer, the telecommunications services industry, the  demand for commercial space launches has generally declined. As shown  in figure 1, the total number of U.S. and worldwide commercial orbital  launches has declined from a peak of 41 launches in 1998.", "The U.S. commercial space launch industry, comprising a few launch  companies, has historically used federal sites to launch satellites using  expendable vehicles, which are designed to be launched once. According  to FAA, the launch vehicle manufacturing and services sector of the  commercial space industry had $1.7 billion in economic impact on the U.S.  economy for 2004, with the greatest economic impacts to enabling  industry sectors such as satellite manufacturing and services. (See app. II  for more information on the industry and its economic impact.)", "The commercial space launch industry is changing with the emergence of  suborbital reusable launch vehicles that enable space tourism from state- sponsored or private launch sites, known as spaceports. (See fig. 2 for  examples of expendable and reusable launch vehicles.)", "The prospect for commercial space tourism materialized in 2004 when  SpaceShipOne, developed by Scaled Composites, flew to space twice,  achieving a peak altitude of about 70 miles to win the Ansari X Prize.  Several entrepreneurial launch companies are planning to start taking  paying passengers, also known as space flight participants, on suborbital  flights within the next few years. Virgin Galactic intends to enter  commercial suborbital space flight service around 2009, launching from a  spaceport in New Mexico, and according to the company, plans to carry  3,000 passengers over the subsequent 5 years, with 100 individuals having  already paid the full fare of $200,000. In addition, 4 individuals have  already paid an estimated $20 million each for space flights to the  International Space Station on a Russian vehicle that launches from  Kazakhstan. According to a Futron Corporation market study on space  tourism, the orbital and suborbital space tourism market could attract up  to 15,000 passengers and generate revenues in excess of $1 billion per year  by 2021, with suborbital space tourism likely generating the most  demand. Several other companies in the United States and elsewhere,  including former Ansari X Prize competitors, continue to develop their  vehicles for space tourism. For example, Russia is developing a reusable  launch vehicle, Cosmopolis 21, for space tourism flights.", "Spaceports are being developed to accommodate anticipated commercial  space tourism flights and are expanding the nation\u2019s launch capacity. As of  August 2006, the United States had five federal launch sites, six spaceports  with an FAA launch site operator\u2019s license, and an additional eight  spaceports have been proposed (see fig. 3). Although their individual  capabilities and level of infrastructure development vary, these facilities  may house launch pads and runways as well as the buildings, equipment,  and fuels needed to prepare vehicles and payloads before launch. The  spaceports are operated by state or local governments and authorities and  by private entities. These spaceports also face competition from abroad.  Space Adventures, a U.S.-based space tourism broker, in partnership with  other investors, plans to develop a $115 million spaceport near Changi  Airport in Singapore and a $265 million spaceport in Ras Al-Khaimah near  Dubai in the United Arab Emirates."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Agencies\u2019 Roles and Responsibilities in the Commercial Space Launch Industry", "paragraphs": ["Several federal agencies regulate and support the commercial space  launch industry. FAA oversees the safety of all commercial launches\u2014 both expendable and reusable launch vehicles from federal launch sites  and spaceports\u2014through its licensing, compliance monitoring, and safety  inspection activities. FAA licenses launches to ensure the health and  safety of the public and the safety of property. The agency licenses all  commercial launches that take place in the United States. In addition, it  licenses all overseas launches by U.S. citizens or companies. FAA  generally does not license launches by the U.S. government, nor does it  license the operation of federal launch sites. In issuing launch and  launch-site operator licenses, FAA does not certify the launch vehicle as  safe; in contrast, FAA\u2019s Office of Aviation Safety provides initial  certification of aircraft and periodically inspects an aircraft and certifies it  as safe to fly. FAA can also issue experimental permits for launches of  reusable vehicles conducted for research and development, for  demonstrations of compliance with licensing requirements, or for crew  training before obtaining a license. During commercial launches, FAA  aerospace engineers are on-site to monitor licensees\u2019 compliance with  license and permit requirements. For 179 commercial launches conducted  between March 1989 and August 2006, FAA has issued licenses for 63  launch vehicles and six spaceports. In addition, FAA has issued one  experimental permit for a suborbital reusable vehicle. (See app. III for  more information about FAA\u2019s launch licensing process.) Furthermore,  FAA is responsible for promoting the industry, which the agency said it  accomplishes by sponsoring an annual industry forecast conference,  publishing industry studies, and conducting outreach to potential launch  companies. FAA also consults with industry through its advisory  committee, the Commercial Space Transportation Advisory Committee,  which provides advice and recommendations to the FAA Administrator.  This advisory committee has working groups comprising industry  representatives who consult on reusable launch vehicle development and  launch operations and support, among other commercial space subjects.", "Other federal agencies support the commercial space launch industry to  varying degrees. DOD provides guidance and safety oversight for  government and commercial launches at federal launch sites. The Air  Force also operates the government\u2019s two primary commercial launch  sites\u2014Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida and Vandenberg Air  Force Base in California\u2014and provides infrastructure and operations  support. In addition, the Department of the Army operates a launch site at  the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico and at the Ronald Reagan  Ballistic Missile Test Site in the Marshall Islands. Commercial launches at  federal launch sites occur when \u201cexcess capacity\u201d is available and the  launch company reimburses DOD for the direct use of government  services. Three U.S. companies\u2014Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Orbital  Sciences\u2014have been the primary commercial users of DOD launch  facilities. In support of its mission to have assured access to space, DOD  also has supported the industry through investments in the design and  development of small, medium, and heavy lift launch vehicles, which have  been used for both government and commercial launches.", "Under the Technology Administration Act of 1998, Commerce is to serve  as an advocate for the commercial space industry. Its Office of Space  Commercialization, established in 1988 within the Office of the Secretary  of Commerce and now located within the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration, is responsible for promoting commercial  investment in the industry by, among many activities, collecting and  disseminating information on space markets; conducting workshops on  commercial space opportunities; promoting space-related exports; and  seeking the removal of legal, policy, and institutional impediments to  space activities. Commerce\u2019s International Trade Administration also  promotes the commercial space industry in matters concerning  international trade through such activities as trade events, advocacy  programs, and the development of policies to further U.S. industry  competitiveness. In addition, Commerce regulates export of space  technologies that are considered dual-use items\u2014that is, items with  military and civilian uses\u2014and is a customer of satellite launches.", "NASA\u2019s support for the commercial space launch industry includes   (1) providing infrastructure and range support from its Wallops Flight  Facility in Virginia and radar support for commercial launches from DOD  launch sites and (2) encouraging private sector investment in NASA  launches and other activities. Since the 1985 National Aeronautics and  Space Administration Authorization Act, Congress has required NASA to  \u201cseek and encourage, to the maximum extent possible, the fullest  commercial use of space.\u201d In January 2004, the President announced the  Vision for U.S. Space Exploration, which directed NASA to pursue  commercial opportunities for providing transportation and other services  supporting the International Space Station and exploration missions  beyond low-Earth orbit. Congress supported this direction in the NASA  Authorization Act of 2005 by requiring NASA to develop a  commercialization plan that (1) identifies opportunities for the private  sector to participate in NASA missions and activities in space and (2)  emphasizes the use of advancements made by the private sector in  developing launch vehicles. One such opportunity is NASA\u2019s Commercial  Orbital Transportation Services demonstration program, for which NASA  solicited proposals from private industry in March 2006 to demonstrate  cargo and crew space transportation to low-Earth orbit and awarded two  contracts in August 2006.", "Other federal agencies support commercial launches in various ways.  DHS\u2019s Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is responsible for  security policy, compliance, and related issues for commercial space  transportation. TSA also is responsible for establishing national standards  for transportation and infrastructure security for commercial space  transportation. The Department of State ensures that domestic space  policies support U.S. foreign policy objectives and international  commitments. State also regulates the export of space technology and  represents the United States on the United Nations Committee on the  Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. The White House Office of Science and  Technology Policy (OSTP) and the National Security Council (NSC)  develop and manage commercial space launch policymaking by mediating  among federal agencies and reporting to the President on space policy  issues, among other duties.

Moreover,  according to FAA, none of the 179 commercial launches that occurred  between March 1989 and August 2006 resulted in casualties or substantial  property damage. Of these 179 launches, FAA had joint oversight  responsibility with other federal agencies for 152 (about 85 percent) and  sole responsibility for 27 (about 15 percent) that included sea launches  and the launches of SpaceShipOne from Mojave Spaceport. FAA shared  responsibility with the Air Force for 132 launches at Air Force launch sites  and with NASA, the Army, or foreign governments for 20 launches at  NASA\u2019s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, the Army\u2019s White Sands Missile  Range in New Mexico, and other facilities. Thus, the majority of  commercial space launches during this period took place at Air Force  launch sites where the Air Force had primary responsibility for safety  oversight.

As we have  reported, a system safety process is an effective evaluative method of  identifying and mitigating risks. Specifically, system safety relies on the  application of technical and managerial skills to identify, analyze, and  control hazards and risks. An objective of a system safety process is to  identify hazard trends to spot and correct problems at their root cause  before an incident occurs.", "During the licensing process, the launch company is responsible for  system safety by demonstrating that it has assessed all hazards and risks  posed by its launch operations and has proposed how to mitigate them.  The assessment is focused on safety critical systems, such as a vehicle\u2019s  main structure, propulsion system, and flight safety systems, whose  performance or reliability can affect public safety and the safety of  property. Through the development of a system safety program plan, the  launch company applicant demonstrates that the proposed vehicle design  and operations satisfy regulatory requirements, and that the system is  capable of performing safely during all flight phases, including launch and  reentry. The plan provides a description of the strategy by which  recognized and accepted safety standards and requirements, including  organizational responsibilities, resources, methods of accomplishment,  milestones, and levels of effort, are to be tailored and integrated with other  system engineering functions. FAA consults with an applicant early in its  launch vehicle development to help the applicant understand what must  be included in the system safety program plan. In addition, FAA reviews  the final system safety program plan as part of its safety review of the  license application.", "Another way in which FAA incorporates system safety in its oversight of  commercial launches is by conducting a risk analysis for each launch. FAA  calculates, for each launch, the expected average number of casualties  (deaths or serious injuries) to the public from debris hazards in the  proposed flight path. This risk level\u2014no more than 30 per million for the  public and no more than 1 per million for an individual\u2014is consistent with  the launch standards used at federal launch sites. According to FAA, the  risk to the public from commercial launches should not exceed \u201cnormal  background risk\u201d\u2014that is, no greater risk than is voluntarily accepted in  the course of normal day-to-day activities. For licensing launch-site  operations, FAA performs a similar safety review that includes a risk  analysis, which considers the site\u2019s proximity to populated areas and a  review of security planned at the facility. The risk analysis is both site- specific and vehicle-specific, and FAA reviews the results on a case-by- case basis because of differences between launch sites and vehicle  designs.", "An expert on system safety confirmed our assessment that FAA has  appropriately applied a system safety process to its launch license  activities. In particular, the expert said that FAA has identified all of the  safety systems that are critical to commercial space launches, made the  proper assumptions of risk, and used proper validation methodologies. He  also noted that FAA has used a higher factor of safety for commercial  space launches than is commonly used in other industries, which is  appropriate given that the space launch industry has a high-risk profile.  However, the expert said that FAA should update its system safety  handbook as the space tourism sector matures to incorporate different  launch methods, such as launches from land, sea, and air, which may have  different safety implications."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA Has Applied Management Controls in Its Licensing Process", "paragraphs": ["FAA is applying relevant management controls in its licensing process.

According to our review of the 19 applications for  launch and launch-site licenses that were active as of January 2006, FAA is  applying these management controls. FAA accurately documented the  review and approval process and completed its reviews of license  applications within 180 days, as required by the Commercial Space Launch  Act. However, FAA starts counting the 180 days after deciding that an  application is sufficiently complete. Our analysis showed that FAA  communicated and consulted on an as-needed basis with other federal  agencies that are members of an interagency advisory group on  expendable launch vehicles, as required by an executive order that  designates DOT as lead agency within the federal government for  commercial space launches. This communication includes coordinating  with other federal agencies during the licensing process. Representatives  from the majority of agencies serving on the group told us that FAA had  periodically contacted them during its review of license applications. For  example, agency representatives told us that FAA had checked with DOD  on whether certain launches would negatively affect national security, and  with State on whether launches were consistent with international  treaties.

The regulations for reusable launch vehicles require  launch operators to obtain a safety approval from FAA in order to receive  a license. In August 2006, FAA issued regulations that include safety  requirements that applicants must meet to obtain a license for operations  of expendable launch vehicles. The 2006 regulations cover license  requirements for any launch of a commercial expendable launch vehicle  from any launch site, whether a federal launch site or a spaceport.  However, some industry experts raised questions about the  appropriateness of the regulations for operations at spaceports and also  expressed concern about both existing and potential future safety  requirements for reusable launch vehicles, which can vary widely in design  and operation.

Some industry  experts that we interviewed noted that differences in spaceports from  which vehicles are or will be launched raise questions about the  appropriateness of the regulations. Additionally, while the 2006  regulations only apply to expendable launch vehicles, industry experts  expressed concern about safety regulation of reusable launch vehicles,  given the difference in the design of vehicles and the methods for  launching them. FAA stated that it addresses these concerns by (1) making  license determinations on a case-by-case basis using common  performance standards and (2) providing waivers in special  circumstances. Performance standards require launch companies to meet  certain performance thresholds\u2014a risk level, calculated by an expected  casualty analysis, of no more than 30 per million for the public and 1 per  million for an individual\u2014while allowing these companies to develop their  own specific launch vehicle design. FAA said that it uses performance  standards to encourage innovation in vehicle design, rather than being  prescriptive on how the vehicle should be designed. FAA said that its  ability to issue waivers of license requirements for special circumstances  allows it to assess the unique characteristics of a launch and its impact on  safety. FAA, for example, granted a waiver at Mojave Spaceport that  allowed for the storage and handling of liquid propellants closer to the  runway\u2014which would be used for a horizontal launch, such as  SpaceShipOne\u2014than would have been allowed for a vertical launch. Later  in this report, we discuss the challenges that FAA faces in ensuring that its  regulations are suitable for the emerging space tourism sector.", "In addition, industry officials and one expert with whom we spoke raised  concerns about the costs that expendable launch vehicle companies would  incur to comply with the proposed regulations, because they believe that  FAA\u2019s safety requirements at federal launch sites will be in addition to the  Air Force\u2019s requirements. However, according to FAA, it has minimized  these companies\u2019 costs by ensuring that its safety standards are the same  as the Air Force\u2019s, and that waivers issued by FAA or the Air Force are  accepted by both agencies. FAA officials also noted that they have the  authority to implement an option that they said could potentially reduce  costs for both launch companies and the agency\u2014namely, to issue a safety  approval that is separate from a licensing determination. For example,  they said that FAA could approve a component of a vehicle, such as a  flight termination system, which could then be used for multiple licenses.  This approval could reduce uncertainty and costs for the vehicle  manufacturer and save FAA the cost of evaluating the component for each  license.

However, FAA\u2019s experience in this area is  limited because its launch safety oversight has focused primarily on  unmanned orbital launches. From 1989 to 2005, FAA issued two reusable  launch vehicle licenses that were mission-specific and conducted  compliance monitoring and safety inspections for five reusable launch  vehicle missions. Although FAA gained some experience and expertise  from these missions, some industry representatives and experts with  whom we spoke questioned whether FAA is prepared for its expanded role  and raised concerns about whether FAA has sufficient experience and  expertise. Experts also indicated that FAA must stay ahead of the  development of the reusable launch vehicle industry to fulfill its safety  oversight responsibilities, because many companies are developing space  hardware for the first time and are producing different designs that have  not been tested. For example, a safety incident occurred during a  SpaceShipOne flight when the vehicle deviated from the launch trajectory  and flew over a populated area. FAA evaluated this incident and required  Scaled Composites, the developer of SpaceShipOne, to take corrective  measures to continue its licensed flights. During its next flight,  SpaceShipOne unexpectedly rolled 29 times, which FAA did not classify as  an incident. In addition, retaining staff expertise may also be a challenge,  given federal funding constraints and competition within the industry for  qualified aerospace engineers. We have reported on the challenges the  aerospace industry faces in attracting, training, and retaining new workers  with the engineering, science, and technical capabilities it needs, given  recent trends in the decline of the future supply of such workers. In  FAA\u2019s case, two of the five aerospace engineers who worked on the  licensing and monitoring of SpaceShipOne flights are no longer with the  agency. However, FAA said that it has since filled these positions.", "To help evaluate the safety of reusable vehicle launches, FAA\u2019s Office of  Commercial Space Transportation has obtained expertise from outside  firms and other FAA offices. For example, FAA contracted with a  consulting firm to verify the expected casualty analysis involving  SpaceShipOne\u2019s flights. In addition, because of certain similarities  between reusable launch vehicles and aircraft, the Office of Commercial  Space Transportation has consulted with FAA\u2019s Office of Aviation Safety.  Both of these FAA offices, for example, worked on SpaceShipOne\u2019s  license application and had a documented agreement that described how  the offices would work together. However, according to Scaled  Composites, confusion existed during the licensing process regarding the  respective authorities of the FAA offices. For instance, Scaled Composites  was required to have two authorizations\u2014one for its vehicle and one for  its launch operations. Initial vehicle flight tests to demonstrate \u201cproof of  concept\u201d were conducted by the Office of Aviation Safety. Once Scaled  Composites was ready to conduct launch operations, the Office of  Aviation Safety transferred the vehicle review to the Office of Commercial  Space Transportation, which reviewed the launch for licensing. According  to an Office of Aviation Safety inspector, communication between the two  offices, especially during the transfer stage of the review of SpaceShipOne,  was not clear. In addition, an FAA engineer stated that distinctions  between the two offices\u2019 respective authorities had to be made so that  there was no overlap and disagreement between the offices. Since the  licensing of SpaceShipOne, the Commercial Space Launch Amendments  Act of 2004 clarified responsibility by stating that only one license would  be required by DOT to approve commercial space launches, and this  responsibility has been designated to the Office of Commercial Space  Transportation. However, the two offices still need to coordinate on  license reviews for operations of hybrid vehicles having both aircraft and  rocket-like characteristics, according to officials in both offices.  Nonetheless, no formal process exists between the two offices that  outlines when and under what circumstances the offices should consult.  While the documented agreement between the offices described how they  would authorize flights of SpaceShipOne, this document is specific to  those flights and is not generic for future reusable launch vehicle licenses.", "FAA\u2019s safety oversight of the commercial space launch industry may be  further challenged, in part, because of the expected increase in workload  demands facing agency staff. FAA is anticipating a substantial increase in  the number of permit and launch applications that could be submitted for  reusable launch vehicle and launch-site operations in the near future, but  FAA has not quantified the magnitude of applications. For example, FAA\u2019s  annual industry forecast does not include projected reusable vehicle  launches. FAA said that its anticipated increase in applications is based on  preapplication consultations that FAA has conducted with reusable launch  vehicle companies and spaceports. In addition, an FAA official noted that  companies with existing reusable launch vehicle licenses are likely to  apply for additional permits or licenses for the new vehicles they are  developing. Furthermore, launch companies participating in NASA\u2019s Lunar  Lander Challenge and Commercial Orbital Transportation Services  demonstration program and Commerce\u2019s Geostationary Operational  Environmental Satellite Program are required to obtain commercial launch  permits or licenses from FAA. FAA initially plans to be present for every  licensed launch of a reusable vehicle. If FAA carries out this plan, its staff  workload would increase, since the proposed spaceports for space  tourism flights are located throughout the country and space tourism  companies are planning frequent launches. FAA has not determined the  level of resources needed to meet this expected increase in responsibilities  involving reusable launch vehicles. Agency officials said that they monitor  the industry to assess how its development could impact resource  requirements and will not make a budget request for additional resources  until the workload has grown to justify the request. However, the agency  has not conducted scenarios of different workload projections on the  basis of increased space tourism launches."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA Faces the Challenge of Ensuring That Its Various Regulations Are Suitable for Launches", "paragraphs": ["FAA faces the challenge of ensuring that its 2006 regulations on licensing  and safety requirements for launch, which are based on the Air Force\u2019s  safety requirements for expendable launch vehicle operations at federal  launch sites, will be suitable not only for operations at federal launch sites,  but also for operations at spaceports. As we previously mentioned,  industry representatives and experts are concerned that the safety  regulations for reusable launch vehicles may not be suitable for space  tourism flights because of differences in vehicle types and launch  operations. Table 1 contains a comparison of some of the differences  between expendable and reusable launch vehicles.", "Three of the six operators of licensed spaceports and six of the eight  operators of spaceports in the licensing process told us they did not  believe that FAA\u2019s regulations should apply to the new spaceports. Five of  these spaceport officials said that since reusable vehicles can be launched  differently from expendable vehicles and can return to earth, the reusable  vehicles present different safety implications.", "In addition, concerns about the suitability of the safety regulations were  raised by experts we interviewed and by comments filed in the public  docket for these regulations. While it was noted that the regulations were  appropriate to spaceports if the vehicles launching from them are using  exotic or dangerous fuels, concerns were raised that the rules may be too  stringent for the currently proposed and operating reusable launch  vehicles. Although the safety regulations applicable to expendable launch  vehicles are separate from the safety approvals required to obtain a  reusable launch vehicle license, some experts are concerned about  similarities in the safety rules. For example, two experts noted that the  expected casualty analysis that is the same for launches of expendable  and reusable vehicles might be too high for reusable vehicles, given the  vehicles\u2019 different safety implications. Experts also said that safety  regulations should be customized for each spaceport to address the  different safety issues raised by different orbital trajectories and the  differences in the way that vehicles launch and return to Earth\u2014whether  vertically or horizontally. (See fig. 5 for examples of vertical federal launch  sites and spaceports.) To address these concerns, experts have noted that  it will be important to measure and track safety information and use it to  determine if the regulations should be revised. For example, an expert  noted that FAA should identify and track safety indicators for launch  companies and spaceports and, as the industry matures, conduct trend  analyses with the objective of eliminating negative situations  representative in the trends. Another expert noted that any safety  performance measure should account for different launch and trajectory  tracks, such as over land or over water. Yet another expert noted that  FAA\u2019s proposed regulations for experimental permits allow FAA to collect  statistical data that could then be applied to develop safety standards  criteria. FAA says that it collects data on anomalies and failures of safety- critical systems, which will allow it to analyze safety trends and determine  potential precursors to accidents. However, the agency has not conducted  trend analyses of that information. Other industry experts noted that the  regulations should be revisited when the space tourism sector has further  developed. Meanwhile, the Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act of  2004 requires DOT to commission an independent report to be issued to  Congress and completed by December 2008. This report is to analyze  whether expendable and reusable vehicles should be regulated differently  from each other, and whether either of the vehicles should be regulated  differently if carrying passengers. This report could provide FAA with  information to address industry concerns about the suitability of its  regulations to space tourism."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA Faces the Challenge of Determining the Circumstances under Which It Would Regulate Crew and Flight Participant Safety on Space Tourism Flights before 2012", "paragraphs": ["The Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act of 2004 requires that a  phased approach be used in regulating commercial human space flight,  and that regulatory standards evolve as the industry matures. The act  prohibits FAA from regulating crew and space flight participant safety  before 2012, except in response to incidents that either pose a high risk or  result in serious or fatal injury. However, the act maintains FAA\u2019s  authority over protecting the uninvolved public, and FAA stated that it has  the authority to regulate crew and passenger safety to the extent that the  public would be affected. According to FAA, it is only prohibited from  issuing regulations that apply solely to crew and passenger safety, and any  situation that implicates the public would allow FAA to regulate. FAA  asserts that it has the authority to protect the crew because they are part  of the flight safety system that protects the general public. FAA\u2019s proposed  regulations for human space flight would establish requirements for crew  qualifications and training and space flight participant training and  informed consent. Although these proposed regulations address passenger  and crew behavior, FAA believes that the regulations are within its  authority because they are intended to protect the public\u2014not space flight  participants. For example, the proposed regulations would require an  operator to train each space flight participant before the flight on how to  respond to emergency situations, including loss of cabin pressure, fire,  smoke, and emergency egress. The proposed training requirement is aimed  at protecting public safety, because if a space flight participant did not  receive this training, he or she might interfere with the crew\u2019s ability to  protect public safety.", "The proposed regulations are not aimed solely at crew and passenger  safety and, as a result, there have been instances in which FAA has not  stepped in and imposed additional regulations or requirements for safety  reasons because the public was not implicated. For example, Scaled  Composites\u2019 SpaceShipOne rolled 29 times, and, according to FAA, it did  not impose additional requirements because the flight was over a  unpopulated area, and because FAA concluded that the pilot was in  control of the vehicle. FAA monitored and reviewed the corrective actions  taken by Scaled Composites prior to its next flight. Additionally, FAA has  not developed specific criteria regarding when an incident would qualify  as contributing to \u201can unplanned event or series of events\u2026that pose a  high risk of causing a serious or fatal injury\u201d that would trigger FAA\u2019s  authority to issue regulations specific to crew and passenger safety.", "Experts and industry representatives that we interviewed expressed  different opinions about whether FAA should regulate crew and flight  participant safety and, if so, when. Some industry representatives and  experts we interviewed agreed that the Commercial Space Launch  Amendments Act of 2004 provides the industry with the flexibility needed  to innovate and grow. However, other experts said that there is too much  flexibility in the act. One of these experts noted that FAA should publish  the criteria that would cause it to regulate crew and flight participant  safety before 2012. Another expert said that FAA\u2019s having the discretion to  decide when it would regulate crew and flight participant safety creates  uncertainty for the industry, noting that without published criteria, the  industry does not know how FAA would react to an incident involving a  space tourism company, which could seriously hurt the industry. The  designer of a reusable launch vehicle told us that FAA should regulate  crew and flight participant safety for commercial space flight because he  believes that space tourism needs to be as safe as commercial aviation.", "Meanwhile, a trade association made up of space tourism companies and  spaceports\u2014called the Personal Spaceflight Federation\u2014plans to  commission standards for vehicles and their operation, including space  flight participant safety, as the space tourism industry develops. The  federation believes that ensuring the highest-possible level of safety for the  industry and sharing best practices will be essential to promote the safety  and growth of the industry. The federation intends to commission an  independent standards organization, such as the American Society for  Testing and Materials, to develop accredited industry standards for  voluntary testing and approval, much as Underwriters Laboratories, an  independent organization that tests electrical devices, has done. According  to an expert, while companies do not have to submit their products to  Underwriters Laboratories for testing, market acceptance is low and  liability exposure is high without the Underwriters Laboratories\u2019 stamp of  approval. The expert believes that a similar approach will work for space  flight participants, who are more likely to choose to fly on a launch vehicle  that has been approved according to industry standards than on one that  has not been approved."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA\u2019s Dual Role of Promotion and Safety May Pose a Challenge", "paragraphs": ["FAA faces the potential challenge of overseeing the safety of commercial  space launches while promoting the industry as the space tourism sector  develops. According to our analysis, FAA\u2019s current promotional activities  have not conflicted with its safety regulatory role; however, industry  experts have noted that potential challenges may arise as the space  tourism sector develops. FAA is mandated to regulate the commercial  space transportation industry to protect public safety and property while  encouraging, facilitating, and promoting commercial space launches.  According to FAA, its promotional activities include sponsoring an annual  industry conference, sponsoring Commercial Space Transportation  Advisory Committee meetings and work groups, presenting space-related  topics at various aerospace professional association conferences, creating  forums at which industry elements network, publishing economic impact  studies and launch forecast reports, and conducting outreach to potential  license applicants. These are all activities that experts say, and we agree,  do not conflict with FAA\u2019s safety oversight responsibilities. According to  some experts, FAA\u2019s promotional activities have not conflicted with the  agency\u2019s role as a safety regulator because the activities do not involve  advocacy for the industry, nor do they increase demand in the industry.  Furthermore, experts noted that some of these activities promote FAA\u2019s  safety role. For example, outreach to potential license applicants is a  means of ensuring that new launch companies know about and adhere to  federal safety regulations. Experts also noted that industry conferences  are a means by which FAA can have a dialogue with industry to ascertain  new industry trends and issues. FAA also has provided an estimated  $200,000 for Mojave Spaceport to complete its environmental impact  study, which FAA deems a promotional activity. According to its statutory  responsibility, FAA can take action to facilitate private sector involvement  in spaceport infrastructure.", "However, as the commercial space launch industry matures, there is a  greater risk that FAA\u2019s role as both the regulator and a promoter of the  industry may pose a conflict of interest. Experts told us, and we agree, that  as the commercial space launch industry evolves, it may be necessary to  separate FAA\u2019s regulatory and promotional activities. For example, one  expert indicated that with the emergence of space tourism, FAA\u2019s dual role  could pose a potential conflict of interest between creating an enabling  business environment and not compromising safety with regard to the  agency\u2019s determining when and if it would regulate crew and passenger  safety on space launches. Other experts cited Congress\u2019s removal of FAA\u2019s  promotional responsibilities for commercial aviation in 1996 as evidence  of the importance of maintaining FAA\u2019s focus on safety oversight. In  response to the ValuJet accident of May 11, 1996, the DOT Secretary asked  Congress to restrict FAA\u2019s mandate to safety, eliminating its role in  promoting the airline industry. According to the conference report that  accompanied the legislative change, Congress withdrew FAA\u2019s  promotional role in commercial aviation to address public perceptions  that might exist that the promotion of air commerce by FAA could create a  conflict with its safety regulatory mandate. Congress also has withdrawn  promotional responsibilities from other transportation entities. In 1961,  the Federal Maritime Board was dissolved and its promotion and safety  responsibilities were transferred to Commerce and the Federal Maritime  Commission, respectively. In proposing the legislative change, the  President stated that this change was made to eliminate the intermingling  of regulatory and promotional functions that had diluted responsibility and  led to serious inadequacies, particularly in the administration of regulatory  functions. Recognizing the potential conflict in the oversight of  commercial space launches, Congress required DOT to report by  December 2008, among other things, on whether the federal government  should separate the promotion of human space flight from the regulation  of such activity.", "Furthermore, FAA\u2019s promotional role has the potential to overlap with that  of Commerce\u2019s role\u2014given the broad definition of FAA\u2019s statutory  promotional responsibilities, the more detailed definition of Commerce\u2019s  promotional responsibilities, and the efforts of Commerce to fully staff its  Office of Space Commercialization. Commerce\u2019s International Trade  Administration, which is responsible for promoting U.S. exports and  competitiveness of U.S. companies in foreign markets, has remained fully  staffed and provides assistance to the U.S. commercial space industry.  However, the Office of Space Commercialization within NOAA did not  have a permanent director from 1999 through January 2006 and had been  staffed with one permanent employee who had been charged with work  related to satellite services. In February 2006, a new director was  appointed, and, as of June 2006, the office has been fully staffed. The  Office of Space Commercialization is currently developing a strategic plan  that is to be completed by the end of 2006. Some of FAA\u2019s promotional  activities, such as publishing economic impact studies on the industry,  have been undertaken due to past understaffing at Commerce, according  to an FAA official.

During the rise of the commercial launch  industry in Russia, Ukraine, and China in the 1980s and 1990s, bilateral  agreements between these countries and the United States (1) limited the  number of launches in those countries of commercial satellites containing  U.S. licensed components and (2) imposed pricing restrictions. According  to a Commerce official, the United States entered into these agreements  because foreign countries were nonmarket economies and there was the  potential to employ nonmarket-based practices or offer prices  substantially below international market value. According to an USTR  official, which negotiated these agreements, the agreements required the  countries to price their commercial launch services \u201con a par\u201d with  Western companies, which allowed the nonmarket economies to evolve  their industries while competing on a fair basis.

The U.S. government encourages federal  agencies to acquire space transportation from U.S. commercial launch  companies. Some of these companies have also received DOD funds to  develop new launch vehicles that are intended to provide low-cost access  to space for government purposes. Once developed, these vehicles could  also be used for commercial purposes. For example, DOD\u2019s Evolved  Expendable Launch Vehicle Program, a government-industry partnership  whose objective is to lower the cost of medium-to-heavy lift vehicle  launches, has led to the development of Lockheed Martin\u2019s Atlas V vehicle  and Boeing\u2019s Delta IV vehicle. DOD has provided $1.4 billion to the  program as of fiscal year 2006, with an additional investment of $4.6 billion  provided by Lockheed Martin and Boeing. With the objective of reducing  U.S. government launch costs, Lockheed Martin and Boeing have  proposed a joint venture of their vehicle programs, called the United  Launch Alliance, for which DOD gave conditional approval in January 2006  and for which the Federal Trade Commission gave conditional clearance  in October 2006. In addition, DOD has funded small vehicle development.  For example, SpaceX, which has received DOD funding, has developed  and is testing its Falcon I vehicle that will carry a small government  payload and will launch from the Army\u2019s Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile  Test Site on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. SpaceX then plans on  launching a small commercial payload to low-Earth orbit from Kwajalein  at an estimated cost of under $7 million (in 2006 dollars). This cost is in  contrast to launch prices for small payloads averaging $15 million,  according to a report on space transportation costs. Furthermore,  whereas international competitors launch prices for medium-to-heavy  payloads to geosynchronous transfer orbit average $56 million for  medium and $87.5 million for heavy payloads, SpaceX plans to launch  medium payloads on its Falcon 9 vehicle from $27 million and heavy  payloads from $78 million. SpaceX said that it has reduced launch costs in  a number of ways, including the simplification of vehicle design akin to  Russian vehicles. Another example of new lower-cost vehicles that have  been developed with DOD support is AirLaunch, LLC, which has  developed a small lift vehicle that launches from the air from a military  cargo aircraft and is intended to put a small payload into orbit for less than  $5 million.

We agreed that FAA assesses resource requirements annually and added  this information to the report; however, we have not seen evidence that it  does so on a longer-term, strategic basis. In response to the draft report\u2019s  discussion of the suitability of FAA\u2019s expendable launch vehicle  regulations for reusable launch vehicles, FAA explained that the regulation  is not intended to apply to reusable vehicles. We agreed with this comment  and revised the draft to indicate the specific reusable launch vehicle  regulation to which we were referring. Commerce agreed with our  recommendation concerning the need for a memorandum of  understanding between it and DOT that clearly delineates the two  agencies\u2019 respective promotional roles. In addition, Commerce pointed out  that the draft report did not reflect the industry advocacy role played by its  International Trade Administration. We agreed and added that information  to the report. OSTP stated that the report should include more discussion  of competition challenges facing the industry. Although we agree that such  challenges are important and addressed some competitive issues, such as  foreign price competition, a larger study of these issues was beyond the  scope of the report. Finally, NASA noted that the draft report did not  reflect the infrastructure support, such as wind tunnels and rocket  propulsion test stands, that it provides to the commercial space launch  industry.

To accomplish this, we addressed  the following questions: (1) how well does the Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA) oversee the safety of commercial space launches?  (2) To what extent is FAA responding to key emerging issues in the  commercial space launch industry? (3) What challenges does FAA face in  regulating and promoting the commercial space launch industry? and (4)  What are the key competitive issues affecting the U.S. commercial space  launch industry, and to what extent are the industry and government  responding to them?", "For background information on the commercial space launch industry, we  reviewed reports prepared by the Congressional Research Service, FAA,  the Department of Commerce (Commerce), and other sources to  determine the composition of the industry and its role in the economy. We  also obtained data on historical commercial launch activity worldwide,  including the number of commercial space launches conducted, by  country, from 1997 through 2005; the types of vehicles used; and the types  of payloads launched. We did not independently verify this information  because it was used for background purposes only. In addition, we  identified the commercial launch infrastructure in the United States and  observed the commercial launch facilities at Cape Canaveral Air Force  Station and Vandenberg Air Force Base, which are the two main federal  launch facilities. We also determined the roles and responsibilities of  various federal agencies involved in commercial space launch activities by  reviewing their respective statutory authorities and interviewing agency  officials. These included officials from FAA, Commerce, the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Department of  Defense (DOD), the Department of State, the Department of Homeland  Security, the Office of the United States Trade Representative, and the  Office of Science and Technology Policy.", "To determine how well FAA has overseen the safety of commercial space  launches to date and to what extent it is responding to key emerging  issues in the commercial space launch industry, we reviewed FAA\u2019s safety  oversight processes, identified key emerging issues in the commercial  space launch industry, and reviewed FAA\u2019s response to those issues. We  reviewed FAA\u2019s safety oversight process by interviewing agency officials  about their safety oversight activities and reviewed documentation on  FAA\u2019s licensing and safety monitoring processes, including internal  guidance and policies, applicable regulations, and memorandums of  agreement with other federal agencies. Because FAA shares responsibility  with the Department of the Air Force to conduct safety oversight at the Air  Force\u2019s launch sites, we interviewed FAA and Air Force officials at Cape  Canaveral Air Force Station and Vandenberg Air Force Base about their  interaction and respective responsibilities, and reviewed Air Force launch  safety requirements. We also interviewed representatives from eight  commercial space launch companies that had received launch licenses  from FAA and six launch companies that were consulting with FAA about  obtaining licenses as of September 2005 about FAA\u2019s licensing process. We  also interviewed an official heading a working group on reusable launch  vehicles from the Commercial Space Transportation Advisory Committee,  which is an industry group that provides advice to FAA on commercial  launch issues. This official is also a key principal of the Personal  Spaceflight Federation, which is an industry group. When we found that  some companies were offering to sell tickets for flights into space, we also  interviewed two firms that were selling such tickets or were planning to  sell them about their services and related safety issues. In addition,  because security is a component of safety, we interviewed officials from  the Transportation Security Administration about its future role in  securing new spaceports.", "To further assess how well FAA has overseen the safety of commercial  space launches and because FAA conducts its safety oversight largely  through its licensing process, we reviewed its application files for the  licenses that were in effect in January 2006, which consisted of 13 launch  licenses and five launch-site licenses. In addition, although its license was  no longer in effect at the time of our review, we reviewed the application  file for Scaled Composites\u2019 launch of SpaceShipOne because the company  had received the first license from FAA for a reusable vehicle. We  reviewed these application files to determine the types of FAA safety  issues that the agency examined and how it conducted those  examinations. Because we were evaluating the management of a  government program, we examined (1) how FAA applied certain  management controls in its license approval process using our guidelines  for management controls at federal agencies and (2) whether FAA met the  180-day review criteria established by the 1984 Commercial Space Launch  Act. The management controls included documentation of the review  process, effective communication, reliability and verification of data,  supervisory review, and documentation of the approval process, which we  determined from consulting Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government for the elements needed for effective management of the  licensing approval process. Furthermore, we assessed the extent to which  FAA interacted with other federal agencies participating in an interagency  advisory group on expendable vehicles, which was part of the application  review process in some cases, by interviewing the interagency group  members about their interaction with FAA on commercial launch issues.  In addition, we reviewed FAA\u2019s safety monitoring process by examining its  most recent compliance-monitoring reports that corresponded to the  licenses that were in effect as of January 2006, as well as enforcement  actions taken against commercial launch companies for noncompliance  with safety issues. Moreover, to obtain an independent perspective on how  well FAA has conducted launch safety oversight and responded to key  emerging issues, we interviewed 11 experts from academia and industry  that we selected with the assistance of the National Academy of Sciences.  (See table 3 for a list of these experts.)", "We identified key emerging issues through literature reviews and  interviews with agency officials and industry representatives, including  associations representing the commercial space launch industry and  entities that had received launch or launch-site licenses from FAA or were  consulting with FAA about receiving such licenses as of September 2005.  To assess the extent to which FAA has responded to emerging issues in  the commercial space launch industry, we interviewed federal government  officials, including FAA officials and representatives from federal launch  sites and FAA-licensed and proposed spaceports, launch companies,  industry experts, and trade associations to obtain their views. See table 4  for a list of the organizations that we interviewed.", "We also reviewed the proposed and issued regulations relating to  commercial space launches and comments published in the Federal  Register on those regulations to assess how the agency had responded to  the emerging issues.", "To determine the challenges that FAA faces in responding to emerging  issues in the commercial space launch industry, we interviewed FAA  officials, industry representatives, industry experts, and trade associations  to obtain their views on how FAA would need to respond and the level of  expertise and resources that would be required. This included considering  the challenges that FAA may face in complying with requirements  contained in both proposed regulations and under existing law to provide  safety oversight over a new industry sector involving reusable launch  vehicles.", "To determine the key competitive issues affecting the U.S commercial  space launch industry and the extent to which the industry and federal  government are responding to them, we conducted a literature review that  included applicable laws affecting industry competitiveness and  interviewed FAA officials, industry representatives, industry experts, and  trade associations to obtain their views. This included interviewing  officials from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative about the U.S.  government\u2019s past use of bilateral treaties with foreign governments  regarding the commercial space market and from the Commercial Space  Transportation Advisory Committee, which is an industry group that  provides advice to FAA on commercial launch issues, about industry  concerns regarding insurance and liability matters. We also interviewed  U.S. commercial space launch companies, including U.S. partners in  international partnerships. In addition, to obtain the perspective of a  foreign commercial launch company on international competitive issues,  we interviewed an official from Arianespace, which is a French  commercial space launch company. To obtain the perspective of a  domestic commercial launch company, we interviewed SpaceX. We also  reviewed regulations affecting the competitiveness of the commercial  space launch industry, such as the International Traffic in Arms  Regulations, and reports on competitive issues prepared by the  Congressional Research Service, FAA, Commerce, Futron, and others. We  attempted to compare the extent to which countries were providing  financial assistance to their commercial space launch industries, but we  were unable to obtain transparent and quantifiable data.

During the policy review, FAA consults with other federal  agencies to determine whether the launch license presents any issues  affecting U.S. national security, foreign policy, or international obligations.  FAA also determines the amount of liability insurance required to  compensate third-parties for activities carried out under a license, up to a  maximum of $500 million or the maximum liability insurance available on  the world market at a reasonable cost as determined by FAA.
