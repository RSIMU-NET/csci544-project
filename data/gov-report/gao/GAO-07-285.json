Many of these losses are borne by private insurers and by two federal insurance programs--the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which insures properties against flooding, and the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC), which insures crops against drought or other weather disasters. GAO was asked to (1) describe how climate change may affect future weather-related losses, (2) determine past insured weather-related losses, and (3) determine what major private insurers and federal insurers are doing to prepare for potential increases in such losses. In response, among other things, GAO reviewed key scientific assessments; analyzed insured loss data; and contacted private insurers, NFIP, and FCIC."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Key scientific assessments report that the effects of climate change on weather-related events and, subsequently, insured and uninsured losses, could be significant. The global average surface temperature has increased by 0.74 degrees Celsius over the past 100 years and climate models predict additional, perhaps accelerating, increases in temperature. The key assessments GAO reviewed generally found that rising temperatures are expected to increase the frequency and severity of damaging weather-related events, such as flooding or drought, although the timing and magnitude are as yet undetermined. Additional research on the effect of increasing temperatures on weather events is expected in the near future, including a highly anticipated assessment of the state of climate science this year. Taken together, private and federal insurers paid more than $320 billion in claims on weather-related losses from 1980 to 2005. Claims varied significantly from year to year--largely due to the effects of catastrophic weather events such as hurricanes and droughts--but have generally increased during this period. The growth in population in hazard-prone areas and resulting real estate development have generally increased liabilities for insurers, and have helped to explain the increase in losses. Due to these and other factors, federal insurers' exposure has grown substantially. Since 1980, NFIP's exposure quadrupled, nearing $1 trillion in 2005, and program expansion increased FCIC's exposure 26-fold to $44 billion. Major private and federal insurers are both exposed to the effects of climate change over coming decades, but are responding differently. Many large private insurers are incorporating climate change into their annual risk management practices, and some are addressing it strategically by assessing its potential long-term industry-wide impacts. The two major federal insurance programs, however, have done little to develop comparable information. GAO acknowledges that the federal insurance programs are not profit-oriented, like private insurers. Nonetheless, a strategic analysis of the potential implications of climate change for the major federal insurance programs would help the Congress manage an emerging high-risk area with significant implications for the nation's growing fiscal imbalance."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons demonstrated, weather-related  events can devastate affected communities and individuals, and are costly  to the insurance industry, government disaster assistance programs, and  other relief organizations.

The private sector includes primary insurers that insure  individuals and businesses directly, and reinsurers that provide insurance  to the primary insurers. The public sector includes federal programs\u2014in  particular, the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which insures  properties at risk of damage from flooding, and the Federal Crop  Insurance Corporation (FCIC), which insures crops that are vulnerable to  drought, floods, or other natural disasters.

Virtually  anything that is insured\u2014property, crops and livestock, business  operations, or human life and health\u2014is vulnerable to weather-related  events.

While the temperature increases to date may appear small,  climate models project that additional changes in temperature may alter  social and economic activities in potentially profound ways. Much  research and policy debate has centered on the extent to which human  activities have contributed to the warming and how much is due to natural  variability. For the purposes of this report, climate change refers to any  change in the climate over time, whether due to natural variability or as a  result of human activity. Regardless of the cause, some contend that  increasing temperatures\u2014accompanied by changes in other aspects of the  climate\u2014may have adverse financial consequences for property insurers,  which might slow the growth of the industry and shift more of the burden  to governments and individuals.", "Concerned about the implications of climate change for weather-related  losses incurred by federal agencies and private insurers, you asked us to  (1) describe what is known about how climate change might affect insured  and uninsured losses, (2) determine insured losses incurred by major  federal agencies and private insurers and reinsurers resulting from  weather-related events, and (3) determine what major federal agencies and  private insurers and reinsurers are doing to prepare for the potential risk  of increased losses due to more frequent or more severe weather-related  events associated with climate change.", "To describe how climate change might affect insured and uninsured  losses, we reviewed and summarized key scientific assessments by  reputable international and national research organizations, including the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Third Assessment Report,  National Academy of Sciences reports, and the multifederal agency  Climate Change Science Program. To determine insured losses  attributable to weather-related events, we analyzed data from 1980  through 2005 from the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Federal  Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for the NFIP; from the  Department of Agriculture\u2019s Risk Management Agency (RMA) for FCIC;  and from the Property Claims Service, a leading source of insurance data.  We analyzed changes in weather-related losses since 1980 and  supplemented this analysis with a review of existing literature and the  views of subject area experts on the key drivers of changes in losses.", "To determine what key federal agencies and private insurers are doing to  assess and manage the potential for increased losses, we conducted  semistructured interviews with officials from the NFIP, RMA, and a  sample of the largest private primary insurers and reinsurers in the United  States, Europe, and Bermuda. The companies we interviewed represent  about 45 percent of the total domestic insurance market but should not be  generalized to represent all insurance companies. We also interviewed  officials from catastrophe modeling firms, insurance industry associations,  the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), and  universities to provide additional context for respondents\u2019 statements. To  supplement these interviews, we reviewed documentation of federal  agencies\u2019 risk management practices, studies by subject area experts,  industry reports, insurance company documents, and previous GAO  reports. We performed our work between February 2006 and January 2007  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. A  more extensive discussion of our scope and methodology appears in  appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Insurance is a mechanism for spreading risk over time, across large  geographical areas, and among industries and individuals. While insurers  assume some financial risk when they write policies, they employ various  strategies to manage risk so that they earn profits, limit potential financial  exposures, and build capital needed to pay claims. For example, they  charge premiums for coverage and establish underwriting standards, such  as refusing to insure customers who pose unacceptable levels of risk, or  limiting coverage in particular geographic areas. Insurance companies may  also purchase reinsurance to cover specific portions of their financial risk.  Reinsurers use similar strategies to limit their risks, including charging  premiums, establishing underwriting standards, and maintaining close,  long-term business relationships with certain insurers.", "Both insurers and reinsurers must also predict the frequency and severity  of insured losses with some reliability to best manage financial risk. In  some cases, these losses may be fairly predictable. For example, the  incidence of most automobile insurance claims is predictable, and losses  generally do not occur to large numbers of policyholders at the same time.  However, some infrequent weather-related events\u2014hurricanes, for  example\u2014are so severe that they pose unique challenges for insurers and  reinsurers. Commonly referred to as catastrophic or extreme events, the  unpredictability and sheer size of these events\u2014both in terms of  geography and number of insured parties affected\u2014have the potential to  overwhelm insurers\u2019 and reinsurers\u2019 capacity to pay claims. Catastrophic  events may affect many households, businesses, and public infrastructure  across large areas, resulting in substantial losses that deplete insurers\u2019 and  reinsurers\u2019 capital.", "Given the higher levels of capital that reinsurers must hold to address  catastrophic events, reinsurers generally charge higher premiums and  restrict coverage for such events. Further, in the wake of catastrophic  events, reinsurers and insurers may sharply increase premiums to rebuild  capital reserves and may significantly restrict insurance and reinsurance  coverage to limit exposure to similar events in the future.", "Under certain circumstances, the private sector may determine that a risk  is uninsurable. For example, while homeowner insurance policies typically  cover damage and losses from fire and other perils, they usually do not  cover flood damage because private insurance companies are largely  unwilling to bear the financial risks associated with its potentially  catastrophic impact. In other instances, the private sector may be willing  to insure a risk, but at rates that are not affordable to many property  owners. Without insurance, affected property owners must rely on their  own resources or seek out disaster assistance from local, state, and  federal sources.", "In situations where the private sector will not insure a particular type of  risk, the public sector may create markets to ensure the availability of  insurance. For example, several states have established Fair Access to  Insurance Requirements (FAIR) plans, which pool resources from insurers  doing business in the state to make property insurance available to  property owners who cannot obtain coverage in the private insurance  market, or cannot do so at an affordable rate. In addition, six southern  states have established windstorm insurance pools that pool resources  from private insurers to make insurance available to property owners who  cannot obtain it in the private insurance market.", "Similarly, at the federal level, the Congress established the NFIP and the  FCIC to provide coverage where voluntary markets do not exist. The  Congress established the NFIP in 1968, partly to provide an alternative to  disaster assistance for flood damage. Participating communities are  required to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations, thereby  reducing the risks of flooding and the costs of repairing flood damage.  FEMA, within the Department of Homeland Security, is responsible for,  among other things, oversight and management of the NFIP. Under the  program, the federal government assumes the liability for covered losses  and sets rates and coverage limitations.", "The Congress established the FCIC in 1938 to temper the economic impact  of the Great Depression and the weather effects of the dust bowl. In 1980,  the Congress expanded the program to provide an alternative to disaster  assistance for farmers that suffer financial losses when crops are damaged  by droughts, floods, or other natural disasters. Farmers\u2019 participation is  voluntary, but the federal government encourages it by subsidizing their  insurance premiums. USDA\u2019s RMA is responsible for administering the  crop insurance program, including issuing new insurance products and  expanding existing insurance products to new geographic regions. RMA  administers the program in partnership with private insurance companies,  which share a percentage of the risk of loss or the opportunity for gain  associated with each insurance policy written."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Climate Change May Increase Losses by Altering the Frequency or Severity of Weather-Related Events", "paragraphs": ["Global temperatures have increased in the last 100 years and are projected  to continue to rise over the next century.

Upon  reaching the earth, the sun\u2019s energy is either reflected back into space, or  is absorbed by the earth and is subsequently reemitted. However, certain  gases in the earth\u2019s atmosphere\u2014such as carbon dioxide and methane\u2014 act like the glass in a greenhouse to trap some of the sun\u2019s energy and  prevent it from returning to space. While these gases play an important  part in maintaining life on earth, their accumulation in the atmosphere can  significantly increase global temperatures.", "The earth warmed by roughly 0.74 degrees Celsius over the past 100 years,  and is projected to continue warming for the foreseeable future. While  temperatures have varied throughout history, triggered by natural factors  such as volcanic eruptions or changes in the earth\u2019s orbit, the key  scientific assessments we reviewed have generally concluded that the  observed increase in temperature in the past 100 years cannot be  explained by natural variability alone. In recent years, major scientific  bodies such as the IPCC, NAS, and the Royal Academy (the United  Kingdom\u2019s national academy of science) have concluded that human  activities, including the combustion of fossil fuels, industrial and  agriculture processes, landfills, and some land use changes, are  significantly increasing the concentrations of greenhouse gases and, in  turn, global temperatures.", "Although climate models produce varying estimates of the extent of future  changes in temperature, NAS and other scientific organizations have  concluded that available evidence points toward continued global  temperature rise.

To address this issue, the  NAS recently assessed the scientific community\u2019s efforts to reconstruct  temperatures of the past 2,000 years and place the earth\u2019s current warming  in an historical context. Based on its review, the NAS concluded with a  high level of confidence that global mean surface temperature was warmer  during the last few decades of the twentieth century than during any  comparable period during the preceding 400 years.

Several key assessments of the state of this science have  addressed the large body of work on this topic. Using observational data  and computer models, scientists are examining the effects of rising  temperatures on precipitation patterns and the frequency and severity of  extreme weather-related events. The complexity of weather systems,  together with the limited statistical precision of projections of the extent  of future temperature change, often produces different model results, and  the results themselves represent a range of potential future conditions.", "Nonetheless, a key assessment of climate model projections indicates that  an increase is likely in the frequency or severity of damaging extreme  weather-related events. In 2001, the IPCC, a leading scientific authority on  climate science, released its Third Assessment Report, which assessed the  state of knowledge of, among other things, the potential for global changes  in extreme weather-related events. The IPCC described the relationship  between temperatures, precipitation, and weather-related events.  Increased global mean surface temperatures are linked to global-scale  oceanographic, meteorological, and biological changes. For example, as  the earth warms, more water evaporates from oceans or lakes, eventually  falling as rain or snow. IPCC reported that permafrost is thawing, and the  extent of sea ice, snow cover, and mountain glaciers are generally  shrinking. The IPCC also noted that global sea level rose between 0.1 and  0.2 meters during the twentieth century through thermal expansion of  seawater and widespread loss of land ice, and that this sea level rise could  increase the magnitude of hurricane storm surge in some areas. Warming  is expected to change rainfall patterns, partly because warmer air holds  more moisture.", "Based on model projections and expert judgment, the IPCC reported that  future increases in the earth\u2019s temperature are likely to increase the  frequency and severity of many damaging extreme weather-related events  (summarized in table 1). For instance, IPCC reported that increased  drought is likely across many regions of the globe, including the U.S. Great  Plains. Also, IPCC concluded that the intensity of precipitation events is  very likely to increase across almost all regions of the globe and that heavy  precipitation events are expected to become more frequent. Compared  with projected temperature increases, changes in the frequency and  severity of extreme events can occur relatively rapidly, according to the  IPCC.", "Much research has been done since the IPCC\u2019s Third Assessment Report,  but there has not been a similarly rigorous assessment of what is known  with regard to temperature increase, precipitation, and weather-related  events for the United States.

The  summary reports higher confidence in projected patterns of warming and  other regional-scale features, including changes in wind patterns,  precipitation, and some aspects of extreme events. In particular, the  summary reports that it is very likely that hot extremes, heat waves, and  heavy precipitation events will continue to become more frequent.  Moreover, based on a range of models, IPCC\u2019s summary states that it is  likely that future tropical cyclones (typhoons and hurricanes) will become  more intense, with larger peak wind speeds and more heavy precipitation  associated with ongoing increases in tropical sea surface temperatures.  IPCC reports less confidence in projections of a global decrease in the  number of tropical cyclones, and that the apparent increase in the  proportion of very intense storms since 1970 in some regions is much  larger than simulated by current models for that period. The full first  component report was not publicly released prior to the issuance of our  report and is expected some time after May 2007.", "The other two components of the Fourth Assessment Report will cover  impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability, and mitigation.

IPCC  reported that the insurance industry\u2014especially the property and casualty  segment\u2014are sensitive to the effects of weather-related events. This was  highlighted in the Department of Commerce\u2019s comments on a draft of this  report, which observed that altering either the frequency or severity of  high impact extreme weather-related events could result in a significant  increase in the risk posed to an insurer. For example, the agency said that  what had been considered a 500-year event (i.e., its probability of  occurring in a given year is 1 in 500) could shift under climate change to  become a 100-year event (i.e., its probability of occurring in a given year is  1 in 100). Consequently, more frequent or more severe events have a  greater potential for damage and, in turn, insured losses. As an official  from Aon Re Australia, a large global reinsurer, reported, \u201cThe most  obvious impact of climate change on the insurance sector will be the  increase in insured property losses from extreme weather events.\u201d", "Notably, the economic damages associated with some extreme weather- related events could increase at a greater rate in comparison with changes  in the events themselves. Seemingly small changes in the characteristics of  certain weather-related events can lead to substantial increases in damage.  For example, recent work on hurricanes by researchers at the University  of Colorado, the National Weather Service, and other institutions  examined losses associated with hurricanes that made landfall in the  United States since 1900. Holding constant the increased population and  development in coastal counties during this period, the study compared  the economic damage of stronger storms with weaker storms, based on  the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The researchers found that stronger  storms have caused many times more economic damages than weaker  storms, as shown in figure 3. These findings are consistent with other  independent analyses conducted by insurers and catastrophe modelers.", "Moreover, public reports from several of the world\u2019s largest reinsurance  companies and brokers underscore the potential for substantially  increased losses.

Generally, the more densely populated an area, the greater the extent of  economic activity and accumulated value of the building stock. For  instance, several studies have reviewed the economic impact of Hurricane  Andrew, which tracked over Florida in 1992, in light of the dramatic real  estate development that has occurred in the meantime. Researchers have  normalized losses associated with the storm to account for societal  changes by holding constant the value of building materials, real estate,  and other factors so that the storm\u2019s impact could be adjusted to reflect  contemporary conditions. Hurricane Andrew, which resulted in roughly  $25 billion in total economic losses in 1992, would have resulted in more  than twice that amount\u2014$55 billion\u2014were it to have occurred in 2005,  given current asset values.", "Several recent studies have commented on the apparent increases in  hurricane losses during this time period, and weather-related disaster  losses generally, with markedly different interpretations. Some argue that  loss trends are largely explained by changes in societal and economic  factors, such as population density, cost of building materials, and the  structure of insurance policies. Others argue that increases in losses have  been driven by changes in climate.", "To address this issue, Munich Re and the University of Colorado\u2019s Center  for Science and Technology Policy Research jointly convened a workshop  in Germany in May 2006 to assess factors leading to increasing weather- related loss trends. The workshop brought together a diverse group of  international experts in the fields of climatology and disaster research.  Among other things, the workshop sought to determine whether the costs  of weather-related events were increasing and what factors account for  increasing costs in recent decades.", "Workshop participants reached consensus on several points, including  that analyses of long-term records of disaster losses indicate that societal  change and economic development are the principal factors explaining  observed increases in weather-related losses.

We reported in 2002 that the insurance industry faces potentially  significant financial exposure due to natural catastrophes. Heavily  populated areas along the Northeast, Southeast, and Texas coasts have  among the highest value of insured properties in the United States and  face the highest likelihood of major hurricanes.

For example, NFIP data show that the number of  policyholders and the value of the properties insured have both increased  since 1980. Figure 8 shows the growth of NFIP\u2019s exposure in terms of both  number of policies and the total coverage. The number of policies has  more than doubled in this time period, from 1.9 million policies to more  than 4.6 million. Moreover, although NFIP limits coverage to $250,000 for a  personal structure and $100,000 for its contents, and $500,000 of coverage  for a business structure and $500,000 on its contents, more policyholders\u2019  homes are approaching (or exceeding) these coverage limits.

To prevent these disruptions, the American  Academy of Actuaries (AAA)\u2014the professional society that establishes,  maintains, and enforces standards of qualification, practice, and conduct  for actuaries in the United States\u2014has outlined a five-step process for  private insurers to follow to manage their catastrophic risk. These steps  include the following:  identifying catastrophic risk appetite by determining the maximum  potential loss they are willing to accept;   measuring catastrophic exposure by determining how vulnerable their  total portfolio is to loss, both in absolute terms and relative to the  company\u2019s risk management goals;   pricing for catastrophic exposure by setting rates to collect sufficient  premiums to cover their expected catastrophic loss and other expenses;   controlling catastrophic exposure by reducing their policies in areas  where they have too much exposure, or transferring risk using reinsurance  or other mechanisms; and    evaluating their ability to pay claims by determining the sufficiency of  their financial resources to cover claims in the event of a catastrophe.", "Additionally, insurers monitor their exposure to catastrophic weather- related risk using sophisticated computer models called \u201ccatastrophe  models.\u201d AAA emphasizes the shortcomings of estimating future  catastrophic risk by extrapolating solely from historical losses and  endorses catastrophe models as a more rigorous approach. Catastrophe  models incorporate the underlying trends and factors in weather  phenomena and current demographic, financial, and scientific data to  estimate losses associated with various weather-related events. According  to an industry representative, catastrophe models assess a wider range of  possible events than the historical loss record alone. These models  simulate losses from thousands of potential catastrophic weather-related  events that insurers use to better assess and control their exposure and  inform pricing and capital management decisions. Figure 10 illustrates the  difference between estimating future catastrophic losses using historical  data versus catastrophe models.", "To determine what major private insurers are doing to estimate and  prepare for risks associated with potential changes in climate arising from  natural or human factors, we contacted 11 of the largest private insurers  operating in the U.S. property casualty insurance market. Representatives  from each of the 11 major insurers we interviewed told us they use  catastrophe models that incorporate a near-term higher frequency and  intensity of hurricanes. Of the 11 private insurers, 6 specifically attributed  the higher frequency and intensity of hurricanes to the Atlantic  Multidecadal Oscillation, which\u2014according to NOAA\u2014is a 20- to 40-year  climatic cycle of fluctuating temperatures in the north Atlantic Ocean. The  remaining 5 insurers did not elaborate on the elements of climate change  driving the differences in hurricane characteristics.", "Industry reports indicate that insurance companies\u2019 perception of  increased risk from hurricanes has prompted them to reduce their near- term catastrophic exposure, in both reinsurance and primary insurance  coverage along the Gulf Coast and eastern seaboard. For example, a  recent industry analysis from a leading insurance broker reported that  reinsurance coverage is substantially limited in the southeastern United  States and that reinsurance prices have more than doubled from 2005 to  2006, following a record-setting hurricane season. According to the  Insurance Information Institute, a leading source of information about the  insurance industry, primary insurance companies have also raised prices  in coastal states to cover rising reinsurance costs. Additionally, a recent  report co-authored by a major international insurance company cites  several examples of large primary insurers either limiting coverage or  withdrawing from vulnerable areas such as Florida, the Gulf Coast, and  Long Island.", "As private insurers limit their exposure, catastrophic risk is transferred to  policyholders and the public sector. Insurance companies transfer risk to  policyholders by increasing premiums and deductibles, or by setting lower  coverage limits for policies. Insurers can also transfer risk to policyholders  by passing along the mandatory participation costs of state-sponsored  insurance plans. For example, after the 2004 hurricane season, insurers  assessed a surcharge of about 7 percent to every policyholder in Florida to  recoup the cost of insurers\u2019 participation in the state-sponsored wind  insurance plan. The public sector assumes management of weather-related  risk at the local, state, and national level by providing disaster relief and  recovery, developing mitigation projects, appropriating funds and,  ultimately, providing insurance programs when private insurance markets  are not sufficient or do not exist.", "In addition to managing their aggregate exposure on a near-term basis,  some of the world\u2019s largest insurers have also taken a long-term strategic  approach to changes in catastrophic risk. For example, major insurance  and reinsurance companies, such as Allianz, Swiss Re, Munich Re, and  Lloyds of London, have published reports that advocate increased industry  awareness of the potential risks of climate change and outline strategies to  address the issue proactively. Moreover, 6 of the 11 private insurers we  interviewed provided one or more additional activities they have  undertaken when asked if their company addresses changes in climate  through their weather-related risk management processes.

Additionally, concern over the potential impacts of climate  change on the availability and affordability of private insurance has led  state insurance regulators to establish a task force to formally address the  issue.

Specifically, whereas private  insurers stress the financial success of their business operations, the  statutes governing the NFIP and FCIC promote affordable coverage and  broad participation by individuals at risk. Although both programs manage  risk within their statutory guidelines, unlike the private sector, neither  program is required to limit its catastrophic risk strictly within the  programs\u2019 ability to pay claims on an annual basis. One important  implication of the federal insurers\u2019 risk management approach is that they  each have little reason to develop information on their long-term exposure  to the potential risk of increased low-frequency, high-severity weather  events associated with climate change.", "The statutes governing the NFIP and FCIC promote broad participation  over financial self-sufficiency in two ways: (1) by offering discounted or  subsidized premiums to encourage participation and (2) by making  additional funds available during high-loss years. For example,  discounted insurance premiums are available under the NFIP for some  older homes situated within high flood risk areas where insurance would  otherwise have been prohibitively expensive. FEMA is also authorized to  borrow additional federal funds for the NFIP on an as-needed basis,  subject to statutory limits, to cope with catastrophes. One effect has been  that the NFIP\u2019s exposure has expanded well beyond the ability to pay  claims in high-loss years.", "Similar to the discounted premiums offered by the NFIP, the FCIC\u2019s  subsidized premiums are designed to make crop insurance available and  affordable to as many participants as possible. For example, the FCIC is  mandated to provide fully subsidized catastrophic coverage for producers  in exchange for a minimal administrative fee, as well as partial subsidies  for additional levels of coverage. Also like the NFIP, the FCIC is  authorized to use additional federal funds on an as-needed basis during  high-loss years\u2014although, unlike the NFIP, the FCIC is not required to  reimburse those additional funds.", "Unlike the private sector, the NFIP and the FCIC can use additional  federal funds, and so neither program is required to assess and limit its  catastrophic risk strictly within its ability to pay claims on an annual basis.  Instead, each program manages its risk to the extent possible, within the  context of its broader purposes, in accordance with its authorizing  statutes and implementing regulations. For example, the FCIC uses  coverage limits, exclusions, and premium rates to meet their statutory goal  of a long-term loss ratio no greater than 1.075\u2014including premium  subsidies. Although the program has experienced high-loss years that  required additional federal funds, over time, these high-loss years have  been offset by low-loss years, which have allowed the program to meet its  goal and build reserves.", "By developing a goal to generate sufficient revenue to pay for an average  loss year, the NFIP has also been able to generate a surplus in low-loss  years despite borrowing funds in high-loss years. In the past, the program  has been able to repay borrowed funds with interest to the Department of  the Treasury, however, it is unlikely FEMA will be able to repay the nearly  $21 billion borrowed following the 2005 hurricane season based on the  program\u2019s current premium income.", "Although neither program faces the potential of financial ruin like the  private sector, both programs have occasionally attempted to estimate  their aggregate losses from potential catastrophic events. For example,  FCIC officials stated that they had modeled past events, such as the 1993  Midwest floods, using current participation levels to inform negotiations  with private crop insurers over reinsurance terms. NFIP and FCIC officials  explained that these efforts were informal exercises and were not  performed on a regular basis. FCIC officials also said they use a hurricane  model developed by NOAA to inform pricing decisions for some  commodities such as citrus crops, according to FCIC officials.

As a result, flooding is generally  excluded from homeowner policies that cover damages from other types  of losses, such as wind, fire, and theft.", "The NFIP was established in 1968 to address uninsured losses due to  floods. Prior to the establishment of the NFIP, structural flood controls on  rivers and shorelines (e.g., dams and levees) and disaster assistance for  flood victims were the federal government\u2019s primary tools for addressing  floods. The Mississippi River Commission, created in 1879 to oversee the  development of a levee system to control the river\u2019s flow, was the first of  these federal efforts to address flooding. Due to the limited effectiveness  of structural flood controls, continued development in flood-prone areas,  and a desire to reduce postdisaster assistance payments, the Congress  began examining the feasibility of prefunding flood disaster costs via  federal insurance in the 1950s. Although the first federal flood insurance  program authorized by the Congress in 1956 failed due to lack of funding,  a series of powerful hurricanes and heavy flooding on the Mississippi  River in the early 1960s prompted the Congress to revisit the issue and  direct the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to  conduct a feasibility study of a federal flood insurance program. The 1966  HUD feasibility study helped lead to the passage of the National Flood  Insurance Act of 1968, which authorized the creation of the NFIP.", "Since its inception, the NFIP has undergone several major changes in  response to significant flood events. Hurricane Agnes in 1972 led to the  mandatory flood insurance requirements on certain persons in flood-prone  areas included in the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, which also  significantly increased coverage limits in a further effort to increase  participation. Following the Midwest floods of 1993, the Congress enacted  the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994, which strengthened  lender compliance requirements with mandatory purchase provisions  requiring mortgage-holders in flood-prone areas to purchase flood  insurance and prohibited flood disaster assistance for properties that had  not maintained their mandatory coverage. In 2004, recognizing that losses  from repetitive flooding on some insured properties was straining the  financial condition of the NFIP, the Congress passed the Flood Insurance  Reform Act of 2004, which provided NFIP with additional tools to reduce  the number and financial impact of these properties. These tools include:  increased authorization of funding for mitigation of repetitive loss  properties and statutory authority to penalize policyholders who refuse  government assistance to mitigate certain structures that have been  substantially or repetitively damaged by flooding, among others.

The effective  integration of all three of these elements is needed for the NFIP to achieve  its goals of    providing property flood insurance coverage for a high proportion of  property owners who would benefit from such coverage, reducing taxpayer-funded disaster assistance when flooding strikes, and reducing flood damage through floodplain management and the  enforcement of building standards.", "Over 20,000 communities across the United States and its territories  participate in the NFIP by adopting and agreeing to enforce state and  community floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood  damage. In exchange, the NFIP makes federally backed flood insurance  available to homeowners and other property owners in these  communities. As of 2005, the program had over 4.9 million policyholders,  representing about $875 billion in assets. Homeowners with mortgages  from federally regulated lenders on property in communities identified to  be in high flood risk areas are required to purchase flood insurance on  their dwellings. Optional, lower cost coverage is also available under the  NFIP to protect homes in areas of low to moderate risk.

FEMA has statutory authority to  borrow funds from the Department of the Treasury to keep the NFIP  solvent. Prior to the 2005 hurricane season, FEMA had exercised its  borrowing authority four times, when losses exceeded available fund  balances. For example, FEMA borrowed $300 million to pay an estimated  $1.8 billion on flood insurance claims resulting from the 2004 hurricane  season.

The expansion was designed to allow the disaster  assistance payment program provided by the government under previous  farm bills to be phased out. To encourage participation, the 1980 act  required a 30 percent premium subsidy for producers who purchased  coverage up to the 65 percent yield level. Despite the subsidies, program  participation remained low, and the Congress authorized several ad hoc  disaster payments between 1988 and 1993. Congressional dissatisfaction  with the size and frequency of these payments prompted the Congress to  pass the Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994, which mandated  participation in the crop insurance program as a prerequisite for other  benefits, including agriculture price support payments.

Climate change is real, and has a significant human component related  to greenhouse gases.  2.  Direct economic losses of global disasters have increased in recent  decades with particularly large increases since the 1980s.  3.  The increases in disaster losses primarily result from weather related  events, in particular storms and floods.  4.  Climate change and variability are factors which influence trends in  disasters.  5.  Although there are peer reviewed papers indicating trends in storms  and floods there is still scientific debate over the attribution to  anthropogenic climate change or natural climate variability. There is  also concern over geophysical data quality.  6.  IPCC (2001) did not achieve detection and attribution of trends in  extreme events at the global level.  7.  High quality long-term disaster loss records exist, some of which are  suitable for research purposes, such as to identify the effects of  climate and/or climate change on the loss records.  8.  Analyses of long-term records of disaster losses indicate that societal  change and economic development are the principal factors  responsible for the documented increasing losses to date.  9.  The vulnerability of communities to natural disasters is determined by  their economic development and other social characteristics.  10. There is evidence that changing patterns of extreme events are drivers  for recent increases in global losses.  11. Because of issues related to data quality, the stochastic nature of  extreme event impacts, length of time series, and various societal  factors present in the disaster loss record, it is still not possible to  determine the portion of the increase in damages that might be  attributed to climate change due to greenhouse gas emissions.  12. For future decades the IPCC (2001) expects increases in the  occurrence and/or intensity of some extreme events as a result of  anthropogenic climate change. Such increases will further increase  losses in the absence of disaster reduction measures.  13. In the near future the quantitative link (attribution) of trends in storm  and flood losses to climate changes related to greenhouse gas  emissions is unlikely to be answered unequivocally.  14. Adaptation to extreme weather events should play a central role in  reducing societal vulnerabilities to climate and climate change.  15. Mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions should also play a central role  in response to anthropogenic climate change, though it does not have  an effect for several decades on the hazard risk.  16. We recommend further research on different combinations of  adaptation and mitigation policies.  17. We recommend the creation of an open-source disaster database  according to agreed upon standards.  18. In addition to fundamental research on climate, research priorities  should consider needs of decision makers in areas related to both  adaptation and mitigation.  19.

We agree that the loss experiences of NFIP, FCIC, and private insurers  are distinct and sought to reflect these distinctions in our draft report.  For example, we acknowledged on page 23 of the draft the specific  distinction USDA highlights\u2014that the main cause of catastrophic  losses for FCIC is drought in the nation\u2019s interior (see pages 24 and 25  of this document). Despite these and other differences, however, we  believe the report\u2019s findings and underlying message are still  applicable to the NFIP, the FCIC, and private insurers.  2.  Our analysis of insured losses does not attempt to attribute increases  in past losses to changes in the severity of weather events in the data  sets we reviewed, as implied by the comment. Moreover, we  acknowledge that the increase in FCIC\u2019s losses (indemnities) largely  reflected the rapid growth of the crop insurance program. However,  given the IPCC\u2019s projections for potential increase in the frequency  and severity of weather-related events\u2014including those that affect  crops\u2014we believe that limiting an evaluation of FCIC\u2019s future  weather-related risk to the program\u2019s loss ratio\u2014which only captures  historical performance of the program based on past climatic and  market conditions\u2014to be a potentially misleading metric upon which  to make a prospective assessment.   3.  We acknowledged these activities in the draft report. However, we  believe that USDA\u2019s actions are limited in scope, focusing almost  exclusively on actuarial performance and not on the potential  implications of climate change for FCIC\u2019s operations (i.e., changes in  the frequency and severity of weather-related events, weather  variability, growing seasons, and pest infestations). Accordingly, we  believe the program should do more to prospectively assess the  implications of climate change.  4.  We employed the IPCC\u2019s definition of climate change, which includes  statistically significant variations in climate, brought on by factors that  are both internal and external to the earth\u2019s climate system, and that  persist over time\u2014typically decades or longer. Under this definition,  the Atlantic hurricane cycle, as with other significant variations that  are understood to be internal to the earth\u2019s climate system, can be  considered climatic changes. Our use of the definition was  corroborated by a senior NOAA scientist.   5.  We updated our discussion of FCIC\u2019s modeling activities (see page 36)  to reflect this hurricane model. However, as stated on page 22, 75  percent of FCIC\u2019s claims were associated with drought, excess  moisture, and hail from 1980 to 2005, whereas hurricanes were  associated with a much smaller portion of FCIC\u2019s claims during this  period. Accordingly, we believe that if more sophisticated, prospective  risk assessment techniques (such as those used in FCIC\u2019s hurricane  model) were applied to drought, moisture, and hail events, it would  allow for a far more useful assessment of the potential implications of  climate change for FCIC\u2019s operations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Comments from the Department of Commerce", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Department of Commerce\u2019s  letter dated February 26, 2007."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.
