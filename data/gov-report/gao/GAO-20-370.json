The Navy spends billions annually in maintaining this fleet. In 2015, the Navy changed how it contracts for such maintenance work, aiming to better control costs and improve quality. The new approach, called MAC-MO, generally uses firm-fixed-price contract delivery orders for individual ship availabilities competed among pre-qualified contractors at Navy regional maintenance centers.", "House Report 115-676 included a provision for GAO to review the Navy's implementation of the MAC-MO strategy. This report (1) examines outcomes under the strategy; (2) evaluates actions the Navy has taken related to recent lessons learned; and (3) describes contractors' considerations when planning for hiring and facilities. GAO analyzed data on ship repair under MAC-MO; reviewed six case studies involving different availability types, classes of ships, maintenance centers, and contractors; and interviewed Navy officials and contractors."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since shifting to the Multiple Award Contract-Multi Order (MAC-MO) contracting approach for ship maintenance work in 2015, the Navy has increased competition opportunities, gained flexibility to ensure quality of work, and limited cost growth, but schedule delays persist. During this period, 21 of 41 ship maintenance periods, called availabilities, for major repair work cost less than initially estimated, and average cost growth across the 41 availabilities was 5 percent. Schedule outcomes were less positive and Navy regional maintenance centers varied in their performance (see figure).", "To mitigate these delays, the Navy has identified and taken actions to implement lessons learned, including negotiating and funding undefined but expected increases in work at the time of contract award. However, these actions have not resolved the delays that result from the approval process the Navy often must use to obtain funds to complete this maintenance work. Namely, if an availability extends into a new fiscal year and needs more than $4 million in additional prior-year funding, both Navy and Defense Department approvals are required. GAO found this approval process took between 26 and 189 days based on Defense Department data. In December 2019, Congress established a pilot program that would potentially allow the Navy to avoid this process. Leading practices GAO identified for pilot programs call for development of an analysis plan to track implementation and performance and for evaluating final results. As the Navy moves into implementation of its pilot program, developing an analysis plan would provide it with a means to identify opportunities to evaluate schedule outcomes of pilot program availabilities, as compared to non-pilot program availabilities, and document a process for evaluating lessons learned from the pilot program. Such evaluations would provide information to determine if the pilot approach should expand to help address persistent schedule challenges.", "Ship repair contractors now operating in the MAC-MO environment told GAO that two key considerations drive their decisions on workforce and facilities investments: visibility regarding planned workloads within a given port and their assessment of the share of that work they are most likely to win. In recognition of these considerations, Navy officials have begun taking steps to increase predictability of workloads at each port. These officials anticipate that these steps, coupled with increasing workloads at the ports, will help increase contractors' confidence in their ability to forecast their share of future work."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Navy establish an analysis plan for the evaluation of the pilot program.

The Navy relies on these non-nuclear surface ships to be ready to  operate when needed and to meet their expected service lives. To  accomplish this, the Navy sustains these ships using scheduled periods  of repair work called availabilities. Our prior work has shown that the  Navy has faced persistent challenges in maintaining its fleet, resulting in  thousands of days that ships were unavailable for training or operations.", "The Navy contracts with private shipyards and other firms, which conduct  or support ship repair and maintenance availabilities. In 2015, the Navy  transitioned to a new contracting strategy with the goals to control costs,  increase competition, and improve the quality of work while supporting  operational readiness of the fleet. Under this strategy, which we refer to  as Multiple Award Contract, Multi Order (MAC-MO), the Navy generally  competes orders for individual ship repair availabilities among the  shipyards under firm-fixed-price terms, after a third-party contractor plans  the repair work. The Navy uses the MAC-MO strategy for maintenance  and repair of six classes of ships, including amphibious ships, cruisers,  and destroyers, and plans to include the Littoral Combat Ship in the near  future.", "In a November 2016 report, we assessed the early implementation of the  MAC-MO contracting strategy in response to a provision in House of  Representatives Report 114-102, which accompanied the Fiscal Year  2016 National Defense Authorization Act. We found that the Navy  identified several lessons learned from pilot availabilities it had  undertaken to demonstrate MAC-MO. We concluded that the Navy was  still learning, and we subsequently recommended that that the Navy  perform systematic assessments of MAC-MO to harness new lessons  learned and effectively implement the strategy. The Navy completed its  first such assessment in December 2018 in response to our  recommendation. House of Representatives Report 115-676  accompanying the fiscal year 2019 National Defense Authorization Act  included a provision for us to review the Navy\u2019s more recent progress in  implementing the MAC-MO contracting strategy. Specifically, this report  (1) examines competition, cost, schedule, and quality outcomes under the  strategy; (2) evaluates actions the Navy has taken related to recent  lessons learned; and (3) describes considerations informing contractors\u2019  plans for future hiring and facilities investments under the MAC-MO  contracting strategy.", "To examine competition, cost, schedule, and quality outcomes the Navy  has achieved under the MAC-MO strategy, we obtained available data on  ship repair contract competition, number of offers received, costs, and  schedules.

To assess the reliability of the FPDS-NG data, we  reviewed documentation, interviewed Navy officials, performed logic  checks, and compared the FPDS-NG data to contract documents. We  found the FPDS-NG data sufficiently reliable to examine competition  outcomes.

We found these data sufficiently reliable to examine cost  and schedule outcomes. We reviewed contracting documentation for six  ship repair availabilities under the MAC-MO contracting strategy, four of  which were completed at the time of our review, which we used as case  studies. This documentation included availability completion reports that  identified work progress along with any quality deficiencies at the  conclusion of each availability. We selected these case study availabilities  because they provided examples of performance across a mix of different  types of availabilities, repair complexity, ship classes, and locations. The  case studies are meant to be illustrative and are not generalizable.", "To evaluate the actions the Navy has taken related to recent MAC-MO  strategy lessons learned, we reviewed documentation of initiatives to  improve the MAC-MO contracting approach, the Navy\u2019s December 2018  assessment of MAC-MO implementation, and prior GAO work.

IDIQ contracts do  not specify exact times for delivery of supplies or services at contract  award; the Navy establishes those via orders placed during contract  performance. With MAC-MO, the Navy generally solicits and awards  contracts for five-year periods to a set of qualified contractors at specific  home ports. These periods include an initial execution year and four  additional option years. As a result, several qualified contractors are  available to subsequently compete for availabilities in a specific home  port under firm-fixed-price availability delivery orders until contract  expiration.", "Availabilities that the Navy expects to last more than 10 months are not  restricted to the ships\u2019 home port. This allows for contractors outside the  home port to compete for this work. The Navy then awards contracts for  these coast-wide availabilities as stand-alone contracts to a single prime  contractor, potentially at a port different from the home port of the ship.  Shorter availabilities may be limited to the home port area provided there  is adequate competition, which the Navy defines as the presence of two  or more qualified bidders. If adequate competition is not available in the  home port area, the geographic area for solicitation is expanded equally  in all directions until adequate competition exists.

This represents a departure from  the MSMO strategy under which a single contract was awarded to one  contractor to execute multiple availabilities for a class of ship. The MAC- MO strategy also allows small businesses in Norfolk and San Diego to  compete for noncomplex maintenance. Previously, under the MSMO  strategy, small businesses said that they were more likely to work as  subcontractors for the businesses that held one of the MSMO contracts.  Navy officials have since stated that small businesses are now acting as  prime contractors.", "The Navy has also achieved competition for soliciting its delivery orders  under the MAC-MO strategy.

Further, in the 18 percent of instances when  the Navy awarded a delivery order after receiving only a single offer, it may have attained the benefits of having solicited that delivery order in a  competitive environment.

The Navy identified improving the quality of  workmanship as a goal when it switched from MSMO to MAC-MO. The  previous MSMO contracting strategy relied on use of cost-reimbursement  contracts, which only require the government to reimburse the contractor  its allowable incurred costs, regardless whether the contractor completed  the work. The MAC-MO strategy uses firm-fixed-price contracts, which  provide for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the  contractor\u2019s cost experience in performing the contract. This contract type  places upon the contractor maximum risk and full responsibility for all  costs and performance, including meeting the quality requirements of the  contract. NAVSEA officials stated that in the event that the contractor  doesn\u2019t meet the quality terms of the contract, the Navy has two options:  (1) require the contractor to complete the deficient work, at the  contractor\u2019s cost, to meet the specifications or (2) reduce the contract  price to reflect the reduced value of the services performed and descope  the related work requirements from the existing contract for performance  on a future availability.", "Our review of availability completion reports from the four case study  availabilities that were complete at the time of our assessment, out of six  total, showed no instances where the Navy accepted quality deficiencies  at availability completion. Navy contracting officials stated that in a firm- fixed-price contracting environment, they would not agree to accept  deficient work without first obtaining concessions from the performing  contractor, which would require modifying the delivery order. In one of  these availabilities, we found evidence that the Navy elected to descope a  non-option work item and defer it to a future availability. The maintenance  team stated that this decision followed poor planning of the work item,  which would have caused delays in completing the availability if not  deferred.

This provision eliminates the  need for the Navy and the contractor to engage in time-consuming  negotiations on small dollar items during the availability. According to the  Navy\u2019s 2018 biennial assessment, small dollar growth work negotiations  accounted for around 70 percent of all contract changes. According to  Navy documentation, contract negotiations for small dollar growth work  caused delays of up to a week.

According to these officials, under SDVG the Navy, at times, will likely  pay more for growth items than it would if it devoted increased time to  negotiate prices, with the same being true for the contractors. For  example, the Navy awarded a contract delivery order for the USS  Bulkeley (DDG 84) availability in February 2019 that included SDVG. The  SDVG line item provided for up to 291 changes for growth during that  availability at a firm-fixed-price of $7,144 per change based on historical  needs of similar availabilities. This meant that the Navy could use SDVG  up to 291 times during the availability, and each of those growth items  would cost the Navy $7,144 regardless of whether the actual cost to the  contractor underran or exceeded that amount.

Figure 17 shows how the  change awarding delivery order 120 days before work is scheduled to  begin will affect availability milestones.", "As reflected in figure 17, another change is that long lead time materials  are now ordered 365 days ahead of the start of work, as opposed to the  prior schedule of 170 days ahead. Navy supply officials said that some  materials require lead times from 1 year to 18 months. Consequently,  ordering these materials 170 days before an availability begins increased  the likelihood that they would arrive too late to fulfill the Navy\u2019s stated goal  of procuring all materials 30 days prior to the start of repair work. Unless  repair work requiring these materials is nonessential and can be deferred  to a future availability, these material delays can delay completion of  availabilities by several months. Several ship repair contractor  representatives we interviewed with pointed to long lead-time materials as  drivers for schedule growth.", "While noting the potentially positive effects of shifting award date to 120  days before the availability begins, Navy officials also raised some  challenges. They said that locking ship repair requirements almost a full  year before an availability actually begins means that the Navy could  finalize a ship\u2019s upcoming availability work specifications before a ship  even begins its next deployment. During this deployment, equipment  breakages or other deficiencies not anticipated and subsequently not  included in the work package could arise on the ship, all of which would  likely become growth work during the availability.", "This new time frame for delivery orders has only recently been  implemented. The first MAC-MO delivery order awarded 120 days prior to  the start of work occurred in January 2020, with another awarded since  then. The Navy was scheduled to award availabilities 120 days prior to  the start of work in November 2019, but, according to Navy officials,  lacked necessary funds to award several availabilities due to the  continuing resolution in place at the time.

For  example, contractor representatives stated that they used lessons  learned during the USS Bainbridge (DDG 96) availability to create a  template for a section of the forecastle deck plate. This template could be  used on future availabilities for ships of the same destroyer class,  providing potential cost savings to future availabilities.", "However, RMC officials across the three ports implementing the MAC-MO  strategy expressed concerns over the quality of third-party planning  contractor specifications used in ship repair availability solicitations and  contracts. They stated that the specifications developed by the third-party  planning contractors have frequently included errors and discrepancies.  As a result, the maintenance teams have had to work with the third-party  planning contractor to resolve the issues prior to award.", "According to RMC officials, maintenance teams within a given port have  their own preferences with regard to how the third-party planning  contractor writes specifications. Consequently, a specification written and  approved in one RMC is sometimes deemed inadequate within another  RMC.

For instance, according to MARMC  officials, they found that when availability maintenance teams physically  worked alongside third-party planning contractor staff, the planning  process went much more smoothly. After SWRMC officials learned of this  practice, SWRMC\u2019s maintenance teams were co-located with the third- party planning contractor staff in an effort to improve its process as well.  According to RMC staff, they found that having all parties coordinating  closely in the planning process to be an effective way to mitigate some of  the specification writing issues.", "In contrast to RMC officials, from NAVSEA leadership officials\u2019  perspective, the third-party planning contractor is currently accomplishing  the goals the Navy has set forth and has provided accurate enough  specifications to earn the incentive fees outlined in its contract.

By law, those funds have generally only been  available for new obligations for one fiscal year\u2014which corresponds with  the fiscal year in which the availability contract is awarded\u2013 after which  the funds expire. In order for the Navy to use any remaining expired funds  in the subsequent fiscal year for an in-scope contract change, the  executing RMC must request what is called an upward obligation. The  Navy can request an upward obligation at the fleet level as long as the  request for a specific availability is less than $4 million. RMC officials  stated this type of request involves a short process. However, if the  upward obligations request exceeds $4 million for an availability, the  executing RMC must receive approval from the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense (OUSD) Comptroller. According to RMC leadership  officials, this process can take several months. We found that the Navy  has requested upward obligations from the OUSD Comptroller 25 times  across 14 ship repair availabilities since implementing the MAC-MO  strategy in April 2015.", "In November 2016, we reported that the Navy identified the need for  training for staff on how to obtain upward obligations funding. In our  interviews with RMC leadership officials and Navy financial officials, some  said they now had experience with upward obligations because of their  regular need to obtain funding for ship availabilities that crossed fiscal  years.", "Nonetheless, in our discussions with the RMC commanding officers, they  described the upward obligations process to obtain OUSD Comptroller  approval for upward obligations as cumbersome and unnecessarily  complicated. Other Navy officials and contractors echoed these views  and highlighted the upward obligations request process as a significant  impediment to schedule performance. According to the RMC  commanders, it requires several months to successfully execute and  complete the upward obligations process for many availabilities because  of reviews required within the Navy and the Office of the Secretary of  Defense before approval is granted. Navy officials said the process also  results in significant delays to the availabilities, as work cannot proceed  without funding. For example, of six availabilities for which the Navy  provided data, the shortest upward obligations request took 26 days, with  the longest request spanning 189 days. Figure 19 describes how for one  of our case studies, the USS Chosin (CG 65), the Navy experienced  several months of schedule delay due in part to the upward obligations  process.", "Navy officials stated they have attempted to identify legislative solutions  to reduce the frequency under which they must obtain upward obligations,  given the negative schedule effects this process precipitates. In 2018, the  Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Financial Management and  Comptroller), in conjunction with the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense (Comptroller), proposed two legislative initiatives to Congress  intended to accomplish this goal.", "The first of these proposals seeks to raise the legal threshold for ship  repair upward obligations requiring Navy and Defense Comptroller  approval from $4 million to $10 million. The proposal also provides for a  pilot ship availability with these new thresholds, which would allow the  Navy to determine the proposal\u2019s effectiveness before fully implementing  the new threshold. According to Navy and DOD comptroller officials, this  proposal holds merit on several levels. First, the upward obligations  threshold has not changed since 1990, when the law implementing the  process first passed. The proposed increase to the threshold would  account for inflation and subsequent increases in the cost of ship repair  over the last 30 years. For example, the average maintenance availability  for a DDG 51 Arleigh Burke class destroyer cost $6 million in 1991, but  costs $36 million when the Navy proposed the legislative change.  Additionally, the scope of the Operations and Maintenance, Navy (O&M)  budget has increased by a factor of 2.5 since the law\u2019s 1990 passage.  Navy officials believe that increasing the threshold to $10 million would  potentially raise this amount to a level corresponding to increases in Navy  ship repair budgets since that time.", "The second proposal would permit Navy O&M funds\u2014which the Navy  uses to fund ship repair, among other sustainment-related activities\u2014to  be available for the Navy to obligate for up to 2 fiscal years following their  appropriation by Congress. Currently, these funds are available to be  obligated by the Navy for only 1 year. According to Navy financial  officials, since most ship repairs extend into a second year, this proposal  would allow ship availabilities to avoid using upward obligations. A senior  official with the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)  said that the threshold change was more logical, as the thresholds are no  longer practical, and that the logistics of implementing 2-year funding  were likely to be more complicated because of the various DOD software  systems that would be affected.", "In December 2019, Congress and the President enacted legislation that\u2014 although differing from the Navy\u2019s legislative proposals\u2014is responsive to  the Navy\u2019s concerns relating to the process of approving upward  obligations more than $4 million in its MAC-MO availabilities. In the Fiscal  Year 2020 Consolidated Appropriations Act, Congress established a pilot  program that allows the Navy to use the Other Procurement, Navy (OPN)  account to fund Pacific fleet surface ship repair availabilities for 2020. Our  review of Navy budget documentation shows that the Navy plans to  execute 16 pilot availabilities using fiscal year 2020 OPN funds, and it has  requested funding for another 26 pilot availabilities in fiscal year 2021.  Unlike the Operations and Maintenance, Navy account, which the Navy  typically uses to fund ship repair availabilities in 1-year increments, the  OPN account provides the Navy with funding that will not expire for 3  years. Consequently, for availabilities the Navy funds through the pilot  program, any growth work that necessitates an availability stretching into  a second or even third year will avoid upward obligations and the related  approval processes, provided sufficient funding remains in the OPN  appropriation to cover the work.", "The joint explanatory statement accompanying the enacted legislation  further stated that the Secretary of the Navy is to provide quarterly reports  to Congress on the execution of ship availabilities funded through the pilot  program in the OPN account. In these quarterly reports, the Navy is to  report on the estimated or actual start or end dates of pilot availabilities,  as well as the actual funded amount and estimate to complete.", "The Navy already completes systematic, biennial assessments of MAC- MO implementation, in response to our November 2016 report. While the  Navy recognized upward obligations as an issue in its 2018 biennial  assessment, the Navy did not examine potential solutions to the schedule  delays that these obligations cause. Further, according to NAVSEA  officials, the Navy has yet to determine whether it will address schedule  outcomes and lessons learned from its pilot program availabilities within  future biennial assessments.", "Our prior work identified leading practices for designing a well-developed  and documented pilot program.

Such  evaluations would provide information to the Navy and Congress to  determine if the pilot approach should be expanded to help address  persistent schedule challenges. In addition, similar to the lessons the  Navy has learned in implementing the MAC-MO strategy, the Navy is  likely to learn lessons from its OPN-funded pilot availabilities, including  ones that relate to schedule drivers currently overshadowed by delays  cast by the upward obligations process.

Second, the contractors assess that planned  workload to determine what share of the work they are most likely to  receive. This assessment affects whether a contractor hires more or  fewer people, recapitalizes or expands facilities, and, ultimately, elects to  remain part of the Navy\u2019s industrial base for ship repair.

We selected a combination of six availabilities  that provided a variety of the following characteristics:", "We selected two availabilities of each class of ship under the MAC- MO strategy, including destroyers, cruisers, and amphibious ships.", "We selected two availabilities from each maintenance center  executing the strategy: Mid-Atlantic Regional Maintenance Center,  Southeast Regional Maintenance Center, and Southwest Regional  Maintenance Center.", "We selected availabilities awarded to a variety of ship repair  contractors, including two from BAE Systems, two from General  Dynamics NASSCO, one from Marine Hydraulics International, and  one from Huntington Ingalls Industries.", "We selected a variety of availability types to describe different types of  ship repair work, including two Selected Restricted Availabilities, a  Special Selected Restricted Availability, Depot Modernization Period,  Phased Maintenance Availability, and a Continuous Maintenance  availability.", "For each of the case study availabilities, we collected and reviewed Navy  availability documentation including the delivery order, correspondence  between the maintenance teams and contractors, availability completion  reports, weighted progress reports at the time of completion, and briefings  containing lessons learned following completion of the availability. We  reviewed the documents to: 1) confirm our selection criteria, 2) identify  any deficiencies in quality of work and contract changes as a result, 3)  identify the presence of growth work items, new work items, or deferred  work items, 4) corroborate interview statements, and 5) identify any other  issues during the availability and solutions that could be lessons learned  for future availabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Actions Taken Related to Lessons Learned", "paragraphs": ["To evaluate the actions the Navy has taken related to recent MAC-MO  strategy lessons learned, we analyzed Navy documentation containing  lessons learned that aim to improve the Navy\u2019s implementation of MAC- MO. We identified a total of three lessons learned as key based on our  assessment of the Navy\u2019s documentation of the MAC-MO contracting  strategy. These three lessons learned were also identified as such in one  or more interviews with NAVSEA officials knowledgeable about the  challenges associated with MAC-MO implementation and the steps the  Navy has taken to fix those issues. To evaluate the Navy\u2019s progress in  taking actions to address potential challenges posed by the key lessons  learned, we reviewed Navy documents, including Navy assessments of  the contracting strategy\u2019s effectiveness, documents implementing revised  planning milestones and contracting processes, strategy and planning  documents, documents from availability completion meetings, case study  contract file documents and other documentation related to lessons  learned. To assess the extent to which the Navy has taken actions, we  developed the following three-point scale:", "Not Complete\u2014The Navy has not taken any action to respond to  identified lessons learned.", "Partially Complete\u2014The Navy has taken some action to respond to  the identified lessons learned, but has not completed the action  needed to address the identified risk.", "Complete\u2014The Navy has completed the action needed to address  the identified lesson learned."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Considerations Informing Contractors\u2019 Plans for Hiring and Facilities Investments", "paragraphs": ["To describe considerations informing ship repair contractors\u2019 plans for  future hiring and facilities investments under the MAC-MO strategy, we  conducted semi-structured interviews with and reviewed questionnaire  responses from 11 non-nuclear surface ship repair contractors.

We randomly selected a non-generalizable sample of three small  business contractors performing noncomplex ship repair work at the three  home ports implementing MAC-MO, to obtain the views of small  businesses executing MAC-MO contracts. We used FPDS -NG data to  identify those small businesses that have been awarded MAC-MO  delivery orders.", "Further, we used a data collection instrument to gather information from  each of the selected 11 contractors on their facilities, workforce, and  sources of revenue. For example, we collected contractor-reported  information on what types of facilities the contractor owned, such as a dry  dock or a pier, the number of the contractor\u2019s full-time staff, and the  percentage of revenue from entities other than from the Navy.", "To identify the Navy\u2019s projected workload for non-nuclear surface ships  where the MAC-MO strategy is implemented, we obtained data from the  Navy from fiscal years 2019 through the end of 2023.

We collected  documentation on these approaches, such as for the Performance to Plan  initiative on how the Navy intends to use computer modeling to more  accurately plan and forecast future availability timeframes, leveraging  Navy historical datasets to provide more accurate and realistic planning  forecasts.", "In addition, for all three objectives, we interviewed officials responsible for  overseeing, planning, administering, and funding the Navy\u2019s ship repair  contracts, including representatives of the Office of the Under Secretary  of Defense (Comptroller); Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy  (Financial Management and Comptroller); the Office of the Chief of Naval  Operations; Commander, Navy Regional Maintenance Center (CNRMC)  and Deputy Commander, Surface Ship Maintenance and Modernization  (SEA 21); Surface Maintenance Engineering Planning Program  (SURFMEPP); Commander, Naval Surface Force, Atlantic; Commander,  Naval Surface Force, Pacific; Mid-Atlantic Regional Maintenance Center  (MARMC) in Norfolk, Virginia; the Southwest Regional Maintenance  Center (SWRMC) in San Diego, California; and the Southeast Regional  Maintenance Center (SERMC) in Mayport, Florida.
