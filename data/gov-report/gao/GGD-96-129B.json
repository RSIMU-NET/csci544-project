We structured the interviews to obtain insight into the ability of private delivery firms to deliver letter mail now protected by the Statutes and the interest of mailers in using such firms. Along with these interview results, we compiled, but were unable to verify, various shipment data on private firms in order to estimate existing private delivery capacity and compare the magnitude of private mail delivery to that of the Postal Service.", "To estimate the effects of mail volume losses on the Service\u2019s revenues, costs, and postage rates, we used estimated mail volumes and other data that the Postal Service and Postal Rate Commission used in a recent rate case (Docket No. R94-1). We assumed that for fiscal year 1995, the estimated number of First-Class, Priority Mail, and third-class mail pieces had been reduced in 5-percent increments from 5 to 25 percent. We used those percentages not to predict what would happen, but rather to show the potential effects on postal revenues, costs, and rates if the Service had lost these volumes of mail. We assumed that the financial effects of losing mail volumes would result in changes to postage rates, not reductions in the levels of service offered and not federal appropriations to offset revenue losses.", "At our request and with the Service\u2019s approval, we also used a Price Waterhouse LLP model, developed under contract with the Service, to provide additional estimates for 10 future years of changes in the Service\u2019s revenues, costs, and rates as a result of assumed future mail volume losses. Additional details on the methods and assumptions used to estimate the effects of mail volume losses on the Service\u2019s revenues, costs, and rates are included in appendix I, volume II, of this report.", "To obtain information on postal administrations in other countries, we reviewed several reports done by other U.S. organizations, including a February 1995 report prepared by Price Waterhouse for the Postal Service. We interviewed officials of several other postal administrations, visited the Canadian postal administration\u2014Canada Post Corporation\u2014in Ottawa, and reviewed annual reports and various other documents provided by foreign postal administrations. The information in this report concerning the postal laws of other countries does not reflect our independent analysis of those laws; rather, it rests primarily on the views and analysis provided to us by officials of those governments and other secondary sources.", "We requested written comments on this report from the Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission.

The Service provides a uniform rate for First-Class letters delivered anywhere in the United States, its territories, and possessions. However, the Service\u2019s rates are more complex today than in 1970. The Service has adopted a broader range of rates over the years that more closely reflect its processing and delivery costs.   To illustrate, in 1970, there were only two rates for 1-ounce First-Class letters\u2014an 8-cent rate for regular letters and an 11-cent rate for air mail. For third-class mail, there were three rates\u201423 cents per pound for circulars and 17 cents per pound for books, with a minimum rate per piece of 4 cents. No discounts were offered to mailers who presorted their mail or performed other steps that reduced the Service\u2019s processing time and costs.", "In contrast to the 1970 rates, current postage rates, which became effective in January 1995, include a variety of First-Class and third-class rates. The single-piece, 1-ounce First-Class letter is 32 cents. First-Class mailers who perform certain worksharing functions that reduce the Service\u2019s processing costs are charged lower rates. The eight worksharing rates for First-Class letters weighing 1 ounce or less range from 25.4 cents to 30.5 cents.", "Similarly, the rates for letter-size third-class mail are different today from what they were in 1970. Currently, such rates vary depending on the extent of transportation and preparation (i.e., presorting and prebarcoding) by mailers and the weight of the piece. For example, the rates for one piece of regular, bulk, third-class letter-size mail with no mailer transportation or preparation is 22.6 cents but reduced to 11.7 cents if the mailer presorts it into the order that it is to be delivered and transported to the postal unit responsible for delivery.", "Further, the volume of First-Class mail subject to the uniform rate requirement has declined, as a percentage of total mail volume, since 1971. In 1971, First-Class mail made up 59.2 percent of the total volume, compared to 53.3 percent in 1995. In contrast, third-class mail increased from 23.6 percent of the total volume in 1971 to 39.3 percent in 1995.", "Currently, a relatively small percentage of the overall mail volume is generated by residential customers.

About 55 percent of the total mail stream was sent from business to households, and about 35 percent was sent from business to business.

Rather, under the 1970 Act, a number of criteria must be considered.Further, any person whose service is affected by any proposed post office closing may appeal the closing to the Postal Rate Commission (PRC).", "Postal Service officials told us that the number of post offices not producing sufficient revenue to cover the related operating costs has grown since 1970. This trend has occurred for three basic reasons. First, the make-up of mail has changed, with far more business mail and far less residential mail. Secondly, worksharing postage rates introduced since 1970 encourage mailers to (1) bypass local post offices and \u201cdrop ship\u201d mail closer to the mail\u2019s delivery destination; and (2) deposit large volumes of mail, already sorted and barcoded, at the Service\u2019s mail processing plants rather than local post offices. Thirdly, in earlier years, postage stamps could be purchased only from a post office or rural letter carrier. Today, they may be obtained from a variety of sources, including grocery and other retail stores, vending machines, and mail carriers. Stamps may also be ordered by mail.", "The Service is exploring various ways, in addition to the traditional post office, of providing ready customer access to all \u201cretail\u201d postal services, such as placing \u201cPostal Express\u201d units in private retail stores located in shopping centers and opening postal stations in shopping malls.", "The Service is constrained, however, in upgrading its post office infrastructure, which remains largely the same as in 1970.

These procedures include responding to appeals that could be filed by any person whose service may be affected by the proposed post office closing.", "Under the 1970 Act, the Commission has 120 days to make a decision on each such appeal.

Fourteen closings were upheld, 4 appeals were withdrawn, and 4 were sent back to the Service for further review, i.e., remanded. According to Commission data, the time necessary to complete the appeals process was less than 120 days in each of the 22 cases. In some cases, however, the total time taken to close a small post office ranged up to several years from the date the Service began working with the affected community to the date of the closing.

Unlike other federal and private organizations, the Service is also required by law to consult with postmasters and supervisors before making any changes to pay and certain other matters affecting these employees. Postal Service employees do not have the right to strike, nor does postal management have the right to lock out striking employees or hire replacements.

Thus, whether private firms deliver larger volumes of letter mail in the future appears to depend less on private delivery capacity than on statutory restrictions or the profitability of such deliveries.", "Although the Postal Service considers the five carriers discussed above to be its most prominent competitors, many other private firms also offer expedited mail delivery services. As one indication of the number, the Air Courier Conference of America, a trade association whose member firms compete with the Postal Service, reported that it had 78 members in 1995, including most of the Postal Service\u2019s principal competitors. Similarly, the Express Carriers Association listed 64 ground package express carriers in its 1995-96 directory.

According to an industry group, the Association of Alternate Postal Systems (AAPS), these firms \u201cprovide delivery and distribution of circulars, tabloids, magazines, catalogues, directories, flyers, samples and other printed material and advertising outside of the U.S.P.S. mail stream.\u201d The number of these firms grew rapidly in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Most new start-ups (226 of the 375 firms) occurred over roughly a 5-year period, from 1988 to 1993.", "Several events stimulated expansion and transformation of the industry in the 1980s. One was the growth of computerized database marketing programs that allowed advertisers to target direct mail advertising to specific geographic and demographic groups. This led to a proliferation of highly customized household mailing lists, which also contributed to significant growth in third-class advertising mail delivered by the Postal Service. In addition, three significant increases in the Service\u2019s third-class postage rates that became effective in 1988, 1991, and 1995 prompted some advertisers to seek lower cost delivery alternatives.", "Another event, and one that many industry experts believe was of greatest significance, was the growing participation of newspapers and other publishers in alternate delivery ownership and operations. Newspaper publishers owned about three-fourths of the firms that entered the market between 1988 and 1994. These publishers, who account for the largest share of the overall advertising market, traditionally relied heavily on revenue from advertisements printed within a newspaper\u2019s pages, known in the trade as \u201crun of press\u201d advertising. However, many advertisers have shifted to less expensive advertising inserts. As this change took place, newspaper publishers found themselves increasingly in direct competition with the Postal Service. For example, in discussions with us, newspaper industry representatives were outspoken about losing revenue to the Postal Service and the implications of any such losses to the financial health of the newspaper industry.", "The developments highlighted above both stimulated new entrants to the advertising delivery market and contributed to an unprecedented growth in the Postal Service\u2019s advertising mail deliveries, despite rate increases. As previously illustrated in figure 3.2, the Postal Service delivered about 20 billion pieces of third-class mail in 1971 compared to about 71 billion pieces in 1995.

Many firms made \u201csaturation\u201d deliveries once a week to households to deliver such items as advertising flyers, local government notices, product samples, unpaid community newspapers, and telephone directories. Typically, items were placed in plastic bags and hung on a door knob, placed on a front porch, hung from a hook placed on the mailbox post, placed in a delivery tube attached either to its own stand or a mailbox post, or tossed onto driveways or walkways.", "For alternate delivery firms owned by newspapers, the core delivery product is what they call a \u201ctotal market coverage\u201d (TMC) package. Generally, a TMC package includes at least one item, such as a free community newspaper or a weekly entertainment supplement, that would qualify for second-class postage rates on the basis of its editorial content if sent through the mail. TMC packages also include advertisements identical or similar to newspaper advertising inserts. The primary purpose of TMC deliveries is to ensure distribution of advertisers\u2019 messages beyond the newspaper\u2019s subscriber base alone. Because the TMC packages also include an item qualifying as a second-class publication, alternate delivery firms do not consider TMC packages to be covered by the Statutes and the Postal Service agrees. Most newspaper-owned alternate delivery firms also deliver one or more of the following products, either concurrently or separately from TMC deliveries: saturation advertising and product samples, weekly newspapers and shoppers\u2019 guides not otherwise contained in TMC packages, and consumer magazines and catalogs. Private delivery of the latter, however, has declined since 1994.", "The Postal Service also delivers some third-class advertising mail to occupants and boxholders at specific addresses without an address label on the mail itself. For example, ADVO, Inc., one of the Postal Service\u2019s largest customers, specializes in delivering \u201cmarriage mail\u201d by combining pieces from several advertisers in a single mailing. An address card, which is separate from the advertising pieces, is sent on the same day. Many product samples are delivered in the same manner. However, the Postal Service describes this mail as \u201cdetached label\u201d and still considers it to be \u201caddressed.\u201d Overall, about 17 percent of the Service\u2019s regular third-class advertising mail was addressed to occupants and boxholders in fiscal year 1994, regardless of whether labels were affixed or detached.", "More recently, in 1995, the Postal Service announced it was planning to implement an experimental \u201cNeighborhood Mail\u201d program. In this program, the Service proposed to allow mailers to send advertising materials only to \u201cNeighbor\u201d or \u201cPostal Patron\u201d and to eliminate the requirement that it bear a specific street or box address. The purpose of the neighborhood mail program was to provide lower advertising delivery rates to small, local businesses for unaddressed, saturation mail that did not require significant handling and processing by postal employees. The planned program encountered strong opposition, primarily from the newspaper industry, advertising mailers and companies that provide support services to mailers (such as address lists and labels), and the alternate delivery industry. Consequently, the Service deferred the test and later announced that it would not be done at all.", "Some newspaper and alternate delivery executives perceived the proposed neighborhood delivery program as an attempt by the Service to take business from them. They questioned the Postal Service\u2019s choice of sites, such as Baton Rouge and New Orleans, Louisiana; Rochester, New York; and Sacramento, California, where alternate delivery firms were already operating. These executives were most concerned about the Service\u2019s choice of Rochester. That city\u2019s major newspaper had discontinued a delivery operation in 1995, reportedly after failing to make a profit.", "Subsequently, Publishers Express (PubX), a national alternate delivery network with which the newspaper had been affiliated, established its own alternate delivery operation in March 1995.

To the extent that several large publishers were involved as founders of or investors in such organizations, they were primarily motivated by a desire to reduce mailing costs and improve delivery service. Locally owned delivery companies affiliated with national networks in order to benefit from the collective marketing of members\u2019 delivery services to national advertisers or publishers.

APD has a network of about 40 private delivery affiliates capable of delivering address-specific items to about 10 million households and saturation materials to about 30 million households.", "The second organization, PubX, was established in 1989 by a group of equity partners led by Time, Inc., and included other magazine publishers, catalogers, printers, and paper companies. PubX, which was headquartered in Marietta, Georgia, built a national network through licensing agreements with predominantly newspaper-owned alternate delivery firms. The number of PubX licensees peaked at 32 in 1994; collectively, they delivered about 60 million pieces that year. However, PubX licensees declined to around 25 by mid-1995, and some of the remaining licensees cut back on second-class magazine deliveries, which constituted the core of PubX\u2019s business.", "Both APD and PubX tried several marketing strategies to increase the volume of pieces delivered. Officials of both firms said that to deliver magazines profitably and at rates lower than the Postal Service\u2019s second-class postage rates depended on developing a market for so-called \u201cride-along\u201d advertising, i.e., normally third-class mail pieces that may be delivered to specific addresses when included as inserts with second-class publications. However, ride-along advertising did not develop as fully as anticipated, and many newspaper publishers reduced or terminated magazine deliveries arranged through APD or PubX. Largely as a result of the decline in private magazine deliveries, the combined number of APD and PubX affiliates dropped from 82 in 1993 to 47 by the end of 1995.", "APD and PubX also have sought to increase the use of alternate delivery by mail order catalog publishers. Toward that end, some of these publishers participated in a 1994 catalog delivery test coordinated by the Direct Marketing Association (DMA). Overall, however, DMA found that Postal Service delivery resulted in more orders and higher dollar sales than private delivery of the same catalogs. Separately, a representative of the Mail Order Association of America said that for large nationwide catalogers, any delivery cost savings associated with alternate delivery were not great enough, given the industry\u2019s relatively limited geographic reach when compared to the Postal Service, to justify shifting portions of their deliveries to private carriers and bearing the additional administrative costs of using multiple service providers.", "Nonetheless, the JC Penney Company, one of the nation\u2019s largest catalogers, had distributed a portion of its catalogs through former PubX licensees. In January 1996, it terminated its agreement with PubX and reverted to Postal Service delivery in those markets.", "In February 1996, PubX\u2019s board of directors voted to discontinue all operations. The board cited a number of factors for the decision, including a period of stable postal rates, the \u201chistorically low\u201d increase in second-class rates that became effective in January 1995, improved service by the Postal Service, and the Service\u2019s strong financial results in fiscal year 1995. The board said that \u201cthe recent improvements within the Postal Service have diminished the need for a hard copy delivery alternative. However, if the USPS cost trends revert to prior levels, hard copy delivery alternatives will once again develop.\u201d", "\u201cWe ran them out of business by improving service and keeping costs low!

And second, when we get our act together, we can be one hell of a competitor.\u201d", "APD and PubX also pursued, unsuccessfully, changes in Postal Service regulations to permit greater competition with the Service for the delivery of advertising letter mail. As previously noted, they and other parties were members of the Coalition for the Relaxation of the Private Express Statutes that petitioned the Postal Service to suspend the letter mail monopoly for some or all third-class mail in January 1995. The Coalition founder told us that its principal target was catalogs of less than 24 pages.", "Despite the strong interest expressed by alternate delivery firms in expanding their business, industry leaders have acknowledged that they have a long way to go to increase capacity to levels that would represent a significant competitive threat to the Postal Service.

Of the remainder, five said they were unlikely to do so, and two were undecided.", "Both in our 1992 report and in our more recent discussions with private carriers and Postal Service officials, we obtained other information that suggested Priority Mail may be at greatest risk for immediate and substantial volume losses to private carriers. For example: \u2022 Nationwide private carriers may be able to meet or surpass the Postal Service from a competitive perspective in terms of price, range of services, and reliability. \u2022 Airborne, FedEx, and UPS each claim to deliver to virtually all domestic U.S. addresses; RPS expects to be able to do so by the end of 1996; and DHL advertises its overnight service is available \u201cto all major U.S. business centers.\u201d Thus, most of the private express and parcel carriers say that they maintain essentially universal delivery networks. \u2022 National carriers already have lobbied Congress to suspend the double-postage rule, discussed in chapter 2, in an effort to facilitate adding letters to their deferred package deliveries. \u2022 Declining growth in next-day morning deliveries has caused overnight carriers to consider expanding into the fast growing but less expensive next-day afternoon, second-day, and third-day delivery markets. This trend is reflected in the Postal Service\u2019s Priority Mail volume, which increased nearly 64 percent between 1990 and 1995, from about 518 million to 869 million pieces, while its Express Mail (next-day) volume declined about 3 percent. \u2022 Some expedited mail delivered by private carriers is too large to fit in residential mailboxes, is delivered inside to businesses, or requires a signature for delivery. Consequently, most private carriers we interviewed said they are not dependent on greater access to mailboxes in order to expand deferred deliveries. \u2022 Unlike the Postal Service, private carriers are able to offer both volume and negotiated discounts to their customers. Further, many mailers perceive private carriers as more reliable than the Postal Service and find their tracking and tracing services superior to those of the Postal Service. \u2022 Priority Mail generates high revenue per mail piece, making it especially attractive to private carriers. In 1994, on average, Priority Mail generated gross revenue of $3.45 per piece and net revenue of $1.79 per piece, compared to gross revenue of about 35 cents per piece and net revenue of 12 cents per piece for First-Class mail. For fiscal year 1995, Priority Mail represented less than one-half of 1 percent of all mail pieces handled by the Service but generated almost 6 percent of total revenues. \u2022 As noted in chapter 3, the five principal nationwide carriers already command an overwhelming share, about 85 percent, of the combined overnight, 2- and 3-day, and parcel delivery markets.", "The Service measures its mail volume on the basis of the following origin and destination pairs: business-to-business, business-to-household, household-to-business, and household-to-household. In 1994, about 90 percent of all mail was generated by businesses (about 55 percent of all mail went from businesses to households, and 35 percent went from businesses to businesses), while 10 percent emanated from households. We asked private carriers whether they were most interested in providing business or residential service. We asked mailers in which of those market segments they were likely to divert some mail to private carriers if given greater freedom to do so.", "Among the five national express/parcel carriers, all but one said they were \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery likely\u201d to pursue additional business-to-business deliveries.

However, only two of the five carriers (40 percent) said they were likely to pursue a greater share of the business-to-household delivery market, while two others said they were as likely as unlikely to do so. None said they were likely to pursue household-to-business deliveries, although one indicated it might be as likely as unlikely to consider that market segment.

For these estimates, we used Postal Service data that it had provided to the Commission in early 1994 to request new postage rates, including the 32-cent basic letter rate that became effective in January 1995.

The most recent rate increase, which took effect in January 1995, was 3 cents.", "Even though our analysis indicates that the basic letter rate might not significantly increase as a result of volume losses ranging up to 25 percent for Priority Mail and third-class mail pieces, the effects of letter mail volume losses on the estimated revenue per mail piece would differ among the Service\u2019s mail classes, subclasses, and selected categories, as table 4.2 shows.", "Although we believe that our analysis is useful as an indicator of the possible effects on the Service\u2019s basic letter rate, the effects of any mail volume losses on other postage rates likely would differ significantly. The effects depend on the amount of assumed percentage volume losses among the affected letter mail classes and subclasses. For example, if First-Class mail volumes had been 25 percent lower in fiscal year 1995, the Priority Mail rate would have increased by an average of 31 cents per piece (effective January 1995, the single piece rate for 2 pounds or less was $3). Using the same assumption, the rate for Express Mail (with a single-piece cost of $10.25 for 8 ounces or less as of January 1995) would have increased an average of 36 cents per piece.", "Consistent with the data shown above, estimates provided by Price Waterhouse show that a 25-percent loss of First-Class mail volume could have a greater effect on the Service\u2019s basic letter mail rate than a 25-percent loss of either Priority Mail or third-class mail volumes. Specifically, the price of a First-Class stamp (for a 1-ounce or less letter) would need to be 41 cents in 2005 under the \u201cbaseline\u201d estimate, while an assumed 25-percent First-Class mail volume loss would increase this price to 46 cents.

For example, if the Service lost mail volume in some high-volume geographic areas, carrier delivery costs could be unaffected after the volume decline if the carrier must travel the same delivery route and make the same number of stops along the route as before the loss. In this case, the Service would lose revenue to the extent of the volume loss but would not reduce its delivery costs.", "Postal Service officials told us they had performed some analysis to better understand and measure how revenue and delivery costs might be affected in areas with different demographics as a result of mail volume losses. The analysis showed that a change in the Statutes could most affect those types of mail pieces, such as bank statements, bills, and retail advertisements, that were received in greater numbers by households with higher incomes. Households with the greatest incomes received three times as much mail as those with the smallest incomes, according to the Service\u2019s analysis. If the Service lost some mail now delivered to households with higher incomes, it is likely that it would still have to deliver some mail, but fewer pieces of mail, to those households each day. This could mean that the Service would collect less revenue from the mail delivered to these households but still incur about the same costs for the lesser amount of mail delivered to these same households.", "Our analysis showed that the geographic concentration of alternate delivery firms specializing in distribution of third-class advertising matter tended to correlate highly with population density.

Therefore, to estimate financial effects relating to changes in the Statutes, we used the systemwide, average revenue and cost per mail piece for the various mail classes and subclasses that were used in the most recent ratemaking proceeding (Postal Rate Commission Docket No. R94-1), which resulted in new rates effective January 1995.

The current national leadership includes recently recruited vice presidents from the private sector who head such functions as marketing, technology applications, facilities, finance, quality, and international business. \u2022 At the Service\u2019s request, PRC recently recommended reclassification of most postage rates, in part to encourage mailers to do more barcoding of letter mail. This action, along with the Service\u2019s deployment of additional automated mail barcode sorting equipment, is expected to reduce the Service\u2019s mail processing and delivery costs, thereby helping the Service to set and maintain more competitive postage rates for most of its mail classes and thereby maintain overall mail volume. \u2022 The Service\u2019s business plans focus increased attention and resources on those markets that have strong growth potential and hold the promise of strong financial returns to the Service. For example, as we discussed in our recent report, the international mail markets offer strong growth potential.

In the mid-19th century, European governments developed \u201cuniversal governmental postal service\u201d to deliver mail to many homes and businesses and introduced uniform postal rates. These developments led to increased demand for international as well as domestic postal services. Since these governments had asserted a monopoly over postal service, there was no private mail system for international mail delivery. Instead, international mail was governed under bilateral agreements, which resulted in a complex set of rates calculated under different currencies, weights, and measures. To address this issue, postal administrations from 21 European nations and the United States agreed in 1874 to form a permanent international organization, the Universal Postal Union (UPU), to develop standard rules for exchanging international mail.", "As discussed in our earlier report, 189 countries (including the United States) participated in UPU in 1995. UPU now functions as a specialized agency of the United Nations and governs international postal services. Member countries have agreed to fulfill statutory universal service obligations on an international level by accepting mail from each other and delivering it to its final destination. In effect, each UPU member country has agreed to provide some form of universal mail delivery service for international mail to be delivered within their country.", "In the eight countries we reviewed, the postal administrations provided certain services to their citizens at uniform rates before reform and continued to provide them following reform. However, the definition of universal mail service varies somewhat from country to country. Some of the countries provided the same level of service for urban and rural customers, while others had different service standards for urban and rural areas. For example, although Canada Post is required by law to maintain service that meets the needs of Canadian citizens, the service only needs to be similar for communities of the same size. Canadian citizens in very remote areas in the far north may receive mail delivery less frequently each week than those in some other areas of Canada.", "Similarly, some citizens in rural areas of Australia and New Zealand receive mail delivery less often each week. In Australia, the frequency of rural delivery is based on a system agreed on between Australia Post and the government that takes into account the cost of delivery and special needs for educational materials and medical supplies. In New Zealand, a written agreement between New Zealand Post and the government specifies the proportion of delivery points that may receive delivery less frequently.", "The legal basis of universal postal service also varies from country to country. Universal service requirements can be based on the country\u2019s constitution, statutes, written agreements between the postal administration and the government, policies established by the government minister who oversees the postal administration, or a combination of these. The way requirements are specified\u2014and the degree of specificity\u2014also varies from one country to another.", "In some countries, changes in universal service practices have been controversial. For example, in New Zealand, New Zealand Post increased a long-standing rural delivery fee for service, paid by the addressee; this decision proved unpopular, and the fee was eliminated, effective April 1, 1995.", "In Canada, changes in universal service have provoked debate and led in some cases to further changes in policy. After Canada Post was incorporated in 1981, it started to close and consolidate some rural post offices in order to increase the number of those that were privately operated through franchises. This policy was controversial and, in February 1994, the government minister overseeing Canada Post announced that rural post offices should no longer be closed."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Private Letter Delivery Restricted in Most Countries That We Reviewed", "paragraphs": ["Governments in seven of eight countries that we reviewed imposed restrictions on the delivery of certain mail by private firms.

However, according to the Price Waterhouse report mentioned above, a key reason for reform was an \u201cincrease in competition in the delivery and communications markets.\u201d Further, some other countries found direct enforcement of mail monopolies to be difficult and used other means to achieve compliance with legal restrictions on private mail delivery. For example, like the Postal Service, Canada\u2019s postal administration, Canada Post Corporation, primarily uses education and persuasion rather than legal action to get violators to comply with the Canadian law restricting the delivery of certain letter mail.", "In many of the other eight countries, the mail monopoly exists for reasons similar to those supporting the U.S. mail monopoly. For example, Canada\u2019s mail monopoly has been justified on the grounds that the Canadian government was believed to be the only entity that could and would provide a postal service universal in scope. According to a recent study of Canada\u2019s postal system, the private sector has been judged to be unwilling to make the large, expensive investment in infrastructure and commitments required to serve all areas, including outlying and low-density ones, with a full range of postal services at equitable prices. As a result of the monopoly, a single charge has been levied for basic nonlocal letter mail service in Canada since the nation was founded, regardless of the distance traveled or any complications associated with the route. Although Canada reformed its postal laws in 1981, Canada Post officials said that the monopoly, or \u201cexclusive privilege,\u201d continues to be justified on both economic and social grounds.", "In contrast with the United States, none of the eight countries have laws that give their postal administrations exclusive access to the mailbox. However, there may be certain limitations to mailbox access in some countries. For example, in Canada, if Canada Post owns the mailbox, it is locked and only Canada Post has access to it. In some rural areas, there are mailboxes that are grouped together at various crossroads and are locked for security reasons.

The Swedish government currently contracts exclusively with Sweden Post to provide universal service. The government can extend this arrangement in the future to other competitors that are able to provide the entire service or parts of universal service.

When a number of utility companies and municipalities in Ontario began delivering bills themselves, claiming they were not letters, Canada Post proposed a changed definition of \u201cletter\u201d in July 1982. After considerable protest, Canada Post, businesses, and the government agreed on a mutually acceptable definition that was approved in May 1983. A letter was redefined to mean \u201cone or more messages or information in any form.\u201d New exemptions covered transmission of electronic mail and allowed utility company employees to deliver bills made up on the spot.

The narrowing of the mail monopoly in 1994 generated concern in Parliament over Australia Post\u2019s ability to maintain services to rural and remote areas. Even before the changes to the postal monopoly became effective, the Country Mail Services Working Party (a subcommittee of the Australian government\u2019s Primary Industries and Energy Committee) reviewed the provision of Australia Post\u2019s PSOs. In February 1994, it recommended to the Minister for Communications and the Arts, who oversees postal matters, that Australia Post\u2019s services to rural and remote communities should be protected through a review of PSOs once in the life of Parliament (i.e., every 3 years). This recommendation was accepted by the government.", "As a result, the Minister requested that the Australian House of Representatives\u2019 Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure review rural and remote letter delivery services, including \u201cthe effect of any further reduction in reserved services\u201d on Australia Post\u2019s performance of its public service obligations.
