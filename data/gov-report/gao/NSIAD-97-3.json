Market research is the process used to collect and analyze data about capabilities in the market that could satisfy an agency\u2019s procurement needs. Specifically, we were required to (1) review existing federal government market research efforts regarding commercial items and nondevelopmental items (NDI) and (2) review the feasibility of creating a governmentwide database for storing, retrieving, and analyzing market data.", "For purposes of our review, the term \u201cexisting market research efforts\u201d includes (1) efforts/practices used for selected contracts awarded during our review and for associated acquisition requirements, which often occurred a year or more earlier and (2) efforts/practices used to implement FASA requirements. As such, the term includes market research done both prior to and after the regulations implementing FASA\u2019s market research requirements became mandatory for use, December 1, 1995 (referred to as pre-FASA and post-FASA practices, respectively). To determine market research efforts, we reviewed 21 contracts that were awarded by some of the major federal buying agencies identified in the Federal Procurement Data System. These contracts are not intended to represent a scientific sample. For each contract, we also reviewed available market research information on the acquisition requirements.", "We also obtained from government procurement officials and industry procurement officials their views on the feasibility of creating a governmentwide database for storing, retrieving, and analyzing market data."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Market research has been a statutory requirement for over 10 years, since the passage of the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984, which required the use of market research and procurement planning to promote the use of competitive procedures in federal contracting. The FAR implemented those market research provisions and essentially established market research as a tool for identifying (1) sources to ensure competition and (2) commercial products to meet an agency\u2019s needs. Emphasis on the use of market research to identify commercial items has evolved, however, since the 1984 act was enacted. For example, in November 1990, Congress reemphasized market research for the Department of Defense (DOD) in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991 (P.L. 101-510). This act sought to encourage DOD to save money and reduce acquisition cycle time by buying products that were commercially available or had already been developed.", "FASA, which was enacted on October 13, 1994, reiterated some existing requirements and stipulated additional ones for market research for all federal executive agencies. It requires federal executive agencies to conduct market research before developing new specifications for a procurement and before soliciting bids or proposals for a contract exceeding $100,000. FASA also requires agencies to use market research results to determine whether commercial items/NDI could meet their needs if either the item or the requirement were modified to some extent. These provisions seek to ensure that agencies\u2019 requirements definition and contracting communities are involved in market research and that cost/performance tradeoffs are evaluated up front to encourage the use of commercial items or NDI.", "All FASA provisions were to apply no later than October 1, 1995. The officials responsible for incorporating FASA\u2019s market research provisions into the FAR, however, made such revisions optional for solicitations issued from October 1 through November 30, 1995, and mandatory for solicitations issued on or after December 1, 1995. The officials explained that the 2-month delay allowed more time for agency officials to be trained and familiarize themselves with the changes in the regulations. Such regulatory changes included (1) the use of note 26 in Commerce Business Daily (CBD) preaward notices as a final check on the government\u2019s market research effort and (2) the requirement to identify, via market research, customary commercial practices regarding customizing, modifying, or tailoring of items to meet customer needs and associated costs.", "The FAR lists some market research techniques, including (1) contacting knowledgeable individuals in the government and industry regarding market capabilities to meet the acquisition requirements, (2) publishing formal requests for information in appropriate technical journals or business publications, and (3) involving potential offerors in interchange meetings or holding presolicitation conferences early in the acquisition process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Existing Market Research Varied: Benefits From FASA Changes Expected Later", "paragraphs": ["In general, existing market research efforts and practices relating to commercial items and NDI varied greatly. For example, we found variances in the emphasis DOD and civilian agencies placed on pre-FASA market research. Additionally, our review of selected acquisition requirements and contract awards showed variances in the type and extent of existing market research practices, primarily due to the circumstances surrounding the buy. Such circumstances included the dollar value; nature of the buy (whether it was a new or recurring requirement); and the industry sector or pace of technology changes for the item involved. Variances were also apparent in the use of the results of such research.", "Efforts to implement FASA\u2019s market research changes are underway. Government and industry officials stated, however, that it will probably take well over a year after the December 1, 1995, implementation of FASA in governmentwide regulations for significant effects of these changes to be apparent. For example, our review of the use of CBD note 26\u2014the government\u2019s final check on their market research\u2014showed that it is early in the implementation phase. Specifically, due to a lack of awareness of the FAR requirement, federal agencies and procuring activities were generally not using note 26."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOD and Civilian Agencies\u2019 Market Research Requirements and Guidance Varied in Emphasis", "paragraphs": ["DOD emphasized market research for commercial items and NDI more than the civilian agency locations we visited. Such emphasis is partly due to additional statutory requirements related to commercial items/NDI and associated market research that have applied to DOD for several years\u2014before FASA made them applicable governmentwide. These included the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991  (P.L. 101-510). Section 810 of this act required DOD to conduct market research to determine whether an NDI, including a commercial item, was available or could be modified to meet the agency\u2019s need before developing a new specification for a developmental item.", "As a result of such statutory requirements, DOD, before FASA, had (1) written guidance for its market research process; (2) conducted market research training for specification writers and program managers and their staffs (but not necessarily including contracting officials); (3) established NDI advocates to promote the acquisition of more commercial items and NDI through, among other things, the use of market research; and (4) collected data to measure trends in the procurement of such items.", "We did not find as much pre-FASA emphasis on market research within the civilian agencies we visited as in DOD. For example, most did not have separate guidance for commercial/NDI market research, or provide training to their acquisition officials that focused on market research. However, post-FASA, some of the civilian agencies have written market research guidance, developed market research training, and adopted many of DOD\u2019s procedures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Type, Extent, and Use of Market Research Varied", "paragraphs": ["Market research was performed for 18 of the 21 contracts we reviewed. The three contracts for which such research was not performed were awarded under exceptions to full and open competition. The market research performed in the 18 remaining contracts varied, primarily based on the complexity of the buy; its nature (whether the buy was to fulfill a new or recurring requirement); the dollar value of the buy; and the industry sector involved.", "For example, the Air Force Electronic Systems Center used a number of market research techniques before finalizing the specification and soliciting offers for one contract totaling $7.6 million. This contract is for a handheld thermal imager to assist security personnel in assessing the cause of alarms emanating from intrusion detection sensors deployed under the Tactical Automated Security System. Specifically, the Air Force tasked the Sandia National Laboratory to conduct a market survey, which was completed in January 1992. Also, the system program office performed an acquisition requirements tradeoff study in 1993 before establishing the requirement. In addition, program officials regularly used industry trade shows, DOD association meetings, and joint service briefings to assess improvements in handheld thermal imagers. They said that the concentration of industry equipment demonstrations and technical personnel at these meetings afforded ideal conditions to determine the state of the art of thermal imagers and identify industry research and development efforts to address this new operational requirement. Notices seeking sources for the thermal imagers were published in the CBD in April and August 1995, and face-to-face meetings were held with several of the vendors who responded to these notices. A solicitation was issued in September 1995 and a contract was awarded in March 1996 for a modified commercial item.", "On the other hand, less complex market research was performed for a new requirement that involved a simpler, lower dollar value procurement. Specifically, this Army Communications and Electronic Command contract was for a commercially available off-the-shelf Asynchronous Transfer Mode Network Analyzer that would be used to test computer network operations. According to program officials, the users were aware of what was available commercially and contacted a number of companies to determine prices and capabilities. The list of companies was provided to the contracting officer, who published a CBD notice for additional sources. The requirement was identified in November 1994 and a $118,900-contract was awarded for a commercial item in March 1996.", "Table II.1 in appendix II presents the results of our review of the  21 contracts by agency or military service command, including a description of the item bought, the dollar value of the contract, the type of requirement (or the nature of the buy), and the types of market research conducted before requirements development and solicitation of offers.", "DOD and industry officials have repeatedly stated that DOD\u2019s acquisition system must evolve not only to meet national security needs, but also to take advantage of rapid technological changes in industry. Critical items such as computers and electronic components are examples of such rapidly changing technology. Officials from the Army\u2019s Communications and Electronic Command and the Air Force\u2019s Electronic Systems Center stated that they keep abreast of such changes by holding frequent briefings with industry representatives to exchange information on new developments. At such meetings, industry participants inform participants from the military activities what they are developing and the military services tell industry what they may need. The Electronic Systems Center officials told us that their market research efforts for specific buys do not have to be\u2014and are not\u2014that extensive now because they have kept up with changes in industry and are relying primarily on industry to supply electronic solutions to their needs since most of what they buy are integrated commercial items. They also stated that their solicitations and awards for new items require contractors to use commercial items and components to the maximum extent practical.", "Regarding the use of the results of market research in the contracts reviewed, we found evidence that such research was used in 13 of the  21 contracts to obtain commercial items and NDI and in 5 of the  21 contracts to obtain government-unique items or services. In 6 of the  13 contracts, market research identified commercial items/NDI, which ultimately were bought as is. In the other seven contracts, the agencies bought a modified commercial item/NDI. In addition, cost and/or performance tradeoffs were made and acquisition requirements were modified in 6 of the 13 contracts.

For example, post-FASA efforts to implement the new market research requirements have included (1) the Defense Acquisition University\u2019s development of a governmentwide satellite training program, for the acquisition workforce, that included modules on market research; (2) the Office of Federal Procurement Policy\u2019s (OFPP) efforts to compile a list of available commercial training courses for market research; (3) the Federal Acquisition Institute\u2019s revisions and development of online training materials relating to market research; (4) GSA\u2019s compilation of commercial terms and conditions used by 100 of the top Fortune 500 companies; and (5) DOD\u2019s issuance of its 1996 5000.1 and 5000.2 acquisition guidance, incorporating FASA\u2019s market research changes.", "Regarding the development of specifications for a procurement, officials in DOD and the civilian agencies we visited pointed out two significant post-FASA changes (1) a much stronger preference for commercial items and (2) a requirement to determine whether the agency\u2019s acquisition requirements should be modified, to a reasonable extent. Aside from this, the only other significant market research-related changes noted by these officials that resulted from the implementation of FASA related to customary commercial practices and use of CBD note 26. These officials stated that market research for developing specifications, as envisioned by FASA, has been performed for years by the technical community, which includes program management officials and specification writers. They further stated that they do not expect a lot of changes to the current market research process or practices they perform as a result of FASA and FAR market research requirements.", "Focusing specifically on contracting, as opposed to acquisition requirements and specifications, the contracting officials within DOD and civilian agencies noted that the market research they normally perform will not be just a product/sources search as in the past. Instead, FAR now states that the contracting officer should identify the customary commercial terms and conditions for the item being bought; practices regarding customizing, modifying, or tailoring of items to meet practices regarding buyer financing and warranty terms; and practices of the commercial sector, in general, so that the contracting officer can tailor the FAR clauses to be consistent with commercial practices.", "Most of the procurement officials we spoke with did not believe there were any standard terms, conditions, or practices industrywide. Although early efforts were being made to identify customary commercial practices, and terms and conditions associated with particular items, officials we spoke with stated, for the most part, vendors\u2019 proposals and subsequent negotiations with offerors will probably continue to be used to determine such information.", "Most of the acquisition and procurement officials we contacted in DOD, the civilian agencies, and the industry were unable to provide us with examples of any significant effects of the FASA market research changes. These officials stated that the significant effects of such changes will not be apparent for at least a year after governmentwide regulatory implementation.

They told us, essentially, that (1) this requirement had been overlooked and (2) they would emphasize it to their contracting staff in future policy letters. We brought this to the attention of officials in OFPP, GSA, and DOD. Although these officials acknowledged that the regulation writers may have intended for note 26 to be used as a final check on the government\u2019s market research, some DOD and GSA officials objected to an across-the-board use of the note as such a check.", "DOD officials stated that because a number of their items are military-unique, the note would have to go into hundreds of thousands of their notices of solicitation and that this may not be practical. GSA officials stated that certain services, such as construction and architecture and engineering are already covered under a different part of the FAR that reflects current commercial practices in these areas. These officials said that use of the note in all acquisitions, including construction and architecture and engineering services, would place an unnecessary burden on contracting officials, who would have to evaluate all responses to the note. Both the DOD and GSA officials stated that they would take actions to exempt these types of contracts from the note 26 requirement.", "Although some DOD officials have expressed concern over the use of numbered note 26, DOD, when commenting on a draft of this report, stated that it does not currently plan to change its market research process or practices that have been implemented under FASA, unless its process measurements in this area indicate a need to do so. GSA, in its comments on our draft report, stated that the issue of an across-the-board application of number note 26 is being reviewed by the FAR Commercial Contracting Drafting Team as part of its efforts to address related questions that have arisen.

However, the Command eventually terminated the system because it was never current, due to rapid advances in electronic technology and cost too much to maintain\u2014about $500,000 annually. According to Command officials, the activity decided to use DATAPRO\u2014an industry firm that provides some of the same information they were trying to maintain, but in a more up-to-date manner.", "We also talked with officials from selected private sector firms about their market research efforts, companywide databases that would facilitate market research, and their views on the feasibility of a governmentwide, government-maintained database to facilitate market research. They said such a database is feasible but would be difficult to maintain and would be costly. They noted that their companies have or are generating companywide databases to provide prior procurement information, which is similar to the data in the Federal Procurement Data System and in individual government buying activities.", "In contrast to the reaction against a government-maintained database, many of the government and industry officials we spoke with favored other technology-related ideas to facilitate market research.

They also stated that any of the previously suggested types of information (product data, terms and conditions, or data on past acquisitions) could be accessed from the Internet. These officials noted that the Internet is becoming a popular forum for providing federal acquisition information, and that private industry has started to use the Internet to list their products and services and, in some cases, to provide extensive commercial catalogs.", "For example, OFPP officials and others pointed out that powerful \u201csearch engines\u201d are becoming available on the Internet that will facilitate market research of private sector and government electronic catalogs. In commenting on a draft of this report, OFPP officials noted that they had provided guidance for the major procuring agencies to promote the use of the Internet for market research.

Specifically, the toolbox contains a number of items such as (1) the Thomas Register of American Manufacturers, which provides sourcing information on nearly 52,000 industrial products and services as well as specifications and availability information from thousands of manufacturers; (2) the Dunn and Bradstreet Catalog, which identifies and assists in evaluating potential suppliers based on purchasing needs; and (3) the Frost and Sullivan Report, a large market research consulting firm that provides market research information and reports on over 20 key industries.
