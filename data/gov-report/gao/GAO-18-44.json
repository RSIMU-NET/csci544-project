MAT is an approach that combines behavioral therapy and the use of certain medications, such as methadone and buprenorphine. HHS has implemented five key efforts since 2015 that focus on expanding access to MAT for opioid use disorders\u2014four grant programs that focus on expanding access to MAT in various settings (including rural primary care practices and health centers) and regulatory changes that expand treatment capacity by increasing patient limits for buprenorphine prescribers and allowing nurse practitioners and physician assistants to prescribe buprenorphine.", "Some of the grant awards were made in 2015, while others were made as recently as May 2017. (See figure.) As of August 2017, efforts under all the grant programs were ongoing. Grant recipients can use funding to undertake a range of activities, such as hiring and training providers and supporting treatments involving MAT. In addition, certain providers and grant recipients are required to develop plans for preventing MAT medications from being diverted for nonmedical purposes.", "HHS officials told GAO that as of August 2017, the department was in the process of finalizing its plans to evaluate its efforts to address the opioid epidemic. In September 2016, HHS awarded a contract to conduct the evaluation. HHS officials told GAO that they are still working with the contractor to finalize the evaluation approach and that it will focus on whether HHS's efforts to address the opioid epidemic have been implemented as intended. HHS officials said that in the future, HHS may also evaluate whether, or to what extent, its efforts have been effective in expanding access to MAT, in addition to evaluating implementation.", "While HHS has some of the information that could be used in a future evaluation of the effectiveness of its efforts to expand access to MAT, it has not adopted specific performance measures with targets specifying the magnitude of the increases HHS hopes to achieve through its efforts to expand access to MAT, and by when. For example, HHS has not established a long-term target specifying the percentage increase in the number of prescriptions for buprenorphine HHS would like to achieve, which would help to show whether efforts by HHS and others are resulting in a sufficient number of prescriptions for MAT medications. HHS has also not chosen a specific method of measuring treatment capacity or established targets associated with it, which would help determine whether a sufficient number of providers are becoming available to evaluate and treat patients who may benefit from MAT.", "Without specifying these performance measures and associated targets, HHS will not have an effective means to determine whether its efforts are helping to expand access to MAT or whether new approaches are needed. Gauging this progress is particularly important given the large gap identified nationwide between the total number of individuals who could benefit from MAT and the limited number who can currently access it based on provider availability.", "In addition, GAO also found that as of August 2017, HHS had not finalized its approach for its planned evaluation activities, including timeframes. Without timeframes for the evaluation's activities, HHS increases the risk that the evaluation will not be completed as expeditiously as possible.", "In addition to HHS efforts to expand access to MAT, officials from selected states, private health insurers, and national associations reported using several efforts to expand patients' access to MAT for opioid use disorders. For example, several stakeholders provided GAO with the following examples of their efforts:", "States. State health officials from all five selected states have implemented or are planning approaches that focus on integrating the use of MAT into primary care, such as by providing services for centralized intake and initial management of patients or through telehealth that connects patients in rural areas with addiction specialists in a different location.", "Private health insurers. Three private health insurers reported removing prior authorization requirements for MAT medications so patients can avoid a waiting period before receiving the medications.", "National associations. Officials told GAO that they are conducting outreach and training for their members and developing tools and resource guides. For example, one association developed a road map with strategies that state policymakers can use to address the opioid epidemic, including strategies for reducing the stigma associated with MAT through educating the public and potential providers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that HHS take two actions: (1) establish performance measures with targets related to expanding access to MAT, and (2) establish timeframes for its evaluation of its efforts to expand access to MAT.

For example, in a 2016 report we identified several factors that affect  access to MAT, including lack of insurance coverage and an insufficient  number of existing treatment programs or practicing physicians offering  MAT. Similarly, a 2016 Surgeon General\u2019s report on Alcohol, Drugs, and  Health noted barriers to accessing treatment, such as the cost of care  and challenges accessing providers who offer treatment services. In part  because of these challenges, it is likely that only a portion of the  individuals who need MAT are receiving it. The 2016 Surgeon General\u2019s  report and a 2015 study on MAT treatment capacity have both highlighted  this \u201ctreatment gap.\u201d The 2015 study, for instance, found that the  availability of MAT has not kept pace with the incidence of opioid use  disorders in the United States, as more are in need of the treatment than  can currently access it\u2014a treatment gap estimated to be nearly 1 million  people in 2012.", "In March 2015, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)  established the HHS Opioid Initiative, which aimed to decrease (1) opioid  overdoses and overall overdose mortality, and (2) the prevalence of  opioid use disorders. Led by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for  Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) in coordination with the Immediate  Office of the Secretary, the HHS Opioid Initiative had three priorities  related to opioid use disorders, one of which was to expand access to  MAT. Although the HHS Opioid Initiative ended in January 2017, HHS  activities related to improving access to treatment for opioid use disorders  have continued under the new administration\u2019s five-point Opioid Strategy,  which was announced in April 2017.

We also reviewed HHS\u2019s April 2017  announcement of the Opioid Strategy, as well as relevant federal laws  and regulations relating to MAT. In addition, we interviewed officials at  relevant federal agencies, such as ASPE, SAMHSA, HRSA, the Agency  for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), and the Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) with knowledge of MAT expansion efforts within  HHS. We specifically asked the officials to identify their key efforts to  expand access to MAT and to confirm the key efforts that we identified  independently through our document reviews. Our review focused on  those efforts implemented from fiscal year 2015 through August 2017. We  also inquired about the extent to which diversion control plans\u2014 procedures that reduce the possibility that controlled substances will be  transferred or used illicitly\u2014are included in HHS\u2019s efforts to expand  access to MAT, and we reviewed relevant documents.", "To examine any HHS evaluation of its key efforts to expand access to  MAT, we reviewed relevant documentation that describes HHS\u2019s  evaluation plans to assess MAT expansion efforts. These documents  included a 2016 report by Mathematica Policy Research that describes a  proposed evaluation approach developed under contract with HHS and  the solicitation for a contractor to conduct the evaluation. We assessed  these plans using criteria for defining objectives and evaluating results in  federal internal control standards. We also interviewed ASPE officials  about their evaluation approach and the status of the evaluation.", "To describe efforts by selected stakeholders to expand access to MAT,  we first identified relevant stakeholder organizations that represent states,  private health insurance plans, and national associations. Through our  interviews with HHS officials, background interviews with officials from  organizations, such as the America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans and Blue  Cross Blue Shield Association, and background research, we identified a  non-generalizable selection of 15 stakeholders in the following groups\u2014 states, private health insurance plans, and national associations\u2014to  obtain information about their efforts to expand access to MAT.  Specifically, we gathered information from officials at (1) state health  departments and behavioral health services agencies in five states:  Rhode Island, Maryland, Washington, West Virginia, and Indiana; (2)  seven private health insurance plans; and (3) three national associations  that represent providers, government officials, and public health officials:  the American Society of Addiction Medicine, the National Governors  Association, and the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.  In addition to identifying and selecting stakeholders with efforts to expand  access to MAT for opioid use disorder based on background interviews  and research, we considered (1) geographic diversity and Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention data on states with high opioid death  rates when selecting the five states; and (2) health insurers with large  market share when selecting the seven private health insurers. We also  asked several stakeholders about their views on the diversion of MAT  medications as part of their efforts to expand access to MAT, and we  reviewed relevant documents.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2016 to October 2017  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

It has a long history of use for the  treatment of opioid dependence in adults. Methadone suppresses  withdrawal symptoms during detoxification therapy, which involves  stabilizing patients who are addicted to opioids by withdrawing them in  a controlled manner. Methadone also controls the craving for opioids  during maintenance therapy, which is ongoing therapy meant to  prevent relapse and increase treatment retention. Methadone can be  administered to patients as an oral solution or in tablet form.", "Buprenorphine: Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist, meaning it  binds to opioid receptors and activates them, but not to the same  degree as full opioid agonists. It reduces or eliminates opioid  withdrawal symptoms, including drug cravings. It can be used for  detoxification treatment and maintenance therapy. It is available for  MAT for opioid use disorder in tablet form for sublingual (under the  tongue) administration, in film form for sublingual or buccal (inside the  cheek) administration, and as a subdermal (under the skin) implant.", "Naltrexone: Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist, meaning it binds to  opioid receptors but does not activate them. It is used for relapse  prevention following complete detoxification from opioids. Naltrexone  prevents opioid drugs from binding to and activating opioid receptors,  thus blocking the euphoria the user would normally feel.

Among other things, recipients are to use  outreach and other engagement activities to increase participation in  and access to MAT for diverse populations at risk for opioid use  disorders. In August 2015, SAMHSA awarded 3-year grants to 11  states, under which each of the states will receive up to $1 million in  each grant year. In September 2016, SAMHSA awarded 11 additional  3-year grants to other states. Total funding is expected to be up to  $66 million for all 22 grants.

As of August 2017,  these efforts were ongoing.", "In addition to these four grant programs, HHS\u2019s fifth key effort increases  treatment capacity by expanding the waivers that practitioners may  receive to prescribe buprenorphine. Specifically, SAMHSA issued a  regulation that became effective August 8, 2016 increasing the number of  patients that eligible practitioners can treat with buprenorphine outside of  an OTP (e.g., in an office-based setting). Previously, qualified  practitioners could request approval to treat up to 30 patients at a time,  and after 1 year the limit could increase to 100 patients at a time upon  SAMHSA approval. The new regulation expanded access to MAT by  allowing eligible practitioners who have had waivers to prescribe  buprenorphine to 100 patients for at least 1 year to request approval to  treat up to 275 patients thereafter. Similarly, SAMHSA has implemented  provisions of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016  (CARA) that expanded the types of practitioners who can receive a  waiver to prescribe buprenorphine in an office-based setting to include  qualifying nurse practitioners and physician assistants. CARA generally  requires that these nurse practitioners and physician assistants complete  24 hours of training to be eligible for a waiver. According to HHS  documents, as of early 2017, nurse practitioners and physician assistants  who have completed this training could request a waiver from SAMHSA  to treat up to 30 patients at a time.", "In addition to its five key efforts focused specifically on expanding access  to MAT for opioid use disorders, HHS has other efforts with broader  focuses, such as treating multiple types of substance abuse. While these  efforts are not specifically focused on expanding access to MAT for opioid  use disorders, they may result in expanded access to MAT. For example,  CMS has approved section 1115 Medicaid demonstration projects to  allow states to undertake comprehensive reforms of their delivery of  substance abuse services, including provisions to enhance the use of  MAT for opioid use disorders. In July 2015, CMS issued a state  Medicaid Director letter informing states that they may seek approval of  section 1115 demonstrations to undertake comprehensive substance use  service reforms. According to CMS, all participating states are using the  demonstration authority to develop a full continuum of care for individuals  with substance abuse disorders, including coverage of short-term  residential treatment services not otherwise covered by Medicaid.", "In addition, FDA has programs to help expedite development and to  provide for faster review of marketing applications for certain drugs.

For example, OTPs and  practitioners who request and receive a waiver to prescribe  buprenorphine to treat up to 275 patients outside of an OTP setting are  required under federal regulations to maintain a diversion control plan.  In addition, the MAT-PDOA grant program explicitly requires grant  recipients to implement a diversion control plan, though the other grant  programs do not have similar additional requirements. (See appendix I for  an overview of the diversion control plan requirements for OTPs and the  practitioners who prescribe buprenorphine outside of an OTP.) The 2016  Surgeon General\u2019s report on Alcohol, Drugs, and Health noted that  decades of research have shown that the benefits of MAT greatly  outweigh the risks associated with diversion, and that withholding these  medications greatly increases the risk of relapse to illicit opioid use and  overdose death."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS is Finalizing Its Approach for Evaluating MAT Expansion Efforts but Lacks Performance Measures with Targets and Implementation Timeframes", "paragraphs": ["HHS officials told us that as of August 2017, the department is in the  process of finalizing its approach for evaluating the implementation of its  agencies\u2019 collective efforts to address the opioid epidemic that were  undertaken as part of the HHS Opioid Initiative and will continue under  the new administration\u2019s Opioid Strategy. HHS officials provided a draft of  the evaluation\u2019s schedule. According to the officials, the evaluation will  include, but not be limited to, efforts to expand access to MAT.

The lack of such performance  measures with associated targets is inconsistent with federal internal  control standards that specify that management should define objectives  and evaluate results. According to these standards, using performance  information such as performance measures can help agencies monitor  results and determine progress in meeting program goals. In the context  of HHS\u2019s efforts to expand access to MAT, establishing appropriate  performance measures with associated targets would allow HHS to  determine whether its efforts are making sufficient progress or whether  they need to be improved. Gauging this progress is particularly important,  given the large nationwide MAT treatment gap identified in 2015 between  the total number of individuals who could benefit from MAT and the  limited number who can access it based on provider availability. This gap  was estimated at nearly 1 million people as of 2012, and according to  HHS officials and other stakeholders, lack of providers continues to be a  challenge.

Officials  from all five selected states told us that they are offering outreach to and  training for providers to help expand access to MAT. For example,  several state officials told us that they are promoting training to (1)  encourage physicians to obtain authorization (DATA 2000 waivers) to  prescribe buprenorphine and (2) encourage physicians with waivers to  treat patients up to their patient limit or to request a higher patient limit.", "According to the stakeholders, all five selected states have implemented  or are planning to implement a health care delivery model or approach  that will expand access to MAT. Specifically, these models or  approaches focus on integrating the use of MAT into primary care  settings. For example, health officials from three states described use of a  hub-and-spoke model. This model generally involves centralized intake  and initial management of patients at a \u201chub\u201d (e.g., an OTP) and then  connecting these patients to community providers at \u201cspokes\u201d (e.g.,  primary care clinics) for ongoing care, with ongoing support provided by  the hub as needed. Additionally, officials from two states described  offering remote MAT-related consultations through telehealth that  connects patients in rural areas with addiction specialists. According to  a 2017 Healthcare Fraud Prevention and Partnership whitepaper,  telehealth expands the reach of the addiction professional workforce and  the existing pool of MAT providers, and it supports remote forms of  behavioral therapy to make trained professionals more accessible to  those in underserved or isolated communities.", "Officials from three states described focusing their MAT expansion efforts  in various settings, such as in the criminal justice setting and emergency  room departments. State health officials from four of the five states told us  that programs in their states are using peer specialists (individuals who  have successfully recovered from substance abuse disorders) in  emergency rooms and other settings to engage with addicted patients  and refer them to addiction specialists or behavioral health counselors.  Officials from the selected states said that some of these and other efforts  are funded through federal sources, such as MAT expansion grants  awarded by SAMHSA, or with state funds to the extent they are available.", "Efforts by private health insurers. Officials from private health insurers  reported that they are expanding access to MAT through outreach or  training for providers and through the following three efforts:", "Eliminating the need for prior authorization to prescribe MAT  medications. Officials from three insurers reported removing prior  authorization requirements for MAT medications, thereby making it  easier for patients to access needed MAT medications more readily,  rather than undergoing a waiting period for approval to receive the  medications. Other private health insurers told us that they continue to  require prior authorization, intended for safety reasons and to reduce  drug misuse, and officials from one insurer told us that they will allow  a patient to access a limited amount of MAT medications for a period  of 24 to 72 hours while making a determination about the appropriate  treatment services for the patient.", "Modifying health benefit coverage. Officials from one private health  insurance plan told us that the company is redesigning the benefit  coverage for methadone and has removed member copays. This  effort is intended to make MAT medications more affordable and allow  members who are not able to use buprenorphine to have an  alternative, such as methadone, that is not cost-prohibitive.", "Incentivizing providers and health insurance plan members to use  MAT. Officials from four private health insurance plans described  plans to offer incentives to providers or patients to use MAT. For  example, officials from three health plans stated that they are offering  alternative payment models or paying higher rates to providers that  offer MAT, and another private health insurer is offering incentives to  its members who are enrolled in behavioral health programs that  provide access to MAT.", "Efforts by national associations. Officials we interviewed from the  national associations\u2014including the American Society of Addiction  Medicine, the National Governors Association, and the Association of  State and Territorial Health Officials\u2014told us that they are helping to  expand access to MAT through outreach and training for their members  and by developing tools and resource guides for their members. An  official from one association told us that it shares federal grant  announcements, including those that are focused on expanding access to  MAT, with its members. Officials from another association said it provides  training to providers on how to appropriately prescribe MAT medications.  In addition, officials from one association told us that they developed an  opioid-related road map that identifies examples of strategies\u2014including  MAT\u2014that state policymakers can use in their ongoing efforts to address  the opioid epidemic. Examples of strategies include reducing the stigma  associated with MAT through educating the public and potential  providers. Another strategy in the road map is changing payment policies  to expand access to MAT services, such as ensuring that Medicaid and  other state health programs adequately cover all MAT medications and  behavioral interventions and encouraging or requiring commercial health  plans to adopt similar policies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["HHS funds grant programs and has taken other steps to expand access  to MAT, which has been shown to be effective in reducing the prevalence  of opioid use disorders and with them, the likelihood of drug overdoses.
