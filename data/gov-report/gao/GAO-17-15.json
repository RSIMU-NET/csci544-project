Specifically, the DNP working system offers no access to the Social Security Administration's (SSA) prisoner records and partial access to the Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System and SSA's death records. The death records offered through the DNP working system do not include state-reported death data. SSA officials stated that sharing its full death file\u2014which includes state-reported death data\u2014would require an amendment to the Social Security Act. Sharing the full death file through the DNP working system would enhance efforts to identify and prevent improper payments.", "The 10 agencies GAO reviewed have used the DNP working system in limited ways, in part because of a lack of clear OMB strategy and guidance. The most common way these agencies used the DNP working system is through its payment integration process, whereby Treasury compares disbursements it makes with DNP databases. However, Treasury matches against only two databases, and because the matching is performed simultaneously with disbursement, agencies generally do not receive the results in time to prevent improper payments. Further, because the payment integration process is built into Treasury's payment process, it does not compare payments disbursed through other means, such as payments made by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service ($477 billion in fiscal year 2015). OMB and Treasury guidance do not fully address the limitations of the payment integration process or whether its use is required. Aside from payment integration, 6 of the 10 agencies GAO reviewed used the DNP working system in limited ways, and 9 of the 10 agencies used some of the databases outside the DNP working system. OMB has not developed a strategy or communicated through guidance how it expects agencies to use the DNP working system. As a result, agencies may not effectively and efficiently use the system to help reduce improper payments.", "Although OMB collects certain information about the use of the DNP working system, it has not developed monitoring mechanisms, such as goals or performance measures. Reported savings from use of the DNP working system have been minimal. OMB reported that the overall DNP Initiative (which encompasses the DNP working system and other agency-specific efforts) prevented over $2 billion in improper payments in fiscal year 2014, but none of these savings resulted from use of the DNP working system. Further, while OMB has not reported on fiscal year 2015 results, the 24 Chief Financial Officers Act agencies reported about $680,000 in improper payments prevented through use of the system in fiscal year 2015. However, GAO identified instances in which such agency-reported information was not consistent with reports generated by the system. Without monitoring mechanisms and reliable data, OMB cannot effectively evaluate the DNP working system or identify and address performance issues."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider amending the Social Security Act to allow SSA to share its full death file through the DNP working system.

Treasury  officials stated that Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System  (CAIVRS) data inputs from the Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and  Education (Education) are not currently available through the DNP  working system because of delays in negotiating MOUs with these  agencies and revising SORNs.

Although Treasury continues to work with relevant  agencies, until access to all of the required databases is offered,  agencies may face a higher risk of not preventing or identifying improper  payments, particularly those to prisoners and individuals that are  delinquent on federal nontax debt.", "Further, Treasury has not obtained SSA\u2019s more complete death records  for the DNP working system. SSA shares two sets of death data: its full  death file and DMF. DMF is a subset of the full death file, as it contains  about 10 percent fewer death records than the full death file and does not  include state-reported death data. Initially, IPERIA listed DMF as a  required database for the DNP working system. FIPCA amended IPERIA  by replacing the reference to DMF with \u201cdeath records maintained by the  Commissioner of Social Security.\u201d SSA officials stated that the Social  Security Act limits sharing of SSA\u2019s full death file to federal benefit-paying  agencies, which does not include the DNP working system. These  officials stated that the Social Security Act would need to be amended to  allow the agency to share its full death file with Treasury for the DNP  working system. The President\u2019s Budget for fiscal year 2017 included a  proposal for such an amendment, but no amendment providing this  authority has been enacted. Consequently, the DNP working system  offers access to only DMF and not the full death file.", "In November 2013, we reported that SSA\u2019s processes for collecting and  maintaining death reports could result in untimely or erroneous death  information, such as including living individuals or not including deceased  individuals. For example, we identified about 500 instances in which  death reports submitted to SSA in early 2013 listed dates of death in 2011  or earlier. This is of concern because\u2014if the dates of death are  accurate\u2014SSA and other agencies may have been at risk of paying  benefits to these individuals for long periods after they died. We also  reported that SSA\u2019s Office of Inspector General found that data for about  182,000 deceased Supplemental Security Income recipients and about  1.2 million deceased Old Age and Survivors Insurance beneficiaries were  not included in SSA\u2019s death data. To help improve the accuracy of its  death data, we recommended that SSA conduct a risk assessment and  assess the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of addressing various types  of errors given the risk they pose. We found that since fiscal year 2014,  SSA has been taking steps to redesign how the agency processes death  reports and compiles data for dissemination. As part of that redesign,  SSA completed a risk assessment and a data quality assessment in June  2014. SSA has completed the first two phases of its redesign project and  developed a business process description for the third phase. According  to SSA, the agency is taking care to ensure that improvements made to  the death data processing system are cost-effective. Although we have  not assessed the extent to which SSA\u2019s efforts have improved the quality  of its death data, we are encouraged that SSA plans to continue the  redesign project in future years. SSA\u2019s efforts will be critical to addressing  the risk of errors in its death data. However, it is important to note that  SSA does not guarantee the accuracy of the death information it provides  to agencies. SSA reported that users of its death data must agree to  independently verify the information before taking action based on an  individual\u2019s death report. Such verification\u2014if completed\u2014should help  reduce the effect of erroneous death data.", "While there is a continued need for SSA to address the risk of errors in its  death data, sharing the full death file through the DNP working system  would provide agencies with additional information and enhance efforts to  identify and prevent improper payments to deceased individuals.

While Treasury\u2019s Do Not Pay Agency Implementation Guide states  that payment integration matching happens at the time of payment,  the agencies we reviewed reported inconsistent interpretations of the  timing of the process. Because the guide is not clear that the results  are generally received after payments have been made, about half of  the agencies we reviewed considered the payment integration  process to be a prepayment function, whereas others considered it to  be a postpayment activity.
