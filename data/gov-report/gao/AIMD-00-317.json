CMB began operations in June 1998 to monitor the 2000 Census conducted by the Bureau of the Census, an entity within the Department of Commerce. The CMB board consists of four members appointed by the Speaker of the House and the Senate Majority Leader and four members appointed by the President.Both sides operate autonomously, have separate offices, executive directors and staff, and contract separately for legal, consultant, and other services. The combined CMB disbursed about $7.4 million from June 1998 through March 31, 2000, from its appropriated funds, and another $0.5 million from the Congressional Printing and Binding appropriation.", "As you requested, we obtained and reviewed information on seven specific matters contained in your requests; conducted an audit relating to all CMB out-of-town travel disbursements and all other financial transactions over $200 from CMB\u2019s inception in June 1998 through March 31, 2000, which resulted in our auditing about 98 percent of the dollar value of total CMB disbursements; reviewed CMB financial policies and practices, the internal control environments, and specific internal controls over disbursements, including those related to travel, personnel, and procurement of services; and identified and disclosed related-party transactions that met the criteria you asked us to use.", "We did not evaluate the program effectiveness of CMB, as we focused on auditing its financial activities. We performed our work from April 2000 through August 2000 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Appendix II contains further details of our scope and methodology. We requested comments on a draft of this report from CMB and the Government Printing Office. Their written responses are presented in appendixes IV and V, respectively, and are discussed in the \u201cAgency comments and Our Evaluation\u201d section."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["CMB was established by the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and the Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998.CMB\u2019s function is to observe and monitor all aspects of the Bureau of the Census\u2019 preparation and implementation of the 2000 Census. CMB is also to promote the 2000 Census by encouraging the public to provide full and timely responses to census questionnaires.", "The legislation establishing CMB did not define its status or, with a few exceptions, specify laws that would govern its operations. In our opinion, supported by substantial precedent on similarly established boards and commissions, CMB is an agency in the legislative branch and is subject to laws generally applicable to the legislative branch except to the extent that provisions of law provide otherwise. See appendix III for further discussion.", "CMB held its first meeting on June 3, 1998, and thereafter began disbursing funds by hiring staff, locating and renovating office space, obtaining equipment and furniture, and creating a new organization from the ground up. The board consists of two members appointed by the Speaker of the House and two members by the Senate Majority Leader (the congressional CMB) and four members appointed by the President (the presidential CMB), with each side having a co-chairman. Board members are not entitled to pay for serving on the board but are entitled to reimbursement for travel expenses, including per diem when on official board business. The congressional and presidential CMB hired an executive director and staff and contracted for legal, consultant, and other services.", "CMB met with Bureau of the Census officials in Suitland, Maryland, and visited many of the local census offices, which are in every congressional district in the United States. In addition to reviewing bureau plans to conduct the census and efforts to improve enumeration techniques, CMB held joint hearings in Washington and across the country. CMB obtained testimony from Bureau of the Census officials, state and local officials, and community leaders to record their observations regarding Census 2000 efforts in their areas.", "In January 1999, the Supreme Court held that existing law did not authorize the use of statistical sampling for apportionment purposes.Subsequently, CMB focused on an outreach program with state and local governments and community groups to identify concerns and obstacles in obtaining an accurate and complete census. A particular concern is the widely acknowledged historical undercounting of rural populations and inner city minorities. CMB findings are presented in periodic reports to the Congress, of which six have been issued, the most recent on April 1, 2000.", "CMB received appropriations of $4 million for fiscal year 1998, $4 million for fiscal year 1999, and $3.5 million for fiscal year 2000. Each appropriation is available until expended. The CMB board allocated the congressional and presidential CMB $1.5 million each annually, with the balance allocated to a joint account to pay common expenses. As of March 31, 2000, the board employed 17 congressional and 14 presidential CMB staff. In addition, CMB legislation provides that it is considered a committee of the Congress for purposes of having CMB costs relating to printing and binding paid from the Congressional Printing and Binding appropriation.", "CMB entered into an interagency agreement with the Government Printing Office (GPO) for GPO to pay CMB\u2019s bills and provide payroll, procurement, and travel services. GPO provides a monthly report of CMB disbursements for the congressional, presidential, and joint accounts. GPO charges $1,000 annually to each side for payroll processing and a fee of 6 percent of noninventory purchases. However, this agreement did not relieve the congressional and presidential CMB of the responsibility to maintain an adequate system of internal controls, approve disbursements in accordance with established polices and procedures, and maintain documentation to support disbursements. CMB legislation did not require (1) annual financial statement or internal control audits or (2) inspector general oversight to conduct audits and investigations as needed or requested.", "The General Services Administration (GSA), in coordination with the Department of Commerce, was responsible for providing office space for CMB at the Bureau of the Census complex in Suitland, Maryland. CMB\u2019s enabling legislation provides that it shall cease to exist on September 30, 2001."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Seven Specific Matters", "paragraphs": ["The following are our findings for the seven specific matters, which are presented as questions with responses. 1. Were presidential CMB funds used to print reports for the 1998 World Exposition?", "Our review of presidential CMB disbursements over $200 did not identify any documented evidence that presidential CMB funds were used to pay for printing reports for the 1998 World Exposition in Lisbon, Portugal.", "The former presidential CMB co-chairman and the presidential CMB executive director had been former U.S. pavilion officials at the 1998 World Exposition immediately before coming to CMB. The presidential CMB executive director provided invoices from a commercial business that printed the 1998 World Exposition reports at a total cost of $4,538. Initially, the presidential CMB executive director paid $1,369 of the invoices by personal check. He was later reimbursed for this amount by personal check of the former presidential CMB co-chairman, who paid the remaining $3,169 by personal check directly to the printer. 2. Did congressional CMB videotapes have a narrow political distribution and did internal controls exist over the use of copyrighted material?", "We found no documented evidence that congressional CMB videotapes produced had a narrow political distribution. We identified nine video productions with over 4,300 copies that were widely distributed to nonprofit organizations, community groups, and units of state and local government. This wide distribution included about 1,200 copies of a video on census undercounts entitled \u201cOn Every Street\u201d featuring the congressional CMB co- chairman. While some copies of this tape were labeled \u201cFor Republican Mayors,\u201d the distribution was far wider and included community groups and others noted above.", "We found that no CMB controls existed over the use of copyrighted material because CMB had not contemplated such a use. However, the congressional CMB did obtain a written release from a recording company for the use of background music for a videotape production. This release, however, was obtained after the fact. 3. Were congressional and presidential CMB travel funds used in connection with political events?", "We found no documented evidence that CMB funds were used for political travel. Through March 31, 2000, we found the following: The congressional CMB co-chairman, who lives in Ohio, took 36 trips, including 15 to CMB offices in Suitland, Maryland, for CMB business. The remaining 21 trips to various locations throughout the country were to attend board meetings, conduct field hearings, attend conferences, meet with local government and community leaders, and participate in other CMB events.", "The former presidential CMB co-chairman took two trips, one to South Carolina and another to California, to conduct CMB field hearings. We noted that he did not claim reimbursement for all presidential CMB travel taken, although entitled to reimbursement.", "CMB staff took 2 trips to New Hampshire and 10 trips to Arizona. All trips had a stated CMB purpose to meet with local officials or to attend conferences. There was no travel to Iowa. During the 2 months before the early presidential primaries in these three states, a congressional CMB employee traveled to Arizona to meet with area complete-count committees several weeks before the Arizona democratic primary. 4. Were four presidential CMB contracts for studies on census undercounting properly procured?", "We found no evidence to indicate that four presidential CMB contracts to conduct studies on census undercounting were improperly procured. The presidential CMB followed the joint CMB procurement policy for four separate contracts totaling $251,000 for studies of census undercounting.", "The four separate presidential CMB contracts were as follows: In the summer of 1999, the presidential CMB prepared a request for proposal for an analysis of how a 2000 census undercount could affect federal funding allocations to the 50 states over the next decade. The cost of this effort was estimated to be under $150,000, which, under the CMB joint policy for procurement of temporary or intermittent services, requires that three bids be obtained with an effort to award contracts to small businesses. Due to the type of work required, three nationally known consultants were contacted. Two firms submitted written proposals, and the lowest bid, $140,000, was selected. This work was completed in November 1999 with a briefing.", "The contractor proposed a second analysis to estimate funding distortions at a cost of $50,000, which was under the $75,000 CMB policy for a sole-source procurement. The cost was later amended and increased to $70,000 because the Bureau of the Census released new data requiring recalculations. A written report was delivered by December 31, 1999.", "The contractor then proposed a third analysis of funding distortions at a cost of $30,000, which CMB agreed would be efficient to perform based on work already done. For efficiency, the results of this effort were incorporated into the written report of the second analysis.", "Finally, the contractor provided an Internet version of the study at a cost of $6,000 and printed copies at a cost of $5,000.", "There is no indication that CMB anticipated having the second and third analyses performed when the first analysis was competitively awarded. 5. Were protected census data accessed by two former congressional CMB employees?", "We found no evidence that two former congressional CMB employees accessed confidential census data protected by Title 13, U.S. Code.All CMB employees take an oath not to disclose Title 13 information. The two former employees involved stated that their former jobs as CMB counsel and director of outreach, respectively, gave them no reason to access Title 13 data and that they had not seen any such data during their time at CMB. We obtained Bureau of the Census control logs, maintained in date order, of all CMB requests for documents including Title 13 protected data. Bureau of the Census officials identified only the two following occasions in which Title 13 data were provided to the congressional CMB before the two staff left in September 1999 to work for the Republican National Committee on redistricting issues.", "On December 11, 1998, the congressional CMB requested a Post Enumeration Study (PES) of the 1990 Census, which included Title 13 data. However, the files were incorrect when initially provided in April 1999, and the congressional CMB immediately returned the data for correction. The corrected files were provided to the congressional CMB in November 1999, 2 months after the two employees left.", "On June 24, 1999, the congressional CMB requested Title 13 data for Integrated Coverage Measurement and PES operations for six blocks in Sacramento, California, and Columbia, South Carolina. The data were provided to the congressional CMB in August 1999, 1 month before the two employees left. These data were in preparation for a dress rehearsal comparing the 2000 Census to the 1990 Census, which according to congressional CMB officials did not involve the two former employees. 6. Were questions about political parties asked in a congressional CMB contractor focus study?", "We found that 2 of 27 questions in a congressional CMB contractor focus group study mentioned political parties. In April 1999, the congressional CMB hired a contractor to conduct focus groups on hard-to-count minorities in the nation\u2019s largest public housing project in Chicago, Illinois. Two groups of 13 residents by gender were asked the same 27 questions over 2 hours to learn their attitudes and perceptions about the census. Both sessions were videotaped, and each resident received $50 to participate. \u201cThere are some members of the U.S. Congress who believe using people like you to help with the census count is the better way. Tell me who do you think these people might be: Democrat or Republican members of Congress?\u201d \u201cNow if I say to you the people who believe it\u2019s better to employ you to help with the census are Republicans, what do you think?\u201d", "According to congressional CMB officials, these two questions were asked to determine how minority views of political parties affected current efforts by both parties to improve census undercounts. 7. Was there a verbal confrontation by a congressional CMB contractor, and how was the matter subsequently resolved?", "We found some evidence of a verbal confrontation between a congressional CMB contractor and Bureau of the Census employees in a local census office (LCO).", "CMB employees and contractors made numerous LCO visits as part of the CMB mission to monitor the 2000 Census and to identify potential problems and issues to bring to the attention of the Bureau of the Census. A congressional CMB contractor met with LCO officials during a March 22, 2000, visit to obtain information on census activities. In his report, the contractor, a former criminal investigator, observed that during a 3-hour interview, the local manager appeared evasive in responding to his questions, with repeated looks at the two area managers who were present. The contractor stated that he asked the managers to provide honest answers to his questions and, if they did not, it may not look good later. Words to that effect were also confirmed by a detailed e-mail of the visit by the LCO area manager, who referred to the 3 hours of detailed questions as \u201ca deposition that was relatively painless, but extremely taxing.\u201d", "The congressional CMB and the contractor mutually terminated their agreement effective 14 days after the visit due to a variety of reasons, including the LCO visit. Shortly thereafter, the congressional CMB adopted a conduct policy for field visits. LCO managers prepare brief reports on CMB visits and the Bureau of the Census chief of field decennial oversight and communications indicated that there were no further incidents regarding CMB visits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMB Disbursements", "paragraphs": ["The vast majority of CMB disbursements were supported and related to official business.However, we could not evaluate about $119,000 of disbursements, all but about $1,000 of which were the presidential CMB\u2019s. This was because the presidential CMB could not provide adequate supporting documentation.", "CMB disbursed about $7.4 million from June 1998 through March 31, 2000, from its appropriated funds plus another $0.5 million from the Congressional Printing and Binding appropriation. As shown in table 1, about half of these disbursements were for personnel compensation and benefits, with the balance for services and travel.", "The congressional and presidential CMB each received $1.5 million annually and spent their appropriations differently. The congressional CMB employed five field staff and, accordingly, spent more than the presidential CMB on personnel. It also spent more on travel because of an outreach program with local census offices, state and local governments, and community groups. The presidential CMB spent more on contractors, including about $251,000 for four studies on census undercounting."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMB Financial Policies, Procedures, and Internal Controls", "paragraphs": ["The various financial policies, procedures, and practices CMB adopted did not always form a system of internal control adequate for guiding operations, safeguarding assets, and assuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We found specific internal control weaknesses in three main areas: travel, personnel, and the procurement of services. Some of these weaknesses allowed a number of inappropriate and wasteful practices, and two policies were inconsistent with federal law."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Travel", "paragraphs": ["CMB is subject to the Federal Travel Regulations applicable to federal employees of most agencies.We found several significant departures from these regulations particularly for the presidential CMB that included inappropriate use of government credit cards, ineligible travel expenses (such as charges for family member lodging), and no written authorizations to travel. These problems resulted in part from ineffective or missing internal controls over travel."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Government Credit Card Usage", "paragraphs": ["Internal controls over the use, payment, and monitoring of credit cards for official government travel were absent, leading to some abuses by both sides of CMB. Based on CMB requisitions, GPO issued these cards to selected CMB board members and employees, who are personally responsible for their prompt payment and use for official purposes under the master agreement between the credit card company and GSA which represents the federal government. The joint CMB travel policy specifies how government travel credit cards are to be used and that delinquencies are to be monitored by the executive directors.", "We found that several employees did not pay amounts when due, resulting in accounts up to 7 months in arrears. Payment delays can cost the government revenue under the master agreement.Cardholder accounts for one congressional CMB employee and one presidential CMB employee totaling over $5,000 were written off by the credit card company even though, from the start of the CMB through March 31, 2000, the two employees were each reimbursed over $11,000 for travel expenses. While the congressional CMB employee\u2019s balance remains unpaid and she is in the process of establishing a repayment agreement, the presidential CMB employee paid her entire amount due by April 2000.", "Government credit cards are to be used only for expenses incurred in conjunction with official travel, a restriction that was included in the CMB joint travel policy. However, we noted over $7,500 of improper charges by two presidential CMB employees. This included the executive director from August 1998 into January 1999 and the same presidential CMB employee whose charges in June 1999 were later written off by the credit card company. Both employees used the card for personal expenses such as (1) hotel rooms while on annual leave, (2) local restaurants, (3) clothing stores, (4) mail order businesses, or (5) amusement park admission. On January 6, 1999, the former presidential CMB director of operations noted the abuses listed above and informed the presidential CMB executive director. On January 8, 1999, the presidential CMB executive director\u2019s credit card was canceled.", "From July 1999 through July 2000, the presidential CMB executive director improperly used three other employees\u2019 government credit cards for CMB business charges and for about $4,500 for personal travel and local restaurant bills. The presidential CMB executive director promptly paid these charges and the charges to his own credit cards and did not seek reimbursement from CMB for personal charges. However, this use violates the cardholder agreements and CMB\u2019s joint travel policy, which states that the card may be used only by the cardholder."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Ineligible Travel Charges", "paragraphs": ["We found several other ineligible travel charges relating to the presidential CMB.", "Lodging costs were left on a government travel credit card of a presidential CMB employee who had reserved hotel rooms on behalf of a presidential CMB board member and his staff and family for two trips to Washington, D.C., in March 2000. These costs, totaling $5,882, were paid for by CMB and included $1,708 for six nights for a second hotel room and other charges for the board member\u2019s family. In addition, for the same trip, this board member erroneously received a separate reimbursement of $1,346 in May of 2000 from CMB (approved by the executive director) for the hotel and telephone calls that had been paid for by the CMB employee who made the reservations. CMB reimbursed that employee and, after we discovered these errors, billed the board member. On August 28, 2000, CMB was paid for both the erroneous reimbursement and family charges. According to CMB and the board member\u2019s staff, these errors were the result of a misunderstanding, and the board member was not aware of the errors.", "In two instances, a presidential CMB employee charged hotel restaurant bills to her room and obtained reimbursement for the entire hotel bill in addition to requesting full per diem for meals. In another instance, this same employee paid for a meal for 10 individuals and charged the cost to her hotel bill. The employee obtained reimbursement for the entire hotel bill and also requested a separate reimbursement for the meal. The above errors resulted in an overpayment of $402 to the employee, which we brought to the attention of the presidential CMB. The employee reimbursed CMB with two separate checks in August 2000.", "Inappropriate usage of credit cards and an ineffective review of these disbursements contributed to these ineligible expenses not being detected."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Travel Authorizations", "paragraphs": ["For the presidential CMB, we found no evidence of authority to travel. According to the presidential CMB executive director, such approvals were oral. This practice is contrary to the CMB joint travel policy which requires that a written memo or CMB travel order (1) be issued before any expenses are incurred, (2) specify the points of travel, purpose, and estimated costs, and (3) be signed by the executive director. This practice is also contrary to the StandardsforInternalControlinthe FederalGovernment, which emphasizes that appropriate authorization of transactions is needed to ensure that only valid transactions occur. The lack of written authorization increases the risk of transactions that improperly commit government resources. Further, for the presidential CMB, we found two trips taken by individuals that were not CMB board members, employees, consultants, or witnesses that were not approved in advance in writing by the co-chairman as required by the joint travel policy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Travel Advances and Reimbursements", "paragraphs": ["For the presidential CMB, we found that some travel advances were outstanding from 1 to 3 months before a trip was taken, and travel reimbursement requests were frequently submitted over 30 days after the trip was completed. Specifically The presidential CMB executive director received most of the advances on the presidential CMB after his government credit card was canceled. Two of the advances (one to the executive director for $750 and another to an employee for $500) were provided for trips that were canceled. In both instances, CMB was not repaid until 2 months later.", "In June 1999, another employee had a travel advance for $357 that exceeded trip expenses by $56 that had not been repaid until we noted it. The employee repaid CMB in August 2000.", "The congressional CMB provided two travel advances to individuals invited to attend an undercount summit. The congressional CMB did not require these two individuals to submit travel expense reports when their travel was completed, nor were they required to submit receipts. As a result, these two travel advances of $199 each remain unliquidated.", "The CMB joint travel policy provided no guidance on travel advances and their timely liquidation. If the advance is not paid back promptly and the trip was not taken, advances result in an interest free loan and a potential lack of accountability over assets, as discussed in Standards forInternalControlintheFederalGovernment. Additionally, CMB joint travel policy states that reimbursements requests \u201cshould be submitted as soon as possible following the completion of a trip.\u201d However, the policy does not specify any maximum number of days for doing this, resulting in untimely execution of transactions and outdated financial information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Personal Side Travel", "paragraphs": ["For the congressional CMB, we found personal side trips that were inconsistent with the joint travel policy. While the policy allows personal side trips, employees may not use a government travel request form or government credit card to pay for transportation, and a government rate may not be not be used for travel expenses. Contrary to this policy, the congressional CMB allowed employees to make personal side trips at government rates while traveling on official business as long as they (1) prepared an analysis showing that the total airfare, including the personal side trip, did not exceed the airfare of the official trip and (2) obtained advance permission from the executive director.", "We identified one employee who took 27 personal side trips.Also, contrary to the CMB joint travel policy, a government credit card was improperly used to pay for the trips at a government rate. Further, the employee prepared the above analysis and obtained executive director approval in advance for only 11 of these trips.

While the policy states that official use is encouraged, it is unclear whether personal use of these awards is prohibited.

Although the congressional and presidential CMB adopted policies and procedures for personnel, we noted instances in which they were not followed or areas where internal controls were weak."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Time and Attendance", "paragraphs": ["For both sides, we found employees arriving late and leaving early, inaccurate annual leave accounting, and sick leave and other leave issues.", "In Part I of its policy manuals, CMB adopted official office hours of Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. with 1 hour for lunch, resulting in an 8-hour workday. However, during the 10 weeks we were at CMB, from June through August 2000, we observed and were told in at least five employee interviews that CMB personnel frequently arrived late and left early without charging leave. On many days, the building services staff opened the office for us at 8:30 a.m., and usually only a few employees remained at 5:30 p.m. For example, we observed one employee who arrived after 10 a.m. and left before 5 p.m. on many occasions. This practice, which results in less than 8 hours worked, violated CMB policy manuals and does not exemplify good management of human capital.", "A contributing factor to this problem is that CMB staff are not required to maintain time sheets, and all salaried employees are presumed to have worked 80 hours in a biweekly pay period unless they inform their supervisor otherwise. Time sheets would have greatly increased accountability. An employee\u2019s signature on a time sheet attests that his or her time and attendance is correct, and a supervisor\u2019s signature attests to a review and approval.", "We found weak internal controls and poor accounting by CMB regarding annual leave. The CMB jointly adopted the federal government policy on earning and taking annual leave in accordance with the Annual and Sick Leave Act.GPO records annual leave information that is provided monthly by CMB. However, we found that CMB was not reconciling its leave records with GPO. Prudent financial management practices call for an entity to reconcile its balances monthly. With timely reconciliations, the following differences could have been detected and corrected earlier.", "For congressional CMB employees, GPO records show charges of annual leave usage of three employees that were 24 hours (7 percent) less than that on CMB\u2019s records, and charges of three employees were 40 hours (15 percent) more when compared to CMB\u2019s records.", "For the presidential CMB, GPO records show charges of annual leave usage of 14 employees that were 566 hours (31 percent) less than those on CMB\u2019s records, and charges of 3 employees that were 40 hours (13 percent) more when compared to CMB\u2019s records.", "For many presidential CMB employees, we found long time lags between when annual leave was taken and when GPO records reflected that fact because CMB did not promptly provide information to GPO. Moreover, GPO provided an annual printout of leave balances for reconciling purposes, but we found the above errors had not been detected or corrected by CMB.", "Leave accounting problems contributed to errors in several final paychecks for employees departing CMB, including the following.", "A former congressional CMB employee, who had been advanced 4 hours of annual leave, left CMB without having $142 appropriately deducted from her final paycheck.", "Two former presidential CMB employees who had been advanced 28 hours and 12 hours of annual leave left CMB without having $470 and $258, respectively, appropriately deducted from their final pay, while another employee was not paid $633 for unused annual leave.", "The operating environment was conducive to taking but not charging annual leave. Although we could not determine the extent to which this was occurring, we did identify two instances when staff were on personal business and did not charge annual leave: For the congressional CMB, one employee had taken 27 personal side trips in connection with official travel (discussed earlier in this report); during these personal trips, there were 8 workdays for which no leave was recorded on the office records. Later, the CMB comptroller informed us that 7 of those workdays should have been recorded as personal leavedays and 1 day should have been charged as annual leave.", "For the presidential CMB, we found that the executive director was frequently out of town on non-CMB business that included 29 trips to Tampa, Florida. According to the presidential CMB executive director and other evidence obtained, these trips were primarily to care for a family member. For these trips, we identified 12-1/2 days that were not charged to leave. Later, the executive director represented to us that 8 days should have been recorded for family sick leave, 1 day for personal leave he awarded himself, and 3-1/2 days as annual leave. On September 20, 2000, the presidential CMB provided adjustments to GPO to correct the executive director\u2019s leave records, leaving him with a negative leave balance of 4 hours.", "CMB adopted an unlimited sick leave policy that was not consistent with federal law. Under the Annual and Sick Leave Act, a federal employee is entitled to sick leave with pay that accrues on the basis of one-half day for each full biweekly pay period. Unused sick leave accumulates for future use. The statute establishing CMB does not exclude CMB from the Annual and Sick Leave Act. The act has long been applied to employees of temporary commissions in the legislative branch whose members are appointed by the President and members of Congress. Therefore, the executive directors and the employees they appoint are subject to the Annual and Sick Leave Act and its sick leave provisions.", "In addition, we found extensive use of sick leave in the presidential CMB. Its average recorded usage of sick leave for calendar year 1999 was 17.8 days, which is 4.8 more days than an employee accrues in a year. Although we could not determine the number of sick days, if any, that were not recorded, we were told in employee interviews that many presidential CMB staff members were frequently out sick.", "Two Extra Holidays. CMB granted two federal holidays in addition to those authorized by law. Federal law provides for 10 named annual federal holidays.Part II of the CMB policy manuals approved by the board on November 23, 1998, lists the federal holidays that CMB will observe. While that list includes the 10 holidays prescribed by federal law, it adds the day after Thanksgiving and the day before Christmas as paid federal holidays.", "Personal Leave. CMB adopted a policy allowing personal days off, or personal leave, at the discretion of each executive director, to compensate employees for extra hours worked.While this policy is reasonable in substance, we found several examples in which there was inadequate documentation over the granting of personal leave.", "One congressional CMB employee was awarded a total of 23 personal leave days during 1998 and 1999 as compensation for travel days occurring on weekends. However, as previously discussed (see \u201cAnnual Leave Accounting\u201d), this individual had also taken 27 personal side trips while on CMB business travel and, as discussed below, had been inappropriately awarded military leave. Another congressional CMB employee was awarded a total of 18 personal leave days during 1998 and 1999. We found minimal documented justification for these two individuals to receive the substantial number of personal leave days that they were awarded.", "In addition, the presidential CMB executive director granted himself 7 days of personal leave during 1998 and did not justify in writing any corresponding time worked. This included December 30, 1998, when he called the CMB office from Florida while on non-CMB business to close the office for New Year\u2019s Eve, thus granting himself an additional personal leave day rather than charging annual leave. Presidential CMB leave records did not show the granting of a personal day for December 31, 1998, for any employees.", "Military Leave. A congressional CMB employee, who was a member of the Naval Reserve, attended reserve unit inactive duty training before October 5, 1999, for which CMB granted him 8 days of paid military leave from his CMB position, as well as 2 personal days.Both CMB policy manuals provide for military leave by stating that staff members on active duty are allowed paid military leave that does not count against annual leave, which is consistent with federal law. However, since this duty was inactiveduty training, the employee was not entitled to military leave for these days and should have charged annual leave or leave without pay under CMB policy and federal law.Effective October 5, 1999, federal law was changed to allow inactive duty as an authorized use of military leave."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Payroll and Benefits Reconciliation", "paragraphs": ["CMB relied on GPO to correctly pay employees, calculate fringe benefits, and charge expenses incurred to CMB\u2019s appropriation without comparing this activity to its own records.

However, in our opinion, CMB is an agency in the legislative branch and is subject to laws generally applicable to the legislative branch, unless a provision of law specifically provides otherwise. The legislation establishing CMB did not define its status or, with a few exceptions, specify laws that would generally govern its operations. With respect to certain administrative matters, CMB adopted policies that were not consistent with the laws generally applicable to agencies of either the executive or legislative branch.", "The verbatim minutes of the first CMB board meeting consistently reflect the view that CMB is not wholly within the executive or legislative branch and that some issues may result from the board being \u201cin the middle somewhere.\u201d For example, in discussing a code of conduct for board members, the board was described as \u201ca hybrid, in some respects, it acts like an executive branch agency, and for others, like a congressional agency.\u201d CMB minutes indicate that questions as to the application of federal law would be addressed case by case. However, as the board adopted policies governing administrative matters, such as leave and travel, we found no legal analysis supporting departures from the laws generally applicable to agencies of either the executive or legislative branches. Further, we have received no evidence from CMB that reflects a clear view of its legal status and what laws would generally govern its operations.", "As a federal governmental entity, CMB must be in either the executive or legislative branch.Because congressional leaders appoint some CMB board members and CMB reports to the Congress and exercises no executive or regulatory functions, CMB is not an entity in the executive branch.Further, there is ample legal precedent for considering entities like CMB to be in the legislative branch. For example, we concluded that the National Commission on Air Quality, which had presidential and congressional members and whose function was to study and report to the Congress, was in the legislative branch.Similarly, in a January 2, 1999, opinion, the Office of Legal Counsel, Department of Justice, concluded that the National Gambling Impact Study Commission, an entity similar to CMB, was part of the legislative branch. Even when the President appointed all members of a commission, we concluded that the commission was in the legislative branch if the commission had no executive powers and its only functions were to study and report to the Congress.Accordingly, we conclude that CMB is an agency of the legislative branch."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Census Monitoring Board", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on CMB\u2019s letter dated September 22, 2000."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1. We disagree with the presidential CMB executive director that the charges to the executive assistant\u2019s government travel card were properly reconciled and paid. We found that charges for lodging of a presidential CMB board member\u2019s family and an erroneous reimbursement of travel expenses to that board member resulted in part because of weak reconciliation of credit card usage. These charges were all made to the executive assistant\u2019s government credit card and were approved for payment by the presidential CMB executive director. These inappropriate charges to the federal government were found as a result of our audit rather than being detected by the presidential CMB reconciliation or other internal controls.", "Additionally, the presidential CMB states that the individual\u2019s credit card was utilized for simplicity sake, this practice is contrary to the agreement with the federal government\u2019s credit card issuer and the CMB joint travel policy which states that only the cardholder may use the card. Presidential CMB staff were placed in the difficult position of being personally liable for charges that others incurred to their federal account. This situation, coupled with a late reimbursement by the presidential CMB, caused the executive assistant\u2019s account to be delinquent and subsequently cancelled by the credit card company with a potentially adverse effect on her personal credit rating. 2. We disagree that $4,000 of the $4,500 of personal charges by the presidential CMB executive director was mistakenly put on an office MasterCard instead of a personal MasterCard last winter. This amount relates to hotel bills charged to his executive assistant\u2019s government credit card in March 2000 while the presidential CMB executive director was on leave in Florida. These charges were part of a pattern of inappropriate personal use by the presidential CMB executive director of his own and three other employees\u2019 government credit cards over a span of nearly 2 years. After his government credit card was cancelled, the presidential CMB executive director used three other employees\u2019 government credit cards for personal travel and local restaurant bills from March 2000 through July 2000. From interviews with the executive director, he had physical possession of the other employees\u2019 credit cards when he used them at local restaurants. Although these personal expenses were not charged to or reimbursed by CMB, we found that the inappropriate personal use was not a mistake. 3. The legal counsels for the congressional and presidential CMBs commented on the lack of clarity concerning CMB\u2019s entity status and refer to three letters on ethics issues to illustrate that lack of clarity. As this report discusses in appendix III, there is substantial legal precedent supporting the conclusion that CMB is a entity in the legislative branch. Further, we do not believe that the letters cited by the counsels contributed to a lack of clarity regarding CMB\u2019s entity status. In fact, the letter from the Office of Government Ethics states that CMB would appear to be a legislative branch entity. Further, the letters from the Senate Select Committee on Ethics and the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct each advised that CMB was not subject to the respective body\u2019s Code of Conduct for reasons unrelated to CMB entity status."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
