In early 1990, the Secretary of Energy announced several initiatives to address these concerns based on recommendations from a special panel of experts\u2014the Secretarial Panel for the Evaluation of Epidemiologic Research Activities. One of these initiatives was the development of a data base to store and retrieve data from DOE on the demographics, health, and exposure of its workers and the communities near its facilities. The data base, to be developed under the guidance of the National Academy of Sciences, was expected to be a valuable, comprehensive resource for those conducting long-term epidemiological and other health studies. For the first time in DOE\u2019s history, these data would be accessible to independent researchers.", "In 1992, DOE began releasing the data used in its past research on health effects to outside researchers through a system it called the Comprehensive Epidemiologic Data Resource (CEDR). However, you were concerned that this system was not as comprehensive as originally envisioned and might be of limited use. Consequently, you asked us to determine (1) whether the current system functions as the comprehensive repository of epidemiological data about DOE\u2019s workers and the communities surrounding the Department\u2019s facilities envisioned by the Secretarial Panel and the National Academy of Sciences and (2) whether it meets their intended objectives of accessibility and utility for outside researchers. You also asked us to determine DOE\u2019s future plans for this system."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Over the past 50 years, as a result of producing tens of thousands of nuclear weapons, DOE\u2019s facilities have also produced radioactive and other toxic substances that pose potential health threats to DOE\u2019s workers and the communities located nearby. These substances include the radionuclides uranium, plutonium, and cesium; toxic metals; organic solvents; and chlorinated hydrocarbons. Epidemiological research\u2014research on the incidence, distribution, and control of disease in a population\u2014provides a scientific evaluation of the health effects of exposing workers and the public to such potentially harmful materials. Such research uses health, exposure, environmental monitoring, and personnel records to analyze health effects and evaluate methods to protect people and prevent harm. As such, epidemiological research is essential to a comprehensive occupational and environmental health program.", "DOE and its predecessor agencies have a long history in epidemiological research, starting with studies of the survivors of the atom bomb. In the past, much of this research was conducted by DOE or its contractors in secret and concentrated on the correlation between the rates of cancer-related deaths of workers at DOE\u2019s nuclear weapons complex and their exposure to ionizing radiation. A number of separate mortality studies\u2014studies of death rates\u2014have been conducted on approximately 420,000 workers over the past 30 years. However, because the records that researchers needed to study the health effects of working in DOE\u2019s facilities were maintained differently at each facility and were difficult to locate, the types and quality of epidemiological research that could be conducted were limited. To alleviate these problems and facilitate epidemiological research on the health effects of exposure to radiation and other hazards, the Secretarial Panel recommended that DOE continue developing CEDR as a comprehensive repository of data on its workers.", "In addition, to break down what was perceived as \u201ca wall of secrecy\u201d and to help establish the credibility of and maintain independence in the conduct of DOE\u2019s epidemiological research, the Secretarial Panel recommended opening this research and its supporting data to external investigation and scrutiny. Among other things, the Secretarial Panel recommended that DOE execute a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), making HHS responsible for long-range, analytic epidemiological studies, while DOE remained responsible for descriptive epidemiology. As a result, much of the epidemiological research on DOE\u2019s facilities is now managed by HHS. Within HHS\u2019 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which implemented this memorandum of understanding, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health was made responsible for occupational health research (i.e., research on workers employed by DOE and its contractors), while the National Center for Environmental Health was made responsible for research involving the environment, including communities near DOE\u2019s facilities.", "The Secretarial Panel also called for greater outside scrutiny by recommending that the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) play a key role in overseeing and monitoring the development of CEDR. In response to the Secretarial Panel, as well as a concurrent request from DOE to provide general scientific advice on the status and direction of DOE\u2019s epidemiological programs, NAS established a Committee on DOE Radiation Epidemiological Research Programs. In 1990, this committee issued a report making a number of recommendations about access to data for researchers outside DOE, the types of data to be included in CEDR, and its future development. The report also noted that use of CEDR will depend on ease of access to the information it contains and researchers\u2019 perception of its value.", "Beginning in 1990, a DOE contractor facility, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, in Berkeley, California, constructed a prototype, known as preCEDR, to serve as the basis of CEDR. In 1992, DOE made data available through this system. In August 1993, DOE published a catalog of data available in CEDR to assist current and potential users in identifying data sets for potential use and to provide instructions on how to obtain access to these data. Through fiscal year 1994, DOE had received $14.35 million in appropriations for CEDR, of which it had spent $9.45 million for CEDR and related expenses and redirected the remaining $4.9 million to other activities. CEDR is budgeted at $1 million for fiscal year 1995, of which $500,000 was funded as of February 1995."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Important Epidemiological Data Limits CEDR\u2019s Value", "paragraphs": ["DOE does not have available the uniform demographic, exposure, medical, and environmental data that would make CEDR a comprehensive and valuable epidemiological resource for independent researchers. The Secretarial Panel recommended in 1990 that DOE define a minimum set of data necessary for epidemiological research and routinely maintain and collect these data at all DOE facilities. As part of this effort, in May 1992 DOE requested that each of its facilities, within 3 years, complete an inventory of 123 specific types of records that the Department believed were important for conducting epidemiological studies. We reported on this and other DOE efforts to manage records in a May 1992 report. DOE officials told us that when completed, this records inventory would be included in CEDR and would more easily identify for researchers where these specific types of records are located. Meanwhile, DOE is waiting for its facilities to complete their records inventories, which may take until 1996, before it takes steps to routinely collect and maintain the types of records it has already identified as important.", "In addition, the NAS committee stated that CEDR should be capable of supporting many kinds of epidemiological studies, including long- and short-term health surveillance, monitoring studies, screening programs, and long-term mortality studies. However, as we reported in December 1993, DOE probably will not establish a comprehensive health surveillance program until at least 1998. Such a program would standardize the documentation of workers\u2019 occupational exposures to radiation and other industrial hazards\u2014such as chemicals, gases, metals, and noise\u2014and could identify trends in workers\u2019 illnesses and injuries that might be related to these exposures. Until such a program is in place, the comprehensive data on health effects and exposure needed for important epidemiological research will not be available for placement in CEDR. Moreover, DOE\u2019s Assistant Secretary for Environment, Safety, and Health told us in October 1994 that standardization of data at DOE\u2019s facilities was a problem that would take several years to resolve.", "Without the important data necessary to support many types of epidemiological research, CEDR today mainly contains the limited data from DOE-sponsored mortality studies of workers at DOE\u2019s facilities at Oak Ridge, Tennessee; Rocky Flats, Colorado; Hanford, Washington; and elsewhere. Of the 37 data sets in CEDR, 36 contain the retrospective information\u2014data on past incidents\u2014used to conduct these studies. (See app. I.) Some new data will be included when certain ongoing studies are completed. These studies include mortality studies of DOE\u2019s workers at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory and the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Ohio; a study of cancer incidence among workers at Rocky Flats by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health; and studies from the National Center for Environmental Health, including estimates of the effect of the radiation from Hanford on the air and water in the surrounding area. While adding the results of these studies will make some of the data in CEDR more current, the system will still lack the comprehensive data discussed above that would make it the valuable resource that the Secretarial Panel and NAS recommended.", "According to many NAS committee members and CEDR users we spoke with, the current lack of comprehensive epidemiological data limits CEDR\u2019s value for research. The Secretarial Panel cautioned DOE that retrospective data would have limited value for future research. Also, members of the NAS committee told us that the data on mortality that CEDR currently contains limit the types of studies that can be done and have minimal value for future research on health effects. NAS noted in its 1994 report that the scope of the data currently in CEDR limits the type of research that can be conducted. The data restrict researchers by defining the groups that can be studied, the variables that can be examined, and the analytic methods that can be applied. Officials at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and the National Center for Environmental Health also stated that CEDR would be of greater value if it contained data on chemical exposures and health effects. These data will not be available until DOE\u2019s health surveillance program is completed. Since CEDR contains only limited retrospective data, researchers who need more information must still locate records at DOE\u2019s facilities, where the records are not consistently maintained. However, despite CEDR\u2019s limited value for health effects research, several NAS experts, current users, and DOE officials believe that it has significant value as a teaching tool for students of epidemiology."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CEDR Is Easy to Access, but Limitations Impair Its Utility to Researchers", "paragraphs": ["DOE has made data from its mortality studies easy for outside researchers to access through CEDR, and thousands of people have accessed the system to see what basic data are available.

In addition, some members of the NAS Committee on Epidemiological Research and some researchers we interviewed noted problems that impair the usability of the data. Difficulties include a lack of data that have not been previously modified by other researchers to meet their specific research needs, data that are hard to work with because they have been edited to protect the privacy of the workers, and data that are not current. In addition, some researchers have encountered problems with the quality of the data, including missing and inconsistent data and inadequate documentation of the studies included.

Potential users of CEDR can obtain basic information about the system\u2019s contents and file structure (but cannot access the actual data) through DOE\u2019s published catalog of available data or via a computer link with CEDR directly or through the Internet. The summaries, which do not provide detailed research data, are available to all Internet users. We were able to access CEDR directly from personal computers using communication software and found the instructions relatively easy to follow.

Some of the users listed, however, were not independent researchers but worked for DOE or its contractors. Some of these users were involved only in loading, testing, and maintaining the system. We identified 13 independent researchers who were primary users and may have obtained data from CEDR. (See table 1.) We confirmed that nine independent researchers had obtained data from CEDR.

DOE also rounded some key dates in workers\u2019 files, such as birth date, hiring date, and death date, if applicable. In contrast, an official from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health stated that while the Institute replaces identifying data elements, such as the name and social security number, in data that it releases to the public, it does not truncate dates.", "Researchers funded by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health noted that truncating key dates makes it difficult to do precise calculations of exposure, for which it is necessary to know the exact numbers of days a worker is exposed to a hazard.

In many of these studies, the most recent mortality data are more than 10 years old. Researchers are unable to follow up on the results of the mortality studies without significant additional work. Researchers we spoke with explained that because the chronic effects of exposure to low doses of radiation may not occur until decades afterwards, workers who have been exposed to radiation should be studied over lengthy periods. One epidemiologist, a member of the NAS committee, stated that unless the workers in a study are monitored until the cause of death has been determined, the results of the study are not conclusive. Other epidemiologists and health physicists from the Centers for Disease Control and some DOE contractors also agreed that the data in CEDR would be more useful if the information on mortality were updated. DOE\u2019s Assistant Secretary for Environment, Safety, and Health said that while she considers it the responsibility of the Department to update these radiation studies, she is not sure that the funding necessary to do this will be available, given the current emphasis on funding research on the occupational health effects of hazardous chemicals rather than radiation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Quality of Some Data Is Questionable", "paragraphs": ["Some researchers working with CEDR have encountered additional problems with the quality of the data.

Rather than develop CEDR into a comprehensive data base, the DOE Assistant Secretary said DOE may consider that the data base\u2019s current function of providing the public with access to its existing epidemiological research data is sufficient. In addition, the Assistant Secretary told us in October 1994 that the budget for CEDR\u2014$1 million in fiscal year 1995\u2014will be reevaluated if usage does not increase substantially. Even with increased usage, however, it is not clear whether CEDR is the most cost-effective and practical means of accomplishing the more limited objective of providing access to DOE\u2019s epidemiological data and data gathered under the memorandum of understanding with HHS. Some researchers and others we spoke with suggested that a far less expensive clearinghouse arrangement might meet this need just as effectively.

If DOE decides to pursue the original vision for CEDR, it cannot be assured of an orderly implementation without a long-range plan that sets forth the required time frames, resources, and costs and takes into account the ongoing efforts to uniformly collect and maintain epidemiological data throughout DOE\u2019s facilities. If DOE decides not to develop a comprehensive epidemiological data base, it could either maintain or abandon the current system. However, maintaining the current system may not be the most practical and cost-effective means of providing the epidemiological data used in DOE\u2019s past studies and those currently being conducted by HHS.

Updates are planned to the working data sets for at least two sites and the dosimetry data for several others."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To determine how well CEDR meets its intended objective of being a comprehensive resource, we (1) reviewed recommendations from reports by the Secretarial Panel for the Evaluation of Epidemiologic Research Activities and National Academy of Sciences (NAS) on designing and implementing CEDR; (2) interviewed officials at DOE headquarters\u2014including the Assistant Secretary for Environment, Safety, and Health; the Acting Director of the Office of Epidemiology and Health Surveillance; and the CEDR Program Coordinator\u2014and contractor staff at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory concerning the current status of CEDR; (3) reviewed relevant DOE directives, program plans, progress reports, and documentation on CEDR; (4) interviewed eight of the nine members (attempts to contact the ninth member were unsuccessful) of the NAS committee responsible for monitoring and reporting on DOE\u2019s progress on CEDR; and (5) interviewed the officials from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and the National Center for Environmental Health who were responsible for the studies conducted under the memorandum of understanding between DOE and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).", "To determine how accessible and usable CEDR is for outside researchers we also (1) obtained authorization from DOE to become CEDR users and accessed and reviewed various files in the system and (2) interviewed CEDR users about their experiences with the system.
