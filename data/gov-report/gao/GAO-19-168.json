As of February 2019, SBA had not eliminated the option for program participants to self-certify that they are eligible to participate, as required by 2015 NDAA. SBA officials stated that this requirement would be addressed as part of the new certification process for the WOSB program, which they expect to implement by January 1, 2020.", "SBA has not addressed WOSB program oversight deficiencies identified in GAO's 2014 review (GAO-15-54). For example, GAO previously recommended that SBA establish procedures to assess the performance of four third-party certifiers\u2014private entities approved by SBA to certify the eligibility of WOSB firms. While SBA conducted a compliance review of the certifiers in 2016, it has no plans to regularly monitor them. By not improving its oversight of the WOSB program, SBA is limiting its ability to ensure third-party certifiers are following program requirements. In addition, the implementation of sole-source authority in light of these continued oversight deficiencies can increase program risk. Consequently, GAO maintains that its prior recommendations should be addressed. In addition, similar to previous findings from SBA's Office of Inspector General, GAO found that about 3.5 percent of contracts using a WOSB set-aside were awarded for ineligible goods or services from April 2011 through June 2018. SBA does not review contracting data that could identify this problem and inform SBA which agencies making awards may need targeted outreach or training. As a result, SBA cannot provide reasonable assurance that WOSB program requirements are being met and that the program is meeting its goals.", "While federal contract obligations to all women-owned small businesses and WOSB program set-asides have increased since fiscal year 2012, WOSB program set-asides remain a small percentage (see figure)."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that SBA develop a process for periodically reviewing the extent to which WOSB program set-asides are awarded for ineligible goods or services and use the results to address identified issues, such as through targeted outreach or training on the WOSB program.

However, the federal goal of awarding  5 percent of procurements government-wide to women-owned small  businesses has only been met once since fiscal year 2013. In 2000,  Congress authorized the Women-Owned Small Business Federal  Contracting Program (WOSB program) to, among other things, reserve  contracts for qualified women-owned small businesses in industries  where these businesses are substantially underrepresented.

Using data from the Federal Procurement Data  System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG), we judgmentally selected the three  federal agencies and three components (for a total of six selected  agencies and components) because their WOSB dollar obligations  (including competed and sole-source) were among the largest or because  we had interviewed them for our prior work. Specifically, we selected the  following six agencies or agency components: the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) and, within DHS, the Coast Guard; the  Department of Defense (DOD) and, within DOD, the U.S. Army and U.S.  Navy; and the General Services Administration (GSA). Within the  components and GSA, we judgmentally selected eight contracting offices  (two each from Coast Guard, U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, and GSA) based on  whether they had a relatively large amount of obligations and had used  multiple types of set-asides (competed or sole-source) to WOSBs or  EDWOSBs.", "To address the second objective, we reviewed SBA policies and  procedures for the WOSB program and SBA oversight activities, such as  SBA compliance reviews of the four third-party certifiers.

To determine the  relative usage of the WOSB program, we compared data on obligations  for set-asides under the WOSB program with federal contract obligations  for WOSB-program-eligible goods and services to all woman-owned small  businesses. We assessed the reliability of FPDS-NG data by reviewing  available documentation and prior GAO data reliability assessments and  by electronically testing for missing data, outliers, and inconsistent  coding.

To determine the industries eligible  under the WOSB program, SBA is required to conduct a study to  determine which NAICS codes are eligible under the program and to  report on such studies every 5 years. WOSBs can receive set-asides in  industries in which SBA has determined that women-owned small  businesses are substantially underrepresented. EDWOSBs can receive  set-asides in WOSB-eligible industries as well as in an additional set of  industries in which SBA has determined that women-owned small  businesses are underrepresented but not substantially so.

Self-certification is  free, but some third-party certification options require businesses to pay a  fee. Each certification process requires businesses to provide signed  representations attesting to their WOSB or EDWOSB eligibility.  Businesses must provide documents supporting their status before  submitting an offer to perform the requirements of a WOSB set-aside  contract. In August 2016, SBA launched certify.sba.gov, which is an  online portal that allows firms to upload required documents and track  their submission and also enables contracting officers to review firms\u2019  eligibility documentation.

In the final rule, SBA explained  that it promulgated the sole-source rule before the WOSB certification  requirements for two reasons. First, the sole-source rule could be  accomplished by simply incorporating the statutory language into the  regulations, whereas the WOSB certification requirements would instead  require a prolonged rulemaking process. Second, SBA said that  addressing all three regulatory changes at the same time would delay the  implementation of sole-source authority.

However,  SBA officials told us that the results of annual eligibility examinations\u2014 such as the number of businesses found eligible or ineligible\u2014are  generally not documented. As a result, we obtained conflicting data from  SBA on the number of examinations completed and the percentage of  businesses found to be ineligible in fiscal years 2012 through 2018. For  example, based on previous information provided by SBA, we reported in  October 2014 that in fiscal year 2012, 113 eligibility examinations were  conducted and 42 percent of businesses were found to be ineligible for  the WOSB program. However, during this review, we received information  from SBA that 78 eligibility examinations were conducted and 37 percent  of businesses were found ineligible in fiscal year 2012. We found similar  disparities when we compared fiscal year 2016 data provided by SBA for  this report with a performance memorandum summarizing that fiscal  year\u2019s statistics. Regardless of the disparity between the data sources,  the rate of ineligible businesses has remained significant. For example,  according to documentation SBA provided during this review, in fiscal  year 2017, SBA found that about 40 percent of the businesses in its  sample were not eligible.", "In addition, SBA continues to have no mechanism for evaluating  examination results in aggregate to inform the WOSB program. In 2014,  we reported that SBA officials told us that most businesses that were  deemed ineligible did not understand the documentation requirements for  establishing eligibility. However, we also reported that SBA officials could  not explain how they knew a lack of understanding was the cause of  ineligibility among businesses and had not made efforts to confirm that  this was the cause. In June 2018, SBA officials told us they did not  analyze the annual examinations in aggregate for common eligibility  issues because the examination results are unique to each WOSB firm.  They noted that this was not necessary as WOSB program staff are  familiar with common eligibility issues through the annual eligibility  examinations. As we noted in 2014, by not analyzing aggregate  examination results, the agency is missing opportunities to obtain  meaningful insights into the program, such as the reasons many  businesses are deemed ineligible.", "Also, SBA still conducts eligibility examinations only of firms that have  already received a WOSB award. In 2014, we concluded that this  sampling practice restricts SBA\u2019s ability to identify potentially ineligible  businesses prior to a contract award. Similarly, during this review, SBA  officials said that while some aspects of the sample characteristics have  changed since 2012, the samples still generally consist only of firms that  have been awarded a WOSB set-aside. In addition, officials said that the  sample size of the eligibility examinations has varied over time and is  largely based on the workload of WOSB program staff. Restricting the  samples in this way limits SBA\u2019s ability to better understand the eligibility  of businesses before they apply for and are awarded contracts, as well as  its ability to detect and prevent potential fraud.", "SBA officials said that their other means of reducing participation by  ineligible firms and mitigating potential fraud is through WOSB or  EDWOSB status protests\u2014that is, allegations that a business receiving  an award does not meet program eligibility requirements. A federal  contractor can file a status protest against any firm receiving an award  that represents itself as a WOSB in the System for Award Management  for grounds that include failure to provide all required supporting  documentation. The penalties for misrepresenting a firm\u2019s status, per  regulation, include debarment or suspension. However, one third-party  certifier expressed in its comments to the advance notice of proposed  rulemaking on certification that status protests alone are not a viable  option for protecting the integrity of the WOSB program. The certifier  questioned how a firm could have sufficient information about a  competitor firm to raise questions about its eligibility. According to SBA  officials, 11 status protests were filed under the WOSB program in fiscal  year 2018. Of these, four firms were deemed ineligible for the WOSB  program, four were deemed eligible, and three status protests were  dismissed. In fiscal year 2017, 9 status protests were filed; of these, three  firms were found ineligible, two were found eligible, and four status  protests were dismissed.", "We recognize that SBA has made some effort to address our previous  recommendation by documenting procedures for conducting annual  eligibility examinations of WOSB firms. However, leading fraud risk  management practices state that federal program managers should  design control activities that focus on fraud prevention over detection and  response, to the extent possible. Without maintaining reliable  information on the results of eligibility examinations, developing  procedures for analyzing results, and expanding the sample of  businesses to be examined to include those that did not receive  contracts, SBA limits the value of its eligibility examinations and its ability  to reduce ineligibility among businesses registered to participate in the  WOSB program. These deficiencies also limit SBA\u2019s ability to identify  potential fraud risks and develop any additional control activities needed  to address these risks. As a result, the program may continue to be  exposed to the risk of ineligible businesses receiving set-aside contracts.  In addition, in light of these continued oversight deficiencies, the  implementation of sole-source authority without addressing the other  changes made by the 2015 NDAA could increase program risk. For these  reasons, we maintain that our previous recommendation that SBA  enhance its WOSB eligibility examination procedures should be  addressed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SBA Has Not Addressed Previously Identified Issues with WOSB Set- Asides Awarded Under Ineligible Industry Codes", "paragraphs": ["In 2015 and 2018, the SBA OIG reported instances in which WOSB set- asides were awarded using NAICS codes that were not eligible under the  WOSB program, and our analysis indicates that this problem persists. In  2015, the SBA OIG reported on its analysis of a sample of 34 WOSB set- aside awards and found that 10 awards were set aside using an ineligible  NAICS code. The SBA OIG concluded that this may have been due to  contracting officers\u2019 uncertainty about NAICS code requirements under  the program and recommended that SBA provide additional, updated  training and outreach to federal agencies\u2019 contracting officers on the  program\u2019s NAICS code requirements. In response, SBA updated WOSB  program training and outreach documents in March 2016 to include  information about the program\u2019s NAICS code requirements.", "In 2018, the SBA OIG issued another report evaluating the WOSB  program, with a focus on the use of the program\u2019s sole-source contract  authority. Here, the SBA OIG identified additional instances of contracting  officers using inaccurate NAICS codes to set aside WOSB contracts.  Specifically, the SBA OIG reviewed a sample of 56 awards and found that  4 were awarded under ineligible NAICS codes. The report included two  recommendations for SBA aimed at preventing and correcting improper  NAICS code data in FPDS-NG: (1) conduct quarterly reviews of FPDS- NG data to ensure contracting officers used the appropriate NAICS codes  and (2) in coordination with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy and  GSA, strengthen controls in FPDS-NG to prevent contracting officers from  using ineligible NAICS codes.", "SBA disagreed with both of these recommendations. In its response to  the first recommendation, SBA stated that it is not responsible for the  oversight of other agencies\u2019 contracting officers and therefore is not in a  position to implement the corrective actions. With respect to the second  recommendation, SBA stated that adding such controls to FPDS-NG  would further complicate the WOSB program and increase contracting  officers\u2019 reluctance to use it. SBA also stated its preference for focusing  its efforts on ensuring that contracting officers select the appropriate  NAICS code at the beginning of the award process.", "In our review, we also found several issues with WOSB program set- asides being awarded under ineligible NAICS codes. Our analysis of  FPDS-NG data on all obligations to WOSB program set-asides from the  third quarter of fiscal year 2011 through the third quarter of fiscal year  2018 found the following:", "3.5 percent (or about $76 million) of WOSB program obligations were  awarded under NAICS codes that were never eligible for the WOSB  program;", "10.5 percent (or about $232 million) of WOSB program obligations  made under an EDWOSB NAICS code went to women-owned  businesses that were not eligible to receive awards in EDWOSB- eligible industries; and", "17 of the 47 federal agencies that obligated dollars to WOSB program  set-asides during the period used inaccurate NAICS codes in at least  5 percent of their WOSB set-asides (representing about $25 million).", "According to SBA officials we spoke with during this review, WOSB  program set-asides may be awarded under ineligible NAICS codes  because of human error when contracting officers are inputting data in  FPDS-NG or because a small business contract was misclassified as a  WOSB program set-aside. They characterized the extent of the issue as  \u201csmall\u201d relative to the size of the FPDS-NG database and said that such  issues do not affect the program\u2019s purpose. Rather than review FPDS-NG  data that are inputted after the contract is awarded, SBA officials said that  they have discussed options for working with GSA to add controls  defining eligible NAICS codes for WOSB program set-aside opportunities  on FedBizOpps.gov\u2014the website that contracting officers use to post  announcements about available federal contracting opportunities.  Adding controls to this system, officials said, would help contracting  officers realize as they are writing the contract requirements that they  should not set aside contracts under the WOSB program without  reviewing the proper NAICS codes. However, SBA officials said that the  feasibility of this option was still being discussed and that the issue was  not a high priority. For these reasons, according to officials, SBA\u2019s  updated oversight procedures described in the 2017 SOP and the Desk  Guide do not include a process for reviewing WOSB program set-aside  data in FPDS-NG to determine whether they were awarded under the  appropriate NAICS codes.", "Further, as of November 2018, the WOSB program did not have targeted  outreach or training that focused on specific agencies\u2019 use of NAICS  codes. As noted previously, in March 2016, SBA updated its WOSB  program training materials to address NAICS code requirements in  response to a 2015 SBA OIG recommendation. In fiscal year 2018, SBA  conducted three WOSB program training sessions for federal contracting  officers, including (1) a virtual learning session, (2) a session conducted  during WOSB Industry Day at the Department of Housing and Urban  Development, and (3) a session conducted during a Department of  Defense Small Business Training Conference. However, with the  exception of the virtual learning session, these training sessions were  requested by the agencies. SBA officials did not identify any targeted  outreach or training provided to specific agencies to improve  understanding of WOSB NAICS code requirements (or other issues  related to the WOSB program).", "Congress authorized SBA to develop a contract set-aside program  specifically for WOSBs and EDWOSBs to address the  underrepresentation of such businesses in specific industries. In addition,  federal standards for internal control state that management should  design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks and to  establish and operate monitoring activities to monitor and evaluate the  results. Because SBA does not review whether contracts are being  awarded under the appropriate NAICS codes, it cannot provide  reasonable assurance that WOSB program requirements are being met  or identify agencies that may require targeted outreach or additional  training on eligible NAICS codes. As a result, WOSB contracts may  continue to be awarded to groups other than those intended, which can  undermine the goals of and confidence in the program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Contracts to WOSB Set-Asides Remain Relatively Small, and Stakeholders Discussed Various Aspects of Program Use", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Percentage of Obligations to Women- Owned Small Businesses under the WOSB Program Increased Slightly since 2012", "paragraphs": ["Federal dollars obligated for contracts to all women-owned small  businesses increased from $18.2 billion in fiscal year 2012 to $21.4 billion  in fiscal year 2017.

Contracts awarded to all  women-owned small businesses within WOSB-program-eligible industries  also increased during this period\u2014from about $15 billion to $18.8 billion,  as shown in figure 1. However, obligations under the WOSB program  represented only a small share of this increase. In fiscal year 2012,  WOSB program contract obligations were 0.5 percent of contract  obligations to all women-owned small businesses for WOSB-program- eligible goods or services (about $73.5 million), and in fiscal year 2017  this percentage had grown to 3.8 percent (about $713.3 million) (see fig.  1).", "From fiscal years 2012 through 2017, 98 percent of total dollars obligated  for contracts to all women-owned small businesses in WOSB-program- eligible industries were not awarded under the WOSB program. Instead,  these contracts were awarded without a set-aside or under other, longer- established socioeconomic contracting programs, such as HUBZone, the  SDVOSB, and 8(a). For example, during this period, dollars obligated to  contracts awarded to women-owned small businesses without a set-aside  represented about 34 percent of dollars obligated for contracts to all  women-owned small businesses in these industries (see fig. 2).", "As shown in table 1, six federal agencies\u2014DOD, DHS, Department of  Commerce, Department of Agriculture, Department of Health and Human  Services, and GSA\u2014collectively accounted for nearly 83 percent of the  obligations awarded under the WOSB program from the third quarter of  fiscal year 2011 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, with DOD  accounting for about 49 percent of the total.", "Contracting officers\u2019 use of sole-source authority was relatively limited,  representing about 12 percent of WOSB program obligations from  January 2016 through June 2018.

Issues stakeholders discussed  included the impact of sole-source authority and program-specific NAICS  codes on program usage. Stakeholders also noted the potential effect of  other program requirements on contracting officers\u2019 willingness to use the  program, and some suggested that SBA provide additional guidance and  training to contracting officers.", "Sole-source authority. Participants in 12 of the 14 stakeholder groups  commented on the effect of sole-source authority on WOSB program  usage. Staff from 4 of the 12 stakeholder groups\u2014including three  contracting offices\u2014said that sole-source authority generally had no  effect on the use of the WOSB program. One of these stakeholders  believed contracting officers seldom use the authority because they lack  an understanding of how and when to use it; therefore, in this  stakeholder\u2019s opinion, use of the WOSB program has not generally  changed since the authority was implemented. However, staff from two  contracting offices and one third-party certifier said that sole-source  authority was a positive addition because, for example, it can significantly  reduce the lead time before a contracting officer can offer a contract  award to a firm. Staff from one of these two contracting offices stated that  the award process can take between 60 to 90 days using sole-source  authority, compared to 6 to 12 months using a competitive WOSB  program set-aside. These staff also said that negotiating the terms of a  sole-source contract is easier, from a contracting officer\u2019s perspective,  because they can communicate directly with the firm. As discussed  previously, SBA officials we interviewed said that adding sole-source  authority to the WOSB program made the program more consistent with  other existing socioeconomic set-aside programs, such as 8(a) and  HUBZone.", "The remaining five stakeholder groups that discussed the effects of  WOSB sole-source authority described difficulties with implementing it.  Specifically, representatives from DHS, DOD, and one third-party certifier  said that executing sole-source authority under the WOSB program is  difficult for contracting officers because rules for sole-source authority  under WOSB are different from those under other SBA programs, such as  8(a) and HUBZone. For example, the FAR\u2019s requirement that contracting  officers justify, in writing, why they do not expect other WOSBs or  EDWOSBs to submit offers on a contract is stricter under the WOSB  program than it is for the 8(a) program. Further, staff from one contracting  office noted that justifications for WOSB set-asides must then be  published on a federal website. In contrast, contracting officers generally  do not need to prepare and publish a justification under the 8(a)  program. According to staff from another contracting office, it may be  difficult to find more than one firm qualified to do the work under some  WOSB-eligible NAICS codes, but contracting officers would still have to  conduct market research and explain why they do not expect additional  offers in order to set the contract aside for a WOSB.", "Program-specific NAICS codes. Participants in 13 of the 14 stakeholder  groups we interviewed commented on the requirement that WOSB  program set-asides be awarded within certain industries, represented by  NAICS codes. For example, two third-party certifiers we interviewed  recommended that the NAICS codes be expanded or eliminated to  provide greater opportunities for WOSBs to win contracts under the  program. Another third-party certifier said that some of its members focus  their businesses\u2019 marketing efforts on industries specific to the WOSB  program to help them compete for such contracts.", "Representatives from GSA and DHS made comments about limitations  with respect to the WOSB program\u2019s NAICS code requirement. Staff we  interviewed from three contracting offices made similar statements,  adding that the NAICS codes limit opportunities to award a contract to a  WOSB or EDWOSB because they are sufficient in some industry areas  but not others. All five of these stakeholder groups suggested that NAICS  codes be removed from the program\u2019s requirements to increase  opportunities for WOSBs.", "Conversely, staff from five other contracting offices we interviewed  generally expressed positive views about the WOSB program\u2019s NAICS  code requirements and stated that eligible codes line up well with the  services for which they generally contract. Finally, SBA officials noted that  there are no plans to reassess the NAICS codes until about 2020.  However, SBA officials also stated that the NAICS code requirements  complicate the WOSB program and add confusion for contracting officers  who use program, as compared to other socioeconomic programs that do  not have such requirements, such as HUBZone or 8(a).", "Requirement to verify eligibility documentation. Staff from 7 of the 14  stakeholder groups we interviewed discussed the requirement for the  contracting officer to review program eligibility documentation and how  this requirement affects their decision to use the program. For example,  staff from one contracting office said that using the 8(a) or HUBZone  programs is easier because 8(a) and HUBZone applicants are already  certified by SBA; therefore, the additional step to verify documentation for  eligibility is not needed. GSA officials noted that eliminating the need for  contracting officers to take additional steps to review eligibility  documentation for WOSB-program set-asides\u2014in addition to checking  the System for Award Management\u2014could create more opportunities for  WOSBs by reducing burden on contracting officers. However, staff from  two contracting offices said it is not more difficult to award contracts under  the WOSB program versus other socioeconomic programs.", "WOSB program guidance. Staff from 13 of the14 stakeholder groups we  interviewed discussed guidance available to contracting officers under the  WOSB program. Most generally said that the program requirements  outlined in the FAR are fairly detailed and help contracting officers  implement the program. According to SBA officials, SBA provides training  on WOSB program requirements to contracting officers in federal  agencies by request, through outreach events, and through an annual  webinar. SBA officials also said that the training materials include all the  regulatory issues that contracting officers must address.", "However, representatives from two third-party certifiers described  feedback received from their members about the need to provide  additional training and guidance for contracting officers to better  understand and implement the WOSB program. Staff from two  contracting offices also expressed the need for SBA to provide additional  training and guidance. Staff from one of these contracting offices said that  the last time they received training on the WOSB program was in 2011,  when the program was first implemented. Staff in the other contracting  office added that the most recent version of a WOSB compliance guide  they could locate online was at least 6 years old. SBA officials estimated  that the WOSB compliance guide was removed from their public website  in March 2016 because it was difficult to keep the document current and  officials did not want to risk publishing a guide that was out-of-date. SBA  officials also said that there are no plans to issue an updated guide as the  FAR is sufficient.", "The stakeholder groups also identified positive aspects of the WOSB  program. Specifically, staff from seven stakeholder groups believed that  the program provided greater opportunities for women-owned small  businesses to obtain contracts in industries in which they are  underrepresented. In addition, staff from three stakeholder groups  mentioned that SBA-led initiatives, such as the Small Business  Procurement Advisory Council and SBA\u2019s co-sponsorship of the  ChallengeHER program, help improve collaboration between federal  agencies and the small business community and overall government  contracting opportunities for women-owned small businesses."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The WOSB program aims to enhance federal contracting opportunities for  women-owned small businesses.

Without ongoing monitoring and  reviews of third-party certifier reports, SBA cannot ensure that the  certifiers are fulfilling the requirements of their agreements with SBA, and  it is missing opportunities to gain information that could help improve the  program\u2019s processes. Further, limitations in SBA\u2019s procedures for  conducting, documenting, and analyzing eligibility examinations inhibit its  ability to better understand the eligibility of businesses before they apply  for and potentially receive contracts, which exposes the program to  unnecessary risk of fraud.

To  ensure the accuracy of our characterization of the comment letters, one  staff member independently summarized the third-party certifiers\u2019  comments on the advance notice, and a second staff member then  reviewed the results.

Using data from the Federal  Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG), we judgmentally  selected the three federal agencies and three components (for a total of  six federal agencies and components) because their WOSB program  dollar obligations (including competed and sole-source) were among the  largest or because we had interviewed them for our prior work.  Specifically, we selected the following six agencies or agency  components: the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and, within  DHS, the Coast Guard; the Department of Defense (DOD) and, within  DOD, the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy; and the General Services  Administration (GSA). Within the components and GSA, we judgmentally  selected eight contracting offices (two each from Coast Guard, U.S.  Army, U.S. Navy, and GSA) based on whether they had a relatively large  amount of obligations and had used multiple types of WOSB program set- asides (competed or sole-source) to WOSBs or economically  disadvantaged women-owned small businesses (EDWOSB).", "To address our second objective, we reviewed the findings and  recommendations in our October 2014 report and in audit reports issued  by the SBA Office of Inspector General (OIG) in May 2015 and June  2018. We also reviewed SBA documentation on the WOSB program,  including SBA\u2019s 2017 Standard Operating Procedures and 2018 WOSB  Program Desk Guide, results from 2016 compliance reviews of the four  third-party certifiers, and SBA eligibility examinations from fiscal years  2012 through 2018. In addition, we analyzed FPDS-NG data on contract  obligations to WOSB program set-asides from the third quarter of fiscal  year 2011 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 to determine  whether set-asides were made using eligible program-specific North  American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes. To conduct this  analysis, we compared contract obligations in FPDS-NG with the NAICS  codes eligible under the WOSB program at the time of the award for the  time frame under review. The WOSB program\u2019s eligible NAICS codes  have changed three times since the program was implemented in 2011,  but the eligible industries have changed once. SBA commissioned the  RAND Corporation to conduct the first study to assist SBA in determining  eligible NAICS codes under the WOSB program. Based on the results of  the RAND study, SBA identified 45 four-digit WOSB NAICS codes and 38  four-digit EDWOSB NAICS codes, for a total of 83 four-digit NAICS  codes. WOSB and EDWOSB NAICS codes are different and do not  overlap. In December 2015, the Department of Commerce issued the  next study, which increased the total NAICS codes under the program to  113 four-digit codes, with 92 WOSB NAICS codes and 21 EDWOSB  NAICS codes (which became effective March 2016). Often, there is a  time lag between the effective date of NAICS codes and when they are  entered in FPDS-NG. Therefore, we did not classify a contract as having  an ineligible NAICS code if the code eventually became eligible under the  WOSB program. We also excluded actions in FPDS-NG coded other than  as a small business. These actions represented a small amount of  contract obligations\u2014approximately $125,000. We compared SBA  information on its oversight activities and responses to previously  identified deficiencies, federal internal control standards, and GAO\u2019s fraud  risk framework.", "We assessed the reliability of FPDS-NG data by considering their known  strengths and weaknesses, based on our past work and through  electronic testing for missing data, outliers, and inconsistent coding in the  data elements we used for our analysis. We also reviewed FPDS-NG  documentation, including the FPDS-NG data dictionary, FPDS-NG data  validation rules, FPDS-NG user manual, prior GAO reliability  assessments, and relevant SBA OIG audit reports. Based on these steps,  we concluded that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  reporting on trends in the WOSB program and the use of sole-source  authority under the program.", "To describe how participation in the WOSB program has changed since  2011, including since the 2015 implementation of sole-source authority,  we analyzed FPDS-NG data from the third quarter of fiscal year 2011  through the third quarter of fiscal year 2018. We identified any trends in  WOSB program participation using total obligation dollars set aside for  competitive and sole-source contracts awarded to WOSBs and  EDWOSBs under the program. We also compared data on obligations for  set-asides under the WOSB program with federal contract obligations for  WOSB-program-eligible goods and services to all women-owned small  businesses, including those made under different set-aside programs or  with no set-asides, to determine the relative usage of the WOSB program.  In our analysis, we excluded from WOSB program set-aside data actions  in FPDS-NG coded other than as a small business (representing  approximately $125,000) or coded under ineligible NAICS codes that  were never eligible under the WOSB program (representing  approximately $76.3 million).", "To describe stakeholder views on WOSB program use, we conducted  semistructured interviews to gather responses from 14 stakeholder  groups. These groups consisted of staff within three federal agencies  (DHS, DOD, and GSA), eight contracting offices within these agencies,  and three third-party certifiers (selection criteria described above). One  person summarized the results of the interviews, and another person  reviewed the summary of the interviews to ensure an accurate depiction  of the comments. In addition, a third person then reviewed the  summarized results.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2017 to March 2019  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the U.S. Small Business Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Allison Abrams (Assistant  Director), Tiffani Humble (Analyst-in-Charge), Pamela Davidson,  Jonathan Harmatz, Julia Kennon, Jennifer Schwartz, Rebecca Shea,  Jena Sinkfield, Tyler Spunaugle, and Tatiana Winger made key  contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": ["The Women-Owned Small Business program aims to give these businesses an edge when competing for federal contracts in industries where women have traditionally been underrepresented.", "Each year, the Small Business Administration examines a sample of businesses that received contracts under the program to determine whether they were eligible to participate.
