The policy requires CBP officials, when alerted, to verify licenses by calling experts in a centralized CBP office. CBP officials at two of four airports GAO visited said they were calling as required. However, CBP officials at the other two airports did not verify many licenses from January 1, 2015, through September 30, 2016, and headquarters officials were unaware of non-compliance with CBP policy. Also, GAO found that during this time frame nationwide, CBP officials were alerted to verify licenses for a significant number of shipments of licensable radiological material for all U.S. airports, but they did not make all the required calls\u2014leaving numerous shipments potentially unverified over this 21-month period. This situation occurred because CBP does not have a monitoring system to ensure that officials make license verification calls as required. Until CBP develops a monitoring system for license verification, it will not have reasonable assurance that it can identify activities inconsistent with its policy and take corrective action.", "CBP procedures cannot effectively implement the agency's policy that its officials verify all radiological material shipments imported into the United States. The procedures are not effective for this policy in part because they rely on automated alerts that are based on some but not all relevant information that could indicate potentially dangerous radiological material. Consequently, CBP's current system and procedures cannot ensure that all such materials will be identified. Under federal internal control standards, agencies are to design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks. However, CBP does not have the information it needs to develop a robust system or revise its procedures because it has not conducted a comprehensive assessment of the information not included in its automated alert system. In particular, CBP has not assessed relevant information not currently included in the automated alert or how to create a more risk-based approach that distinguishes between higher- and lower-risk quantities of radiological materials. Without such an assessment, CBP may be unable to develop a system or procedures that best support its policy for verifying imported radiological materials.", "This is a public version of a sensitive report GAO issued in September 2017.

Radiological material is commonly used in  thousands of locations throughout the United States and many other  countries for medical, industrial, and research purposes, such as treating  cancer, sterilizing food and medical instruments, and detecting flaws in  metal welds. In the hands of terrorists, radiological material could be used  to construct a \u201cdirty bomb\u201d\u2014a type of radiological dispersal device that  uses conventional explosives to disperse radiological material. Depending  on the type, form, amount, and concentration of radiological material  used, a dirty bomb could expose nearby individuals to the material and  potentially increase their long-term risk of cancer. In addition, the  evacuation and cleanup after a dirty bomb explosion could result in  serious economic costs, as individuals with homes and businesses in the  vicinity may not be able to, or may choose not to, return for an extended  period until the investigation and remediation activities are complete.  Recent terrorist activity in the United States, Europe, and the Middle East  continues to remind us about the potential use of radiological material in a  malicious act, such as a dirty bomb, and the need to control radiological  material.", "The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s U.S. Customs and Border  Protection (CBP) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) work to  ensure that only licensed radiological material enters the United States.  NRC authorizes the possession of radiological materials through licenses,  which can be issued by NRC or one of 37 Agreement States with  licensing authority. CBP monitors ports of entry to help ensure that only  properly licensed shipments of radiological material are permitted to enter  the United States. CBP is also part of the global nuclear detection  architecture\u2014a framework that includes numerous other federal agencies  that work domestically and internationally to detect, analyze, and report  on radiological materials that are out of regulatory control. Within this  framework, CBP deploys technology at and between ports of entry\u2014 which include border crossings, seaports, and airports\u2014that can detect  the presence of radiological material hidden in cargo or vehicles. In  addition, CBP personnel take steps to ensure that radiological material  imported into the United States is properly licensed.", "We have previously reported on vulnerabilities in CBP and NRC policies  and procedures to prevent unauthorized individuals from obtaining  radiological material. In March 2006, we were able to transport unlicensed  radiological material across the U.S. border using a fake license. In  response to that report, CBP developed a policy to verify the legitimacy of  licenses. In June 2008, we reported that many CBP field staff were not  aware of, or properly using CBP systems to verify licenses. We  recommended, among other things, that CBP communicate verification  guidance to ports of entry. CBP concurred with the recommendation. In  response, CBP sent a memorandum to all ports of entry requiring that  they incorporate new guidance into their operating procedures and  ensure that the guidance be a part of their on-the-job training. In 2016, we  again reviewed the rigor of NRC\u2019s radiological materials licensing  program. For that review, we obtained a genuine license to possess  radiological material by establishing fictitious companies, and we later  altered that license in order to procure additional quantities of radiological  material. Using both the genuine and altered licenses, we secured  commitments from radiological material distributors to sell us a dangerous  quantity of radiological material considered attractive for use in a dirty  bomb. In response to that report, NRC is considering making  enhancements to its pre-licensing process. In 2016, we also found that  CBP faces limitations in the air cargo radiological screening  environment. In 2017, we found weaknesses in NRC\u2019s and the  Department of Transportation\u2019s processes for ensuring compliance with  ground transportation security requirements for dangerous radiological  shipments. That report recommended, among other things, that NRC  should collect information on the number of shipments and mode of  transport for shipments of radiological material. NRC disagreed with the  recommendation.", "You asked us to review how CBP ensures that only properly licensed  radiological material is imported into the United States. Specifically, this  report (1) describes CBP\u2019s policies and procedures for ensuring that  imported radiological material is properly licensed, (2) examines the  extent to which CBP follows its policies and procedures, and (3)  evaluates the effectiveness of these policies and procedures. This report  is a public version of a sensitive report that we issued in September  2017. CBP deemed some of the information in our September report to  be sensitive, which must be protected from public disclosure. Therefore,  this report omits sensitive information about the extent of CBP\u2019s  verification of licenses and its procedures for doing so.

We received data in October 2016  that included calls made from January 2015 through the last full month  prior to the data request (September 2016). We believe this 21-month  time frame provided a sufficient amount of time to examine trends within  the program. The information we obtained at airports is not generalizable  to all airports but provides examples of how airports are following CBP  policies and procedures. Finally, we gathered data from CBP on the  number of shipments of radiological material at ports of entry and  compared it with data on the number of calls to the Teleforensic Center to  verify licenses. We discussed the reliability of these data with  knowledgeable CBP officials and questioned them about the system\u2019s  controls to verify the accuracy and completeness of the data. We also  analyzed these data for missing information and obvious outliers.

We also spoke to  CBP officials about the data systems and automated rule they have in  place to notify CBP officials that a shipment requires license verification.  In discussions with the officials, we discussed the history of the data systems and which information indicating a shipment contains licensable  radiological material is included in the automated rule. We also obtained  data from January 1, 2015, through September 30, 2016, on licensable  radiological material imports. The 21-month time frame for these data  matched the data we received showing calls to the Teleforensic Center to  verify licenses, and it provided a consistent time frame for comparison.  These data included the port of entry, company receiving the shipment,  and mode of transport (i.e. air, ground, or sea), among other things. We  analyzed these data to determine how many shipments with radiological  material were not checked to verify that their license was legitimate. We  discussed the reliability of these data with knowledgeable CBP and NRC  officials, and we found the data sufficiently reliable for counting the  number of shipments of radiological material.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2016 to January  2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Possession of this material within the United States  requires a license from NRC or from one of the 37 Agreement States to  which NRC has relinquished regulatory responsibility. NRC and  Agreement States issue two types of licenses authorizing the possession  and use of radiological materials: specific licenses and general licenses.  Specific licenses are issued for devices that typically contain larger  quantities of radiological material, such as medical equipment used to  treat cancer, cameras used for industrial radiography, and moisture and  density gauges used in construction. Devices approved for use under a  general license, by contrast, such as luminous exit signs, normally  contain relatively small quantities of radiological material. Such devices  are designed with inherent safety features, are widely available  commercially, and do not require NRC or Agreement State approval to  possess. Not all radiological material requires an NRC license for  possession. For example, there is naturally occurring radioactive material  in ceramics, fertilizers, and granite tile that does not require a license.  This report focuses on radiological material that requires specific licenses  for possession and use.", "Beyond requiring specific licenses for possession of radiological material,  NRC may also require a general or specific license to import such  material.

Specifically, NRC and Agreement State officials are to conduct pre- licensing visits with all unknown applicants, using detailed screening  criteria. According to NRC, the purpose of the site visit is to have a face- to-face meeting with the applicant to determine whether there is a basis  for confidence that the applicant will use the radiological materials sought  as represented in the application when the applicant receives the license.  NRC has established a 14-point checklist to guide pre-licensing site visits  and has developed a list of questions and activities related to each  applicant\u2019s business operations, facility, radiation safety operations, and  personnel qualifications, to scrutinize the applicant and provide a basis for  confidence that the applicant will use the radiological material as specified  in the license.", "In 2003, the International Atomic Energy Agency published a system\u2014 which NRC adopted in 2004\u2014that ranks quantities of individual  radionuclides into one of five categories on the basis of their potential to  harm human health. Under this system, a given radionuclide is  considered dangerous when gathered in sufficient quantity and in close  enough proximity to people to cause direct human health effects. A  category 1 quantity, if not safely managed or securely protected, is likely  to cause permanent injury to a person who handles or is otherwise in  contact with it for more than a few minutes. Being close to this amount of  unshielded material for a period of a few minutes to an hour will probably be fatal. A category 2 quantity, if not safely managed or securely  protected, can cause permanent injury to a person who handles or is  otherwise in contact with it for a short time (minutes to hours). Being close  to this amount of unshielded radioactive material for a period of hours to  days can be fatal. A category 3 quantity, if not safely managed or  securely protected, can cause permanent injury to a person who handles  or is otherwise in contact with it for some hours. Being close to this  amount of unshielded radioactive material for a period of days to weeks  can be fatal. Category 4 and 5 quantities are unlikely to cause permanent  injury.", "In addition to categorizing radionuclides on the basis of their potential to  harm human health, NRC has identified 16 radionuclides that are  sufficiently attractive for use in a dirty bomb or for other malicious  purposes.

Instead of calling the  Teleforensic Center as required, the CBP officials said that they  reviewed the shipment paperwork and looked for anomalies. CBP  officials said that they undertake this paperwork review regardless of  the risk of the radiological material in the shipment. For example, they  said they would use this approach to verify licenses for category 1  materials, which NRC and the International Atomic Energy Agency  classify as likely to cause permanent injury to a person who comes  into contact with them.

This is because CBP does not have  a mechanism, such as a monitoring system, to ensure that all required  license verifications are occurring. Such a system could also conduct  checks to ensure CBP officials are following agency policy. The challenge  to creating such a system is that CBP houses the data necessary to  create it in separate systems that do not communicate with each other,  and these systems are currently run by different offices with differing  missions within CBP.

Consequently, of the 44,152  shipments that could contain licensable radiological material, the system  alerted CBP officials that they were required to verify relatively few  licenses from January 1, 2015, to September 30, 2016.", "In addition, CBP\u2019s license verification procedures do not currently target  the higher-risk radiological materials. CBP\u2019s method for identifying the  contents of shipments does not include information that describes the  quantity of radiological material. Specifically, categories 1, 2, and 3  quantities of radiological material can cause permanent injury or death to  a person in contact with them for some period of time. As a result,  according to a senior CBP official, it is safer to assume all shipments of  radiological material are dangerous until proven otherwise.", "Federal standards for internal control recommend that agencies design  control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks. Until CBP  develops a robust system that can identify all shipments of radiological  material that pose risk, it will not have reasonable assurance that it has  the appropriate policies and procedures necessary to verify licenses for  these shipments. Furthermore, as we reported in December 2016, an  essential element of enterprise risk management is to examine risks  considering both the likelihood of the risk and the impact of the risk on the  mission, in order to help prioritize risk response. Although CBP officials  recognize that their current system and procedures have limitations and  do not allow them to fully implement the agency policy to verify all  shipments of radiological material that enter the United States, we found  that they have not developed a system nor revised their procedures to  address the issues we identified. Of particular concern is that CBP has not conducted a comprehensive assessment of (1) the information not  currently included in the automated alert to determine what additional  information would indicate shipments that may contain dangerous  material or (2) how to create a more risk-based approach that  distinguishes between higher- and lower-risk categories of radiological  materials. Until it conducts such an assessment, CBP will not know how  to adjust its current procedures to ensure that it is identifying all  shipments of potentially dangerous radiological material and targeting its  limited resources to those that pose the greatest risk."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["CBP has implemented a policy and procedures intended to ensure that  the tens of thousands of shipments of potentially dangerous radiological  material imported through U.S. airports each year are properly licensed.  However, CBP\u2019s procedures do not effectively implement CBP\u2019s policy of  ensuring that only properly licensed radiological material gains entry to  the United States. This is because CBP does not have a monitoring  system to help ensure that CBP officials at airports nationwide are  complying with the license verification policy. Until CBP develops such a  system, the agency will not have reasonable assurance that it can identify  activities that are inconsistent with its policy and take corrective action as  necessary.", "In addition, CBP\u2019s procedures for identifying licensable radiological  material do not ensure that all shipments of radiological material are  identified and verified. This is the result of CBP\u2019s automated alert, which  currently does not include all relevant information needed to identify such  shipments. Additionally, CBP procedures do not distinguish between  high-risk categories of radiological materials and lower-risk categories;  therefore CBP cannot target its limited resources to the shipments that  pose the greatest risk. CBP has not conducted a comprehensive  assessment of the information not currently included in the automated  alert and does not know which shipments pose the greatest risk. A  comprehensive assessment could help CBP gain a better understanding  of information not currently included in the automated alert, and it could  better position the agency to make appropriate changes to its existing  system and procedures, as well as target its limited resources toward the  quantities of material that pose the greatest risk."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following three recommendations to CBP:", "The Commissioner of CBP should develop a monitoring system to  help ensure that CBP officials comply with license verification policies  and procedures.
