For workers to receive TAA benefits, the Department of Labor (Labor) must certify that workers in a particular layoff have lost their jobs due to trade. Congress is considering allowing entire industries to be certified to facilitate access to assistance. GAO was asked to examine (1) trends in the current certification process, (2) the extent to which the proposed industry certification approach based on three petitions certified in 180 days would increase eligibility and identify potential challenges with this approach, and (3) the extent to which an approach based on trade remedies would increase eligibility and identify potential challenges. To address these questions, GAO analyzed data on TAA petitions, mass layoffs, trade, production, and trade remedies. GAO also interviewed Labor and ITC officials. GAO is not making recommendations at this time. Labor reviewed the report and did not provide comments. The ITC provided technical comments that have been incorporated as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["During the past 3 fiscal years, Labor certified about two-thirds of TAA petitions investigated and generally processed petitions in a timely manner. Labor certified 4,700, or 66 percent, of the 7,100 petitions it investigated from fiscal years 2004 to 2006. Labor took on average 32 days to make a certification decision and processed 77 percent of petitions within the required 40-day time frame. According to Labor officials, they were not always able to meet the 40-day time frame because they sometimes did not receive information from company officials in a timely manner. In fiscal year 2006, 44 percent of the petitions that Labor denied were because workers were not involved in the production of an article. An industry certification approach based on three petitions certified in 180 days would likely increase the number of workers eligible for TAA but presents some design and implementation challenges. However, the extent of the increase in eligible workers depends on the additional criteria, if any, industries would have to meet to be certified. From 2003 to 2005, 222 industries had three petitions certified within 180 days. Based on our analysis of 69 of these industries for which we could obtain complete data, the number of eligible workers in these industries could more than double if no additional criteria were used, but would expand by less than 10 percent if industries had to meet more restrictive criteria, such as demonstrated increases in the import share of the domestic market over a 3-year period. Designing the criteria presents challenges due to the possibility of making workers who lose their jobs for reasons other than trade eligible for TAA. Implementation challenges include notifying all workers of their potential eligibility, verifying their eligibility, and linking them with services. Using trade remedies to certify industries could also expand eligibility for workers in some industries, but challenges exist. While basing industry certification on trade remedies could expand eligibility in areas where there have been no TAA petitions, some trade remedies are for products already covered by TAA petitions, such as iron and steel products. It is difficult to estimate the extent of the impact on worker eligibility because trade remedies are applied to specific products, and data on unemployment by product do not exist. This approach presents many of the same challenges as industry certification based on three petitions certified in 180 days. For example, workers who did not lose their jobs due to international trade could be made eligible for TAA because trade remedy investigations are not focused on employment. In addition, verifying workers' eligibility may be particularly challenging due to the narrow product classifications of some trade remedy products, such as carbazole violet pigment 23. In companies that make multiple products, it may be difficult to identify which specific workers made the product subject to trade remedies."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since 2000, more than 3 million jobs have been lost in the manufacturing  Since 2000, more than 3 million jobs have been lost in the manufacturing  sector due to a range of factors, including international trade.

Congress is now considering approaches that would  facilitate certifying entire industries for TAA. One approach being  considered would make an industry eligible to be investigated for possible  certification when Labor certifies three petitions from that industry within  180 days. An investigation would determine whether the entire industry  has been affected by trade and, therefore, whether workers in any future  layoff in that industry should automatically be eligible for TAA. Another  approach would require certification of an industry with a trade remedy.  Trade remedies include, for example, a duty imposed on an imported  product because the Department of Commerce found the product had  been subsidized and the International Trade Commission (ITC) found that  a domestic industry had been injured by the unfair trade practices. To  better understand the potential effects of certifying entire industries for  TAA, you asked us to assess the implications of having industrywide  certification.

Due to data limitations, our analysis of the impact of an industry  certification approach based on three petitions certified in 180 days is  limited to a subset of industries for which we were able to obtain complete  information.

The 222 are a diverse set of industries, including textiles,  apparel, wooden household furniture, motor vehicle parts and accessories,  certain plastic products, and printed circuit boards (see app. III for a list of  the 222 industries).", "The proposals for this approach include a requirement that an  investigation be initiated after an industry meets the three certifications in  180 days criterion. This investigation would use some additional criteria to  determine whether these certifications represent a broad industrywide  phenomenon or just a collection of firms experiencing similar pressures  from foreign trade. As a result, not all 222 industries would likely be  certified industrywide. The additional criteria that an industry would have  to meet to be certified have not yet been specified, but they could include  factors such as the extent to which an industry has been impacted by  imports, changes in production levels in the industry, or changes in  employment levels.", "The number of workers that would become eligible for TAA through an  industry certification approach depends on what additional criteria are  established. For example, we analyzed 69 industries in the manufacturing  sector for which we had comprehensive data on petitions, unemployment,  trade and production. These industries represent about one-third of the  222 industries that would have been eligible for industrywide certification  (13 percent of industries with petitions certified). If there were no  additional criteria beyond the 3 petitions criteria and all of the   69 industries had been certified, the number of workers eligible for TAA in  these industries would have more than doubled over the number that were  actually certified under the current layoff-by-layoff process. However, if  certification were limited to those industries that also had a 10 percent  increase in the import share of the domestic market over a 1-year period,  we estimated that the increase in eligible workers in these industries  would have been more modest, at roughly 70 percent. Under a slightly  more restrictive criterion\u2014a 15 percent increase in the import share of the  domestic market\u2014the increase in the number of eligible workers would  be less, an estimated 39 percent in those 69 industries (see fig. 4). If we  were able to analyze the program as a whole the magnitude of the  increases would likely be different. This would occur, in part, because  the number of workers would increase only in those industries that met  the three petition criterion and would not increase in those that did not  meet the criterion. Thus the multiplier we developed for the 69 industries  could not be applied broadly to all 515 industries with certified petitions.", "More stringent criteria would result in a smaller increase in the number of  workers eligible for TAA. For example, if over a 3-year period, an industry  were required to have a 15 percent increase in the import share of the  domestic market in 1 year, as well as increases in the import share during  the 2 other years, we estimated that there would have been a 9 percent  increase in the number of workers eligible for TAA in the 69 industries we  analyzed.

Any industrywide  approach raises the possibility of certifying workers who were not  adversely affected by trade. Even in industries that are heavily  impacted by trade, workers could lose their jobs for other reasons,  such as the work being relocated domestically. For example, Labor  officials told us that they have denied petitions in the apparel industry,  which has been heavily impacted by trade, because the layoff was not  related to trade but occurred as a result of work being moved to  another domestic location. The risk of certifying non-trade affected  workers increases with more lenient criteria for industrywide  certification. On the other hand, narrow criteria may limit the potential  benefits of industry certification because few industries would be  certified. Furthermore, using the same thresholds for all industries  would not take into account industry-specific patterns in trade and  other economic factors. For example, the import share of the domestic  market may be volatile and change significantly from year to year in  some industries, while other industries may experience smaller year-to- year growth in imports that could represent a significant impact over  time.", "Determining appropriate duration of certification. Determining the  length of time that an industry would be certified may also present  challenges. If the length of time is too short, Labor may bear the  administrative burden of frequently re-investigating industries that  continue to experience trade-related layoffs after the initial  certification expires. In addition, a shorter duration may make it  difficult for workers to know whether their industry is certified at the  particular time that they are laid off. As a result, workers may not know  whether they need to file a regular TAA petition to become certified.  However, if the time period is too long, workers may continue to be  eligible for TAA even if conditions change and an industry is no longer  adversely affected by trade.", "Defining the industries. How the industries are defined would  significantly affect the number of workers who would become eligible  for TAA through an industry certification approach. Our analysis  defined industries according to industry classification systems used by  government statistical agencies. However, some of these industry  categories are broad and may encompass products that are not  adversely affected by trade. On the other hand, certain products within  an industry that, as a whole, does not show evidence of a trade impact  may have been adversely affected by trade. For example, the men\u2019s  footwear industry might not be classified as adversely trade-impacted  because it did not have a 15 percent increase in the import share of the  domestic market over a 1-year period, but it is possible that certain  types of men\u2019s footwear, such as casual shoes or boots, could be  adversely impacted by trade. More narrow definitions would reduce the  possibility of certifying workers who are not adversely affected by  trade, but doing so would cover fewer workers and could increase the  administrative burden for Labor because it might have to investigate  more industries.", "Notifying workers and initiating the delivery of services. Notifying  workers of their eligibility for TAA has been a challenge and would  continue to be under industry certification. Under the current  certification process, workers are linked to services through the  petition process. The specific firm is identified on the petition  application, and state and local workforce agencies work through the  firm to reach workers in layoffs of all sizes. However, getting lists of  employees affected by layoffs and contacting them is sometimes a  challenge for states and would remain so under industry certification.  For industry certification, however, there are no such procedures in  place to notify all potentially eligible workers in certified industries.  For large layoffs in a certified industry, state and local workforce  agencies could potentially use some of the processes they currently  have in place to connect with workers, but it is not apparent that there  would be a built-in link to workers in small layoffs. In large layoffs,  firms with 100 or more employees are generally required to provide   60-days advance notice to state and local workforce agencies, who then  work with the firm to provide rapid response services and inform  workers about the various services and benefits available, including  TAA. However, in smaller layoffs in certified industries, or when firms  do not provide advance notice, workforce agencies would not know  that the layoff has occurred and therefore would not be able to notify  the workers of their eligibility for TAA.", "Verifying worker eligibility. Verifying that a worker was laid off from  a job in a certified industry to ensure that only workers eligible for TAA  receive TAA benefits may be more of a challenge under industry  certification than under the current system. For example, it may be  difficult to identify the specific workers who made a product in the  certified industry if their employer also makes products that are not  covered under industry-wide certification. In order to realize one of the  potential benefits of industry certification\u2014reduced processing time\u2014 this verification process would need to take less time than it takes  workers to become certified through the layoff-by-layoff certification  process. As we noted, Labor takes on average 32 days to complete its  investigation of a petition, but it generally takes additional time for  individuals to be notified of their eligibility. In addition, determining  which entity would conduct this verification may also present  challenges.

Furthermore, trade remedies are intended to mitigate the trade-related  factors that caused the injury to the industry, so employment conditions in  an industry could improve after the trade remedy is in place. In addition,  as with the other industrywide approach, notifying workers in industries  with trade remedies and connecting them with services would also be a  challenge, as well as verifying that they were laid off from a certified  industry. The verification process could be particularly challenging with  an approach based on trade remedies because of the narrow product  classifications of some trade remedy products. In firms that make multiple  products, for example, more than one type of stainless steel pipe, it may be  difficult to identify which specific workers worked on the products  subject to trade remedies.", "An ITC official also expressed concern that seeking a waiver to share  information collected during injury investigations with Labor could  hamper ITC\u2019s ability to collect confidential business information from  firms. By statute, the ITC cannot share with other government agencies  business proprietary information submitted to it in a trade remedies  investigation without a waiver from the submitter."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Labor and the  International Trade Commission.

We also identified potential  challenges with an industry certification approach. To address these  questions, we analyzed Labor\u2019s data on TAA petitions, the Bureau of Labor  Statistics\u2019 Mass Layoff Statistics data, the Census Bureau\u2019s data on trade  and production, and the International Trade Commission\u2019s data on trade  remedies. In examining recent trends in Labor\u2019s certification of TAA  petitions, we analyzed Labor\u2019s petitions data from fiscal years 2004 to  2006. However, in estimating the extent to which industry certification  would increase the number of eligible workers, we analyzed data from  calendar years 2003 to 2005 because that was the most recent time period  that trade, production, and Mass Layoffs Statistics data were all available.

We assessed  the reliability of key data by interviewing Labor officials knowledgeable  about the data, observing a demonstration of the database, reviewing our  prior assessments of the data, and conducting edit checks. For a small  number of petitions, we identified logical inconsistencies or missing  values in the data. We brought these issues to the attention of Labor  officials and worked with them to correct the issues before conducting our  analysis. Complete data on reasons petitions were denied were only  available for fiscal year 2006 because Labor only began to collect the data  in 2005. As a result, we reported information on reasons petitions were  denied for only fiscal year 2006.", "In analyzing the number of petitions denied for TAA that were appealed to  Labor, we did not include in our analysis petitions that were appealed only  for a denial of Alternative Trade Adjustment Assistance (ATAA) wage  insurance benefits.

We then analyzed  the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Extended Mass Layoff Statistics survey to  determine the number of workers who had been laid off in those  industries. We used this data as a proxy for the full number of workers  that would have been eligible for TAA had an industrywide certification  process been in place at the time. We also collected Census trade data  (imports and exports) by industry and Census production data.", "Of the 222 industries that had three petitions certified in 180 days from  2003 to 2005, we were able to analyze 69 industries for which we had  comprehensive data. The available data sources used different industry  classification systems which we matched to each other. Labor\u2019s petitions  data classified industries according to the Standard Industrial  Classification System (SIC), while the Mass Layoff Statistics and Census\u2019  trade and production data classified industries based on variations of the  North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). In addition, our  production data, from Census\u2019 Annual Survey of Manufacturers, was  limited to manufacturing industries. We were able to find complete and  well-defined matches (one-to-one NAICS to SIC, or many-to-one NAICS to  SIC) between the SIC- and NAICS-defined industries for 69 of the   222 industries. We could not use data on industries where a NAICS code  corresponded to multiple SIC codes. Because the 69 industries were not  drawn from a random sample, the results of our analysis are not  necessarily representative of the entire 222 industries.", "In analyzing Labor\u2019s petitions data to identify the industries that would  have met the three petitions certified in 180 days criteria during 2003 to  2005, we added an additional criterion to our analysis, that the three  petitions had to be from three different companies. When companies lay  off workers at multiple divisions or locations, they may file separate  petitions for each division or location. We added the criterion to prevent  an industry from becoming eligible to be considered for certification when  the three petitions were from the same company.", "In estimating the number of workers certified for TAA under the current  program, we used estimates from Labor\u2019s petitions data on the number of  workers affected by a layoff at the time that TAA petitions are filed with  the Department of Labor. At the time petitions are submitted, companies  may not know exactly how many workers will be affected. The  Department of Labor does not collect information on the number of  workers ultimately certified. We used these data to estimate the increases  in the number of workers who might be eligible for TAA with the addition  of an industry certification approach. They should not be relied upon to  support precise numbers on workers certified for TAA.", "In estimating the increase in worker eligibility, we used data from the  Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Mass Layoff Statistics program to estimate the  number of unemployed workers in industries that could have been eligible  for industrywide certification. The Mass Layoff Statistics program collects  reports on mass layoff actions that result in workers being separated from  their jobs. Monthly mass layoff numbers are from establishments which  have at least 50 initial claims for unemployment insurance (UI) filed  against them during a 5-week period. Extended mass layoff numbers  (issued quarterly) are from a subset of such establishments\u2014private- sector nonfarm employers who indicate that 50 or more workers were  separated from their jobs for at least 31 days. We used Extended Mass  Layoffs to reduce the possibility of including workers who were on  temporary layoff and subject to recall.", "Several limitations of the Mass Layoff Statistics data are relevant to this  analysis. First, Mass Layoff Statistics only include workers from larger  firms (workers with at least 50 employees). It also only includes workers  laid off through larger layoffs (layoffs of at least 50 employees). In 2003,  there were 1,404,331 initial claims in the Extended Mass Layoffs. In  contrast, estimated unemployment due to permanent layoffs in 2003 was  2,846,000, and total unemployment in 2003 was 8,774,000. Thus, workers  involved in extended mass layoffs represented 49 percent of permanent  layoffs and 16 percent of total unemployment in 2003.", "Second, the Bureau of Labor Statistics suppressed MLS data on the  number of layoffs and the number of workers in the data they provided to  us, when the number of layoffs in an industry was less than three.", "Approximately 40 percent of the data were suppressed. The results  reported here reflect the following imputation criterion. Suppressed values  were imputed with the mean number of laid-off workers per layoff event  within the broad industry group (by year), multiplied by 1.5. We also  conducted sensitivity analysis where we used more conservative  imputation criteria; results were not highly sensitive to the criterion we  selected.", "In order to identify changes in trade related to individual industries, we  calculated the share of imports in the domestic market for each year  between 2002 and 2005. We defined the domestic market as U.S. domestic  production (measured by shipments) minus exports plus imports. We then  calculated the change in the import share of the domestic market from  2002 to 2003, 2003 to 2004, and 2004 to 2005. We examined the distribution  of these changes annually across industries and calculated sample  statistics. The mean change for the 69 industries was 6.1 percent in 2003,  13.01 percent in 2004, and 3.5 percent in 2005. The standard deviation for  these industries was 11.0 percent in 2003, 30.25 percent in 2004, and   13.74 percent in 2005. We also compared these statistics to those of the  entire population of 222 industries and found that they were similar. Based  on this analysis, we determined that using criteria of annual changes of   10, 15, and 20 percent for the share of imports in the domestic market was  reasonable to illustrate the impact of changing criteria on the number of  potential workers eligible for TAA.
