Repayment is to be made through revenues from federal power sales. You expressed concern about issues we previously reported related to the under-recovery of certain power-related costs and the large amount of debt outstanding\u2014more than $14 billion as of September 30, 1997. Specifically, you asked us to determine (1) whether DOE or the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) actively monitors the amount of debt to be repaid and the appropriateness of the annual payments and (2) whether there is a potential for financial loss to the federal government as a result of any lack of such monitoring of the repayment.", "We evaluated the effectiveness of the existing monitoring activities to determine whether they ensure that repayment amounts are complete, accurate, and timely.

Most of these facilities were constructed and continue to be owned and operated by the Bureau and Corps (operating agencies). The operating agencies constructed these facilities as part of a larger effort to develop multipurpose water projects that have functions in addition to power generation, such as flood control, irrigation, navigation, and recreation. As required by law, the PMAs give preference in the sale of power to public power customers. These preference customers include public utility and irrigation districts, customer-owned cooperatives, municipally-owned utilities, and, in some cases, state governments and the federal government.", "With the exception of Bonneville, the Congress appropriates money each year to the PMAs for power-related purposes and to the operating agencies for both power and nonpower purposes. The PMAs, other than Bonneville, generally receive appropriations annually to cover operations and maintenance expenses (O&M) and, if applicable, capital investments in their transmission assets. Since 1974, Bonneville has operated without annual appropriations from the Congress and has financed its activities through a revolving fund. Bonneville is, however, responsible for repaying its pre-1974 appropriations. The operating agencies receive appropriations for all aspects of their multipurpose water projects, including O&M expenses and capital expenditures. The portion of these appropriations expended for power-related purposes is allocated to the PMAs for repayment by power customers.", "Section 9(c) of the Reclamation Project Act of 1939 and section 5 of the Flood Control Act of 1944 generally require that the PMAs recover through power rates the costs of producing, transmitting, and marketing federal hydropower. Bonneville is covered additionally under the Northwest Power Act. In addition, the PMAs that market power from multipurpose projects also having irrigation as a purpose\u2014Bonneville and Western\u2014are responsible for repaying certain irrigation assistance costs. Costs are recovered by the PMAs through rates charged the customers who benefit from the federal power. The PMAs generally repay appropriations expended for O&M expenses in the same year that the expenses are incurred, but generally repay appropriations expended for capital investments and other debt, with interest, within the repayment period prescribed by law and/or DOE order.", "As shown in table 1, the PMAs differ substantially in annual revenues and the amount of outstanding debt to be repaid to the federal government. Table 1 and the notes thereto include information on (1) the outstanding appropriated debt and irrigation costs that are to be repaid by the PMAs, (2) Bonneville Power Administration Treasury bonds, and (3) certain nonfederal debt.", "DOE\u2019s policy for implementing the cost recovery requirement is set forth in DOE Order RA 6120.2, which states that all costs of operating and maintaining the power system, as well as transmission and irrigation assistance costs, are generally to be included in the rates set by the PMAs. This order does not specifically identify and define all costs that must be recovered. To define the full costs associated with producing, transmitting, and marketing the federal hydropower, we referred to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-25 and federal financial accounting standards recommended by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) and adopted by GAO, OMB, and Treasury. OMB Circular A-25 defines the full costs of providing goods or services\u2014in this case federal power marketed by the PMAs\u2014as all direct and indirect costs of delivering those goods or services. The federal financial accounting standard defines the full costs of an entity\u2019s outputs as \u201cthe sum of (1) the costs of resources consumed by the segment that directly or indirectly contribute to the output, and (2) the costs of identifiable supporting services provided by other responsibility segments within the reporting entity, and by other reporting entities.\u201d As we reported in 1996, applying these definitions of full cost, the full cost of the power marketed by the PMAs includes all direct and indirect costs incurred by the operating agencies to produce the power, the PMAs to market and transmit the power, and any other agencies to support the operating agencies and PMAs.", "DOE Order RA 6120.2 requires the PMAs to annually conduct power repayment studies to evaluate whether power rates are sufficient to recover all costs that must be repaid within the rate-making period. These power repayment studies form the basis for setting the PMAs\u2019 rates. Specifically, the power repayment studies must identify, among other things, estimated revenues, expenses, repayments of debt, and the total amount of debt to be repaid generally over the next 50 years.", "Under the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977 (DOE Act), the Secretary of Energy is responsible for monitoring the PMAs to ensure that all applicable costs are recovered. The Secretary has delegated to the Deputy Secretary the primary responsibility for PMA-related issues. The Deputy Secretary\u2019s office is to review the rate proposals of the three PMAs before they are sent to FERC for review.

The Secretary\u2019s delegation order and legislation limit FERC\u2019s review authority.", "The public also plays a role in the rate review process. Whenever a PMA proposes a new rate, a public hearing process takes place to obtain input on the proposed rate. This process ensures that members of the public, such as PMA customers, have an opportunity to provide input for the PMAs\u2019 consideration before the rate becomes effective. According to DOE and FERC officials, most comments received during this public process are received from customers, who have an incentive to keep rates as low as possible.", "See appendix II for more information on the legal responsibilities and delegated authorities regarding PMA rate-making."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Monitoring of Repayment Is Ineffective", "paragraphs": ["Current monitoring activities do not ensure that all power-related costs are recovered and that cost recovery issues identified in audit reports are resolved in a timely manner.

The sole staff person in the Office of the Secretary involved in doing this told us that he spends most of his time on national energy policy issues, such as the administration\u2019s recent proposal for restructuring the electricity industry. He estimated that only about 30 percent of his time is spent on PMA activities, little of which is devoted to detailed review of rate-making and cost recovery issues. As a result, the Deputy Secretary\u2019s office does not perform the monitoring activities necessary to ensure that all of the appropriate costs are included in the PMAs\u2019 power repayment studies, on which rates are based.

Although FERC has the authority to do so, FERC officials told us that when reviewing a rate proposal they generally do not obtain and review documentation related to the three PMAs\u2019 costs, such as audit reports that have raised cost recovery issues, beyond that provided by the three PMAs. Under Department of Energy Delegation Order 0204-108, FERC\u2019s review of the three PMAs\u2019 rates includes assessing (1) whether the rates are the lowest possible to customers consistent with sound business principles, (2) whether the revenue levels generated by the rates are sufficient to recover the costs of producing and transmitting electric energy, and (3) the assumptions and projections used in developing the rate components. However, according to FERC officials, the delegation order allows FERC to reject a rate proposal only if it finds the proposal to be \u201carbitrary, capricious or in violation of law.\u201d According to FERC officials, since this standard for rejection imposes a significant practical limitation on FERC\u2019s review of the three PMAs\u2019 rates, FERC rarely disapproves a rate request. FERC officials told us that they have rejected a rate proposal on only one occasion. This proposal was by Western for the Parker-Davis Project and FERC rejected it because it did not provide for the recovery of significant expected costs of future power facility additions and replacements.", "FERC\u2019s review and final approval of Bonneville\u2019s rates is authorized under the Northwest Power Act. This act requires FERC to assess whether Bonneville\u2019s rates (1) are sufficient to ensure repayment of the federal investment in the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS), (2) are based on total system costs, and (3) reflect equitable allocation of transmission system costs between federal and nonfederal users. However, FERC\u2019s review of Bonneville\u2019s rate proposals is limited by its interpretation of two court opinions issued by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which is statutorily charged with reviewing actions arising under the Northwest Power Act. FERC has interpreted the opinions to mean that it may not obtain and review documentation other than that provided by Bonneville and therefore FERC generally does not request additional documentation from Bonneville in its consideration of Bonneville\u2019s rate proposals. In one case, the court held that under the Northwest Power Act, FERC\u2019s review of rates is limited to the three previously mentioned standards specified in the act and that FERC\u2019s limited review properly reflects congressional desire to limit its role to financial oversight rather than rate-making. In a second case, the court held that FERC should not seek new evidence in reviewing Bonneville\u2019s rate proposals. Instead, the court held that FERC should evaluate the evidence developed by Bonneville, which is required to develop a \u201cfull and complete record\u201d under section 7.(i) of the Northwest Power Act. As a result of its interpretation of these court opinions, FERC generally does not request additional documentation and limits its review to the documentation submitted with Bonneville\u2019s rate proposals.", "For all four PMAs, FERC analyzes the PMA-provided information to determine whether the proposed rates appear to be sufficient to recover the costs the PMAs have included in the power repayment studies.

According to FERC officials, they rely on the financial and other data provided by the PMAs, and not on other evidence, such as audit reports. Based on its restricted analysis, FERC either approves or disapproves the PMAs\u2019 rate proposals; it cannot modify a proposed rate.

In 1996, and again in 1997, we reported that the PMAs still were not recovering the full costs to the federal government of providing these benefits. We reported that the full costs of providing CSRS pensions were not being recovered because the combined contributions of federal employees and the PMAs do not cover the federal government\u2019s full cost of providing these benefits, including payments by other federal agencies.

In fiscal years 1994 and 1995, Western developed a common approach for all projects designed to ensure that it recovered this interest in the future. However, Western\u2019s external auditor reported that the problem had not yet been resolved as of the end of fiscal year 1995. Specifically, the auditor reported that certain area offices had not calculated interest on an allocated amount of movable equipment located at headquarters. Western did not address this issue until 1996, when it began charging interest on the balance of all moveable equipment. However, according to Western\u2019s external auditor, Western did not retroactively charge interest on moveable equipment for years prior to 1993.", "We also found an error related to the calculation of interest on deferred assets at the Truman Project, marketed by Southwestern. Because of fish kills, the project has never operated at its 160,000 kilowatt capacity; instead, only 53,300 kilowatts have been declared to be in commercial operation. As a result, Southwestern has deferred from recovery the estimated costs\u2014$31 million\u2014of the nonoperational portion of the Truman Project. However, Southwestern\u2019s stated policy is to recover the interest expense of the Truman deferred investment annually.", "Until 1994, the Corps calculated the interest expense for Truman and other projects marketed by Southwestern. Interest costs were to be based on the entire power-related construction costs of these projects, including the $31 million Truman deferral. In 1995, Southwestern began calculating the interest expense on the projects it markets. However, Southwestern\u2019s fiscal year 1995 calculation of interest expense for the Truman project mistakenly excluded interest associated with the $31 million Truman deferral. As a result, about $930,000 in interest on the Truman deferral was not recovered. Southwestern officials acknowledged the mistake and said that the underpayment of interest would be corrected in fiscal year 1996. Southwestern did subsequently recover the $930,000 associated with the Truman deferral, along with approximately $71,000 in additional accrued interest.", "As a result of its fiscal year 1994 financial statement audit, Southeastern\u2019s external auditor informed Southeastern\u2019s management that, in several instances, the Corps had improperly calculated interest expense on the federal government\u2019s outstanding power-related appropriations. According to the auditor, these errors resulted from the misinterpretation of the interest calculation guidance. For example, the external auditor reported that since 1983, three Corps district offices had not applied the current interest rate on plant additions, even though the policy has been to use current interest rates since 1983. Instead, the Corps had been using the original project interest rates, which for 1984 through 1994 ranged from a low of 2.5 percent to a high of 6.1 percent. These interest rates were considerably lower than the 7.1 to 12.4 percent interest rates that should have been applied to hydropower investments during this period.", "Under a methodology proposed by its auditor, Southeastern estimated that as of September 30, 1994, using the incorrect interest rates had understated interest expense by about $1.7 million at two of its four rate-making systems. Southeastern officials did not agree with the methodology proposed by its auditor and told us that the $1.7 million represents the maximum amount of the interest understatement. Southeastern subsequently took over the calculation of interest on federal investment that had previously been done by the Corps; however, it did not determine the total magnitude of the error. Southeastern officials told us that they do not plan to recover these costs because they considered them immaterial to Southeastern\u2019s financial statements. We do not agree that materiality in relation to financial statements is the appropriate criteria for deciding whether to recover a known power-related cost.", "Similarly, as a result of its fiscal year 1994 financial statement audit, Southwestern\u2019s external auditor informed Southwestern\u2019s management that, for the years 1984 through 1988, the Corps had used interest rates lower than those that should have been used to calculate interest on additions to the federal power facilities marketed by Southwestern. The auditor also noted that, as of fiscal year 1994, three Corps districts had continued to use the lower interest rates to calculate interest. Southwestern adjusted its books to properly record interest expense for fiscal years 1989 through 1995 when it took over responsibility for calculating interest on investment from the Corps in fiscal year 1995. However, as of fiscal year 1996, Southwestern had not applied the appropriate interest rates to additions to the federal investment for fiscal years 1984 through 1988, and Southwestern officials told us that they do not plan to do so.", "A long delay in recovering the costs of a transmission line on which construction began in 1965, and which was later abandoned, is another example of the ineffectiveness of the current monitoring system. According to the Bureau, a transmission line, which was planned to be part of the Pacific Northwest-Pacific Southwest Intertie Project, was abandoned in fiscal year 1969 due to sporadic funding. Western and its external auditor agreed in 1996 that the total unrecovered amount for the abandoned transmission line was about $20 million. However, even though these costs were power-related, Western was able to delay making any principal or interest payments to the federal government until 1997, about 28 years after the project had been abandoned.", "The current monitoring efforts do not ensure that costs such as those described above are fully recovered, and therefore that the federal government does not incur unnecessary losses on power-related activities. It is important to note that although the aforementioned unrecovered costs have been documented, there is no assurance that all unrecovered costs have been identified. Other instances of under-recovery could exist which we did not identify as a result of the limited scope of our work. Thus, the full magnitude of the unrecovered costs is unknown. If the PMAs were to begin recovering all of these costs, in many cases they would first need to develop estimates of the amounts to be recovered in cooperation with the appropriate operating agency. These estimated costs would then need to be included in the PMAs\u2019 power repayment studies and rates for recovery, as is commonly done now for other costs.

In addition, the revision indicated that the operating agencies\u2019 policy judgments and interpretations of laws and regulations were not reviewable by FERC. These limitations significantly reduced FERC\u2019s ability to ensure that all power-related costs are included in the three PMAs\u2019 rates.", "Prior to the passage of the Northwest Power Act in 1980, the DOE delegation order to FERC applied to all PMAs, including Bonneville.

These reviews should assess (1) the appropriateness of the assumptions and methodologies used in the power repayment studies, (2) whether all power-related costs are included, and (3) whether appropriate interest rates are used by the PMAs and operating agencies to calculate interest to be charged on completed projects or capitalized for projects being constructed. The results of the reviews should be summarized in written reports. These independent reviews should initially be done for each power repayment study the next time it is updated. Thereafter, the frequency of the reviews should be based on the results of prior review(s) and assessments of the risk of financial loss to the federal government.

The costs should include not only those for PMA employees, but also those for operating agency employees involved in power-related activities either full-time or part-time, directly or indirectly.

We do not agree. Based on our review, the current monitoring activities are not designed to ensure that repayment is complete, accurate, and timely. For example, none of the activities delineated by the PMAs include detailed reviews of the PMAs\u2019 power repayment studies, upon which rates are based. Therefore, there is little assurance that these repayment studies provide for complete, accurate, and timely repayment of the costs that the federal government is entitled to recover under current law.", "Our report includes several examples of (1) significant power-related costs that historically have not been recovered and (2) the lack of timeliness in resolving cost recovery issues once they were raised. It is important to note that our review was not designed to detect and quantify all losses, but rather to evaluate the effectiveness of the system for monitoring repayment and determine if there was the potential for financial loss to the federal government. Based on our assessment of the monitoring system, we concluded that there is the potential for loss to the federal government, beyond the identified examples in the report, and therefore that the system is ineffective and needs enhancing through closer monitoring of the PMAs\u2019 repayment. However, in response to the PMAs\u2019 comments, we have revised our report to clarify that we are not proposing multiple detailed reviews of the power repayment studies. Instead, the detailed, independent power repayment study reviews should be performed and summaries of the results of those reviews used by DOE to identify issues that require follow-up and resolution with the PMAs and by FERC in assessing the PMAs\u2019 rate proposals.", "The PMAs also stated that the three PMAs\u2019 respective financial statement auditors perform compliance testing which already accomplishes our recommendation that the power repayment studies be independently reviewed to determine whether they provide for complete, accurate, and timely repayment. We do not agree. As we state in the report, the objective of a financial statement audit is to express an opinion as to whether the statements are fairly stated and the audit would not be expected to detect all issues related to repayment or cost recovery. The financial statement audits\u2014and other audits\u2014have not included detailed reviews of the power repayment studies that assessed their completeness, assumptions, methodologies, and the reasonableness of estimates used. Since the existing reviews of the power repayment studies have not included such assessments to ensure that repayment is complete, accurate, and timely, it is not possible to determine whether all cost recovery issues have been identified. Moreover, the PMAs\u2019 assertion relates to the compliance testing at the three PMAs rather than at Bonneville, which receives a different type of audit and less compliance testing, according to a Bonneville official. As we state in our report, some of the same cost recovery issues exist at Bonneville but generally have not been raised by its financial statement auditor in audit reports.", "Additionally, even when cost recovery issues have been identified as part of the audits, they have often not been addressed in a timely manner by the PMAs. For example, the unrecovered CSRS pensions and postretirement health benefits cost issue was first reported by Western\u2019s financial statement auditor as part of its fiscal year 1993 audit and by Southeastern\u2019s and Southwestern\u2019s auditors in 1994, but still has not been fully resolved by PMA management."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Cost Recovery Disagreements Involve Policy Matters", "paragraphs": ["The PMAs stated that the failure to recover costs that we identified in this and previous reports largely involved differing interpretations of law or policy, rather than a failure to follow clear guidance. While differing interpretations of law or policy can lead to a failure to recover power-related costs, this is one reason closer monitoring is needed so that issues can be resolved in a more timely manner. For example, as discussed above, Western\u2019s financial statement auditor first recommended that Western begin recovering CSRS pension and postretirement health benefits costs in 1993. This issue has only recently begun to be resolved. Some of the delay in resolving the issue could be attributable to differing interpretations of law or policy. However, a monitoring system at the DOE level would likely have identified this as an issue that might also exist elsewhere and would have facilitated quick resolution at all four PMAs to ensure that the federal government did not continue to suffer financial loss. As we state in our report, the amount of the four PMAs\u2019 unrecovered CSRS pension and postretirement health benefits costs over a 5-year period (fiscal years 1992-1996) was an estimated $192 million (in constant 1996 dollars). This financial loss could have been mitigated by timely identification of the scope of the problem at the DOE level and resolution at each of the PMAs.", "The PMAs also maintain that OMB Circular A-25 and federal accounting standards do not apply when \u201cthe amount to be priced is provided for by statute or regulation.\u201d This statement does not appear to be relevant to the unrecovered costs identified in our report, which the PMAs have now agreed should be recovered. Recovering these power-related costs is in accordance with laws and regulations. Moreover, statutes, regulations, and DOE Order RA 6120.2 require that the PMAs\u2019 power-related costs be included in rates, but do not specifically identify and define all costs that must be recovered. Therefore, using guidance set forth by OMB Circular A-25 and federal accounting standards to help define the full costs of federal power is appropriate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Description of Unrecovered Costs Is Misleading", "paragraphs": ["The PMAs state that the description of unrecovered power-related costs included in our report is misleading in that it claims that four types of power-related costs are not being recovered. The PMAs further state that they generally agree that these costs should be recovered and have been taking steps to ensure that this occurs, beginning in fiscal year 1998. They also object to our characterization of progress towards resolving problems as slow or nonexistent. However, as our report demonstrates, progress toward resolving some of the cost recovery issues has been slow. For example, Western delayed making principal or interest payments on a transmission line for about 28 years after the project was abandoned. The total amount of the unrecovered costs during that time period was approximately $20 million.", "No progress has been made toward resolving certain other cost recovery issues. For example, our report discusses unrecovered workers compensation costs at Southeastern that were reported as a result of Southeastern\u2019s fiscal year 1995 financial statement audit. The PMAs\u2019 comments acknowledge that these costs should be included in rates; however, no progress has been made to do so. In addition, Western\u2019s financial statement auditor reported as part of its fiscal year 1993 financial statement audit that Western was not recovering about $3 million annually in interest on moveable equipment. Western subsequently recovered interest for 1993 and later years; however, it has not taken any steps to recover interest for prior years, even though DOE policy has always been to recover interest on the federal government\u2019s outstanding investment in power-related activities. Similarly, our report describes unrecovered interest costs at Southeastern and Southwestern related to the application of incorrect interest rates to the federal investment that remain unrecovered.", "The PMAs state that many of the findings reported by the external auditors and GAO were initially raised by PMA personnel. They also state that because the errors related to unrecovered interest on federal investments at certain projects were raised by the three PMAs\u2019 external auditors, that \u201cit is apparent that the present oversight and monitoring practices are working.\u201d We do not agree.

Discussed in the \u201cAgency Comments and Our Evaluation\u201d section of the report. 2. Our involvement in raising cost recovery issues to the Congress should not be considered a part of the monitoring process designed by the Secretary of Energy to ensure that he or she fulfills his or her responsibility to recover these costs. Our audit work is generally performed at the specific request of the Congress and cannot be considered to be routine, ongoing monitoring of PMA activity. 3. We believe that the return of the federal government\u2019s investment in the PMAs\u2019 power-related activities to the Treasury through scheduled payments is an expectation of the federal government and the taxpayers, and should not necessarily be thought of as a record of achievement. While we agree that the PMAs have made substantial repayments to Treasury on a timely basis, this report and our previous reports clearly point out that the PMAs have not recovered all of the costs that the federal government has incurred to produce, market, and transmit federal power. 4. We disagree. There should not be diversity among the PMAs in recovering the costs discussed, or in recovering other costs that are power-related. Clarifying the requirement that these costs be recovered in DOE Order RA 6120.2 would help ensure the necessary consistency among the PMAs and, as discussed previously, would avoid any confusion which might arise from differing interpretations regarding these costs in the future. Moreover, significant unrecovered cost categories identified in future monitoring efforts, such as detailed reviews of the PMAs\u2019 power repayment studies, should be specified as recovery requirements in the DOE Order. In addition, since Bonneville is not subject to the delegation order under which DOE reviews the other three PMAs\u2019 rate proposals before they are sent to FERC, monitoring of cost recovery issues at Bonneville at the DOE level is curtailed; clarifying cost recovery guidance in DOE Order RA 6120.2 is especially important to ensure power-related costs are treated alike among all the PMAs. 5.
