However, recent analyses of the GOES-R program cost--which in May 2006 the program office estimated could reach $11.4 billion--have led the agency to consider reducing the scope of requirements for the satellite series. Since our report was issued, NOAA officials told GAO that the agency has made a decision to reduce the scope of the program to a minimum of two satellites and to reduce the complexity of the program by canceling a technically complex instrument. NOAA has taken steps to implement lessons learned from past satellite programs, but more remains to be done. Prior satellite programs--including a prior GOES series, a polar-orbiting environmental satellite series, and various military satellite programs--often experienced technical challenges, cost overruns, and schedule delays. Key lessons from these programs include the need to (1) establish realistic cost and schedule estimates, (2) ensure sufficient technical readiness of the system's components prior to key decisions, (3) provide sufficient management at government and contractor levels, and (4) perform adequate senior executive oversight to ensure mission success. NOAA has established plans to address these lessons by conducting independent cost estimates, performing preliminary studies of key technologies, placing resident government offices at key contractor locations, and establishing a senior executive oversight committee.

NOAA operates GOES as a two-satellite system that is  primarily focused on the United States (see fig. 1). These satellites  are uniquely positioned to provide timely environmental data to  meteorologists and their audiences on the earth\u2019s atmosphere, its  surface, cloud cover, and the space environment. They also observe  the development of hazardous weather, such as hurricanes and  severe thunderstorms, and track their movement and intensity to  reduce or avoid major losses of property and life.

NOAA is also planning a future  generation of satellites, known as the GOES-R series, which are  planned for launch beginning in 2012.", "Each of the operational geostationary satellites continuously  transmits raw environmental data to NOAA ground stations. The  data are processed at these ground stations and transmitted back to  the satellite for broadcast to primary weather services both in the  United States and around the world, including the global research  community. Raw and processed data are also distributed to users  via ground stations through other communication channels, such as  dedicated private communication lines and the Internet.

Table 3 summarizes the originally planned instruments and their  expected capabilities.", "The program management structure for the GOES-R program differs  from past GOES programs. Prior to the GOES-R series, NOAA was  responsible for program funding, procurement of the ground  elements, and on-orbit operation of the satellites, while NASA was  responsible for the procurement of the spacecraft, instruments, and  launch services.

NASA is responsible for the procurement of the individual  instruments until they are transferred to the overall GOES-R system  contractor for completion and integration onto the spacecraft.  Additionally, to take advantage of NASA\u2019s acquisition experience  and technical expertise, NOAA located the GOES-R program office  at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center. It also designated key  program management positions to be filled with NASA personnel.  These positions include the deputy system program director role for  advanced instrument and technology infusion, the project manager  for the flight portion of the system, and the deputy project manager  for the ground and operations portion of the system.

To date, NOAA has  issued contracts for the preliminary design of the overall GOES-R  system to three vendors and expects to award a contract to one of  these vendors to develop the system. In addition, to reduce the risks  associated with developing new instruments, NASA has issued  contracts for the early development of two instruments and for the  preliminary designs of three other instruments. The agency plans to  award these contracts and then turn them over to the contractor  responsible for the overall GOES-R program.

In May 2006, program officials  estimated that the life cycle cost could reach $11.4 billion. The  agency then requested that the program identify options for  reducing the scope of requirements for the satellite series. Program  officials reported that there were over 10 viable options under  consideration, including options for removing one or more of the  planned instruments. The program office also reevaluated its  planned acquisition schedule based on the potential program  options.

NOAA programs  face similar unrealistic estimates. For example, the total  development cost of the GOES I-M acquisition was over three times  greater than planned, escalating from $640 million to $2 billion.  Additionally, the delivery of the first satellite was delayed by 5 years.", "NOAA has several efforts under way to improve the reliability of its  cost and schedule estimates for the GOES-R program. NOAA\u2019s Chief  Financial Officer has contracted with a cost-estimating firm to  complete an independent cost estimate, while the GOES-R program  office has hired a support contractor to assist with its internal  program cost estimating. The program office is re-assessing its  estimates based on preliminary information from the three vendors  contracted to develop preliminary designs for the overall GOES-R  system.

In addition, NOAA has planned for an independent  review team\u2014consisting of former senior industry and government  space acquisition experts\u2014to provide an assessment of the program  office and independent cost estimates for this decision milestone.  To improve its schedule reliability, the program office is currently  conducting a schedule risk analysis in order to estimate the amount  of adequate reserve funds and schedule margin needed to deal with  unexpected problems and setbacks.

In addition, NOAA suspended the  work being performed by its independent cost estimator. Now that  the program scope and direction is being further defined, it will be  important for the agency to restart this work. Further, the agency  has not yet developed a process to evaluate and reconcile the  independent and program office cost estimates once final program  decisions are made.

One key decision point is  when an agency decides on whether the component is sufficiently  ready to proceed from a preliminary study phase into a development  phase; this decision point results in the award of the development  contract. Another key decision point occurs during the development  phase when an agency decides whether the component is ready to  proceed from design into production (also called the critical design  review). Without sufficient technical readiness at these milestones,  agencies could proceed into development contracts on components  that are not well understood and enter into the production phase of  development with technologies that are not yet mature.", "In 1997, NOAA began preliminary studies on technologies that could  be used on the GOES-R instruments. These studies target existing  technologies and assessed how they could be expanded for GOES-R.

As a result, the contractor is experiencing negative  cost and schedule performance trends. As of May 2006, the  contractor incurred a total cost overrun of almost $6 million with  the instrument\u2019s development only 28 percent complete.
