The Navy's Geothermal Program Office, located at the China Lake Naval Air Weapons Station in California, manages and develops geothermal resources for the military. Currently, two geothermal power plants at China Lake are the only ones on military lands. A private company, which built, owns, and operates the power plants at China Lake, sells the electricity to a utility company and pays the Navy royalties on these sales as well as other types of compensation. GAO was asked to provide information on (1) the Navy's annual revenues from the geothermal facility at China Lake, (2) how the Navy uses the revenues it collects from the geothermal facility, (3) the budget oversight the Navy provides programs funded from geothermal revenues, and (4) how the Navy's geothermal program differs from BLM's program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Navy received three types of payments from the geothermal power plant operator at China Lake that totaled, on average, $14.7 million annually between 1987 and 2003. During these years, the average annual royalty payment on the sale of electricity was about $11.5 million, payments toward the base's electricity bill were about $2.7 million annually, and bonus payments to the base for using less electricity than it had projected averaged about $500,000 annually. The Navy spent about two-thirds of its geothermal revenues on a variety of energy conservation projects, including solar energy systems and updated climate control systems, as well as other energy conservation programs. The Navy spent the other one-third of its geothermal revenues on its Geothermal Program Office, which oversees the activities of the power plant operator and assesses other military sites for geothermal development. The Navy's Shore Energy Policy Board, which includes representatives of the Secretary of the Navy and the Chief of Naval Operations, oversees the budget for most of the programs funded from the geothermal revenues. Typically, at its annual meeting, the board reviews the draft budget for energy conservation programs, determines whether the funding levels are appropriate, and agrees on final allocations. The China Lake base's Renewable Energy Program office oversees the budget for the remaining geothermal revenues. The Navy's geothermal program differs from BLM's program in significant ways. The Navy makes case-by-case decisions regarding geothermal development, invests in the initial exploration to identify geothermal resources, provides close oversight over geothermal production, and keeps all revenues for use by the military. In contrast, BLM uses a standard approach to geothermal development, does not invest in exploration, and does not provide the same level of oversight over resources in production. Also, 50 percent of BLM's geothermal revenues are shared with the state of origin, with the remainder paid to the Department of the Treasury. The Department of Defense provided technical comments on a draft of the report, which GAO addressed as appropriate. BLM said that the report implies that its program is not properly managed. GAO's report is focused on the Navy's program and does not evaluate BLM's program."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Geothermal energy is heat from the earth that is captured by drilling wells,  brought to the surface as hot water or steam, and used to drive turbines to  generate electricity, among other things. It is a renewable resource that  produces very few emissions compared with energy generated from coal,  natural gas, or oil. Geothermal electricity production is currently  concentrated in California and Nevada, although production potential  exists in several other states. The Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 gives the  Secretary of the Interior the authority to lease public lands and certain  other federal lands, including national forest lands, for geothermal  development. The Secretary has delegated this responsibility to the Bureau  of Land Management (BLM).", "Beginning in 1978, Congress passed laws that also gave the Secretary of  each military department the authority to develop geothermal resources on  lands under his jurisdiction and to keep the proceeds from the sale of  electricity generated from those resources for use by the Department of  Defense.

Currently, this office has contracted with a private  company to produce electricity from geothermal energy at one military  installation\u2014the China Lake Naval Air Weapons Station in California. The  Navy is also currently considering contractors to develop a geothermal  power plant at the Fallon Naval Air Station in Nevada. The private  company, which built, owns, and operates the two power plants at China  Lake, sells the electricity to a utility company and pays the Navy royalties  on these sales as well as other types of compensation.

Identifying  geothermal energy sources that can be competitive with other fuels  involves obtaining and analyzing a complex variety of geologic  (characteristics of rocks), geophysical (variation in magnetic and gravity  fields), and geochemical (chemical characteristics of water) data. Although  a wide variety of data can be used to identify an area with a high likelihood  of containing a geothermal resource, positively identifying and defining the  nature of the resource requires drilling a well though the earth\u2019s surface.  According to the Department of Energy, exploration can account for as  much as 60 percent of the cost of a geothermal power project, and most of  the cost of exploration is associated with drilling wells. After wells have  been drilled, they can be used to pump hot water or steam to the surface  and for returning fluids to the reservoir after they have been used to  generate electricity.", "According to a BLM official, geothermal energy from both public and  private land provides about 2,200 megawatts of electric power nationwide.  In 2003, geothermal electricity represented less than 1 percent of the  nation\u2019s total electricity output. According to data compiled by the  Geothermal Energy Association, about 70 percent of the existing  geothermal power plants came on line in the 1980s. Geothermal power  plant construction has declined significantly in the 1990s because of  several factors, including loss of government incentives and the  introduction of low-cost electricity generated from natural gas.", "BLM reviews and approves leases and permits to explore, develop, and  produce geothermal energy on public land and certain other federal lands,  including national forest lands. The agency is also responsible for ensuring  that leaseholders\u2019 geothermal operations comply with BLM\u2019s regulations. In  2003, BLM\u2019s geothermal program had six full-time and seven part-time staff,  most of who were located in BLM field offices in the western United States,  including California, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, and Idaho, among others. The  program\u2019s budget was $1.35 million in fiscal year 2003, which included a  targeted amount of $600,000 for one year only to be spent on processing a  backlog of lease applications in Nevada. The program\u2019s fiscal year 2004  budget is $1.24 million, which does not include any funds targeted for  special projects. There are 34 power plants that use geothermal energy  from BLM leases in three states (California, Nevada, and Utah). These  power plants have a total electricity production capacity of about 1,200  megawatts, according to BLM.", "Although BLM has the primary responsibility for leasing public and certain  other federal lands for geothermal development, on several occasions,  Congress has passed laws that have given the Department of Defense the  authority to develop geothermal resources on lands under its jurisdiction.   In 1978, Public Law 95-356 authorized the Secretary of each military  department to develop, for the use or benefit of the Department of Defense,  any geothermal energy source within lands under the department\u2019s  jurisdiction, other than public lands administered by the Secretary of the  Interior. The law specified that the military could contract for a period not  to exceed 30 years \u201cfor the provision and operation of energy production  facilities.\u201d  In 1982, Public Law 97-214 expanded the military\u2019s ability to  develop and use geothermal resources by extending its authority to public  lands set aside for military purposes.  In 1984, Public Law 98-407 authorized  the Secretary of a military department to sell electricity produced from  alternative energy projects, which include geothermal projects, and to  credit the proceeds to the account it uses to fund its supply of electricity.", "The Navy\u2019s geothermal program consists of overseeing the operations of  the two power plants at China Lake, known as Navy I and Navy II, and  developing geothermal resources at other military facilities, most  prominently the Fallon Naval Air Station in Nevada. See figure 1 for the  location of the China Lake base in California and the Fallon base in Nevada.", "In 2003, the Navy\u2019s Geothermal Program Office had a budget of about $6.2  million and a staff of 12, which included a program manager, a geologist, 2  geophysicists, other technical professional staff, a business manager, and  clerical staff. The power plants at China Lake convert high temperature  water into steam through a process called \u201cflashing\u201d and then use the steam  to drive turbines that generate electricity. Each of the two plants contains  three turbines. Each turbine has a production capacity of 30 megawatts,  making the total production capacity 180 megawatts. See figure 2 for a  diagram of how a power plant taps underground heat to produce  geothermal electricity.", "Geothermal resources have not yet been fully utilized. In 1979, the U.S.  Geological Survey estimated that known geothermal resources could  provide 23,000 megawatts of power and that undiscovered resources might  provide five times that amount. However, a comprehensive assessment of  the nation\u2019s geothermal energy generation potential has not been  conducted since 1979, and there is no current detailed information on the  extent and location of geothermal resources in the United States. In a 2003  study by the Departments of Energy and Interior, the lead geothermal staff  from each of BLM\u2019s state offices identified, based on their expert judgment,  the best sites for future near term geothermal power development within  their states. The BLM officials identified a total of 35 sites, including 10 in  Nevada, 9 in California, 7 in Oregon, and the remainder in New Mexico,  Utah, and Washington.  Also, in 2003, a Navy contractor assessed the  geothermal energy potential on military lands. The contractor assessed  sites at 18 military bases and concluded that only 5 sites had a high  potential for producing electricity from geothermal resources: the Nellis  Air Force Base and the Fallon Naval Air Station/Dixie Valley Range in  Nevada, the Naval Air Facility El Centro/Parachute Test Range in  California, Fort Bliss in Texas, and the White Sands Missile Range in New  Mexico."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Navy\u2019s Revenues from Geothermal Energy Production Averaged about $14.7 Million Annually between 1987 and 2003", "paragraphs": ["The Navy collected, on average, $14.7 million annually in royalties and  other revenues from geothermal operations at its China Lake base between  1987 and 2003. A contract between the Navy and the power plant operator  has established three sources of annual revenue to the Navy: (1) royalty  payments on the sale of electricity, (2) payments toward the base\u2019s  electricity bill, and (3) bonus payments for voluntarily conserving  electricity usage at the base. In total, the power plant operator received  about $2.3 billion from the sale of electricity produced by the China Lake  power plants between 1987 and 2003 and has paid approximately $249  million, or about 11 percent, to the Navy.", "The largest payment the Navy collects is a royalty on the power plant  operator\u2019s gross revenue from selling electricity produced at China Lake.  The Navy collected, on average, $11.5 million annually in royalties between  1987 and 2003.  Royalties ranged from a low of less than $100,000 in 1988  to a high of more than $20 million in 1996. The two power plants at China  Lake each have three turbine units\u2014units 1, 2, and 3 in Navy I and units 4,  5, and 6 in Navy II. The Navy assessed royalties on all power produced and  sold from units 2 through 6 but not on power produced and sold from unit  1. Other arrangements, including payments toward the base\u2019s electricity  bill, which are discussed later in this report, compensate the Navy for  power sold from unit 1. Table 1 shows the annual royalties the Navy  received from geothermal operations at China Lake.", "The Navy has established royalty rates in its contract with the power plant  operator that increase incrementally from a low of 4 percent to a high of 20  percent. The Navy I and Navy II power plants have different royalty rates  that increase in different years of the contract. Table 2 shows the schedule  of royalty rates for the Navy I and Navy II power plants. The royalty rate for  Navy I was first applied in 1988 and for Navy II in 1990.", "The Navy's royalty revenues rose consistently between 1988 and 1996  based on the 10-year contract price of electricity the power plant operator  agreed to with the local utility (see table 1). However, since the mid-1990s  these revenues have fallen from a high of $20.3 million in 1996 to $13.9  million in 2003, the most recent year for which complete data are available.  This drop occurred because the price that the utility had agreed to pay for  electricity from Navy I fell sharply in 1997 after the 10-year contract price  expired. Similarly, the power plant operator\u2019s contract price for power sold  from Navy II expired in 2000. The contract prices, while competitive when  they were negotiated, were much higher than the market price for  electricity when the contract prices expired. Since the Navy's royalties are  directly related to the power plant operator's proceeds, when they  dropped, the Navy's revenues also decreased. However, about the time the  power plant operator's contract prices expired, the Navy's royalty rates  increased from 10 percent to 15 and 18 percent, respectively, for electricity  sold from each power plant. The increased royalty rates caused the Navy's  royalty revenue to decline less dramatically than the power plant operator's  proceeds from electricity sales.", "The second largest Navy revenue source is the payment made by the power  plant operator toward the China Lake base\u2019s electricity bill. The power  plant operator paid, on average, $2.7 million annually toward the Navy\u2019s  electricity bill between 1987 and 2003. These payments, which were made  directly to the utility, lowered the base\u2019s electricity costs by about 26  percent annually. This arrangement compensates the Navy for some of the  power produced and sold from unit 1 of the Navy I power plant, for which  royalties do not apply. Unit 1 is different because the Navy originally  intended that electricity produced from this unit would directly support the  electricity needs of Navy bases in southern California through electric lines  connecting the power plant and Navy facilities. However, the Navy changed  its plans and instead decided to allow its contractor to sell all electricity  from unit 1 to the electric power grid and established a means of  compensation that directly benefits the base at China Lake.", "The third source of the Navy\u2019s geothermal revenues is the bonus payment  for conserving electricity, known as the conserved power credit. These  payments, which are another part of the Navy\u2019s compensation package for  power sold from unit 1, averaged about $500,000 annually, for a total of $8.6  million from 1987 to 2003.  As shown in table 3, the Navy received the  majority of the conserved power credit funds between 2001 and 2003.", "Under the conserved power credit agreement, the power plant operator  pays the Navy a bonus if the China Lake base uses less electricity than  predicted, based on an expected growth rate of 3 percent annually if the  Navy took no steps to conserve energy. For example, if the contract  projected the Navy\u2019s electricity needs at China Lake to be 100 kilowatt  hours in 2004 and it uses 70 kilowatt hours, the Navy would receive a bonus  payment for the 30 kilowatt hours it did not use. Since the power plant  operator is partially responsible for paying the electricity costs of the base,  this contract provision serves to limit its financial risk by providing an  incentive for the Navy to lower its electricity use. Despite the intent of  these payments to reward energy conservation at the base, the conserved  power credit largely reflects the fact that the base has not grown as  predicted and, therefore, its energy consumption has not grown  significantly.", "As shown in figure 3, the conserved power credit has become a more  significant portion of the Navy\u2019s geothermal revenues since 2001.", "This increase is the result of the formula used to calculate the price the  Navy is paid for every kilowatt hour of electricity it saves. When the market  price for electricity increases, as it did during the California energy crisis  from 2000 to 2002, the price the Navy is paid for the electricity it conserves  also increases. Payments the Navy received under this contract provision,  as well as reductions in the base\u2019s electricity bill, have helped keep its total  geothermal revenues fairly constant since the mid-1990s. During this same  time period, revenue to the power plant operator declined significantly (see  fig. 4).", "In addition to the three sources of annual revenue the Navy receives, the  Navy will get a $25 million lump sum payment at the expiration of its  contract with the power plant operator in 2009. This arrangement is the  final part of the compensation package tied to unit 1 of the Navy I power  plant. The Navy negotiated the $25 million payment because it calculated  that the revenues it received from the electricity bill savings and the  conserved power credit were less than the revenues it would have received  if a royalty provision had been applied to unit 1."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Navy Has Spent Its Geothermal Revenues on Energy Conservation Programs and Oversight and Development of Geothermal Resources", "paragraphs": ["Since fiscal year 1990, the first year the Navy spent geothermal revenues,  most of the Navy\u2019s revenues have been used to develop and implement  energy savings projects throughout the Navy and the Marine Corps and at  the China Lake base.

The two largest Navy energy  conservation programs funded with geothermal revenues are the Project  Development and Execution program and the Utility Incentive program.  Project Development and Execution program funds are used to identify  energy savings projects throughout the Navy and Marine Corps, obtain  proposals from contractors to execute the projects, review the financial  and technical assumptions of their proposals, and execute the selected  projects. Utility Incentive program funds enable base commanders to make  down payments on contracts to implement energy savings projects and to  review designs and oversee construction during the execution phase of the  project. Funds from these two programs have been used to develop a  project to install a large solar energy system and other energy technology at  the Marine Corps\u2019 Twentynine Palms facility in California that, according to  the Navy, effectively removed the facility\u2019s dependence on the power grid.  The Navy also installed geothermal heat pumps that heat and cool a Marine  Corps Air Station in Beaufort, South Carolina, as well as irrigation  improvements by the Public Works Center in San Diego and at the Lemoore  Naval Air Station in California, among other projects.", "Among the other energy conservation programs the Navy funds from  geothermal revenues are the Energy and Water Projects program, the  Training program, and the Awareness program. Under the Energy and  Water Projects program, the Navy installed energy efficient lighting  systems in its buildings, such as sensors that detect movement and  automatically turn on and off lights, as well as updated climate control  systems. The Navy also installed metering upgrades that allow it to obtain  energy consumption data for individual buildings, instead of for an entire  base. Under its Training program, the Navy trains Navy and Marine Corps  staff to be effective energy managers and to develop and finance energy  savings projects, among other things. The Navy\u2019s Awareness program pays  a public relations firm to emphasize the benefits of energy efficiency to  Navy personnel. To help change attitudes and behaviors regarding energy  conservation, the public relations firm produces a newsletter; writes  speeches and reports; and disseminates promotional items, such as pads of  paper with an energy efficiency message.", "The Navy funded 22 other energy conservation programs between October  1, 1989, and December 31, 2003, using geothermal revenues, such as  collecting and managing the Navy\u2019s energy consumption data, establishing  an office to test and validate new energy savings technologies, creating a  program to showcase energy savings features at Navy installations, and  developing an awards program.

The Navy\u2019s monitoring activities include  testing how fluid moves underground and the temperature and pressure of  subsurface water to help ensure the longevity of the geothermal resource.  In addition, the Navy takes pressure and temperature readings from wells  to understand the effects of withdrawing fluids from and injecting them  into the reservoir. As a result of these monitoring activities, the Navy  noticed a decrease in the volume of steam available to one of its power  plants and worked with the power plant operator to correct it.", "The Navy also oversees the activities of the power plant operator at China  Lake to ensure the safety and security of power plant operations, as well as  the operator\u2019s compliance with environmental laws and the agreements it  entered into with the Navy. The Navy requires the power plant operator to  prepare a resource management plan that details its plans for drilling wells,  extracting steam, injecting fluids, and other aspects of resource  management. To assess the power plant operator\u2019s compliance with the  plan, the Navy inspects the power plants and reviews reports submitted by  the operator. For example, the Navy reviews weekly reports on the amount  of steam withdrawn from the reservoir, as well as the amount of electricity  produced, sold, and lost.", "Finally, the Navy takes actions to preserve natural and cultural resources  on its lands. In the vicinity of the power plants at China Lake, there are  natural resources, such as fumaroles (holes in the ground that emit  volcanic gases) and bubbling mud pots, and cultural resources, such as an  abandoned hot springs resort and a site with cultural significance to Native  Americans. To help preserve these resources, the Navy has agreed to  minimize surface disturbance; limit access to historic sites to only those  with a need to be there; monitor and report on surface thermal features,  such as fumaroles; and conduct a cultural resources site restoration study,  among many other things.", "The Navy\u2019s resource development activities involve identifying and  quantifying the extent of geothermal resources at Army, Navy, Air Force,  and Marine Corps bases.

This contract was first signed in 1979 and has been modified  over time as conditions have changed. For example, the Navy originally  believed the electricity production potential at the site was much smaller  and that the electricity would be provided only to the base. The contract  was originally based on these assumptions but was modified when it  became clear that additional production potential existed and that the  electricity produced would be sold to a local utility company rather than  supplied directly to the base.

At the  China Lake and Fallon bases, the Navy assumed some of that risk and cost  by funding and conducting the initial work to identify developable  geothermal resources on these military installations. The Navy analyzed  the characteristics of the rocks, variations in soil density, and the chemical  characteristics of subsurface water, among other things, to determine the  existence and characteristics of the geothermal resources at China Lake  and Fallon. In addition, the Navy conducted some exploratory drilling,  although it did not drill any wells that could be used for geothermal  electricity production.", "A representative of the company that currently operates the China Lake  power plants told us that he did not believe that the Navy\u2019s initial  exploratory work reduced the company\u2019s costs and risks significantly. On  the other hand, representatives from the three companies that are  interested in developing the geothermal resources at Fallon told us that the  Navy\u2019s development work had reduced their initial risk and cost.

The Navy is interested in developing geothermal  resources on military lands only if it can be done in a manner that does not  impinge on its primary mission of national security. By conducting the  initial exploration itself, or by using hired contractors, the Navy maintains  much greater control over access to military facilities.

BLM performs some oversight  activities to ensure that the leaseholder's operations ensure the longevity of  the resource. For example, BLM\u2019s field office staff may check meters that  monitor the pressure and temperature of the resource and compare trends  over time, among other activities, to ensure the resource is not being  depleted too quickly. However, because of its limited number of staff, BLM  does not conduct these activities as frequently as the Navy does.", "An official from the company that currently operates the power plants at  China Lake told us that the level of oversight the Navy provides is  burdensome and costly.
