According to the 2004 National Military Strategy, U.S. forces expect to have sufficient quantities of the right items at the right time. However, demand for the seven items exceeded availability sometime between October 2002 and September 2004. The documented impact of these shortages varied between combat units. For example, while units in the 3rd Infantry Division reported that tire shortages reduced their operational capability, forcing them to abandon equipment, the 4th Infantry Division reported no similar effect. GAO identified five systemic deficiencies that contributed to shortages of the reviewed items, including inaccurate Army war reserve spare parts requirements and ineffective distribution. Annual updates of Army war reserve parts requirements have not been conducted since 1999. As a result, the war reserves did not contain enough track shoes, batteries, and tires to support U.S. forces during initial operations. Effective distribution relies on a seamless process to promptly move supplies from the United States to a customer. GAO found that conflicting doctrinal responsibilities for distribution management, improperly packed shipments, insufficient transportation personnel and equipment, and inadequate information systems prevented the timely availability of four of the items. While U.S. troops developed short-term solutions to manage item shortages during OIF, DOD and the services have begun to undertake systemic, long-term changes to fix some supply problems identified. While GAO did not evaluate their potential for success, the majority of the changes are focused on distribution, and not on the full gamut of systemic deficiencies GAO identified."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["To support Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), the largest deployment of U.S.  troops since Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm in 1990, the Department  of Defense (DOD) has undertaken a massive logistics effort, moving more  than 2 million short tons of cargo including equipment, spare parts,  supplies, and other items several thousand miles to the Persian Gulf. This  effort started in late 2001 as U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) began  planning for OIF, accelerated as troops deployed in the fall of 2002 and  major combat operations were launched on March 19, 2003, and continues  today while U.S. and coalition forces undertake stabilization efforts in Iraq.  From October 2002 through September 2004, DOD reported spending  $51.7 billion for operating support, including fuel, spare parts, and facilities  management, and $10.7 billion for transportation of personnel and supplies  to sustain U.S. forces before, during, and after major combat operations in  Iraq. Despite these expenditures, there have been widespread reports of  serious shortages of some critical items needed by U.S. troops.", "DOD relies on a number of individual processes and activities, known  collectively as supply chain management, to purchase, produce, and deliver  products and services to the warfighter during contingency operations  consistent with the National Military Strategy. The goal of supply chain  management is to deliver the \u201cright items to the right place at the right  time\u201d for the warfighter. To meet the initial increase in demand during a  contingency, DOD depends on its war reserves\u2014stocks of specifically  designated weapon systems, equipment, spare parts, and other items that  are amassed during peacetime. The war reserves are intended to fill the gap  until the national supply system can increase production. DOD relies on  defense working capital funds to finance the flow of supplies to the  services. These revolving funds are financed by sales revenue rather than  direct appropriations. Working capital funds allow the Defense Logistics  Agency (DLA) and the services\u2019 logistics agencies to purchase needed  items from suppliers. Military units then order items from the logistics  agencies and pay for them with appropriated funds when the requested  items\u2014either from inventory or manufacturers\u2014are delivered to the units.  Supplies are shipped from the United States by air and sea through DOD\u2019s  joint distribution system and delivered to deployed units.", "Since the 1990s, we have identified DOD\u2019s supply chain management as a  high-risk area because of high inventory levels and a supply system that  was not responsive to the needs of the warfighter. In a substantial body of  work, we have examined a range of problems, including inventory  management and shortages of critical spare parts. DOD also recognizes supply chain management as a serious issue. In the Quadrennial Defense  Review for 2001, DOD stated its intention to transform its logistics  capabilities to improve the deployment process and implement new  logistics support tools that accelerate logistics integration between the  services and reduce logistics demand and cost. OIF is one of the first major  tests of these new capabilities, and we have reported on the supply chain  issues that have impeded support to the warfighter. For example, after  visiting the theater in 2003, we provided our preliminary observations on  the effectiveness of logistics support during OIF. Among the problems we  observed were the unavailability of spare parts, hundreds of backlogged  shipments, and an inability to track shipments at the distribution centers.", "Supplying spare parts has been a long-standing DOD management problem.  Under the Comptroller General\u2019s authority, we evaluated the effectiveness  of spare parts and related logistics support being provided to deployed  forces for OIF. Our objectives were to assess (1) what supply shortages  were experienced by U.S. forces in Iraq and what impact the shortages had  on operations, (2) what primary deficiencies in the supply system  contributed to any identified supply shortages, and (3) what actions DOD  has taken to improve the timely availability of supplies for current and  future operations.", "We developed detailed case studies of nine supply items that were reported  to be in short supply during OIF.

We chose the items that  we believed presented possible shortages with operational impacts based  on information available in GAO and military reports, military and  contractor lessons-learned studies, and other accounts covering the time  period between October 2002 and September 2004. To identify the extent  and impact of supply shortages, we visited numerous DOD logistics  organizations to obtain data on the production, availability, and distribution  of supply items at the national level. When supply data specifically for OIF  were not available, we used worldwide data since OIF received supply  priority. We also interviewed members of units that had returned from the  theater to determine the extent and impacts of item shortages on their  operations. We identified deficiencies that affected the availability of  two or more of the case study items. We worked with DOD logistics  agencies, operational units, and service and geographic commands to  evaluate the significance of these deficiencies to DOD\u2019s overall logistics  system. We also identified DOD\u2019s and the services\u2019 short-term and long- term efforts to address these shortages. We assessed the reliability of the  data we obtained for individual items and determined they were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes.

As  the conflict in Iraq continued, track shoes, essential components of  combat vehicles such as Abrams tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicles,  were not available to meet increasing demands. Although sufficient  quantities of track shoes existed to meet demand at the beginning of  combat, by May 2003 actual demand was 5 times the forecasted  demand primarily because of the heavy wear and tear on track shoes as  a result of high mileage, poor road conditions, and extreme desert heat.  Major combat units reported that significant shortages of track shoes  negatively affected their operational capabilities. For example, the  3rd Infantry Division reported in June 2003 that 111 (60 percent) of  its 185 Abrams tanks were unable to perform their missions because  of supply shortfalls that included track shoes. Furthermore,  159 (67 percent) of the division\u2019s 237 Bradley Fighting Vehicles were not  mission capable for the same reason.", "Interceptor Body Armor. Demand for Interceptor body armor  exceeded supply during OIF. The Coalition Forces Land Component  commander decided to increase individual protection by issuing the  armor to all troops and civilians. As a result, demand for the body armor  surged, with quarterly demand rising from a pre-war level of about  8,600 vests and 9,600 plates, to about 77,000 vests and 109,000 plates by  the time the war commenced on March 2003. Back orders for plates  peaked at 598,000 in November 2003, while back orders for vests  reached 328,000 in December. Even though the services did not report  that the lack of body armor impacted their missions during OIF, there  were serious concerns. For example, combat support units in the Army  and Marine Corps were among the last to be equipped with the armor,  increasing the risk to personnel given the enemy\u2019s focus on attacking  supply routes.", "Lithium batteries. Army and Marine Corps forces operating in Iraq  experienced severe shortages of lithium batteries, particularly BA-5590s  and BA-5390s, during major combat operations in the spring of 2003.  These nonrechargeable batteries power some 60 critical  communications and electronics systems, such as radios and missile  guidance systems. Worldwide demand for these batteries surged  from a peacetime average of below 20,000 per month prior to  September 11, 2001, to a peak rate of over 330,000 in April 2003. As a  result, the number of back orders rose rapidly to 900,000 by May 2003.  According to Marine Corps officials, if the war had continued at the  same pace into May 2003 or beyond, Marine units would have  experienced degraded communications capability and increased risk as  a result of battery shortages.", "MREs. U.S. forces in Iraq experienced shortages of MREs primarily  during the deployment and major combat phases in February, March,  and April 2003 before normal dining facilities were established. The  peak monthly demand for MREs rose to more than 1.8 million cases,  while inventories dropped to a level of 500,000 cases. In late April when  other food options became available, demand fell rapidly. While certain  Army units reported running out of MREs, available data only shows  that they came close. According to a RAND study, some Army units  came within an estimated 2 days or less of exhausting their on hand  quantities. Similarly, according to a Center for Naval Analysis study, at  times Marine Corps combat support units had less than 1 day of MREs  on hand. As a result, both Army and Marine Corps units were at risk of  running out of food if supply distribution was hindered.", "Tires for 5-ton trucks and HMMWVs. The rising demand for  truck tires during and after major combat operations in Iraq nearly  exhausted existing inventories. The demand grew as vehicles were  driven long distances and were modified with add-on-armor. For  example, in August 2003, the Army\u2019s inventory contained only 505 tires  for 5-ton trucks, which fell far below the worldwide monthly demand of  more than 4,800 tires. As a result, back orders spiked to over 7,000 for  5-ton truck tires and to over 13,000 for HMMWV tires. The shortages  reduced the operational capabilities of these vehicles and negatively  impacted operations in Iraq. For example, 3rd Infantry Division units  reported that tire shortages forced them to abandon equipment, and  Marine Corps units reported stripping and abandoning otherwise good  vehicles because of a lack of tires.", "Up-armored HMMWVs and add-on-armor kits. Since the  U.S. military began identifying requirements for these vehicles during  the summer of 2003, there has been a gap between the number of  vehicles required and the number being produced by the industrial base.  This new requirement was based on the need to protect soldiers and  Marines executing distribution and force protection missions. The  up-armored HMMWV provides enhanced protection against rifle  rounds and explosive blasts while the add-on\u2013armor kits provide  some additional protection to previously unarmored vehicles. As of  September 2004, only 5,330 of the 8,105 required vehicles were in  theater. The overall impact of the shortages of up-armored HMMWVs  and add-on-armor kits is difficult to measure because units do not report  the direct effects of using unarmored HMMWVs.

The requirement for BA-5590s was set at 180,000 to support the first  45 days of operations, but this amount was considerably lower than the  actual demand of nearly 620,000 batteries recorded during the first  2 months of the conflict. CECOM officials attributed this mismatch to  inaccurate battery failure and usage rates in the 1999 model. They also said  the model did not include all the communications systems that used  nonrechargeable lithium batteries.", "In another example, the war reserve requirement for track shoes for  armored vehicles was inadequate to keep pace with actual demand during  the early months of combat. As table 4 shows, the pre-OIF war reserve  requirement for track shoes for Abrams tanks and Bradley Fighting  Vehicles was, respectively, 5,230 and 5,626; however, in April 2003 the  actual worldwide demand for these tanks was four times higher.  The situation was even worse for 5-ton truck tires.", "Since the end of major combat operations, war reserve managers have  made manual adjustments to the requirements to reflect supply  experiences from OIF. For example, officials told us that they have  adjusted the Army and the Marine Corps war reserve requirement for  BA-5590 and BA-5390 lithium batteries upward to more than 1.5 million  batteries based on the average monthly demand of 250,000 batteries  experienced during OIF multiplied by 6 months. Similarly, war reserve  managers at TACOM have increased the requirements for Abrams and  Bradley tank track shoes to 32,686 and 34,864, respectively. While these  actions may correct a particular problem, they do not address the systemic  inaccuracy of the Army\u2019s war reserve requirements.", "In prior reports, we have identified problems with the Army\u2019s process for  computing the war reserve spare parts requirements. In a 2001 report,  we recommended that the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretary of the  Army to develop and use the best available consumption factors; improve  the methodology used to determine requirements by considering planned  battlefield maintenance practices; and develop industrial-base capacity on  current, fact-based estimates for the war reserve. In a 2002 report, we  recommended that the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretary of the  Army to have the Commander of AMC change its process of calculating war  reserve requirements.

AMC data indicate that a lack  of funding for war reserve spare parts continues to be an issue. As table 5  shows, as of October 2004, only about 24 percent ($561.7 million out of  $2,327.4 million) of AMC\u2019s total spare parts requirement is currently funded  and on hand. Moreover, AMC data show this pattern of underfunding is  expected to continue through fiscal year 2009.", "As a result of this low funding, war reserve managers told us that they must  prioritize how the available funding is allocated based on their professional  experience. For example, the war reserve manager for TACOM reported  that he tends to spend his available funds on expensive items with long  production lead-times, such as tank engines, because they are difficult to  acquire on short notice. Conversely, lower cost items with shorter  production lead-times, such as tires, do not receive funding priority.", "The Army accepts the risk of unfunded war reserve requirements in order  to fund other priorities, such as operations and the procurement of new  systems.

The model uses the  average monthly demand over the previous 24 months to predict future  equipment use and demand. Although the Army regulation indicates that  the model should be able to switch to a wartime demand forecasting  method, AMC officials stated the system has no wartime forecasting  capability. As a result, the Army\u2019s supply requirements forecasting model  could not forecast the wartime surge in requirements during OIF. In  contrast, DLA\u2019s model has the capability to forecast requirements for  contingencies, but it was not completely effective, as in the case of MREs.", "Instead of using the model, the Army relied on the expert opinion of item  managers, who manage supply items at AMC\u2019s subordinate commands.  Item managers, however, did not have sufficient information on estimated  deployment sizes or duration and intensity of operations to accurately  forecast supply requirements for OIF. According to TACOM officials, AMC  initially directed item managers to use their expert opinion and knowledge  to develop forecasts, without input from operational planners in  CENTCOM. AMC officials stated that Army headquarters did not provide  them with formal guidance on the duration of the conflict, supply  consumption, or size of the deploying force.

This amount was based on  the requirements established in the President\u2019s Budget prepared 2 years  earlier. By the time fiscal year 2003 began, AMC had identified a new supply  requirement of $4.8 billion to support both peacetime operations and the  ongoing global war on terrorism, but, the obligation authority provided in  October 2002 did not support this revised requirement.

Initial priority was to provide funding to the U.S. Army Aviation  and Missile Command to support critical aviation systems and then to  TACOM for tracked and tactical wheeled vehicles. Without prompt  obligation authority, item managers could not contract for supplies in  anticipation of customer demands. According to item managers, they  need sufficient obligation authority in advance of customer demands in  order to have sufficient supplies available. TACOM officials reported that  the lack of adequate obligation authority prevented them from buying  supplies, including tires and tank track shoes, in anticipation of demands.

By the end of the fiscal year, TACOM\u2019s total requirement,  including funds necessary to reset the force, totaled $2.7 billion, but its  obligation authority was less than $2.4 billion.

Moreover, the lack of sorting continued because of a miscommunication  between CENTCOM and DLA, the shipper. CENTCOM expected the  peacetime practice of pure pallets would continue during OIF, while DLA  officials focused on moving pallets to theater regardless of whether they  were pure or mixed.

Although his unit \u201cmanaged\u201d with what was available, he said that the  shortage of equipment used to haul supplies into Iraq created a strain on  materiel movement. Both the Marine Corps and the 3rd Infantry Division  also reported that available transportation assets could not meet their  capacity requirements. Even high-priority items, such as food did not  always move as intended. According to a CENTCOM after-action report,  contractors responsible for moving MREs from ports to the Theater  Distribution Center at times had only 50 of the 80 trucks needed. DLA  officials reported that at one time 1.4 million MREs were stored at a port  in theater, awaiting transport to customers.", "One cause for the distribution resource problems was the failure of the  force deployment planning process to properly synchronize the flow of  combat and support forces. DOD normally uses time-phased force  deployment data to identify and synchronize the flow of forces during an  operation. Key elements of this process include requirements for military  transportation companies, contractor provided services, and host nation  logistics support. However, the process was \u201cthrown out\u201d in the planning  leading up to OIF. Around November 2002, DOD started to use another  method for deployment planning, referred to as the Request for Forces  process.", "The Request for Forces process segregated the initial deployment plan  into over 50 separate deployment orders. DOD\u2019s priority was for combat  forces to move into theater first. Under this new process, logistics unit  commanders had to justify the flow of their units and equipment into the  theater\u2014often with little success. According to some DOD planners, this  approach did not adequately meet planner needs, especially the needs  of logisticians. Each deployment order required its own transportation  feasibility analysis, which resulted in a choppy flow of forces into the  theater. This in turn caused imbalances in the types of personnel needed in  the theater to handle logistics requirements. Furthermore, a RAND study  suggests that distribution assets, particularly for components such as the  377th Theater Support Command and the 3rd Corps Support Command,  were either deleted from the deployment plan or shifted back in the  deployment timeline. As a result, logistics personnel could not effectively  support the increasing numbers of combat troops moving into theater.", "DOD took steps to mitigate the impact of some distribution problems, but  these did not always work. For example, according to a RAND report,  priority was given to moving critical supplies, such as food, water,  ammunition, and fuel. Other items, to include spare parts, were moved on a  very limited, opportune basis. As a result, according to one after-action  report, it took nearly 2 weeks after U.S. forces moved into Iraq for the first shipment of spare parts to reach combat forces, and this delivery was  inadequate to support an entire division engaged in combat operations.  Moreover, the Army confirmed that after 45 days of enemy engagement,  moving water still consumed over 60 percent of available theater  transportation trucks. A Marine Corps after-action report listed repair  parts distribution as a \u201cnear-complete failure.\u201d", "In order to move supplies to the troops, both the Army and Marines  contracted for additional trucks. For example, the Marine Corps contracted  for $25.6 million in services from several commercial trucking companies  to support combat operations. It justified this action by identifying  deficiencies in the provision of transportation support they expected from  other components in theater. However, Army officials stated that its  contractors did not always have sufficient trucks to move supplies as  required because contracts did not specify a level of operational readiness  for trucks. As a result, even if trucks were available, they were not always  functional. In its after-action report, the 3rd Infantry Division stated that  available transportation assets and contracted host nation support could  not meet divisional requirements for carrying capacity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information Systems did not Support Supply Distribution", "paragraphs": ["According to military doctrine, financial, communication, and information  systems used to support supply distribution must be accessible, integrated,  connected, and contain accurate and up-to-date information. In other  words, these systems need to provide a seamless flow of all types of  essential data from the point of production to the warfighter. However  during OIF, the logistics systems used to order, track, and account for  supplies were not well integrated; moreover, they could not provide the  essential information necessary to effectively manage theater distribution.", "Data Transmission Problems Hindered Supply Requisitions Logistics information systems in use during OIF could not effectively  transmit data, making it difficult to process and track requisitions for  critical supplies. A number of factors limited communications between the various logistics systems, including a lack of bandwidth in the theater to  satisfy all systems users, systems that were incompatible with each other,  units lacking the necessary equipment or being delayed in connecting to  the supply system, and distances being too great for supply activities to  effectively transmit data by radio. For example, the supply activities in the  Army\u2019s 3rd Infantry Division only received about 2,500 of the over  10,000 items\u2014including armored vehicle track shoes, lithium batteries, and  tires\u2014they requisitioned between August 2002 and September 2003.  Officials at the 3rd Infantry Division attributed this issue specifically to  communications problems between systems. Army officials also attribute  poor communications as a major factor leading to a $1.2 billion  discrepancy between the amount of supplies shipped to the theater and the  amount actually acknowledged as received, which we reported on in  December 2003.", "The Marine Corps similarly experienced communications problems  between its information technology systems during OIF. Marine forces  deployed with two different versions of the Marine Corps Asset Tracking  Logistics & Supply System logistics information system, which were not  compatible with each other. Marine Corps units in the 1st Marine  Expeditionary Force were using the Asset Tracking Logistics & Supply  System I for frontline logistics, while the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force  was using the Asset Tracking Logistics & Supply System II+ for theater  support. Therefore, requisitions from Marine support activities at the  front lines could not be transmitted directly to Marine logistics units in the  rear. Instead, the Marines used other processes, such as e-mail and satellite  phone to requisition supplies. However, this left ordering units without any  information on the status of their requisitions. As a result, many duplicate  orders were submitted and may have unnecessarily added more cargo to  the already overwhelmed theater distribution system. A study by SAIC also  noted that the lack of logistics communications was a weaknesses during  OIF. The Army\u2019s Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics has since provided satellite communications equipment to the units operating in theater to  help alleviate these communication difficulties.", "Available Logistics Information Systems Did Not Provide  Adequate Visibility Another major problem encountered during OIF was a lack of adequate  visibility over supplies in the distribution system. While the operation order  for OIF called for the use of radio frequency identification, tracking was  limited primarily by a failure to place radio frequency identification tags  on all shipments sent to the theater and a lack of fixed scanners needed to  read radio frequency identification tags. For example, some ports, such as  one we observed in Bahrain, had no scanners at all.", "Another equally challenging problem was that scanners often failed under  the harsh environmental conditions. According to one Army assessment,  only 50 percent of the scanners inspected in Kuwait were operational. In  addition to problems with the radio frequency identification technology,  there was no suitable information system infrastructure to track and  identify supply assets. SAIC reported that the Joint Total Asset Visibility  system could not provide commanders with the asset visibility they  needed, while military officials in theater told us they knew of no joint  system that tracked supplies from the point of production to the warfighter.  Rather, logistics personnel relied on a number of unintegrated tracking  systems. As a result, CENTCOM and the major combat forces in the Army  and Marine Corps could not adequately track or identify supplies moving to  and within the theater.", "The lack of in-transit visibility over supplies significantly effected  distribution. For example, an Army official responsible for logistics  operations at the Theater Distribution Center noted that incomplete radio  frequency identification tags forced the center\u2019s personnel to spend time  opening and sorting incoming shipments. This, in turn, significantly  increased processing time, contrary to DOD\u2019s principle of maximizing  throughput. As a result, according to a CENTCOM issue paper, around  1500 Small Arms Protective Inserts plates for body armor were lost.  Another CENTCOM report stated that 17 containers of MREs were left at a  supply base in Iraq for over a week because no one at the base knew they  were there. According to Marine Corps officials, they became frustrated  with their inability to \u201csee\u201d supplies moving towards them and lost trust  and confidence in the logistics system and processes. For example, the  Marines could only verify the receipt of 15 out of 140 AAV generators that  were shipped to them.", "Changes to Unit Address Codes Disrupted Logistics  Information Systems The use of new OIF-specific address codes, known as Department of  Defense Activity Address Codes, for ordering supplies limited the  effectiveness of logistics information technology. The codes ensure that  supplies are sent to the correct address of the ordering unit and that the  correct unit is charged for the supplies. Because of poor linkages between  Army logistics and financial systems, a problem of where to ship and who  to bill surfaces unless a unit or activity deploys intact. For example, while  some parts of the 3rd Infantry Division remained in the U.S. during OIF, the  majority of the division deployed to Iraq. To ensure that ordered supplies  went to the correct location of a deployed unit and that the unit was  correctly charged, new codes specifically set up for OIF were issued to  deploying entities. Meanwhile, the original codes remained with that  portion of the unit that did not deploy. Approximately 10,000 new codes  were created for OIF. This caused significant disruptions to logistics  information systems as new data had to be manually updated in each  system. Many problems occurred during this process, such as the issuance  of inactive codes, use of codes already assigned to other units, and  incorrect data being input into logistics systems. These problems were  another factor contributing to the $1.2 billion discrepancy between  supplies shipped and supplies received.", "Furthermore, there was a delay in updating the master code schedule that  contained all the locations associated with the new codes. This caused  significant problems for the Theater Distribution Center. According to an  April 10, 2003 Theater Distribution Center log entry, \u201cUpwards of 50% of  pallets shipped to Doha and 20-30% of pallets shipped to Arifjan are being  returned/rejected with the reason being, \u2018it doesn\u2019t belong here.\u2019 The  master  are not being updated when units move in or out and the   is double and triple handling cargo.\u201d Given that  the center was already experiencing problems with personnel and  equipment shortages; additional handling of the same supplies increased  their difficulties.", "Logistics Personnel Were Not Trained on Some of the Logistics  Information Systems in Use A lack of adequate training for logistics personnel also negatively impacted  the performance of logistics information systems. For example, according  to a 101st Airborne after-action review, loading codes and interfacing with  data caused problems that training could have resolved. Lack of training  also contributed to problems with asset visibility. According to a logistics  study, units were generally not trained in the use of radio frequency  identification devices. Marine Corps officials likewise stated that their  personnel were untrained in the use of tracking equipment."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Actions to Improve Supply Availability for Current and Future Operations", "paragraphs": ["As a result of logistics issues that arose during OIF, DOD, the services, and  the defense agencies have undertaken a number of actions to improve the  availability of equipment and supplies during ongoing and future  operations.

The Joint Staff  Logistics Directorate, in conjunction with the services, determines the  causes of the shortages and makes recommendations to the Office of the  Secretary of Defense and the services for corrective action and execution.  Other actions are long-term, systemic changes that are designed to improve  the overall effectiveness of the supply system.

However, it has undertaken  short-term actions to obtain additional funding for specific supply items.  For example, AMC directed funding towards armored vehicle track  shoes.", "Delayed acquisition. DOD has not undertaken long-term actions to  address acquisition issues that contributed to shortages of certain case  study items. However, DLA has undertaken other actions to improve its  ability to leverage industrial-base capabilities. DLA seeks to improve  industrial-base support through its collaborative planning initiatives  with industry. For example, its Strategic Materiel Sourcing program  establishes long-term contracts for approximately 500,000 (of a total  4.6 million) items the agency considers critical to its customers\u2019 needs.  In addition, its Strategic Supplier Alliances program establishes formal  relationships with the agency\u2019s top 32 sole source suppliers.", "Ineffective distribution.

In the Quadrennial Defense  Review for 2001, DOD stated its intention to transform its logistics  capabilities to improve the deployment process and implement new  logistics support tools that accelerate logistics integration between the  services and reduce logistics demand and cost. OIF tested this system as  well as industry\u2019s capability to meet rapidly increasing demands, and, in  many instances, the system failed to respond quickly enough to meet the  needs of modern warfare. While units in Iraq achieved success on the  battlefield, the supply chain did not always adequately support the troops  and combat operations. A number of problems prevented DOD from  providing supply support to its combat forces at many points in the  process, which reduced operational capabilities and forced combat  commanders to accept additional risk in completing their missions. An  inability to adequately predict the needs of warfighters at the onset of the  war, coupled with a slow process for obtaining additional resources once  those needs were identified, resulted in critical wartime shortages. In  addition, even when sufficient supply inventories were available within the  system, they were not always delivered to the combat forces when they  needed them. All of these problems were influenced to some extent by a  lack of accurate and timely information needed to support processes  and decisions.", "Unless DOD\u2019s logistics process improves the availability of critical supplies  during wartime, combat forces engaged in future operations will likely be  exposed to risks similar to those experienced in Iraq. These risks will  continue to exist unless DOD is able to improve the availability of war  reserve supplies at the start of operations and overcomes problems  forecasting accurate wartime demands. Moreover, delays in the Army\u2019s  funding processes will continue to place U.S. troops at risk by not enabling  AMC to swiftly meet surges in wartime demands. In addition, future  combat operations may be adversely affected unless DOD is able to  anticipate acquisition delays that could affect the availability of critical  supplies and provide transparency into how it expects to mitigate  production risks. Finally, merely increasing the availability of supplies in  the inventory will not help combat forces in the field. Troops will continue  to face reduced operational capabilities and unnecessary risks unless  DOD\u2019s supply chain can distribute the right supplies to the right places  when warfighters need them.", "While DOD took immediate steps to overcome some shortages, and is  beginning to develop solutions to some of the problems identified  during OIF, most systemic solutions have tended to center on resolving  distribution problems. If supply logistics transformation is to be successful,  DOD\u2019s supply chain reform will need to include solutions for the full gamut  of identified deficiencies contributing to supply shortages during OIF. An  integrated approach to addressing all of these deficiencies will increase  DOD\u2019s potential to achieve responsive, consistent, and reliable support to  warfighters, a goal envisioned in the National Military Strategy and its  logistics concepts and necessary to support the continued dominance of  the U.S. military."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve the effectiveness of DOD\u2019s supply system in supporting  deployed forces for contingencies, we recommend that the Secretary of  Defense direct the Secretary of the Army to take the following three actions  and specify when they will be completed:  Improve the accuracy of Army war reserve requirements and  transparency about their adequacy by  updating the war reserve models with OIF consumption data that  validate the type and number of items needed,  modeling war reserve requirements at least annually to update the  war reserve estimates based on changing operational and equipment  requirements, and  disclosing to Congress the impact on military operations of its risk  management decision about the percentage of war reserves being  funded.", "Improve the accuracy of its wartime supply requirements forecasting   developing models that can compute operational supply  requirements for deploying units more promptly as part of prewar  planning and  providing item managers with operational information in a timely  manner so they can adjust modeled wartime requirements as  necessary.", "Reduce the time delay in granting increased obligation authority to the  Army Materiel Command and its subordinate commands to support  their forecasted wartime requirements by establishing an expeditious  supply requirements validation process that provides accurate  information to support timely and sufficient funding.", "We also recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretary of  the Navy to improve the accuracy of the Marine Corps\u2019 wartime supply  requirements forecasting process by completing the reconciliation of the  Marine Corps\u2019 forecasted requirements with actual OIF consumption data  to validate the number as well as types of items needed and making  necessary adjustments to their requirements.

Defense Supply Center Columbus officials  reported that generators were shipped to the theater to support  requirements forecasted by deploying units. However, according to an  official with the 3rd Assault Amphibian Battalion, instead of being  delivered to the units, generators were warehoused in the distribution  center.
