Ensuring that the working capital fund is managed as efficiently as possible could allow Justice to use saved resources for other departmental priorities. GAO was asked to determine how Justice (1) manages its working capital fund to promote compliance with applicable fiscal laws and key operating principles, (2) communicates shared services rates with customers, (3) measures performance to evaluate whether fund activities are contributing to agency goals, and (4) ensures that its excess unobligated balances are used in accordance with legal authorities and managed so that Justice can make well-informed funding decisions. GAO reviewed statutory authorities, analyzed Justice policies, interviewed budget and finance officials, and conducted focus groups with some shared services customers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Justice Management Division (JMD), the component responsible for managing the working capital fund, effectively tracks fund functions to ensure adherence to applicable fiscal laws and sound management practices. For example, JMD has well-established policies and procedures for tracking and monitoring the four working capital fund functions so that the fund adheres to authorized purposes. Further, JMD structures its reimbursable agreements with customers to facilitate adherence to the Economy Act\u0097the statutory authority underlying most of JMD\u0092s customer orders. JMD also clearly delineates roles and responsibilities, which allows customers to know who to contact with questions and clearly assigns responsibility for obligating and expending funds. Justice also ensures the fund\u0092s self-sufficiency by recovering total costs for the provided services. These actions are consistent with two of the four key operating principles for working capital funds.Customers noted positive benefits from Justice\u0092s shared services but seek more information on rate structures and want assurances that fund costs are equitably distributed. For example, customers said they valued the breadth of services offered as well as the experience of fund staff but wanted to better understand the basis for shared services rates and more opportunities to discuss billing concerns and service changes with JMD. Officials expressed surprise at these concerns. They noted that informal information sharing on rates and rate structures happens regularly, but explained that each staff director has his/her own way of communicating with customers and acknowledged that some may be better at providing customer support than others.", "JMD does not systematically measure important aspects of shared service provision and working capital fund management. For example, JMD tracks workload measures such as the number of transactions processed, but does not assess customer satisfaction with shared services. It also does not have measures to assess how effectively it manages the fund, such as whether managers are responsive to concerns about shared service rates or billing issues\u0097areas with which customers have expressed concern. Absent a formal mechanism for customers to provide timely and regular feedback, JMD cannot sufficiently assess whether customer needs are met or have changed. JMD also has not assessed its shared services rates to know whether they provide a good value to customers. If available, specific working capital fund-level performance information would allow JMD to regularly compare actual performance with planned or expected performance. Further, a corresponding management review process could help JMD achieve the efficiencies that working capital funds were designed to produce, potentially freeing up resources that could be realigned for other departmental initiatives. Lastly, performance measures aligned with strategic goals can be used to evaluate whether and how working capital fund activities contribute to departmentwide goals and crosscutting initiatives.", "Justice has processes to ensure that excess unobligated balances are used in accordance with legal authorities. It also has an established process to make well-informed decisions on how to spend available funds.

Justice\u2019s working capital fund was created by Congress on   January 2, 1975. The fund is authorized to maintain moneys from four  distinct sources, or functions (see table 1). The first and primary function  of the fund is to finance, on a reimbursable basis, administrative shared  services provided by JMD to other components of the department and  other federal agencies. The second function of the working capital fund is  to collect up to 3 percent of funds collected pursuant to civil debt  collection litigation activities into the fund. A third function of the working  capital fund is to collect up to 4 percent of earnings from its shared  services provision. Finally, the working capital fund\u2019s fourth function is to  capture expired departmental unobligated balances into the working  capital fund\u2019s Unobligated Balance Transfers (UBT) account. Because the  working capital fund is a no-year account, all amounts earned or collected  by the fund are available without fiscal year limitation to be used for  specific authorized purposes. For example, amounts from three of the  four working capital fund functions may be used for capital equipment  investments and financial system improvements.", "The largest portion of the working capital fund comes from charges for  centralized administrative and infrastructure support services and  functions collected on a reimbursable basis from Justice components.  The shared services provided by the working capital fund are generally  commercial functions, such as data processing, publications, building  services, financial operations, employee data, telecommunications,  property management, and space management (see working capital fund  services and support in fig. 1).", "While most Justice components use the working capital fund to obtain  administrative shared services, there is no statutory requirement that they  do so. For fiscal year 2010, Justice\u2019s largest customers were the U.S.  Attorney\u2019s Office, JMD, the Bureau of Prisons, the Federal Bureau of  Investigation, and the Drug Enforcement Administration (see customers in  fig. 1). Some services are also available to other federal agencies. For  example, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was the largest  non-Justice customer of the working capital fund. The working capital  fund received $38 million from DHS in fiscal year 2010 for information  technology services. However, JMD officials told us that DHS is exiting  the working capital fund and its remaining agreements with the fund are  expected to be completed by fiscal year 2013.", "To set and review rates for working capital fund services, JMD develops,  in the context of Justice\u2019s budget formulation process, an annual 2-year  operating plan. As a part of developing the operating plans, JMD sets the  rates for its services using one of three strategies.", "The \u201cdollar-per-widget\u201d strategy aligns rates with the cost of the  service provided. JMD creates an internal cost schedule of these  services that lists, for example, how much a photocopy or scan job  costs. This strategy is designed to bill customers for the amount of  service actually used.", "The pass-through charge strategy is used to set rates for services that  the working capital fund acquires from another provider. Customer  rates are based on costs as determined by the non-Justice service  providers, such as the flexible spending account services provided by  the Office of Personnel Management and rent charges from the  General Services Administration.", "The allocation strategy is applied when actual usage is more difficult  to predict, such as for information technology security, e-government  services, and acquisition support. Allocations are determined in  various ways, such as a percentage of full-time equivalents (FTE), a  percentage of budget authority, or a weighted average of both.  Additionally, JMD staff factor in data such as recent cost information  and expected use of a service for the coming year. To calculate the  estimated cost for a specific customer, JMD reviews the customer\u2019s  actual use in prior years and expected use for the upcoming fiscal  year. From that, JMD calculates a percentage to charge customers  that will cover the cost of providing that level of service. All customers  using a service are charged a percentage of total estimated costs  throughout the year.", "JMD officials told us that they generally apply the dollar-per-widget and  pass-through charge strategies in setting shared services rates and that  they only use the allocation strategy when the other strategies would not  work well."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Working Capital Fund Customer Advisory Board", "paragraphs": ["Justice established its eight-member Customer Advisory Board (CAB) in  1994 to improve customer satisfaction with the working capital fund.

First, JMD  officials explained that it is difficult to provide that information early  because of the timing of when the plan is finalized and when the CAB  meetings must occur. JMD officials said that they begin the operating plan  process late in the fiscal year to ensure that updated data are available to  adjust rates for the coming year. At the same time, the meeting needs to  occur early in the fiscal year so that CAB members can approve the  operating plan, which includes updated shared services rates that will be  used to renew reimbursable agreements with customers. Second, officials  were concerned about sharing a draft plan that had not been finalized.  Lastly, JMD officials were concerned that if they provided the information  in advance, CAB members would focus too exclusively on component- specific details and limit the group\u2019s ability to engage in a high-level  discussion about the fund. This year, in response to discussions about  preliminary observations from focus groups conducted as part of our  review, JMD provided CAB members with the operating plan about a  week before the annual meeting.

Nevertheless, customers want  more opportunities to learn about upcoming service enhancements or  changes. JMD officials told us that they have taken steps, such as those  mentioned above, to improve communications with customers and that  they remain committed to doing so. Although communication is clearly a  shared responsibility between the customer and the shared services  provider, effectively communicating with customers involves sharing  relevant analysis and information as well as providing opportunities for  customer input.

Accordingly, JMD officials told  us that the working capital fund no longer receives its own audited  financial statements; instead Justice develops performance measures for  the OBD, under which the working capital fund audits were consolidated.  This audit approach does not provide JMD with an opportunity to  specifically measure working capital fund-level performance. In its agency  comments, Justice clarified that while the working capital fund is part of a  broader audited financial statement, performance measures are  continually tracked and maintained through the department\u2019s Quarterly  Status Report process during budget execution activities. Nevertheless,  as we noted earlier, the workload measures that are tracked do not  assess whether the fund is effectively managed, which is a key operating  principle for working capital funds.", "Since the fund\u2019s creation in 1975, changes in the work environment,  technologies, budget conditions, agency needs, and long-term  efficiencies have had an impact on how JMD provides shared services to  its customers. Therefore, opportunities exist for JMD to evaluate whether  the working capital fund provides shared services efficiently or the  services are aligned with current departmental needs. For example,  customers told us that while they need most services provided by the  working capital fund, JMD has required them to use some services  despite customers\u2019 ability to provide these services themselves.  Specifically, one customer said that although her component had  received appropriations to develop security training, it was required to  purchase the same training from the working capital fund a few years  later. She questioned whether components could have provided this  training more cheaply and effectively than JMD. Another customer said  that although his component owned and preferred its own audio  equipment, it was required to use speakers and microphones provided by  the working capital fund whenever events were held in the main Justice  building. Both customers stated that JMD should assess whether the  working capital fund should continue to provide those services for all  components.", "If available, specific working capital fund-level performance information  would allow JMD to regularly compare actual performance with planned  or expected performance. Making adjustments to the fund management  and services, as appropriate, in a corresponding management review  process could help JMD achieve the efficiencies that working capital  funds were designed to produce, potentially freeing up resources that  could be realigned for other departmental initiatives. Further, such a  review could also allow JMD to better reassess functions to ensure that  the working capital fund continues to provide the critical underlying  infrastructure and support that allow other Justice components to perform  their primary functions.

They also create  incentives for customers and managers to exercise cost control and  economic restraint. Given the fiscal pressures facing the federal  government, consolidating operations could potentially achieve cost  savings and help agencies provide more efficient and effective services.  Agencies can maximize the potential of these opportunities by following  four key working capital fund operating principles. Specifically, these  principles are to clearly delineate roles and responsibilities, ensure self- sufficiency by recovering the agency\u2019s actual costs, measure  performance, and build in flexibility to obtain customer input and meet  customer needs. JMD effectively tracks working capital fund moneys in  accordance with fiscal law, clearly delineates roles and responsibilities  within the fund, and ensures self-sufficiency by recovering total shared  services costs. Further, customers noted positive benefits from shared  services, including the breadth of services offered, the experience and  knowledge of shared services staff, and the convenience and ease of  having these services provided in-house.", "Customers do not always understand the basis for the rates they pay and  lack assurances that fund costs are equitably distributed among  customers. Although JMD established the CAB to improve customer  satisfaction with the working capital fund, board members do not find the  annual meeting\u2014JMD\u2019s primary vehicle for engaging board members  about shared services and their accompanying rates\u2014a useful forum in  which to understand and provide advice on fund management and  operations. Further, JMD does not have a systematic way to  communicate with non-CAB customers, which results in uneven flow and  availability of information among working capital fund customers,  especially regarding the structures of some shared services rates. JMD  officials described various ways that they push information on rates and  services out to their customers but ultimately agreed that some customers  may have better access to this information than others, and said that they  remained committed to continuing to improve communication with  customers. Providing ample opportunity for customers to provide input on  services and voice their concerns about the fund is a key principle for  managing working capital funds. Further, transparent and equitable  pricing methodologies allow agencies to ensure that shared services  rates charged recover agencies\u2019 actual costs and reflect customers\u2019  service usage. If customers understand how rates are determined, they  can better anticipate changes to assumptions, identify their effect on  costs, and incorporate this information into their budget planning.", "Customer experiences with getting clear, timely, well-explained bills for  working capital fund services are mixed, and our review of customer bills  for shared services found that some services do not always provide  enough information for the customers to understand the basis for the  charges contained in the bills. As a result, customers\u2019 ability to anticipate  their actual charges at the end of the year and to properly account for  these costs was inhibited. Although customers do not always provide  JMD with points of contact for billing information, we believe that helping  to ensure that the right information gets to the right people at the right  time is part of providing good customer service.", "Although JMD tracks and monitors limited performance information for  some shared services, it does not have measures to assess how  effectively it manages the fund, such as whether managers are  responsive to customer inquiries or billing error rates\u2014two areas with  which customers have expressed concern. By establishing performance  measures and goals for working capital fund operations that align with  Justice\u2019s strategic goals, and putting a management review process in  place to track fund performance, JMD would have the necessary tools to  know whether the fund is achieving the efficiencies that intragovernmental  revolving funds were designed to produce.
