However, civilian agencies have generally not used the Title I authority and most differ from DOD in deciding when to apply it. For example, DOD places ratings on most of its contracts before critical defense items are needed. In contrast, agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) generally request ratings after delivery needs are identified, potentially delaying critical items during emergencies. Also, agencies responsible for responding to domestic emergencies and procuring resources in the areas of food and agriculture, health resources, and civil transportation, lack policies and guidance that could facilitate execution of the Title I authority and delivery of items needed in an emergency. While the Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Health and Human Services are developing regulations to establish a framework for considering priority ratings, the Department of Transportation (DOT) has not yet begun to do so. Other DPA authorities have been used exclusively by DOD or have not been triggered by recent events. For example, DOD has generally been the sole user of the Title III authority for expansion of production capabilities, while events that would activate some Title VII authorities--such as the National Defense Executive Reserve and voluntary agreements--have not occurred. Agencies have taken steps towards fulfilling their offset reporting requirements to Congress, but data collected by the Department of Commerce limits the analysis of the economic effect of offsets. Commerce officials noted that a more detailed analysis could be provided if they requested more specific product data from prime contractors. Also, a DOD-chaired interagency team--required to report on its consultations with foreign nations on limiting the adverse effects of offsets--has reached consensus with other nations that adverse effects exist, but not yet on best practices to address them. Actions by the National Commission on Offsets have similarly been limited in the assessment of economic effects."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["During the Korean War, Congress enacted the Defense Production Act of  1950 (DPA) to ensure the availability of industrial resources to meet the  needs of the Department of Defense (DOD).

Congress has expanded DPA\u2019s coverage to include crises resulting from  natural disasters or \u201cman-caused events\u201d not amounting to an armed  attack on the United States. The definition of \u201cnational defense\u201d in the Act  has been amended to include emergency preparedness activities  conducted pursuant to Title VI of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief  and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) and critical infrastructure  protection and restoration. In 2003, the DPA was reauthorized through  September 30, 2008.", "Currently, only Titles I, III, and VII are in effect:    Title I authorizes the President to require priority performance on  contracts or orders and allocate materials, services, and facilities as  necessary or appropriate to promote the national defense or to  maximize domestic energy supplies for national defense needs. The  authority allows priority-rated contracts or orders to take preference  over any other unrated contract or order if a contractor cannot meet all  required delivery dates. The authority is delegated among various  agencies, including DOD, USDA, and Commerce, with respect to  different types of resources such as water, food and agriculture, and  industrial resources. Currently, Commerce administers the only  priorities and allocations system that is actively used\u2014the Defense  Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS)\u2014which is used for industrial  resources. Commerce has delegated its authority to use priority ratings  for industrial resources to DOD, DOE, and DHS in support of approved  national defense, energy, and homeland security programs.", "Title III allows agencies to provide a variety of financial incentives to  domestic firms to invest in production capabilities to ensure that the  domestic industrial and technological base is capable of meeting the  critical national security needs of the United States. It may be used  when domestic sources are required and firms cannot, or will not, act  on their own to meet a national defense production need. Title III  financial incentives are designed to reduce the risks for domestic  suppliers associated with the capitalization and investments required to  establish, expand, or preserve production capabilities. Executive Order  12,919 authorized the authority to implement Title III actions to the  Secretary of Defense and the heads of other federal agencies and  designates the Secretary of Defense as the DPA Fund Manager. DOD\u2019s  Office of Technology Transition provides top-level management,  direction, and oversight of the DPA Title III program. The Air Force  serves as the Executive Agent for DOD\u2019s Title III program, and  maintains a program office to execute the authority under the guidance  of the Office of the Secretary of Defense.", "Title VII provides for a range of authorities, which include giving  private firms that participate in voluntary agreements for preparedness  programs, defenses from aspects of the antitrust laws and protecting  contractors who honor priority-rated contracts from lawsuits brought  by other customers. Title VII allows for establishing a National Defense  Executive Reserve (NDER) composed of recognized experts from the  private sector and government, which could be activated in the event of  an emergency. Title VII also provides for investigative authority to  collect information on the U.S. industrial base, which has been used by  Commerce to conduct surveys and prepare reports at the request of the  armed services, Congress, and industry.", "DPA also requires the President to report annually to Congress on the  effect of offsets\u2014a range of incentives or conditions provided to foreign  governments to purchase U.S. military goods and services\u2014on U.S.  defense preparedness, industrial competitiveness, employment, and trade.  Additionally, DPA requires Commerce to prepare a report to the Congress  on the cumulative effects of offsets on defense trade, with a focus on the  U.S. defense subcontractor base.", "Defense offsets include coproduction arrangements and subcontracting,  technology transfers, in-country procurements, marketing and financial  assistance, and joint ventures. Foreign governments use offsets to reduce  the financial effect of their defense purchases, obtain valuable technology  and manufacturing know-how, support domestic employment, create or  expand their defense industries, and make the use of their national funds  for foreign purchases more politically palatable. Views on defense offsets  range from beliefs that they are both positive and an unavoidable part of  doing business overseas to beliefs that they negatively affect the U.S.  industrial base. U.S. prime contractors have indicated that if they did not  offer offsets, export sales would be reduced and the positive effects of  those exports on the U.S. economy and defense industrial base would be  lost. Critics charge that negative aspects of offset transactions limit or  negate the economic and industrial benefits claimed to be associated with  defense export sales.", "The effect of offsets on the U.S. economy has been a concern for many  years, and Congress has on numerous occasions required some federal  agencies to take steps to define and address offset issues. DPA, as  amended, provided for an interagency team to consult with foreign nations  on limiting the adverse effects of offsets in defense procurement\u2014without  damaging the U.S. economy or defense preparedness\u2014and provide an  annual report on their consultations and meetings.

We found a lack of developed policies or guidance also may limit agencies\u2019  ability to use the authority in emergencies. Other authorities in the DPA  have had limited use. Specifically, Title III authority to expand production  capabilities for industrial resources or critical technology essential to the  national defense has been used almost exclusively for defense needs, and  circumstances have not required use of some Title VII authorities, such as  the National Defense Executive Reserve or voluntary agreements."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Agencies\u2019 Timely Use of Title I Authorities Could Be Limited in Emergencies", "paragraphs": ["While other agencies have used or have considered using Title I\u2019s priorities  and allocations authority, DOD has been the primary user. DOD places  priority ratings as a proactive measure on almost all of its contracts for  industrial resources, which number approximately 300,000 annually, to  facilitate timely execution of the authority. The Title I authority allows  rated contracts or orders to take preference over any other unrated  contract or order if a contractor cannot meet all required delivery dates.  DOD has used the authority in recent years to prioritize the delivery of  material for body armor for the Army and Marine Corps and to ensure that  the military\u2019s Counter-Improvised Explosive Device systems and the Mine  Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle program receive high industrial  priority. DOD employs this approach to ensure that its use of the priorities  and allocations authority is self-executing, which it reports should mitigate  the risk of not having critical items to meet defense requirements. The U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), which executes the authority for  water resources, also uses this approach to procure water through  advance contracts for emergency response purposes, according to a  USACE official.", "In contrast, officials from other agencies indicated that they would decide  to place priority ratings on contracts or modifications on a case-by-case  basis after a triggering event had identified an issue affecting delivery.  DHS reported that it has authorized or endorsed to the Department of  Commerce the use of priority ratings 15 times since 2003, which includes  endorsing other federal agencies\u2019 use of priority ratings in support of  homeland security programs. DHS makes endorsements with respect to  programs, not specific contracts. Over half of these have been in support  of critical infrastructure protection and restoration requirements. For  example, a railroad company used a priority-rated contract to procure  switch equipment and generators to help restore rail service in the Gulf  Coast region following Hurricane Katrina. DHS also endorsed the use of a  priority rating for a Department of State continuity of operations facility  for which Commerce authorized a priority rating for a contract to procure  a generator to provide emergency power. However, DHS officials told us  that, unlike DOD, its contracts, including those placed for emergency  preparedness purposes, do not automatically receive priority ratings.", "DOE, HHS, USDA, and DOT have had little or no experience using Title I  priorities and allocations authority. The National Nuclear Security  Administration, a separately organized agency within DOE, has applied  priority ratings to contracts primarily in support of defense and atomic  energy programs. Aside from these purposes, DOE has not encountered a  need requiring the use of its priority and allocations authority for energy  resources in the past several years. However, DOE also reported that it has  considered using the authority in response to a number of emergency  preparedness and disaster response cases, such as the restoration of  refinery services affected by fire and flooding in 2007. Upon consideration,  DOE determined that use of the authority was not necessary. DOT has not  used the Title I authority since the DPA was reauthorized in 2003, but has  used it in the past for airport security and in support of DOD during the  Gulf War. Appendix II describes DOT\u2019s current and past use. While HHS  and USDA officials said that they have not encountered circumstances to  date that would require the use of priority rated orders, HHS officials  anticipated that they could use the authority to place priority ratings on  contracts prior to an emergency for a selected number of health resources  needed in an emergency, such as masks, respirators, and antibiotics. In  contrast, USDA and DOT officials indicated that they would place a rating  on a contract once it was determined that the private sector could not  otherwise respond to a need.", "Most of the agencies we reviewed play a key role in an emergency\u2014under  the National Response Framework\u2014to execute contracts to procure  needed goods and services in areas such as transportation, human  services, and energy. We have previously recommended that DHS provide  guidance on advance procurement practices and procedures for those  federal agencies with roles and responsibilities under the National  Response Plan. Our prior work identified a number of emergency  response practices in the public and private sectors that provide insight  into how the federal government can better manage its disaster-related  procurements, including developing knowledge of contractor capabilities  and prices, establishing vendor relationships prior to the disaster, and  establishing a scalable operations plan to adjust the level of capacity to  match the response with the need. DHS and Commerce officials  recognized that while the priorities and allocations authority cannot be  used for procurement of items that are commonly available in sufficient  quantities, emergency situations can quickly affect the availability of  items. Further, priority ratings can be placed on procurement documents  that provide for items as needed but would not be considered rated until a  specific delivery date was identified and received by the supplier.  However, agencies have generally not considered placing priority ratings  on contracts for critical emergency response items before an emergency  occurs and, instead, would wait until there is an issue that affects delivery  of needed goods and services.", "Agency officials acknowledged that there is a need to have policies and  guidance in order to implement the Title I priorities and allocations  authority, but the degree to which agencies have accomplished this varies.  Currently, the Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) is the  only active system for implementing the authority in operation, used  primarily by Commerce, DOD, DOE, and DHS for industrial resources.  Commerce has established a regulation governing DPAS, and DOD and  DOE have internal policies and procedures for using the authority. DHS is  in the process of establishing policies and procedures to fully implement  its priorities and allocations authority. Despite these efforts, gaps remain.  Currently, there is no system for using the priorities and allocations  authority for food and agriculture, health, and civil transportation  resources. USDA and HHS officials told us they are in the process of  developing regulations for using Title I for food and agriculture and health  resources, respectively, modeled on DPAS. DOT officials acknowledged  that they do not have an established system for using the authority for civil  transportation needs, but have internal protocols in place to contact  Commerce and DHS should the need arise. DOT officials said they have  not yet begun the process to develop regulations for a priorities and  allocations system. Table 1 provides a summary of the status of agencies\u2019  priorities and allocations policies and guidance.", "DOD, DHS, and DOE have supplemented their policies and guidance with  training and outreach efforts to increase awareness of the authority and its  potential applications. DOD has developed online training on the use of its  priorities and allocations authority, and DHS is currently developing a Web  site and a training program for its personnel and other groups such as  contractors and state and local government personnel. DOE is updating its  energy emergency support function operations manual with references to  the authority, and has incorporated information on use of the authority in  its emergency responder training.", "Given the status of available policies and guidance for certain resources,  additional time could be required to react to emergency situations as  agencies determine the proper procedures for using the authority. In  addition, agencies may have to rely on less-efficient means for using the  authority. For example, a DOD official stated that the Defense Logistics  Agency has been working with HHS to establish a Memorandum of  Understanding to use priority ratings to procure auto-injector medical  devices for the military, as DOD\u2019s priorities and allocations authority does  not apply to health resources. Further, DOT lacks a system for exercising  the authority for civil transportation that could help facilitate more timely  delivery of critical items and services and could avoid additional steps to  identify the appropriate processes each time an emergency situation  arises."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other DPA Authorities Have Been Used Primarily for Defense Needs as Events Have Not Triggered Their Use in Other Areas", "paragraphs": ["DOD has generally been the exclusive user of Title III\u2019s authority to  stimulate investment and expand production capabilities and is currently  the only agency with a program office prepared to readily use the  authority. DOD has used the authority, for example, to modernize and  preserve two domestic manufacturing sources for next-generation  radiation-hardened microelectronics for space and missile systems and to  reestablish a domestic production source for high-purity beryllium metal  that was lost when the sole domestic production facility was shut down. It  is also being used to establish a domestic source for lithium ion battery  production and to expand production of lightweight, transparent armor for  the military. Appendix III includes examples of DOD\u2019s use of the Title III  authority. DOE officials stated that they have worked with the DOD Title  III Program Office on cooperative projects. For example, they noted that  they actively managed a project to supply high temperature  superconductors. Additionally, DOE and National Aeronautics and Space  Administration (NASA) have contributed money in support of DOD- managed projects. Other agencies have considered using the authority for  non-defense needs but pursued other alternatives. For example, DHS had  committed funds toward a potential project on biological agents, but  pulled back planned funding because DHS was pursuing an alternative  project. Similarly, HHS considered using Title III authority to expand  production of vaccines, but no project resulted. USDA officials stated that,  based on the availability of suppliers for items they typically purchase,  they did not see a need to use Title III.", "DOD officials noted that statutory limitations on the use of Title III  authority present challenges to efficient use of the authority. For example,  the requirement that Congress be notified of new projects via the annual  budget cycle creates a waiting period of up to one year before new  projects can be initiated and can hinder use of the authority to meet  rapidly evolving defense industrial base needs. To address this and other  challenges, DOD has proposed amendments to DPA. These include  allowing for notification to Congress of new projects in writing throughout  the year rather than through the budget cycle, as well as reducing the  required waiting period for awarding contracts from 60 to 30 days and  increasing the statutory limitation on actions under Title III from  $50,000,000 to $200,000,000 before specific authorization in law is  required. According to officials, past Title III projects were primarily  initiated and funded through DOD based on the needs of particular  programs or through information received from industries. However, as  shown in figure 1, a growing number of projects have been funded through  Congressionally directed projects.", "Some civilian agency officials identified other limitations in initiating new  projects under Title III, such as a lack of institutional willingness to use  the authority and available funds. For example, DOE officials stated that it  would be difficult to defend, fund, and manage a project from a  departmental standpoint. However, they added that DOE\u2019s involvement in  current projects suggests that Title III may be used to enhance production  capabilities for industrial resources needed for energy production and  distribution.", "The Title VII authority to collect information on the U.S. industrial base  has been used by Commerce almost exclusively to address capabilities of  industries supplying DOD. Because DOD has a diverse supplier base, these  assessments have covered a range of industries from biotechnology to  textiles and apparel. While Commerce officials recognized that the DPA\u2019s  definition of national defense has been expanded to include emergency  preparedness and the protection of critical infrastructure, they stated that  an assessment at the request of agencies other than DOD would require  additional resources based on current and projected workloads.", "In general, agencies have policies and guidance on using Title VII\u2019s other  authorities but have never had to employ them in an actual event. The  Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), under DHS, has interim  guidance and is preparing a new regulation on forming and activating  NDER units\u2014reserves composed of government and industry experts\u2014in  the event of an emergency, yet has not activated its NDER and is currently  assessing the need for it. While DOE and DOT no longer have active  NDER units, which were associated with Cold War threats, a DOE official  stated that the department is interested in continuing to work with DHS to  restore its unit while DOT officials expressed similar interest in re- establishing an NDER should a justifiable reason be established under  existing crisis management programs and authorities.", "DOT officials stated that it is positioned to use Title VII\u2019s authority to  develop voluntary agreements and plans of action for preparedness  programs and expansion of production capacity and supply that make  defenses from antitrust laws available to participating industry  representatives. DOT currently has voluntary agreements with commercial  tanker and maritime shipping industries to rapidly mobilize resources in  support of defense needs, but noted that events have not triggered the  activation of the established plans of action. DHS reported that because of  the time needed to use this authority it could take 21 to 50 days to  establish a voluntary agreement following a disaster, affecting the  usefulness of the authority in an emergency. HHS officials told us that  another statute provides similar authority that the agency could implement  more quickly for certain health-related purposes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Efforts to Assess Foreign Offsets Have Been Limited", "paragraphs": ["Agencies have taken steps towards fulfilling their offset reporting  requirements, but the information in these reports does not provide a basis  for fully evaluating the effect of offsets on the U.S. economy or take steps  to address them.

Efforts from an interagency team  chaired by DOD to consult with other countries on limiting harmful effects  of offsets have resulted in a consensus with other nations that negative  effects exist, but not yet on best practices to address them.

Commerce\u2019s annual reports provide a summary of total offset agreement  and transaction activity entered into between U.S. defense contractors and  foreign governments in connection with U.S. defense related exports.  Commerce\u2019s efforts to quantify the employment effects of offsets are  based on limited data. For example, the employment analysis relies on  aggregated defense aerospace data, which do not include other defense  sectors nor delineate between subsectors of the aerospace industry.  Further, the most recent annual report on offsets noted that its analysis  does not include the potential effects of nearly $1 billion of technology  transfer, training, and overseas investment offset transactions,  representing nearly 24 percent of average annual offset transactions.", "The 2003 DPA reauthorization also requires Commerce to report on the  impact of offsets on domestic prime contractors and, to the extent  practicable, the first three lower tier subcontractors. These reports are to  address domestic employment, including any job losses on an annual  basis. The August 2004 report, produced in response to the 2003 DPA  reauthorization, provided useful data on the scope of offset agreements  and transactions during the preceding 5-year period, but data collected in  surveys of prime and subcontractors limited the analysis on employment  effects. To assess the effect of offsets on domestic employment,  Commerce surveyed prime contractors and three tiers of subcontractors.  While Commerce acknowledged that it could have requested  documentation for all of the nearly 700 weapon systems and components  contracts for the 5-year period (1998 through 2002), documentation was  requested for only two weapon systems from each of the 13 U.S. prime  contractors. Commerce cited sensitivity to not burdening contractors and  a desire to be responsive to reporting time frames as a cause. The analysis  was further limited by a less than 40 percent response rate to the survey of  the three tiers of subcontractors. Moreover, this survey used subjective  measurements by asking for subcontractors\u2019 perceptions of the influence  of offsets on employment, asking respondents to rank offsets among a  variety of factors as they related to increases or decreases in U.S.  employment.", "We have previously stated that, in evaluating offsets and identifying their  effects on the U.S. economy as a whole, it is difficult to isolate the effects  of offsets from the numerous other factors affecting specific industry  sectors. Despite such difficulties, Commerce officials stated that they  could request more specific product data from prime contractors that  would allow for more detailed analysis of the effect of offsets on the U.S.  economy. Under DPA, the Secretary of Commerce is given authority to  promulgate regulations to collect offset data from U.S. defense firms  entering into contracts for the sale of defense articles or services to  foreign countries or firms that are subject to offset agreements exceeding  $5 million in value. The Secretary of Commerce designated this authority  to the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), which published its first  offset regulations in 1994. The regulations, which have never been  updated, require companies to annually report information such as a name  or description of the weapon system; defense item or service subject to  the offset agreement; the name of the country of the purchasing entity; the  approximate value of export sale subject to offset; and the total dollar  value of the offset agreement. The regulations also require prime  contractors to report on the broad industry category, based on outdated  four-digit Standard Industry Classification (SIC) codes, in which offset  transactions are fulfilled. Currently, 84 percent of the value of export  contracts involving offsets submitted by prime contractors are for the  aerospace industry and there is no delineation among subsectors of the  aerospace industry.", "According to Commerce officials, their analysis of the economic effect of  offsets could be improved by requesting more detailed sector and product  information based on updated six-digit North American Industry  Classification System (NAICS) codes from prime contractors. As the  NAICS has replaced the SIC, such improvements would allow Commerce  to provide greater insight into the effects of offsets on specific subsectors  of the economy and would more closely match employment data already  used in their analysis. BIS is currently conducting a review of the data and  methodology used to assemble their annual reports on offsets. BIS  officials have stated that they will review additional sources of data from  sources such the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Commerce\u2019s Bureau of  Economic Analysis.

The commission, whose  members included representatives from government, business, labor, and  academia, produced an interim report in 2001 that described the extent  and nature of defense-related offsets in both defense and commercial  trade. It also described a variety of effects of offsets on the U.S. defense  supplier base. For example, the commission reported that while offsets  may facilitate defense export sales\u2014which can help maintain the  economic viability of certain U.S. firms\u2014offsets can also supplant a  significant amount of work and jobs that would go to U.S. firms if export  sales occurred without offsets. The commission also reported that U.S.  technology transfers through offsets often improved foreign firms\u2019  competitiveness, but rarely resulted in technology transfer back to the  United States. The commission was to provide a final report with areas for  additional study including the effects of indirect and commercial offsets,  the effects of offsets on industries other than aerospace as well as  concrete policy recommendations.
