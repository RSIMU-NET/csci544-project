However, in 2006, federal agencies restructured two key satellite acquisitions, the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R series (GOES-R). This involved removing key climate and space weather instruments. GAO was asked to (1) assess plans for restoring the capabilities that were removed from the two key satellite acquisitions, (2) evaluate federal efforts to establish a strategy for the long-term provision of satellite-provided climate data, and (3) evaluate federal efforts to establish a strategy for the longterm provision of satellite-provided space weather data. To do so, GAO analyzed agency plans and reports."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["After key climate and space weather instruments were removed from the NPOESS and GOES-R programs in 2006, federal agencies decided to restore selected capabilities in the near term. However, neither the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) nor the Department of Defense (DOD) has established plans to restore the full set of NPOESS capabilities over the life of the program. Further, NOAA has not made any plans to restore the advanced climate capabilities of the instrument that was removed from GOES-R. Expected gaps in coverage for the instruments that were removed range from 1 to 11 years, and begin as soon as 2015. Until these capabilities are in place, the agencies will not be able to provide key environmental data that are important for sustaining climate and space weather measurements. For over a decade, federal agencies and the climate community have clamored for a national interagency strategy to coordinate agency priorities, budgets, and schedules for environmental satellite observations over the long-term-- and the governance structure to implement that strategy. In mid-2009, a White House-sponsored interagency working group drafted a report that identifies and prioritizes near-term opportunities for environmental observations; however, the plan has not been approved by key entities within the Executive Office of the President and there is no schedule for finalizing it. In addition, the report does not address costs, schedules, or the long-term provision of satellite data, and there is no process or time frame for implementing it. Without a strategy for continuing environmental measurements over the coming decades and a means for implementing it, agencies will continue to independently pursue their immediate priorities on an ad hoc basis, the economic benefits of a coordinated approach to investments in earth observation may be lost, and our nation's ability to understand climate change may be limited. While federal agencies have taken steps to plan for continued space weather observations in the near-term, they lack a strategy for the long-term provision of space weather data. NOAA and DOD plan to replace aging satellites, and an interagency space weather program drafted two reports on how to mitigate the loss of key satellites and instruments. These reports were submitted to the Executive Office of the President's Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) in the fall of 2009. However, OSTP has no schedule for approving or releasing the reports. Until OSTP approves and releases the reports, it will not be clear whether the reports provide a strategy to ensure the long-term provision of space weather data--or whether the current efforts are simply attempts to ensure short-term data continuity. Without a comprehensive longterm strategy for the provision of space weather data, agencies may make ad hoc decisions to ensure continuity in the near term and risk making inefficient investment decisions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Environment-observing satellites provide data that are used for weather  forecasting, as well as climate monitoring, prediction, and research.

USGEO officials could not provide a schedule for completing this  near-term interagency plan.", "This draft report is an important first step in developing a national strategy  for earth observations, but it is not sufficient to ensure the long-term  provision of data vital to understanding the climate. The draft report  integrates different agencies\u2019 requirements and proposes continuing or  improving earth observations in 17 separate areas, using both satellite and  land-based measuring systems. However, the report does not include  costs, schedules, or plans for the long-term provision of satellite data. For  example, it does not fully address the capabilities that were removed from  the NPOESS and GOES-R missions. While the report notes the importance  of continuing current plans to fly the Total Solar Irradiance Sensor on the  NPP satellite and the Clouds and the Earth\u2019s Radiant Energy System  sensor on the NPP and first NPOESS satellites, it does not make  recommendations for what to do over the long term.", "In addition, the federal government lacks a clear process for implementing  an interagency strategy. Key offices within the Executive Office of the  President with responsibilities for environmental observations, including  OSTP and the Council for Environmental Quality, have not established  processes or time frames for implementing an interagency strategy\u2014 including steps for working with OMB to ensure that agencies\u2019 annual  budgets are aligned with the interagency strategy. As a result, even if an  interagency strategy was finalized, it is not clear how OSTP and OMB  would ensure that the responsibilities identified in the interagency strategy  are consistent with agency plans and are funded within agency budgets.", "Agency officials cite multiple reasons for the difficulties they have  encountered over the last decade in establishing a national interagency  plan for long-term earth observations. One issue involves conflicting  priorities between and among agencies, including disconnects between the  research and operational communities and between the weather and  climate communities. Another issue is the lack of agreement on how and  when to transition research capabilities to operational satellites\u2014and how  to fund them.", "Without a long-term interagency strategy for satellite observations, and a  means for implementing it, agencies face gaps in satellite data and risk  making ad hoc decisions on individual satellites. For example, until  recently, NASA\u2019s QuikScat research satellite provided measurements of  the effect of wind on ocean surfaces, which were used by the National  Weather Service to improve tropical and midlatitude storm warnings and  by the National/Naval Ice Center to improve its understanding of Arctic  and Antarctic ice environments. However, NOAA does not plan to  replace the satellite until at least 2014. This extended gap leaves the  organizations that used QuikScat with degraded measurements. As  another example, Landsat satellites have provided data on land cover  change, vegetation mapping, and wildfire effects for over 35 years.  Currently, there are two Landsat satellites in operation, and both are long past their expected life spans. While there is a plan to develop and la the Landsat Data Continuity Mission by June 2013, there is no comm to ensure continuity after that mission. satellite program, there will be a significant gap in land cover images an other important global climate data ranging from water manageme nt to  agriculture.", "Without Landsat or a similar Until an interagency strategy for earth observation is established, and a  clear process for implementing it is in place, federal agencies will continue  to procure their immediate priorities on an ad hoc basis, the economic  benefits of a coordinated approach to investments in earth observation  may be lost, and the continuity of key measurements may be lost. This will  hinder our nation\u2019s ability to understand long-term climate changes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies Lack a Strategy for the Long-term Provision of Space Weather Data", "paragraphs": ["While key federal agencies have taken steps to plan for continued space  weather observations in the near term, they lack a strategy for the long- term provision of space weather data.

It subsequently developed, again at the request of  OSTP, two reports documenting specific recommendations for the future  of space weather, one on what to do about the Advanced Composition  Explorer and the other on the replacement of the space weather  capabilities removed from the NPOESS program.

Until OSTP releases the reports, it will not be clear whether they provide a  clear strategy to ensure the long-term provision of space weather data\u2014or  whether the current efforts are simply ad hoc attempts to ensure short- term data continuity.

The gaps in satellite coverage are expected to affect the continuity of  important climate and space weather measurements, such as our  understanding of how weather cycles impact global food production, and  when radio and GPS satellite communications are likely to be affected by  space weather.", "Looking more broadly, despite repeated calls for interagency strategies for  the long-term provision of environmental data (both for climate and space  weather purposes), our nation still lacks such plans. Efforts to develop  even short-term strategies have languished in committees and offices  supporting the Executive Office of the President, and there is no schedule  for them to be approved or released. Further, even if an interagency  strategy for the long-term provision of environmental observations was  established, there are not clear processes in place to implement it or align  it with individual agencies\u2019 plans and annual budgets. Specifically, key  organizations within the Executive Office of the President, including the  Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Office of Management and  Budget, and the Council on Environmental Quality, lack a coordinated  process for ensuring that individual agencies align their plans and budgets  to the greater good identified in an interagency plan.", "Until the Executive Office of the President establishes comprehensive  interagency strategies and internal processes that foster the  implementation of these strategies, individual agencies will continue to  address their most pressing priorities as they arise and opportunities to  effectively and efficiently plan ahead will be lost."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to effectively address our country\u2019s need for sustained  environmental observations, we recommend that the Assistant to the  President for Science and Technology, in collaboration with key Executive  Office of the President entities (including the Office of Science and  Technology Policy, the Office of Management and Budget, the Council on  Environmental Quality, and the National Science and Technology  Council), take the following four actions:    Establish a firm deadline for the completion and release of three key  reports on environmental observations:    USGEO\u2019s report on near-term priorities and opportunities in earth  observations, called the Strategic Assessment Report;    The National Space Weather Program\u2019s report on how to address the  loss of the Advanced Composition Explorer capabilities; and   The National Space Weather Program\u2019s report on how to address the  space weather capabilities that were removed from the NPOESS  program.", "Direct USGEO to establish an interagency strategy to address the long- term provision of environmental observations from satellites that includes  costs and schedules for the satellites, as well as a plan for the relevant  agencies\u2019 future budgets.", "Establish an ongoing process, with timelines, for obtaining approval of the  interagency strategy and aligning it with agency plans and annual budgets.", "Direct the National Space Weather Program Council to establish an  interagency strategy for the long-term provision of space weather  observations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["A senior policy analyst from the Office of Science and Technology  Policy/Executive Office of the President provided comments on a draft of  this report via e-mail.

Further, officials  agreed that the Strategic Assessment Report is a first step in developing a  strategy for earth observations, and noted that they plan to use the report  as a basis for meeting congressional reporting requirements directing  OSTP to develop a strategy on earth observations. In crafting this strategy,  it will be important for OSTP to address long-term interagency needs and  to work with OMB to ensure that the long-term plans are aligned with  individual agencies\u2019 plans and budgets. If the plan does not include these  elements, individual agencies will continue to address only their most  pressing priorities, other agencies\u2019 needs may be ignored, and the  government may lose the ability to effectively and efficiently address its  earth observation needs.", "In its comments, NOAA noted that it had completed its actions relative to  delivering input to the Executive Office of the President for developing  strategies for climate and space weather observations. We agree; it is now  up to the Executive Office of the President to establish and implement an  interagency strategy for the long-term provision of these observations. The  agency also responded to our statement that it had not established plans to  restore all of the capabilities that were removed from the GOES-R and  NPOESS programs. Regarding GOES-R, NOAA stated that it will continue  to evaluate the feasibility and priority of addressing requirements and  determine the appropriate means to meet them.", "Regarding NPOESS, NOAA noted that, in fiscal year 2009, the agency  restored the highest priority climate sensors that were removed from the  NPOESS program. NOAA also reported that the fiscal year 2011  President\u2019s Budget Request includes plans to restore additional key  climate sensors on JPSS and other satellite programs. However, as  discussed in our report, NOAA\u2019s efforts to restore sensors in 2009  addressed only selected near-term needs and did not address the full set of  capabilities over the life of the NPOESS program. Further, regarding the  fiscal year 2011 President\u2019s Budget Request, at the time of our review the  full set of capabilities planned for the JPSS program had not yet been  determined. For example, the Total Solar Irradiance Sensor (which was  one of the high-priority sensors that was restored to the NPOESS program  in fiscal year 2009) will not be included on the JPSS satellite, but could  instead be included on another to-be-determined satellite. As noted several  times in our report, we focused on the capabilities that were planned for  the NPOESS program because plans for JPSS had not yet been finalized.  We have ongoing work to examine the JPSS program, which will further  evaluate NOAA\u2019s plans as they are solidified. In a final comment, NOAA  stated that we did not distinguish between potential data gaps in existing  and new capabilities, and suggested that we only use the term \u201cgap\u201d to  describe the potential loss of an existing capability. Given that the  requirements for the NPOESS programs were developed and validated by  multiple agencies nearly a decade ago, and requirements for the GOES-R  sensor were revalidated by NOAA in 2007, we believe it is appropriate to  view the removal of these requirements as gaps\u2014whether they represent  existing or new capabilities.", "In its written comments, NASA provided further details on its efforts to  advance the understanding of earth systems and Heliophysics through  environmental research satellites, and provided clarification on plans for  future missions that are included in the fiscal year 2011 President\u2019s Budget  Request. The agency also noted that OSTP developed a plan for the future  of the land-imaging program, under which NASA would develop future  Landsat-like satellites on behalf of the Department of the Interior.  However, this plan was established in 2007 and has not yet been funded or  implemented. It is not clear that it will be implemented. This situation  illustrates that having an approved plan is not enough to ensure that  critical satellite capabilities are obtained, and reiterates the need for an  ongoing process that aligns interagency strategies with individual  agencies\u2019 plans and annual budgets.", "OSTP, NOAA, and NASA also provided technical comments on the report,  which we incorporated as appropriate.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.
