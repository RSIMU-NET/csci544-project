These efforts, carried out primarily through NNSA's Material Protection, Control, and Accounting (MPC&A) program, included a range of projects to upgrade security at dozens of Russian nuclear material sites, such as the installation of modern perimeter fencing, surveillance cameras, and equipment to track and account for nuclear material. However, not all planned upgrades were completed before cooperation ended in late 2014. NNSA also completed many\u2014but not all\u2014of its planned efforts to help Russia support its national-level security infrastructure, such as by helping improve the security of Russian nuclear materials in transit. In addition, NNSA made some progress in improving each site's ability to sustain its security systems, such as by training Russian site personnel on modern MPC&A practices and procedures. NNSA documentation that GAO reviewed showed that by the time cooperation ended, Russian sites had generally improved their ability to sustain their MPC&A systems, but this documentation showed that concerns remained.", "According to stakeholders, there is little specific information about the current state of security at Russian nuclear material sites because U.S. personnel no longer have access to sites to observe security systems and discuss MPC&A practices with Russian site personnel. However, stakeholders said there is some information on national-level efforts. Specifically, stakeholders said that Russia has improved regulations for some MPC&A practices, and there are signs that Russian sites receive funding for nuclear material security, though it is unlikely that Russian funding is sufficient to account for the loss of U.S. financial support. Regarding threats to Russia's nuclear material, nongovernmental experts GAO interviewed raised concerns about the risk of insider theft of Russian nuclear materials. Experts stated that it is likely that Russian sites have maintained nuclear material security systems to protect against threats from outsiders, but it is unlikely that sites are adequately protecting against the threat from insiders.", "Stakeholders said that there may be opportunities for limited future cooperation between the two countries to help improve Russian nuclear material security. Such opportunities could include technical exchanges and training. These opportunities could provide the United States with better information about the risk posed by Russia's nuclear materials and could help address areas of concern, such as by training Russian personnel to help sites better address the insider threat. However, any potential cooperation faces considerable challenges, according to stakeholders, most notably the deterioration of political relations between the two countries. In addition, stakeholders said that cooperation is challenged by current U.S. law, which generally prohibits NNSA from funding nuclear security activities in Russia; by Russian antagonism toward U.S. proposals to improve nuclear material security internationally; and by Russian conditions for cooperation that the United States has not been willing to meet."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, the United  States was concerned that political and economic instability and a lack of  government revenues threatened the security and control of Russia\u2019s  nuclear warheads and weapons-usable nuclear materials, including highly  enriched uranium (HEU) and plutonium.

Experts and national laboratory personnel noted that  training Russian personnel on technical matters\u2014such as how to  conduct comprehensive vulnerability assessments\u2014could improve  Russian security practices.", "Conversations on legal agreements. Some stakeholders said that  initiating conversations with Russia on the status of existing but  suspended legal agreements could provide an opening for other forms  of cooperation. For example, a few stakeholders mentioned an  existing\u2014but suspended\u2014research and development agreement  from 2013 under which future nuclear security cooperation might be   pursued if both parties were interested in reactivating the  agreement.", "Cooperation within multilateral organizations. Some stakeholders  noted that existing multilateral organizations, such as the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Global Initiative to Combat  Nuclear Terrorism, could provide venues for the United States to  pursue cooperative opportunities with Russia. For example, Russia  and the United States could cooperate on developing  recommendations to the IAEA on physical protection measures for  nuclear material, which could then be shared with IAEA member  states.", "Other opportunities. The Nuclear Threat Initiative, a U.S.  nongovernmental organization (NGO), and the Center for Energy and  Security Studies, a Russian NGO, coauthored a report that identified  51 mutually beneficial opportunities to cooperate in nuclear security,  nuclear safety, nuclear energy, nuclear science, and nuclear  environmental remediation. For example, the report identifies an  opportunity for Russian and U.S. experts to establish a joint research  and development program to improve nuclear security technologies to  address emerging threats to nuclear material storage sites, such as  drones.", "Russia would likely insist that it and the United States be seen as equal  partners under any future arrangement or program for cooperation on  nuclear security, according to stakeholders. However, U.S. project team  personnel told us that Russian nuclear material sites often lack the  financial resources to pay travel costs for Russian personnel or to cover  costs for venues or workshops necessary for training or the exchange of  best practices. Therefore, the level of funding to support any potential  future cooperation might be disproportionate between the United States  and Russia. Because we were unable to obtain views from Russian  officials and Russian nuclear material site representatives, we were  unable to establish the extent to which Russia would be willing to pursue  any form of nuclear material security cooperation with the United States,  regardless of funding sources and requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Cooperation Faces Significant Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Stakeholders we interviewed were generally pessimistic about  cooperation under the current political and diplomatic climate, and they  noted that the deterioration of political relations is the most significant  challenge to any future cooperation. Stakeholders identified other specific  challenges, including the following:", "Funding prohibition. Some stakeholders said that provisions in  recent appropriations acts and National Defense Authorization Acts  (NDAA) prohibiting NNSA from funding nuclear security activities in  Russia have been obstacles to cooperating on nuclear security  matters. In a report submitted to Congress in May 2019, NNSA stated  that \u201cthe lack of ability to sign new contracts or engage on a modest  scale denies NNSA the insights necessary to directly monitor nuclear  material security in Russia and the sustainment of past security  improvements.\u201d According to U.S. officials and U.S. project team  personnel, the prohibition largely prevents U.S. personnel from  sharing best practices with and training Russian counterparts, and the  existence of the prohibition discourages U.S. and Russian personnel  from interacting and maintaining relationships. Although the acts allow  the Secretary of Energy to waive the prohibition under certain  conditions, no secretary has done so since a prohibition was first  included in the fiscal year 2015 appropriations act. In addition,  according to NNSA officials we interviewed, the language describing  waiver requirements in NDAAs has become more restrictive in recent  years. Initially, the Secretary of Energy could waive the prohibition on  the basis of a notification to certain congressional committees that the   waiver was in the national security interest of the United States, an  accompanying justification, and the passage of 15 days. Starting with  the fiscal year 2017 NDAA, however, a waiver can only be issued if it  is necessary to address an urgent nuclear-related threat in Russia,  and any such waiver requires concurrence from the Secretary of  Defense and the Secretary of State.", "Russian conditions on cooperation. Stakeholders we interviewed  said that Russia has set conditions on any future nuclear security  cooperation. For example, they said that Russia has indicated that it is  unwilling to discuss nuclear security cooperation with the United  States unless the United States is willing to discuss related areas,  such as nuclear energy, nuclear safety, and nuclear science.  According to stakeholders, in the past the United States has been  unwilling to discuss these other areas as a condition for cooperating  on nuclear security.", "Russian antagonism to U.S. security efforts. Stakeholders noted  antagonism at some levels of the Russian government toward U.S.  nuclear security efforts. For example, although Russia participates in  nuclear security efforts at the IAEA, some stakeholders noted that  Russia regularly obstructs U.S. initiatives and recommendations in  that organization.", "As noted above, stakeholders view the general deterioration of political  relations between the United States and Russia as the greatest challenge  to cooperation, and it is not clear whether Russia is prepared to reengage  with the United States on these or other options for rekindling U.S.- Russian nuclear security cooperation. We reached out to the Russian  government to request meetings with Russian government officials and  representatives of nuclear material sites who could provide Russian  perspectives on efforts to secure Russia\u2019s nuclear materials, the status of  past U.S. nuclear material security investments, and potential  opportunities for cooperation. The Russian government declined our  requests to meet with these officials and site representatives. Therefore,  without Russian perspectives on the likelihood of possible future  cooperation, we were unable to determine whether changes to U.S.  policy, such as lifting the funding prohibition, would have any meaningful  effect on the status of nuclear security cooperation between the United  States and Russia."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of the classified version of this report to NNSA for  review and comment.

We identified the  stakeholders by contacting government agencies and NGOs with nuclear  security expertise and asking them to identify other knowledgeable  stakeholders. We reached out to these other knowledgeable stakeholders  and interviewed those who responded and were willing to speak with us.  To identify nongovernmental experts, we compiled a list of individuals  who stakeholders identified as having expertise in the area of nuclear  security in Russia. We also worked with a staff librarian to conduct an  independent search of published literature to identify nongovernmental  experts who had authored multiple publications related to Russian  nuclear security. In addition, to ascertain whether an individual should be  considered a nongovernmental expert, we considered other information,  such as invitations to speak at nuclear security panels, being an editor of  nuclear security related journals, and relevant positions in academic and  other nongovernmental institutions. We interviewed six nongovernmental  experts who fit these criteria.", "To examine the extent to which NNSA\u2019s planned nuclear material security  efforts in Russia were completed when cooperation ended and what  nuclear security concerns remained, we reviewed documents prepared by  NNSA and the national laboratories for each of the 25 nuclear material  sites in Russia where the United States worked previously with Russia to  improve security. To identify NNSA sustainability programs at a national  level, we reviewed GAO reports and NNSA project documentation. We  also reviewed NNSA guidelines that detailed how project teams were to  support and assess the ability of Russian sites to sustain their material  protection, control, and accounting (MPC&A) systems. We reviewed the  NNSA documents that assessed site sustainability and analyzed how site  sustainability had changed at sites by the end of cooperation. These  documents included project team assessments for each of the 25 sites in  seven different sustainability elements. In these assessments, project  teams provided ratings from low to high on the extent to which sites were  prepared to sustain these areas. We also reviewed NNSA documents and  identified concerns that site teams documented about site sustainability.  We then analyzed the concerns from the 25 sites and grouped similar  concerns into categories. We developed these categories based on the  similarity of the concerns, definitions of key nuclear security areas in  NNSA documents, and professional judgement. We then identified the six  concerns that appeared most frequently, which accounted for about 70  percent of all concerns.", "To describe what is known about the current state of nuclear security in  Russia\u2014in addition to interviews with our stakeholder group\u2014we  reviewed U.S. government and open-source documents. Specifically, we  reviewed reports from the International Panel on Fissile Materials, the  Nuclear Threat Institute, the National Academies of Science, and a  national laboratory; articles on Russian nuclear security; and periodic  reports on Russian nuclear security published by an expert independent  consultant. In addition to general internet searches for published  documents relating to Russian nuclear security and the MPC&A program,  we conducted literature searches of published materials with assistance  from a staff librarian; we excluded from our literature review any search  results that were published prior to 2014 or were not related to nuclear  material security in Russia. In addition to unclassified interviews with U.S.  government officials on Russian nuclear material security, we received  classified briefings from DOE. We requested threat and risk information  relating to Russian nuclear material security from the Central Intelligence  Agency, but we were not provided this information.", "To describe stakeholder views on potential opportunities for future U.S.- Russia nuclear security cooperation, we interviewed those in our  stakeholder group identified above. We also reviewed administration  plans and reports, including the National Security Strategy, the National  Strategy for Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Terrorism, and  NNSA\u2019s May 2019 Report to Congress describing NNSA\u2019s funding of  nuclear security improvements in Russia. To inform our understanding of  the prohibition on NNSA\u2019s expenditures on nuclear security in Russia, we  reviewed laws since fiscal year 2015 that restricted relevant NNSA  funding in some way. In addition, to obtain Russian perspectives on  nuclear material security and past U.S. efforts, we requested\u2014through  the State Department and the U.S. Embassy in Moscow\u2014interviews with  Russian officials at relevant Russian agencies and representatives at five  Russian nuclear material sites.
