This includes access with respect to transportation, polling places, voting equipment, and alternative voting methods. During the 2000 election, most polling places we inspected had one or more potential impediments that might prevent older voters and voters with disabilities from reaching voting rooms, although curbside voting accommodations were often made available. Additionally, our 2000 review of state provisions and practices related to accessible voting systems and accommodations in the voting room revealed that provisions to accommodate individuals with disabilities varied from state to state and may vary widely in their implementation. A 2004 GAO report also found transportation gaps in meeting the needs of seniors, which may create a barrier to voting for many elderly voters, and a lack of data on the extent of unmet needs. Since the passage of HAVA and the subsequent 2004 election, we have identified a number of reported efforts taken to improve voting access for people with disabilities. In particular, our 2006 report on election systems shows a marked increase in state provisions addressing the accessibility of polling places, voting systems, and alternative voting methods. However, the degree of change in accessibility is difficult to determine, in part because thousands of jurisdictions have primary responsibility for managing elections and ensuring an accurate vote count, and the complexity of the election system does not ensure that these provisions and reported practices are reflective of what occurs at polling places on election day. Understanding and addressing accessibility gaps represent enormous tasks for state and local election officials who are challenged by the multiplicity of responsibilities and requirements they must attend to within resource constraints. At the same time, as the population ages and the percentage of voters with disabilities expands, the expectation of accommodation and assistance to participate in this basic civic exercise will grow, making accessibility a key performance goal for our election community."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We appreciate the opportunity to participate in today\u2019s hearing on older  Americans\u2019 access to voting. Voting is fundamental to our democratic  system, and federal law generally requires polling places for federal  elections to be accessible to all eligible voters, including older voters and  voters with physical disabilities. In particular, the Voting Accessibility for  the Elderly and Handicapped Act requires that, with a few exceptions,  local election jurisdictions assure that polling places used in federal  elections are accessible, in a manner as determined by the state, to the  elderly and voters with disabilities. These requirements can present a  challenge to state and local election officials because achieving  accessibility\u2014which is affected by the type of impairment and various  barriers posed by polling place facilities and voting methods\u2014is part of a  larger set of challenges they face in administering elections on a periodic  basis.

Significantly, we found that most polling places we  inspected had one or more potential impediments for people with mobility  impairments\u2014only 16 percent had no impediments\u2014although some  provided for curbside voting. Since the passage of HAVA, and after the  2004 election, we surveyed state and local election jurisdictions and  identified a number of reported efforts taken to improve voting access for  people with disabilities.  In particular, we found a marked increase in  state provisions addressing accessibility of polling places and voting  systems, and alternative voting methods, such as curbside and absentee  voting. However, achieving accessibility in the polling place and with  respect to voting systems is complicated by the fact that thousands of  jurisdictions have primary responsibility for managing and conducting  elections and ensuring an accurate vote count. We have not examined the  extent to which the improvements reported by state and local election  jurisdictions since November 2000 have been implemented and, thus, do  not know the extent to which they have yielded improved accessibility of  polling places and voting systems."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The proportion of older people in the United States who may face  challenges exercising the right to vote is growing. As of 2003, there were  almost 36 million individuals aged 65 or older (12 percent of the  population), and the majority have at least one chronic health condition.  By 2030, those aged 65 and over will grow to more than 20 percent of the  population. Disability increases with age, and studies have shown that  with every 10 years after reaching the age of 65, the risk of losing mobility  doubles. In many ways, lack of mobility and other types of impairments  can diminish seniors\u2019 ability to vote without some assistance or  accommodation. With increased age, seniors will become more limited in  their ability to get to polling places by driving, walking, or using public  transportation. Once seniors arrive at the polling places, they may face  additional challenges, depending on the availability of accessible parking  areas, accessibility of polling places, type and complexity of the voting  equipment, availability of alternative voting methods (such as absentee  voting), and the availability of voting assistance or aids.", "Responsibility for holding elections and ensuring voter access primarily  rests with state and local governments. Each state sets the requirements  for conducting local, state, and federal elections within the state. For  example, states regulate such aspects of elections as ballot access,  absentee voting requirements, establishment of voting places, provision of  election day workers, and counting and certifying the vote. The states, in  turn have typically delegated responsibility for administering and funding  state election systems to the thousands of local election jurisdictions\u2014 more than 10,000 nationwide\u2014creating even more variability among our  nation\u2019s election systems.", "Although state and local governments are responsible for running  elections, Congress has authority to affect the administration of elections.  Federal laws have been enacted in several major areas of the voting  process, including several that are designed to help ensure that voting is  accessible for the elderly and people with disabilities. Most importantly,  the Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act (VAEHA),  enacted in 1984, requires that political subdivisions responsible for  conducting elections assure that all polling places for federal elections are  accessible to elderly voters and voters with disabilities (with limited  exceptions). Any elderly voter or voter with a disability assigned to an  inaccessible polling place, upon his or her advance request, must be  assigned to an accessible polling place or be provided with an alternative  means for casting a ballot on the day of the election. Under the VAEHA,  the definition of \u201caccessible\u201d is determined under guidelines established  by each state\u2019s chief election officer, but the law does not specify what  those guidelines shall contain or the form those guidelines should take.  Additionally, states are required to make available voting aids for elderly  and disabled voters, including instructions printed in large type at each  polling place, and information by telecommunications devices for the deaf.  The VAEHA also contains a provision requiring public notice, calculated to  reach elderly and disabled voters, of absentee voting procedures.", "HAVA also contains a number of provisions designed to help increase the  accessibility of voting for individuals with disabilities. For example, under  HAVA, voting systems for federal elections must be accessible for  individuals with disabilities in a manner that provides the same  opportunity for access and participation as for other voters. To satisfy this  requirement, each polling place must have at least one voting system  equipped for individuals with disabilities. In addition, the Secretary of  Health and Human Services is required to make yearly payments (in an  amount of the Secretary\u2019s choosing) to each eligible state and unit of local  government, and such payments must be used for (1) making polling  places (including path of travel, entrances, exits, and voting areas)  accessible to individuals with disabilities, and (2) providing individuals  with disabilities with information about the accessibility of polling places.  The Act also created the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to  serve, among other things, as a clearinghouse and information resource  for election officials with respect to the administration of federal  elections. For example, the EAC is to periodically conduct and make  available to the public studies regarding methods of ensuring accessibility  of voting, polling places, and voting equipment to all voters, including  individuals with disabilities. Under HAVA, the EAC is also to make grants  for carrying out both research and development to improve various  aspects of voting equipment and voting technology, and pilot programs to  test new technologies in voting systems. To be eligible for such grants, an  entity must certify that it will take into account the need to make voting  equipment fully accessible for individuals with disabilities.", "The Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA), as amended, provides for voter  assistance in the voting room. Specifically, the VRA, among other things,  authorizes voting assistance for blind, disabled, or illiterate persons.  Voters who require assistance to vote by reason of blindness, disability, or  inability to read or write may be given assistance by a person of the voter\u2019s  choice, other than the voter\u2019s employer or agent of that employer or  officer or agent of the voter\u2019s union.", "Other laws also help to ensure voting access for the elderly and people  with disabilities\u2014albeit indirectly. For example, Title II of the Americans  with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and its implementing regulations  require that people with disabilities have access to basic public services,  including the right to vote. However, it does not strictly require that all  polling place sites be accessible. Under the ADA, public entities must  make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures to  avoid discrimination against people with disabilities. Moreover, no  individual with a disability may, by reason of the disability, be excluded  from participating in or be denied the benefits of any public program,  service, or activity. State and local governments may comply with ADA  accessibility requirements in a variety of ways, such as by redesigning  equipment, reassigning services to accessible buildings or alternative  accessible sites, or altering existing facilities or constructing new ones.  However, state and local governments are not required to take actions that  would threaten or destroy the historic significance of a historic property,  fundamentally alter the nature of a service, or impose undue financial and  administrative burdens. In choosing between available methods of  complying with the ADA, state and local governments must give priority to  the choices that offer services, programs, and activities in the most  integrated setting appropriate.", "Title III of the ADA covers commercial facilities and places of public  accommodation. Such facilities may also be used as polling places. Under  Title III, public accommodations must make reasonable modifications in  policies, practices, or procedures to facilitate access for individuals with  disabilities. They must also ensure that no individual with a disability is  excluded or denied services because of the absence of \u201cauxiliary aids and  services,\u201d which include both effective methods of making aurally and  visually delivered materials available to individuals with impairments, and  acquisition or modification of equipment or devices. Public  accommodations are also required to remove physical barriers in existing  buildings when it is \u201creadily achievable\u201d to do so, that is, when it can be  done without much difficulty or expense, given the entity\u2019s resources. In  the event that removal of an architectural barrier cannot be accomplished  easily, the accommodation may take alternative measures to facilitate  accessibility. All buildings newly constructed by public accommodations  and commercial facilities must be readily accessible; alterations to existing  buildings are required to the maximum extent feasible to be readily  accessible to individuals with disabilities.", "Finally, the Older Americans Act of 1965 (OAA), as amended, supports a  wide range of social services and programs for older persons. The OAA  authorizes grants to agencies on aging to serve as advocates of, and  coordinate programs for, the older population. Such programs cover areas  such as caregiver support, nutrition services, and disease prevention.  Importantly, the OAA also provides assistance to improve transportation  services for older individuals."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Transportation Challenges Become More Acute with Aging and Can Limit Seniors\u2019 Ability to Reach Polling Places", "paragraphs": ["For older adults who wish to vote at polling places, access to the polls is  highly affected by their ability to travel to the polling place on election  day. While most older adults drive, their physical, visual, and cognitive  abilities can deteriorate, making it more difficult for them to drive safely.  One study found that approximately 21 percent (6.8 million) of people  aged 65 and older do not drive, and another study found that more than  600,000 people aged 70 and older stop driving each year and become  dependent on others for transportation. According to senior  transportation experts, the \u201coldest of the old\u201d (those aged 85 and older)  are especially likely to be dependent on others for rides, particularly if  they are also in poor health.", "For those who do not or cannot drive, our previous work for this  committee on the mobility of older adults identified other options than  driving that are available; nevertheless, transportation gaps remain.  Consistent with the Older Americans Act and other legislation, the federal  government provides some transportation assistance, but this is largely to  provide older adults with access to other federal program services\u2014such  as health and medical care or employment. This has been done through  partnerships with local agencies, nonprofits, and other organizations that  provide transportation services and also contribute their own funds. Such  partnering efforts may afford the opportunity to transport seniors to  polling places as well. For example, the Montana Council on  Developmental Disabilities partners with other organizations, such as  AARP and the Montana Transit Association, to provide election day rides  to older adults and people with disabilities. Still, we generally found that  older adults in rural and suburban areas have more restricted travel  options than do those in urban areas. In addition, we have reported that  federally supported programs generally lacked data identifying the extent  to which older adults have unmet needs for mobility. Consequently, we do  not know to what extent older adults are unable to find transportation to  polling places.", "To address this lack of data and improve transportation services, more  than 45 states had utilized the \u201cFramework for Action\u201d by 2005, a self- assessment tool created by the Federal Interagency Coordinating Council  on Access and Mobility (CCAM) for states and communities to help them  identify existing gaps in transportation services for people with  disabilities, older adults, and individuals with lower incomes. According to  the CCAM, communities across the country are now using this tool as they  establish coordinated transportation plans at the local level. Voting access  is one need that might well be identified and better met through this  assessment process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Physical Access to Polling Places Was Uneven during Election 2000, but May Have Improved since HAVA Was Enacted in 2002", "paragraphs": ["Our on-site inspections of polling places in the 2000 general election  revealed many impediments that can limit access for older voters and  voters with disabilities.

To estimate the proportion of polling places in the  country with features that might either facilitate or impede access for  people with mobility, dexterity, or visual impairments, we visited 496  randomly selected polling places in the United States on Election Day  2000. Our random sample was drawn by first selecting a random sample of  counties\u2014weighted by population\u2014and then randomly selecting some  polling places within those counties. At each polling place, using a survey  based on federal and nonfederal guidelines on accessibility, we took  measurements and made observations of features of the facility and voting  methods that could impede access. See figure 1 for the key areas at  polling places where we conducted our observations. We also interviewed  poll workers who were in charge of the polling place to identify any  accommodations offered.", "These on-site inspections during the 2000 election revealed that only an  estimated 16 percent of polling places were free of impediments that might  prevent elderly voters and voters with disabilities from reaching voting  rooms. The rest had one or more likely impediments from the parking  area to the voting room, although curbside voting was often made  available where permitted by the state (see fig. 2). These were potential  impediments primarily for individuals with mobility impairments.", "Further, many polling places had more than one potential impediment in  2000. Impediments occurred at fairly high rates irrespective of the type of  building used as a polling place. About 70 percent of all Election Day 2000  polling places were in the types of facilities that are potentially subject to  either Title II or III of the ADA\u2014such as schools, recreational/community  centers, city/town halls, police/fire stations, libraries, and courthouses.  However, under the ADA, only new construction and alterations must be  readily accessible, and we did not determine the date that polling place  facilities were either constructed or altered. Moreover, due to the number  of possible approaches for meeting ADA requirements on accessibility to  public services and because places of public accommodation need remove  barriers only where it is easy to do so, we cannot determine from our data  whether the potential impediments we found would constitute a failure to  meet ADA requirements.", "In addition to inspecting polling places in 2000, we also reviewed state  provisions (in the form of statutes, regulations, or policies) and surveyed  state and county practices that affect voters\u2019 ability to get into polling  places and reach the voting room, and found significant variations. While  all states and the District of Columbia had provisions concerning voting  access for individuals with disabilities, the extent and manner in which  these provisions addressed accessibility varied from state to state. For  example, 43 states had provisions that polling places must or should be  accessible, but only 20 had provisions requiring that reporting by the  counties to the state on polling place accessibility. See table 1 in app. I for  additional state provisions concerning the accessibility of polling places in  the November 2000 election.", "Our survey of election officials in each state and 100 counties also  revealed variation in practices for ensuring the accessibility of polling  places. For example, while 25 states reported providing local  governments with training and guidance for assuring polling place  accessibility, only 5 states reported helping finance polling place  modifications to improve access in 2000. At least an estimated 27 percent  of local election jurisdictions reported not using accessibility in their  criteria for selecting polling places.

For example, 32 states  told us in 2005 that they required local jurisdictions to report on polling  place accessibility to the state, an increase from 20 states with such  provisions in 2000. At the same time, the number of states requiring polling  place inspections decreased by 1 from 2000 to 2004, although 16 in  addition to the 28 requiring inspections had provisions in 2004 that  allowed for polling place inspections.

As we noted earlier, more large and medium local election  jurisdictions reported using accessible electronic voting machines than  small jurisdictions. Some election officials representing small jurisdictions  expressed concerns to us about the appropriateness of HAVA  requirements for accessible voting equipment for their jurisdictions and its  implementation cost. In addition, some elections officials have acted on  concerns regarding the reliability and security of electronic voting systems  by, for instance, decertifying systems previously approved for use within  their states.", "In 2007, we testified on the range of security and reliability concerns that  have been reported, and long-standing and emerging challenges facing all  levels of government, with respect to electronic voting systems. For  example, significant concerns have been raised about vague or incomplete  standards, weak security controls, system design flaws, incorrect system  configuration, poor security management, and inadequate security testing,  among other issues. Jurisdictions reported that they did not consistently  monitor the performance of their systems, which is important for  determining whether election needs, requirements, and expectations are  met and for taking corrective actions when they are not. Finding remedies,  however, is challenging, given, for example, the distribution of  responsibilities among various organizations, and financing constraints  and complexities. Given the diffused and decentralized allocation of voting  system roles and responsibilities across all levels of government,  addressing these challenges will require the combined efforts of all levels  of government, under the leadership of the EAC."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Have Increased Provisions for Voting Rooms Accommodations, though the Extent of Such Improvements Is Unclear", "paragraphs": ["Our 2005 survey of state election officials revealed a marked increase  since the 2000 election in the number of state provisions related to  accommodations in the voting room. For example, the number of states  that reported having provisions for wheelchair accommodations in voting  areas was 43, compared to 33 in 2000. Further, the number of states that  reported having provisions to require or allow ballots with large-type,  magnifying instruments, and Braille ballot or voting methods increased by  18, 20, and 8, respectively. At the same time, a few states reported having  provisions that prohibit certain accommodations, such as ballots in Braille  or large type. (See app. I, table 2 for details on 2004 state provisions.) It is  important to keep in mind, however, our findings for the 2000 election\u2014 i.e., that state provisions are not necessarily predictors or indicators of  whether these accommodations will be found at polling places.", "Most recently, we reported on accommodations provided to bilingual  voters, including elderly bilingual voters. Under the VRA, when the  population of a \u201csingle language minority\u201d with limited English proficiency  is large enough, voting materials (including ballots, instructions, and  assistance) must be provided in that minority\u2019s language, in addition to  English. Of the 14 election jurisdictions we contacted, 13 reported  providing similar assistance, such as translated voter materials and  bilingual poll workers. All 14 reported facing similar challenges, such as  recruiting a sufficient number of bilingual poll workers, effectively  targeting where to provide assistance, and designing and translating the  bilingual materials provided. However, GAO found little quantitative data  on the usefulness of various types of bilingual voting assistance.  Jurisdictions were challenged to assess the effectiveness of such  assistance, in part because jurisdictions may be prohibited from collecting  data on who used such assistance. Thus, it is difficult to know the extent  to which elderly voters use bilingual assistance and what forms of  assistance they find most useful."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "State Provisions for Alternative Voting Methods and Accommodations Generally Increased since 2000, but Implementation Practices May Vary", "paragraphs": ["As noted earlier, the VAEHA requires that any elderly voter or voter with a  disability assigned to an inaccessible polling place, upon his or her  advance request, must be assigned to an accessible polling place or be  provided with an alternative means for casting a ballot on the day of the  election. The VAEHA also contains provisions to make absentee voting  more accessible by prohibiting, with limited exceptions, the requirement  of a notary or medical certification of disability in granting an absentee  ballot. However, states generally regulate absentee voting and other  alternative voting method provisions. Alternative voting methods may  include advance notice of an inaccessible polling place; curbside voting;  taking ballots to a voter\u2019s residence; allowing voters to use another, more  accessible polling location either on or before election day; voting in  person at early voting sites; or removing prerequisites by establishing \u201cno  excuse\u201d absentee voting or allowing absentee voting on a permanent  basis. Disability advocates have told us that while alternative voting  methods are important and needed options for some voters with  disabilities, they still do not provide an equal opportunity to vote in the  same manner as the general public and therefore should not be viewed as  permanent solutions to inaccessible polling places.", "Meanwhile, state provisions that allow for alternative voting methods had,  in 2004, generally increased from the 2000 election period. Specifically, the  number of state provisions permitting curbside voting increased from 28 in  the 2000 election to 30 in the 2004 election. The number of states with  provisions that provided for carrying ballots to voters\u2019 residences on or  before election day increased from 21 to 25. Additionally, state provisions  regarding notification of voters of inaccessible polling places went up  from 19 to 27. In addition, 21 states reported allowing voters to vote  absentee without requiring a reason or excuse\u20143 more than for the  November 2000 election.", "Although states may offer similar alternatives and accommodations, our  review of state provisions in 2000 indicated that there may be wide  variation in their implementation. For example, in accordance with the  VAEHA, as previously mentioned, all states allowed absentee voting for  voters with disabilities without notary or medical certification  requirements in 2000. However, the dates by which absentee ballots must  be received varied considerably, with some states requiring that, to be  counted, the ballot must be received before election day. In addition,  where states lacked provisions, or had provisions allowing but not  requiring accommodation or alternative method of voting, county and  local government implementation practices can vary. For example, in  2000, we found that in a number of states without formal provision for  curbside voting, some counties and local governments reported offering  curbside voting and some did not. Similarly, in a number of states that  lacked provisions for allowing voters to use an alternate voting place on  Election Day, our 2000 county survey data also showed that some counties  and local governments offered this alternative, while others did not.", "Expanding alternative voting methods or making special accommodations  can provide voters with additional options. Early voting, for example,  allows voters, including elderly voters, to choose a day without inclement  weather on which to vote. However, the implementation of voting  alternatives can also present election officials with legal, administrative,  and operational challenges. For example, expanding the use of curbside  voting requires having staff trained and available to assist voters outside  the polling place. In some states where it is not authorized or in practice,  policymakers would need to be convinced that it would not increase the  risk of fraud with ballots being taken out of the polling place facility.  Similarly, reassigning voters to more accessible polling places requires  officials to notify the voter, train the poll workers, and provide an  appropriate ballot at the reassigned location. Election officials reported to  us in 2001 that establishing early voting sites and expanding the number of  absentee voters added to the cost and complexity of running an election.  For example, with early voting, election officials must set up and close  down the polling place daily, ensure that there are trained poll workers at  each early voting site, and update the voter registration lists to be used on  election day to indicate which voters have already voted early. Absentee  voting challenges include receipt of late absentee voter applications and  ballots; administrative issues including workload demands and resource  constraints; dealing with potential voter error caused by unsigned or  otherwise incomplete absentee applications and ballot materials; as well  as guarding against fraud. Internet voting\u2014an alternative that has been  used only on a limited basis to date\u2014could offer voters the convenience of  voting from their homes or other remote locations, and help increase voter  participation. On the other hand, numerous election officials and others  have expressed concerns about the security and reliability of the Internet  and lack of widespread access to it. To resolve these issues, studies by  some task forces have suggested a phased-in approach to Internet voting."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Ensuring that seniors or individuals with disabilities successfully cast their  votes in an election requires government to think broadly about access,  including access to transportation, access into buildings, access with  respect to voting equipment, and access to various alternative voting  methods. The increase in state provisions and reports of practices to  improve the accessibility of the voting process is encouraging. At the same  time, the complexity of our election systems is such that we cannot be  assured that these provisions and reported practices reflect what actually  occurs at polling places on election day. Understanding and addressing  accessibility gaps is an enormous task for our state and local election  officials who are challenged by the multiplicity of responsibilities and  requirements they must attend to within resource constraints. At the same  time, as our population ages, and with it the percent of voters with  disabilities swells, the expectation of accommodation and assistance to  participate in this basic civic exercise will grow, making accessibility a key  performance goal for our election community."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix I: State Provisions for Accessibility of Polling Places and Accommodations for the November 2000 and 2004 Elections", "paragraphs": ["Appendix I: State Provisions for Accessibility  of Polling Places and Accommodations for the  November 2000 and 2004 Elections  for rticr proviion were identified only if  te did not hve either  te or  regtion for tht proviion.", "Inspections of  polling place  accessibility  Reporting by local  jurisdictions to the  state on polling  place accessibility  Accommodations  of wheelchairs in  voting areas  Provision of ballot  or methods of  voting in BrailleProvision of  ballots with large  type   in one te reponded tht they did not know.  ct voting by mil; thus, proviion for polling plce ccessibility re not pplicble.   in one te did not repond to thition."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Bilingual Voting Assistance: Selected Jurisdictions\u2019 Strategies for  Identifying Needs and Providing Assistance.
