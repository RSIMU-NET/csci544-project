The challenge is made greater by the shifting demographics of veterans. While nationally the veteran population is declining, veterans have migrated from northeastern and midwestern states to southeastern and southwestern states in the past decade, offsetting veteran deaths in these states.", "VA has historically based its allocations to facilities primarily on their past funding levels\u2014providing incremental increases to facilities\u2019 past budgets. In an effort to improve its planning, allocation, and management processes, VA made a considerable investment in implementing a new system, called the Resource Planning and Management (RPM) system, for use initially in fiscal year 1994. VA considers RPM to be a management decision process to use to formulate its budget, allocate most of its resources, and compare facility performance. As the basis for resource allocation, RPM classifies each patient into a clinical care group, calculates average facility costs per patient, and forecasts future workload. VA envisioned that the system would improve VA\u2019s management of limited medical care resources, better define future resource requirements, and enable VA to explore opportunities to improve quality and efficiency in its health care system. This vision included improving the equity of its allocations by more closely linking resources with facility workloads and alleviating inconsistencies in veterans\u2019 access to care across the system.", "Two recent events could have significant implications for VA\u2019s resource allocation system. First, VA is restructuring its organization to establish 22 veterans integrated service networks (VISN) that will replace four regional offices and assume the individual facilities\u2019 role as the basic budgetary and planning unit for health care delivery. The new structure will require some change in how resources are allocated. Second, the Senate passed your proposed amendment to the VA appropriations bill that would require VA to develop a plan for the allocation of health care resources among its health care facilities to ensure that veterans have the same access to quality health care.", "Because of your interest in this issue, you asked us to review the equity of VA\u2019s resource allocation system, particularly as it related to the allocations made to the Carl T. Hayden Medical Center in Phoenix, Arizona. More specifically, you asked us to determine the following:", "To what extent does VA\u2019s allocation system provide for an equitable distribution of resources among VA facilities?", "What are the causes of any inequity in the distribution of resources, and what changes, if any, would help ensure that the system more equitably distributes resources?", "In September 1995, we sent you our preliminary observations. This report presents our final results.", "To accomplish our objectives, we first needed to apply a definition of the term \u201cequity.\u201d We based our evaluation of the equity of the system\u2019s distribution on VA\u2019s vision for RPM. We considered the following two elements to be characteristics of an equitable system: It provides comparable resources for comparable workload. It provides resources so that veterans within the same priority categories have the same availability of care, to the extent practical, throughout the VA health care system.", "We then reviewed VA documents and analyzed RPM system data to determine the degree to which these two elements were present. We discussed potential reasons for any inequities in allocations with VA Headquarters, the Boston Development Center, the RPM Committee, and facility officials in several locations. To assess potential changes to address inequities, we discussed such changes with VA officials and reviewed VA documents on its original plans for RPM and minutes of several RPM committees and work groups.

Individual facilities vary widely in the inpatient, outpatient, and long-term care services they provide. For example, some facilities provide only basic clinical care; whereas, others have capabilities to provide special care such as for organ transplants, spinal cord injuries, or chronic mental illness.", "VA historically allocated funds to its facilities on the basis of the facilities\u2019 past expenditures, with incremental increases for such factors as inflation and new programs. Beginning in 1985, VA modified its allocation system because it recognized the need to more directly relate funding to the work performed and the cost to perform it, and to improve the efficiency and productivity with which medical care is delivered to veterans.", "The Resource Allocation Methodology (RAM) was VA\u2019s first attempt to better link resources to workload. VA ended RAM in 1989 because of concerns that facilities had inappropriate incentives to perform work beyond their resources, possibly affecting quality of care and resulting in a budget crisis at some facilities. Between 1990 and 1993, VA again based allocations on making incremental changes to facilities\u2019 historical budgets.

VA hoped to better link resources and facility workload, move to prospective workload management by forecasting workload changes, and provide for differences in facility efficiencies in the allocations. VA also hoped that by forecasting workload changes, it could better establish and justify its budget requests. VA envisioned the system overcoming inconsistencies in facilities\u2019 provision of care to veterans by allowing for a more equitable distribution of resources to meet veteran needs systemwide. Finally, by identifying facility differences, VA intended that the system would provide managers with useful information, including the matching of resources to quality of care issues.", "Part of this effort to improve resource allocation involved linking the budget allocation process to VA\u2019s strategic plan. The strategic plan was to be the driving force behind RPM, providing it with a set of goals, performance standards, and workload priorities. Furthermore, the system\u2019s link to the strategic plan was intended to allow consideration of service distribution, practice patterns, geographic factors affecting costs, and access differences.", "RPM was also designed to be a patient-based system. It differs from past resource allocation processes in defining workload as patients served rather than as procedures performed\u2014this is the basis for VA\u2019s characterization of RPM as \u201ccapitation-based.\u201d For resource allocation purposes, the RPM database, managed by VA\u2019s Boston Development Center (BDC) in Braintree, Massachusetts, integrates workload data, case mix, and costs to project facility-specific resource needs. With significant input from VA managers in the field and Headquarters, BDC has developed a complex data analysis process to estimate facility unit costs. Generally, this process involves adjusting for case mix differences by classifying patients into clinical classes and groups, forecasting changes by class in the numbers of patients served, and developing average costs per patient type that are then applied to the number of expected patients in each group to achieve a preliminary budget estimate. The facility estimates are adjusted to reflect inflation, VA regional input, and facility efficiencies. A further discussion of the RPM system is in appendix II.", "Because resource allocation is a sensitive and complex undertaking in VA\u2019s health care system, VA has made a considerable investment in it.

In addition to the 26 BDC staff responsible for data processing and education efforts, VA Headquarters chief financial officer, quality management, operations, and clinical staff also provide input to the process through frequent meetings. Facility directors sit on the RPM Field Oversight Committee, a group of about 15 managers (with 10 to 20 support staff and visitors usually present) who meet regularly to discuss implementation issues. Six technical assistance groups comprising physicians and other clinicians in each clinical area generally represent the RPM clinical groups and advise on clinical issues such as the classification of patients. Other RPM committees include a Planning Group and a Financial Advisory Group, which assist in determining forecasting methodologies and advise on the correct allocation of costs. While many parties provide input to the RPM process, the Budget Policy and Review Committee, comprising VA associate chief medical directors and other senior VA managers, makes the final recommendation on the resource allocation methodology, which the Under Secretary for Health approves."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "System\u2019s Potential to Improve Equity May Not Be Realized", "paragraphs": ["The resource allocation system shows mixed results with regard to the two aspects of equity that we examined.

VA places facilities into one of nine facility groups that it considers comparable based on a complex consideration of factors such as affiliation with teaching facilities and size. Then, to provide a fair comparison, the system \u201clevels the playing field\u201d by adjusting for differences among facilities such as case mix, locality costs, salaries, training, and research. After adjustments are made, the system considers variations in workload costs to be more indicative of efficiency differences than facility characteristics. Comparative data show that even after adjustments are made, significant facility cost variations remain. Variations typically ranged 30 percent or more within each facility group. Appendix III and figure III.3 provide an example of the variations the RPM data show in adjusted costs per workload for one group of facilities that VA considered comparable.", "Another important aspect of the RPM system is its ability to forecast workload changes. For each patient class, the system forecasts the number of patients that facilities are likely to see, based on historical trends. The forecasting process recognizes that facility workloads are changing at relatively different rates and that facilities\u2019 clinical workloads or \u201ccase mix\u201d are also changing. For example, the system forecasts that patient classes for pulmonary disease patients or ear, nose, and throat patients are generally expected to decrease in fiscal years 1994 and 1995; whereas, classes for outpatients or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients are expected to increase. System forecasts showed rates of change for total patients expected to be seen at facilities ranging from an 8-percent decrease to a 15-percent increase between 1993 and 1995."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Has Done Little to Change Past Facility Allocations", "paragraphs": ["Despite cost variations and differing workload changes among facilities reflected in RPM data, VA has done little to use the data to change facility allocations.

While one facility gained as much as 3.4 percent through the process, the average uninflated gain was also about 1 percent. Facility budget changes for RPM Facility Group 5 are shown in figure 1. Appendix IV contains data for facilities nationwide.", "VA made two significant decisions that limited the resource allocation adjustments to facilities\u2019 budgets:", "By limiting the movement of resources between the high- and low-cost facilities, VA in effect allowed the wide variations in patient costs among facilities to continue. VA limited the amount of dollars moved between high- and low-cost facilities to $10 million in fiscal year 1994 and $20 million in fiscal year 1995.", "VA did not include enough resources in its RPM allocations to fully fund all the facilities\u2019 expected needs and distributed the shortfall by limiting the amount of resources given to those facilities with growing workloads.Furthermore, for those facilities with decreasing workloads, VA chose to limit their budget decreases. These decisions led to funding for the projected cost of increased workload at approximately 17 cents on the dollar. At the same time, facilities with decreasing workloads were given more money than needed to support the forecasted workload. Appendix III discusses the impact of this decision in further detail.", "Both of these decisions on VA\u2019s part had a greater impact on those facilities that historically had received less funding for their workloads\u2014and therefore were shown to have lower workload costs\u2014than those that had relatively faster growing workloads. For example, the Carl T. Hayden Medical Center adjusted workload costs were 16.8 percent lower than those of other facilities that VA considered comparable in mission and size, and its forecasted workload growth was 4.5 percent\u2014third highest among comparable facilities between 1993 and 1995. However, because of VA\u2019s decisions that limited the reallocation of funds, Carl T. Hayden experienced a 2.2-percent increase in uninflated funding between 1993 and 1995. By comparison, the Long Beach Medical Center\u2014the \u201chigh outlier\u201d in the same comparative facility group as Carl T. Hayden\u2014had adjusted workload costs that were 13.9 percent higher than other facilities and a forecasted workload decrease of approximately 1 percent.

This occurred because VA facilities were given discretion to determine whether to ration, or limit, discretionary or nonmandated care when resources are insufficient to care for all veterans. While considerable numbers of veterans have migrated to southeastern and southwestern states, there was little shift in VA resources. As a result, facilities mainly in the eastern states were more likely to have adequate resources to treat all veterans seeking care than other facilities. VA facilities in other states have adapted by restricting veterans\u2019 access to care.", "Our 1993 report found that 118 facilities indicated they rationed outpatient care for nonservice-connected conditions, while 40 facilities reported no rationing. The facilities that did ration used different methods to determine who got care. Some rationed on the basis of economic status, others on the basis of medical service or medical condition. Consequently, significant inconsistencies existed in veterans\u2019 access to care both among and within centers.", "In responding to our report and in correspondence to the Congress, VA indicated that the RPM system would consider and help overcome inconsistencies among facilities in veterans\u2019 access to outpatient care, allowing for a more equitable distribution of resources to meet outpatient needs systemwide. However, this vision remains unfulfilled. The system does not distinguish between facilities\u2019 discretionary and mandatory workload in determining past and forecasting future workload.", "Consequently, the access problems we reported in 1993 are likely to have continued. VA management systems, however, still lack reliable data on facilities\u2019 rationing or denial of care, which prevented us from confirming the extent to which the rationing we reported earlier still exists. But available data indicate that the ability of facilities to provide care to discretionary categories of veterans still varies. For example, fiscal year 1994 data indicate that although up to 13 percent of some facilities\u2019 patients were veterans in a discretionary category because they had nonservice-connected conditions and higher incomes, other facilities treated none of these discretionary patients.

Also, VA made several changes during the first years of the process to help address facility concerns about the accuracy of data that facilities submit.", "Facilities cannot efficiently adjust to large budget changes. VA officials believed that absent plans to phase in resource changes over a 3- to 5-year period, facilities could not efficiently adjust to large changes in their budgets in any single year. A facility does not know what its allocation for the fiscal year will be until shortly before the year starts\u2014depending on how soon the VA medical care appropriation is determined. Officials believed it unreasonable to expect facility directors to adjust to significant changes given the short lead time between when they learn what their budget allocations will be and the start of the fiscal year. Furthermore, officials believed that facility directors had few management options for reducing operating budgets because 70 percent or more of facilities\u2019 budgets is spent on salaries.", "Reasons for variations are unclear. Officials indicated that they lacked a good understanding of what causes the variations, which some thought could be attributed to factors, such as quality of care, that are not considered in the adjustment process. For example, high-cost facilities may provide higher quality or more timely care and may not necessarily have higher costs because of operating inefficiencies. At the same time, low-cost facilities may be efficient and may become less so if given more money for the same workload. Because VA does not have a standard for what facility unit costs should be, the current process \u201ctitrates budgets to the mean,\u201d that is, only very slowly brings facility budgets closer to the mean.", "VA officials further maintained that the RPM allocations alone could not be used to judge the equity of facility budgets because facilities get funds that are not distributed through RPM. About $4.1 billion, or 25 percent, of the fiscal year 1995 medical budget was allocated to VA facilities by processes separate from the RPM system. About $2.3 billion of the $4.1 billion was allocated to facilities at the beginning of the year and included funding for items such as the community nursing home contract program, activation of newly constructed facilities, outpatient fee-basis care, prosthetics, and resident training. The remaining $1.8 billion in non-RPM-allocated funds paid for leases, travel, and patient care programs such as dental programs and women veterans health programs. In part, these funds also were to pay for contingencies that arose through the year.", "An assessment of the equity of these allocations, and their impact on the relative equity of the RPM system allocations, could not be made with available data. While VA\u2019s financial system accounts for individual transactions to facilities throughout the year, it does not summarize for each program the amount received by each facility. VA officials agreed that some non-RPM resources support patient care operations, such as those for prosthetics or facility activations, and indicated that they had conducted special evaluations of non-RPM accounts to determine whether any of the funds should be allocated through the RPM system. As a result of these evaluations, the percentage of the medical care funds allocated through RPM increased from 66 percent in fiscal year 1994 to 75 percent in fiscal year 1995.

However, other officials\u2019 statements to us and the Congress indicated that the resource allocation system would be used regardless of legislative reforms and that the delay was attributable largely to the absence of useful eligibility data and the difficulty of incorporating this goal in the RPM model. While we agree that reform that simplifies VA\u2019s complex eligibility requirements might allow VA to more easily consider veterans\u2019 access differences in allocating resources, we do not believe such legislation is a prerequisite to meeting this goal because the Congress has established the priorities for the provision of veterans\u2019 care.

Starting in 1992, VA developed what was known as the National Health Care Plan (NHCP) to coordinate RPM, VA strategic planning, and other VA planning efforts. NHCP was developed by a multidisciplinary committee charged with looking at facility missions, identifying gaps and overlaps in services, and developing a planning process. However, VA officials told us the draft plan was preempted by the Clinton administration\u2019s push for national health reform in 1994.

As previously mentioned, the plan would further decentralize VA operations by establishing 22 VISNs throughout the country to coordinate and integrate VA\u2019s health care delivery assets. A key part of the VISN plan is that VISN directors would be held responsible for strategic planning, with greater systemwide direction in strategic planning as well. It is not clear from current VA planning documents how the VISN and VA systemwide strategic plan might interact with resource allocation and how resources will be allocated to VISNs. It is not evident what VA\u2019s plan is for moving facilities and VISNs toward more comparable funding for comparable workload and achieving the coordination between planning and resource management envisioned in NHCP.

Furthermore, VA hoped to better link cost data with quality indicators so an assessment of resources\u2019 impact on quality could be made.

VA reported that it sought to produce resource profiles for each level of the organization that could be analyzed for connections between quality of care and resource availability. The RPM system was envisioned as a critical part of this effort. For example, it was expected to provide information about facilities with resource profiles that suggested resources were insufficient and to lead to reviews that could ensure more consistent care across the VA system. VA anticipated that by the end of fiscal year 1994, RPM would match resources to quality of care issues and improve information for management at all levels. None of these original plans for RPM has yet materialized, apparently because of VA\u2019s priorities, time constraints, data on quality becoming available only recently, and lack of consensus on how to implement VA\u2019s original plans.", "An example of how decisionmakers can be given information on health care cost variations was illustrated in a report by the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (PROPAC), which advises the Congress on Medicare issues.

These efforts, such as the analyses of the Chronic Mental Illness Technical Advisory Group, which we describe in the report, represent, in our view, a step in the right direction.
