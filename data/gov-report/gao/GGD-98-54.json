We assessed each of these components to determine whether they provided the foundation needed to develop or acquire modernized systems. In August and September 1997, we briefed IRS, Treasury, and your respective offices on the results of our assessment. In response to those briefings, your offices asked that we report our findings to you.

To accomplish this, IRS embarked on an ambitious systems modernization program, called Tax Systems Modernization (TSM). In 1995, we identified serious management and technical weaknesses in TSM that jeopardized its successful completion, made more than a dozen recommendations to fix the problems, and designated TSM as a high-risk information technology initiative in our biennial report series on high-risk federal programs. We again designated TSM as high-risk in our 1997 report series.", "To correct modernization weaknesses, we recommended in our 1995 report, among other things, that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue ensure that IRS (1) implements disciplined processes for requirements management, investment decision management, and system development management, and (2) completes an integrated system architecture, including data and security subarchitectures. IRS agreed with all of our recommendations.", "In June 1996, we reported that while IRS had initiated a number of actions to address our recommendations, many of these actions were incomplete and none, either individually or collectively, responded fully to any of our recommendations. Accordingly, in the conference report accompanying the fiscal year 1997 appropriations act (P.L. 104-208, Sept. 30, 1996), the Congress took several actions, including directing Treasury to develop a blueprint to define, direct, and control future modernization efforts. On May 15, 1997, Treasury submitted its modernization blueprint to the Congress. The blueprint consisted of four documents: (1) an SLC overview that provides a high-level framework for defining a disciplined set of processes for managing the modernization, (2) about 3,600 broad business requirements, (3) high-level functional and technical architectures that generally describe the target systems environment, and (4) a general sequencing plan for transitioning from IRS\u2019 current to its target systems environment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS\u2019 SLC Overview Is Conceptually Consistent With Best Practices but Lacks Adequate Process and Product Definition", "paragraphs": ["IRS\u2019 SLC overview is consistent with general approaches used by successful private and public sector organizations for managing large information technology investments.

The phases, listed as columns in table 1, are:", "Requirements Management. This phase addresses the questions of what is needed and how to satisfy the need(s). It includes (1) identification and definition of information technology needs; (2) conduct of technical analyses (e.g., cost estimates, architectural impact assessments) for each defined need; (3) development of individual business cases (i.e., investment justifications) that include architectural impact and cost/benefit results; and (4) prioritization of competing business cases by type (new development, maintenance, and research and development). Investment Decision Management. This phase includes activities and documentation to determine how much should be spent and what should be developed and deployed. During this phase, business cases are rank ordered by type on an agencywide basis, investment decisions are made (i.e., business cases are approved and funded on the basis of investment costs and benefits), and investment decisions are monitored over time to determine actual costs incurred and benefits realized.", "System Development/Operations Management. This phase defines, sequences, and documents activities necessary to develop, deploy, operate, and maintain systems. It consists of (1) research and development, which includes prototype development and evaluation; (2) engineering, which includes system requirements analysis, systems design, release definition, release requirements analysis, and release system design; (3) design and development, which includes configuration item requirements analysis, preliminary design, detailed design, code and unit testing, and integration and testing; (4) integration, test, and deployment, which includes release integration and testing, release system acceptance testing, system piloting, and system rollout; and (5) maintenance, which includes release design, code and unit test, and integration and test.", "Management Control and Oversight. This phase spans each of the three aforementioned phases. It includes change control management (i.e., determining what to change and when), configuration management (i.e., capturing and maintaining records of the changes), performance management (i.e., measuring progress against baselines), organizational management (i.e., determining who is responsible for what), and audit and evaluation process management (i.e., determining whether SLC processes are effective and being followed).", "Associated with each phase, and shown as rows in table 1, are (1) detailed process definitions, which describe the functions that are performed and how they are performed, (2) key actions that need to be taken to implement the processes, and (3) key products that are prepared as a result of the processes\u2019 execution."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS\u2019 SLC Is Incomplete", "paragraphs": ["While the SLC overview provides a framework that is consistent with public and private sector best practices, IRS\u2019 SLC is incomplete and does not yet provide the specificity needed for building or acquiring systems. As IRS recognizes, its SLC does not yet specify how technology investment activities will be performed. For example, it does not specify (1) how work processes will be reengineered; (2) how business requirements will be specified; (3) how engineering solutions will be developed; (4) how business cases for technology investments will be formulated and evaluated; (5) how systems conforming to architectural standards will be developed; (6) how operational systems conforming to architectural standards will be maintained; and (7) how technology investments will be evaluated using performance metrics.", "The SLC shortcomings fall into three categories (see table 2). First, IRS does not yet have detailed process definitions for any of the SLC phases. For instance, IRS has not clearly defined how requirements will be formulated and how they will be assessed and prioritized; how projects will be controlled and evaluated; what data will be required and what evaluation criteria will be used; how system designs will be assessed and how system developments and acquisitions will be managed; and how architectural compliance will be determined and enforced. Without these process definitions, IRS cannot validate that the blueprint products published as of May 15, 1997, are correct and consistent. Moreover, IRS cannot adequately develop the level of detail and precision that, as discussed in the following section of this report, these blueprint products currently lack.", "Second, because it has not yet defined detailed SLC processes, IRS has not yet implemented its SLC. For example, handbooks have not been prepared and training has not been conducted for any of the SLC phases. Further, organizational roles and authorities have not been adequately specified, making it unclear who does what in each SLC process and phase. For instance, as described in the modernization blueprint, the IRS chiefs will be responsible for reengineering business processes and developing business requirements, but it is unclear who has the responsibility and the authority to ensure that the reengineered processes and specified requirements are prioritized and optimized agencywide. Similarly, although the CIO is responsible for developing architecturally compliant engineering solutions to satisfy business requirements, the CIO does not control all system development resources. Moreover, as discussed later in more detail, neither the CIO nor any other organizational entity has sufficient authority to implement SLC processes and enforce architectural compliance agencywide.", "Third, many SLC products have not been defined or developed. For example, IRS does not have an agencywide, rank ordered, portfolio of investment options. Moreover, some investments are not supported by business cases (i.e., business need documents, cost and schedule estimates, analyses of the organizational and technical impact of the proposed solution(s) on the phases and releases of the sequencing plan and on the architecture, and analyses of the proposed solution(s) expected return on investment)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Blueprint Products Are a Good Start but Are Incomplete or Insufficient", "paragraphs": ["While the products constituting IRS\u2019 May 15, 1997, modernization blueprint represent a good first step and a foundation upon which to build, none are complete.

Additionally, the sequencing plan does not provide sufficient detail to understand the transition to the target systems environment."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Business Requirements Are Insufficiently Precise", "paragraphs": ["IRS has divided its tax administration workflow into the following six core functional areas.", "Submissions processing, which is the primary source of data entering the workflow. It provides for the collection and correction of data extracted from paper and electronic tax returns, payments, and information returns as well as forwarding of these data to the corporate processing function for storage and access control.", "Corporate data processing, which includes receipt of data from the submissions processing function and storage of data in enterprisewide databases. It provides for controlled access to a single, authoritative source of corporate data in support of the customer service, compliance, and financial reporting workflow functions.", "Customer service, which provides the primary, non-face-to-face interface to taxpayers primarily through correspondence and telephone contacts.", "Compliance, which provides the primary, face-to-face interface to taxpayers in resolving collection, exam, and other compliance cases.", "Financial reporting, which is integrated with each of the workflow functions that update financial data and provides traceability to the source of all financial updates and summary financial reporting. Information system infrastructure, which supports the other five functional areas by providing communication networks, computing platforms, workstations, and development facilities.", "For each of these core functional areas, the IRS business users developed \u201cguiding principles\u201d that were intended to provide a framework for developing modernization business requirements. For example, the submission processing guiding principles state that IRS will (1) receive submissions from taxpayers and third parties on approved media, (2) perform up-front manual processing for nonelectronic submissions, (3) define interface protocols for electronic submissions, (4) transform nonelectronic submissions into electronic representations, and (5) perfect submissions. Similarly, some of the customer service guiding principles state that IRS will (1) provide non-face-to-face communication with taxpayers via various communication media, (2) provide access to taxpayer account and non-account data without geographic restriction, and (3) accept taxpayer data via various communication media.", "Using these guiding principles, IRS developed about 3,600 business requirements that it believes represent IRS\u2019 mission needs. To IRS\u2019 credit, some of these requirements provide for significant improvements in IRS\u2019 financial management capabilities. For example, they include a general ledger that is transaction-based and conforms to federal automated capture of nonfinancial performance information, such as the number of transactions, calls, paper returns filed, and electronic returns filed; improvements in management information for receivables; the ability to trace significant transactions and documents; and prompt and accurate recording of seized asset transactions.", "However, some of the requirements are insufficiently precise to be useful in building or acquiring systems. For instance, our audits of IRS\u2019 financial statements have reported the need for IRS to correct the serious problems that caused us to designate IRS\u2019 accounts receivable as a high-risk area. To help address these weaknesses, we have recommended that IRS maintain a subsidiary ledger or similar mechanism to routinely track the status of and to assist in managing accounts receivable. However, the business requirements do not describe the subsidiary accounts receivable records in sufficient detail to show that IRS plans to implement such a mechanism. For example, they do not specify whether the subsidiary records will provide for tracking accounts receivable on a receivable-by-receivable basis and include such information as (1) the age of the receivable, (2) the status of any payments received, (3) the accrual of any interest and penalties, (4) the status of the taxpayer\u2019s ability to pay any remaining balances, and (5) the nature of the receivable (i.e., a balance due, created by examination).", "In another case, a business requirement under the infrastructure systems core functional area calls for \u201csupporting all five levels\u201d of the Software Engineering Institute\u2019s (SEI) software development Capability Maturity Model (CMM). The model\u2019s five levels of maturity provide users with a four-step, sequential approach for incremental process improvement. In 1995 and 1996, we reported that IRS was a CMM level 1 organization, SEI\u2019s lowest level, meaning that its software development processes were ad hoc and sometimes chaotic. Since a substantial process effort is required to move from CMM level 1 to level 2, and from there to each higher level, IRS\u2019 stated business requirement of \u201csupporting all five levels\u201d is too vague and imprecise to be meaningful. Rather than calling for support of all five CMM levels, IRS needs to require incremental attainment of CMM levels, as SEI advocates, according to a specified schedule, such as level 2 within 2 years and level 3 within 4 years. Without precise goals, IRS cannot implement an effective process improvement program.", "Also, some of IRS\u2019 guiding principles are not reflected by specific business requirements. For example, the guiding principles that (1) 45 percent of all taxpayer inquiries be resolved via automated systems and (2) 95 percent of all inquiries be resolved in the initial contact could not be reconciled with customer service business requirements specifying the volume of calls that will be resolved. In addition, some key terms in the principles are not well defined. For example, the terms \u201cinitial contact\u201d and \u201cresolution\u201d are not defined. IRS is currently reassessing its guiding principles and its business requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Architecture Is Insufficiently Detailed", "paragraphs": ["IRS\u2019 architecture consists of two components: a functional architecture and a technical architecture. The functional architecture defines in business terms the activities/subfunctions that support the six core functional areas discussed earlier, the relationships among these activities/subfunctions, and the data required to support these activities/subfunctions. The technical architecture defines subsystems, configuration items, data allocations, interfaces, and common services that collectively provide a physical view of the target systems environment.", "Consistent with best practices in both industry and government, the architecture provides traceability among the business requirements, functions and subfunctions, and subsystems. That is, each of the blueprint\u2019s approximately 3,600 business requirements can be mapped to general points in the architecture where they are addressed. Traceability is critical to ensuring that systems meet users needs.", "The architecture has other positive attributes. For example, it specifies a data subarchitecture consisting of five primary databases and 18 supporting databases characterized as (1) mission-critical, such as a financial accounting database required to support revenue accounting, tracking, and reporting; (2) submissions management support, such as a state return database containing the data of electronically filed state tax returns; (3) security requirements support, such as a security audit database containing data used to track and audit behaviors observed by technical mechanisms that secure sensitive data; and (4) systems management and systems development support, such as a configuration management database containing information used to manage the development and operational configuration of the modernization systems.", "Also, the architecture includes a security subarchitecture that addresses data privacy and security. It articulates the need to provide user identification and authentication, to build security profiles specifying transactions and patterns of transactions for which a user is authorized, and to limit the transactions that users can perform to those included in their profiles. Information transmitted over data communications networks like the Internet would be protected through the use of encryption. Security-relevant audit data would also be collected, aggregated, and analyzed.", "Despite the architecture\u2019s positive attributes, it does not yet include implementation details and therefore is insufficiently complete to use in building or acquiring systems. For example, whereas the intention to ensure the confidentiality of taxpayer data is clear, the method to be used is unspecified; and whereas the intention to use data encryption is clear, encryption products and approaches are unspecified. Additionally, the architecture does not sufficiently define the data administration function, and business requirements have not been allocated to specific configuration items (i.e., actual hardware or software components). As a result, it is not yet known which of the system components will satisfy which of the requirements, or how it will do so."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sequencing Plan Is Not Sufficiently Complete", "paragraphs": ["To aid in implementing its target architecture, IRS developed a sequencing plan for transitioning from its current to its target systems environment. To do so, IRS first analyzed existing system platforms, applications, databases, and infrastructures to identify system duplications and gaps as well as systems with \u201cthe best functionality\u201d that should be preserved. According to IRS, it then applied three criteria to define a cost effective, risk mitigated sequence within which it would introduce new or modified systems and retire existing systems. The criteria are: focus on systems to support IRS business priorities; limit the need for complex system interfaces, large-scale data conversions, and continuous disruption of business operations; and minimize the need to develop interim systems and interfaces and make centralization of duplicative, stand-alone applications and systems a priority.", "The result was a sequencing plan that divides the transition into six incremental phases within which software, hardware, and supporting infrastructure components will be developed, acquired, and deployed. Each phase in turn is segmented into multiple releases, which consist of actual software/hardware upgrades, improvements/enhancements, and replacements as well as existing system capability retirements or deactivations. According to IRS, the order of the phases is based on criteria such as IRS\u2019 business priorities and a migration plan. (See table 3 for a summary of the six phases.)", "While the sequencing plan describes IRS\u2019 general intentions for migrating from its current to its target systems environment, the sequencing plan does not provide the fundamental and critical detail needed to fully understand or execute this transition. For example, it does not specify (1) the schedule and cost estimates for any of the phases or releases, (2) the projects that will constitute the phases or releases, (3) the projects\u2019 cost and schedule estimates, and (4) the projects\u2019 interdependencies.", "Additionally, the sequencing plan does not describe precisely what is intended to occur as subfunctions evolve through the various phases and releases. For instance, a subfunction called Case Analysis and Resolution is shown as new in phase 1/release 1. It is then shown as changed in 10 subsequent releases, but none of the planned changes are explained.", "Further, the sequencing plan indicates that several legacy systems, such as the Electronic Audit Research Log (an automated tool to monitor and detect browsing) and the Integrated Data Retrieval System (the primary system through which IRS employees access taxpayer accounts), will be replaced.

Additionally, this legislation, Office of Management and Budget guidance, and our research into how leading public and private sector organizations successfully manage information technology define common tenets for the CIO position. Among these tenets is the need for the agencies to support the CIO position with an effective CIO organization and management framework for implementing agencywide information technology initiatives.", "The legislation establishes the CIO position at executive branch agencies and sets forth special requirements for CIOs at the 24 agencies where the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, as amended, established chief financial officer positions. In addition, we have supported the establishment of a CIO structure at the agency subcomponent and bureau levels, such as IRS. Such a management structure is particularly important in situations where the departmental subcomponents, like IRS, have large information technology budgets or are engaged in major modernization efforts that require the substantial attention and oversight of a CIO. In the Conference Report on the Clinger-Cohen Act, the conferees recognized that agencies may wish to establish CIOs for major subcomponents and bureaus. These subcomponent-level CIOs should have responsibilities, authority, and management structures that mirror those of the departmental CIO.", "In 1995, we reported that IRS had not established an effective organizational structure to manage systems modernization agencywide. Specifically, IRS\u2019 modernization management structure was fragmented and did not provide for agencywide control over all new modernization systems and all upgrades and replacements of operational systems. As a result, we recommended that the Commissioner assign the Associate Commissioner/Modernization Executive management and control responsibility for all systems development activities, including those of IRS\u2019 research and development organization. Since that time, IRS has appointed a CIO and established an Investment Review Board, and Treasury has taken a more active role in overseeing the modernization. However, organizational control over IRS\u2019 huge information technology investment portfolio continues to be a problem.
