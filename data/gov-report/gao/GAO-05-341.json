To help ensure defense contracts are awarded fairly and current and former employees do not use their knowledge of DOD acquisition activities to gain financial or other benefits, DOD personnel are required to conduct themselves in a manner that meets federal ethics rules and standards. Regulations require DOD to implement an ethics program and provide that contractors meet certain ethics standards. For this report, GAO assessed (1) DOD's efforts to train and counsel its workforce to raise awareness of ethics rules and standards as well as DOD measures of the effectiveness of these efforts and (2) DOD's knowledge of defense contractors' programs to promote ethical standards of conduct."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["To implement its ethics program, DOD has delegated responsibility for training and counseling employees on conflict-of-interest and procurement integrity rules to more than 2,000 ethics counselors in DOD's military services and agencies. These efforts vary in who is required to attend training and counseling, the content of ethics information provided, and how often the training and counseling is provided. While some variation may be warranted, DOD lacks the knowledge needed to determine whether local efforts are meeting the objectives of its ethics program--in large part because DOD does not systematically capture information on the quality and content of the training and counseling or employee activity as they relate to ethics rules and restrictions. Specifically, ethics counselors were unable to tell us if people subject to procurement integrity rules were trained. Instead, DOD evaluates its ethics program in terms of process indicators--such as the number of people filing financial disclosure forms, the number of ethics officials providing training and counseling services, and the amount of time ethics officials spend on such activities--which do not provide metrics to assess the effectiveness of local training and counseling efforts. DOD also lacks adequate information on the number and status of allegations of potential misconduct related to conflict-of-interest and procurement integrity rules. Ethics officials did not know of 53 reported allegations of potential misconduct referred to inspectors general offices. DOD has taken several actions since October 2004 aimed at enhancing its ethics program. However, without knowledge of training, counseling, and reported allegations of misconduct, DOD is not positioned to assess the effectiveness of its efforts. DOD's knowledge of defense contractor efforts to promote ethical standards is also limited. Defense regulations provide that contractors should have ethics programs, provide ethics training for all employees and implement systems to detect improper conduct in connection with government contracts. Despite these regulations, DOD had not evaluated the hiring practices of the contractors GAO contacted. Neither the Defense Contract Management Agency nor the Defense Contract Audit Agency--the agencies responsible for oversight of defense contractors' operations--had assessed the adequacy of contractors' practices for hiring current and former government employees. An independent review of one of DOD's largest contractors found that the company lacked the management controls needed to ensure an effective ethics program. Instead, the review found that the company relied excessively on employees to self-monitor their compliance with post-government employment restrictions. The review concluded that by relying on self-monitoring, the company increased the risk of noncompliance, due to either employees' willful misconduct or failure to understand complex ethics rules."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2004, officials from the Department of Defense (DOD)  awarded contracts worth more than $200 billion for goods and services.

A key objective of an ethics  program is to provide a formal and systematic means for agencies to  prevent and detect ethics violations. The elements of a comprehensive  ethics program include (1) a written policy of standards of ethical conduct  and ethics guidance; (2) effective training and dissemination of  information on ethical standards, procedures, and compliance;   (3) monitoring to ensure the ethics program is followed; (4) periodically  evaluating the effectiveness of the ethics program; and (5) levying  disciplinary measures for misconduct and for failing to take reasonable  steps to prevent or detect misconduct.", "The joint ethics regulation is DOD\u2019s written policy establishing its ethics  program. The ethics program emphasizes training and counseling to raise  awareness of standards of ethical behavior and to prevent misconduct.", "DOD\u2019s ethics training requirement includes educating employees about the  procedures to follow when considering employment outside of DOD and  the post-government employment restrictions that may apply and to  inform employees of the resources that are available to them to address  ethics questions and concerns. The training includes an initial briefing to  introduce employees to ethics regulations, such as conflict-of-interest and  procurement integrity rules, and exit briefings to discuss restrictions that  may apply once employees leave government service. Additional ethics  briefings are held for certain senior employees on an annual basis. DOD\u2019s  ethics counseling aims to address employee concerns and questions as  they arise. The training and counseling is also to raise awareness so that  DOD employees can recognize misconduct and report the matter to ethics  officials, inspectors general officials, the head of the command or agency,  criminal investigative offices, or any number of DOD hotlines.  Responsibility for recognizing and reporting potential misconduct rests  with all DOD employees. Additionally, the joint ethics regulation requires  ethics officials to track and follow up on reports of potential misconduct.  Finally, the DOD regulation requires periodic evaluations of local  activities, which implement DOD\u2019s ethics program, to ensure they meet  standards.", "Defense regulations provide that government contractors should have  standards of conduct and internal control systems to promote ethical  standards, facilitate timely discovery and disclosure of improper conduct  in connection with government contracts, and ensure corrective measures  are promptly implemented. The regulations provide that contractors  should have a written code of business ethics and conduct, an ethics  training program for all employees, and to periodically review practices,  procedures, policies, and internal controls for compliance with standards  of conduct.", "The federal government has a host of laws and regulations governing the  conduct of its employees and contractors.

The title 18 provision generally prohibits  former federal employees and their supervisors from representing non- government entities concerning matters they handled while working for  the federal government. Violation of the statute entails criminal penalties.  In contrast, the title 41 provision more narrowly applies to contracting  officials and also entails civil and administrative penalties. The provision  generally restricts employment with a contractor if the official performed  certain functions involving the contractor and a contract valued in excess  of $10,000,000. The law, however, permits employees to accept  compensation \u201cfrom any division or affiliate of a contractor that does not  produce the same or similar products or services\u201d that were produced  under the contract.", "There are also provisions related to post-government employment that are  applicable to federal employees\u2019 actions while still in federal service.   18 U.S.C. 208 prohibits government employees from participating in  matters in which they have a financial interest. The statute imposes  criminal penalties on federal employees who begin negotiating future  employment without first disqualifying themselves from any duties related  to the potential employer. In addition 41 U.S.C. 423(c) requires officials  who participate personally and substantially in a procurement exceeding  $100,000 to report promptly contacts by bidders or offerors regarding  future employment.

At the   12 DOD locations we visited we found training and counseling efforts  varied in the content of ethics information provided, who is required to  attend training and counseling, and how often the training and counseling  is provided. For example, some ethics counselors conduct extensive  discussions about employees\u2019 plans upon separation at the exit briefing,  some provide written advice, and others distribute pamphlets summarizing  employment restrictions. Some ethics counselors have supplemented their  annual training because they do not believe that the minimum  requirements in the joint ethics regulation\u2014an annual ethics briefing\u2014are  sufficient to ensure employees understand employment restrictions both  during and after they leave government service.

However, these process indicators  do not provide DOD knowledge of which employees are subject to  restrictions, which employees receive training and counseling, the quality  and content of training, and who is leaving DOD for employment with  contractors. For example, DOD does not know if the population critical to  the acquisition process, those employees covered by procurement  integrity restrictions, are trained. Further, many ethics counselors could  not provide evidence that employees received the annual ethics training.  Additionally, DOD does not know whether the training and counseling  includes all relevant conflict-of-interest and procurement integrity rules.

However, when we asked the ethics officials  for information on allegations of misconduct and the status of  investigations, they were not tracking or following-up on the status of  alleged misconduct cases. For information on reported allegations of  potential misconduct the ethics officials referred us to the inspectors  general offices. According to inspectors general officials, DOD has not  made an attempt to determine the extent that potential misconduct in  terms of conflict-of-interest and procurement integrity is reported.
