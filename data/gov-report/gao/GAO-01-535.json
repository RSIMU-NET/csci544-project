Operational audits are targeted on returns where IRS suspects noncompliance, often based on a computerized screening of returns that looks for indicators of noncompliance.", "In spite of IRS\u2019 efforts to enforce compliance, each year billions of dollars in taxes owed are not voluntarily reported and paid, which could result in reduced revenue to fund federal programs, higher tax rates, or both. In order to understand the overall extent of noncompliance and the effectiveness of its compliance assurance programs, IRS has periodically measured voluntary compliance. There are three types of voluntary compliance measures: filing compliance, which measures the percent of taxpayers who file returns in a timely manner; payment compliance, which measures the percent of tax payments that are paid in a timely manner; and reporting compliance, which measures the percent of actual tax liability that is reported accurately on returns. This report reviews reporting compliance.", "IRS\u2019 past estimates of reporting compliance were based on audits conducted on random samples of taxpayers that were then statistically projected to the entire population of taxpayers. Unlike operational audits, done to help ensure compliance and targeted on suspected noncompliance, random audits are done to measure compliance and are conducted on a sample of returns selected without regard to suspected noncompliance.", "IRS does not have a current measure of voluntary reporting compliance. The last time IRS measured voluntary reporting compliance was for tax year 1988 returns. IRS planned to measure voluntary reporting compliance for tax year 1994, but canceled the effort because of criticism that the project was too costly and random audits were intrusive and burdensome on compliant taxpayers. However, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue has said that a current measure of voluntary compliance is needed to assess how well IRS is accomplishing its mission.", "In light of the controversy surrounding IRS\u2019 last effort to measure voluntary reporting compliance by randomly auditing taxpayers, we initiated this review to determine the status of IRS\u2019 current efforts. In addition, we looked at how selected programs in other federal agencies use random sampling to measure compliance with the rules and regulations governing their programs. We undertook this review on our own initiative and, as agreed, are addressing it to you because of your interest in IRS\u2019 operations.", "To determine the status of IRS\u2019 plans to measure voluntary reporting compliance, we reviewed available planning documents and discussed the plans with IRS officials. To obtain information on how others measure compliance, we identified six large programs in five other agencies that used random samples to gauge compliance. We then contacted and interviewed officials in the five federal agencies responsible for the six programs and reviewed available documentation. The six programs and associated agencies were the (1) Health Care Financing Administration\u2019s (HCFA) Medicare Program; (2) Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food Stamp Program; (3) Social Security Administration\u2019s (SSA) Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) Program; (4) SSA\u2019s Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Program; (5) U.S. Customs Service\u2019s Compliance Measurement Program (CMP); and (6) Immigration and Naturalization Service\u2019s (INS) Inspections\u2019 Traveler Examinations (INTEX) pilot program. We did not attempt to assess the effectiveness of the agencies\u2019 random sampling programs. In appendix I, we discuss our objectives, scope, and methodology in detail.", "We did our audit work from May 2000 through March 2001 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["One of IRS\u2019 strategic goals is to provide top-quality service to all taxpayers through fair and uniform application of the law. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has stated that measuring voluntary compliance is essential for determining IRS\u2019 progress in meeting this goal. However, IRS\u2019 last measure of voluntary reporting compliance was done on tax year 1988 returns, where an estimated 8 percent of taxes owed were underreported on individual tax returns. This measure was developed from data obtained under IRS\u2019 1988 Taxpayer Compliance Measurement Program (TCMP), which audited a random sample of about 50,000 individual taxpayers. IRS is concerned that these data are too old to be meaningful.", "IRS last planned to measure voluntary reporting compliance for tax year 1994 returns under TCMP. The 1994 TCMP was an ambitious effort, with IRS planning to audit over 150,000 randomly selected tax returns of individuals, corporations, partnerships, and S-corporations. Over 92,000 of these audits were to be conducted on individuals (including sole proprietors and farmers) filing the Form 1040. Before beginning the audit process, however, IRS canceled TCMP because it was too costly. Also contributing to the project\u2019s cancellation was criticism from Congress, the media, tax community, and taxpayers, because the sample was considered too large and the audits too burdensome on taxpayers.", "We have previously reported that the results of TCMP studies provided more than just an indicator of compliance status. (See app. III for a list of the reports we have issued on TCMP studies.) The information generated from TCMP surveys was used to help IRS identify compliance trends, and it allowed IRS to suggest changes in tax laws and regulations to improve voluntary reporting compliance. TCMP results were also used to develop formulas that helped IRS more effectively identify noncompliant taxpayers for operational audits. The formulas developed from TCMP data help IRS identify tax returns with a high probability that an audit would detect changes to tax liability. The lower the numbers of returns with no change to tax liability the better the formulas are as predictors of audit opportunity. According to IRS, since return selection formulas were first developed from TCMP data and used to select 1968 tax returns for audit, the number of audits that result in no change to tax liability have been reduced from about 46 percent in the year before the use of formulas to about 19 percent in fiscal year 1994. Starting in fiscal year 1995, however, the number of audits where there was no-change to tax liability after an audit began to increase, and it was 24 percent in fiscal year 1998, raising IRS\u2019 concerns about increasing the burden on compliant taxpayers.", "TCMP data also enabled IRS to estimate the tax gap, which is the difference between the amount of tax owed and the amount of tax voluntarily paid. The last tax gap estimate was made using 1985 and 1988 TCMP data, in which IRS projected that the individual tax gap for 1992 would be over $93.2 billion. TCMP data were also used by congressional tax writing committees, the Department of Commerce, Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Tax Analysis, and state governments. These uses included estimating revenue impacts of new legislation; making adjustments to the national income accounts, such as gross domestic product; and researching tax noncompliance. Some states have also used compliance measurement data to help them develop state compliance programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Has Not Finalized Its Plans on How It Will Measure Voluntary Reporting Compliance", "paragraphs": ["In May 2000, IRS established a NRP Program Office to develop an approach for measuring voluntary compliance.  While IRS has not finalized its plans for how to measure voluntary reporting compliance as of March 2001, some steps have been taken. The staff has established study objectives and developed a set of guiding principles that are to be adhered to when conducting the study. As of March 2001, IRS had a draft business plan that contained information on four different approaches for measuring voluntary reporting compliance, including two that use random audits. Also, in the event that IRS decides to use audits to measure compliance, the staff plans to use existing data collection software and has started developing database software to organize the data and make it more accessible to staff in the operating divisions. Given the importance of these systems to the program, IRS plans to conduct a comprehensive test of all the software."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "IRS Has Established Objectives and Guiding Principles for Developing a Measure of Voluntary Reporting Compliance", "paragraphs": ["NRP is IRS\u2019 effort to measure its progress in meeting its strategic goal of providing top-quality service to all taxpayers through fair and uniform application of the law.  The NRP Office has developed objectives and established several guiding principles to direct its efforts to plan and implement this program.  Table 1 outlines these objectives and guiding principles.", "The objectives for NRP cover a wide range of uses for compliance data. In addition to the objective of determining the voluntary reporting compliance rate, IRS expects the approved measurement approach to produce data that can be used to update return selection criteria so that it can better detect noncompliance, thus reducing the number of compliant taxpayers selected for operational audits. Similarly, NRP is intended to obtain data that can be used to improve IRS\u2019 operations by providing specific information about noncompliance, allowing IRS to make operational changes that could improve compliance. For example, TCMP data indicated that many taxpayers erroneously claimed dependents on their tax returns. IRS subsequently recommended that Congress require taxpayers to include the dependent\u2019s social security number on their returns. Taxpayers claimed 7 million fewer dependents on their 1987 tax returns, the first year dependent social security numbers were required.", "The guiding principles represent the conditions under which the study will be conducted to meet the objectives. According to IRS, these principles were developed in response to certain real and perceived deficiencies with prior TCMP studies. For example, IRS recognized the need to limit the burden imposed on taxpayers by measuring their compliance. In 1994, taxpayer burden was one of the key criticisms of doing TCMP audits. Although the current plans for measuring voluntary reporting compliance are not complete, some proposed actions seem likely to reduce the burden imposed on taxpayers if IRS determines that random audits are necessary. These include (1) using a dedicated cadre of auditors for NRP audits, which IRS believes will reduce the time needed for an audit; (2) building a comprehensive preaudit case file for the taxpayers being audited, which will reduce the amount of information auditors must request from the taxpayer; (3) limiting the number of lines audited on some returns; and (4) minimizing the sample size, resulting in fewer taxpayers being inconvenienced by audits.", "To avoid criticism like that received on its plan for the tax year 1994 TCMP, IRS planned to contact external stakeholders and solicit their ideas and support before making a decision on the final measurement approach. For example, at the time of our review, NRP staff had contacted officials at Treasury to begin discussing any concerns they might have with the study. The Commissioner indicated that he would be contacting interested congressional officials directly. Finally, NRP staff planned to contact members of the tax community, such as tax preparers and accountants. According to NRP staff, other stakeholders would be included as they are identified.", "To ensure that the measurement approach meets the needs of the operating divisions, NRP officials have begun a dialogue with operating division staff. This process began when NRP staff briefed senior operating division managers on the program\u2019s status. Also, IRS has established an executive steering committee, chaired by the NRP Director, with representatives from the Commissioner\u2019s office, each of the operating divisions, and other potential stakeholders, to ensure high-level, oversight over the study."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Components of IRS\u2019 Draft Business Plan for Measuring Voluntary Reporting Compliance", "paragraphs": ["As of March 2001, the NRP Office had developed a preliminary draft business plan, providing information on how IRS intends to develop a measure of voluntary reporting compliance around the framework of the guiding principles. The plan also shows how IRS intends to determine the most appropriate method for meeting NRP objectives. The plan discusses the pros and cons of four approaches for measuring reporting compliance and how they align with the program\u2019s objectives. These approaches are (1) do not measure voluntary reporting compliance, (2) use operational audit data (i.e., results of IRS\u2019 day-to-day regular audit program), (3) conduct annual random audits of a small sample of taxpayers, or (4) conduct audits of a larger sample once every 3 years. NRP staff has not yet completed their study of the costs and benefits of the various approaches. However, the alternative with a larger sample conducted once every three years is currently the recommended approach.", "The draft business plan analysis of the approach to stick with the status quo and do nothing points out that this approach would not add to taxpayer burden, but also that it would not meet study objectives. The draft business plan analysis for the approach using operational data, while incomplete, suggests that it may be possible to measure voluntary reporting compliance in this manner. However, the plan notes that although statistical methods exist for using nonrepresentative data to project to an entire population, the methods may not be well suited to analyzing the operational audit data available to IRS. According to NRP officials, more detailed analysis is being done on this approach.", "As part of its analysis of the two approaches using random samples, IRS plans to minimize the sample size to address the concerns raised about the proposed tax year 1994 TCMP sample being too large. IRS proposes to limit the sample size by reducing the number of groups it plans to analyze. The sample size may also be reduced because IRS does not plan to update the operational audit selection criteria for most nonbusiness taxpayers.Finally, in previous compliance measurement studies, every line of a selected tax return was audited. In keeping with the guiding principle of reducing taxpayer burden, the draft business plan indicates that IRS does not intend to audit each line of every return selected for audit. According to NRP officials, criteria for when to audit a line on the tax return and how to analyze lines that were not audited have not been determined.", "IRS also intends to include in its NRP business plan a detailed data analysis plan that will show how the information gathered in the study is to be used to meet the study objectives. In the past, we have emphasized the importance of having an analysis plan to show how the data are to be used. Also, such a plan is important to ensure that institutional systems and staff are in place to quickly and efficiently analyze the data and get the results into the hands of managers who can make appropriate changes. NRP officials told us that they are working on these plans with operating division staff and that analysis plans will be included in the final business plan.", "If either of the two random audit approaches or the use of operational audits is deemed the appropriate method for meeting NRP objectives, IRS plans to use existing reporting and data gathering systems to collect the data. NRP officials believe that using these existing systems\u2014the Report Generating System and the Examination Operational Automation Database\u2014will reduce the time needed to complete data entry. They also believe that using the existing software to collect NRP data will result in more accurate data being added to the database because audit information will be directly entered by auditors in an electronic format, with no need to transcribe it after the audit. IRS is also developing database prototype software that is to interface with the existing systems. IRS officials indicated that when the database program is completed, they plan to conduct an operational test of the combined systems to ensure that they are operating efficiently and will provide the services required for NRP."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "How Other Programs Measure Compliance", "paragraphs": ["The six federal programs we studied, like IRS\u2019 TCMP studies, randomly sample their clients to measure compliance with the rules and regulations covering their programs and services. Agencies responsible for these six programs measure compliance to conform to the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993, which required that agencies establish measures to determine the results of agency activities.In general, the agencies use random sampling to reduce the cost and burden of collecting this information. Each of the six programs we studied conducted compliance reviews differently, gathering different amounts and types of information with varying amounts of time required for the review. Table 2 summarizes the characteristics of the random samples used to measure compliance for each of the six programs.", "While none of the agencies\u2019 mission or responsibilities is exactly like IRS\u2019, there are similarities in how they and IRS treat compliance with the laws and regulations governing their programs. For example, the agencies and IRS try to ensure compliance through efforts that apply to all their clients. Similarly, each agency uses random samples to measure the effectiveness of these efforts and to determine how well they are accomplishing their mission objectives. Another similarity, is that most of the agencies, when measuring compliance, contact clients in person. Finally, the agencies statistically project sample results to the entire client population.", "Officials in each of the agencies we contacted indicated that the results of random sampling were used to measure progress against the agency\u2019s strategic goals. Most of the agencies also used the data to help make decisions about operational changes that could improve compliance. For example, HCFA used its compliance measurement data to track claims through the processing system and record their disposition so that it could identify areas of concern and develop corrective actions to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the claims processing system. Also, HCFA officials considered the analysis of data generated from compliance measurement to be a tool for assessing the validity of complaints received from health care providers as well as a method for evaluating the contractors providing payment services to the Medicare Program. INS officials told us that they may be able to use compliance measurement data to identify areas where additional training was needed for their inspection staff. Finally, Customs officials indicated that compliance reviews using random samples allow them to make estimates of how much contraband they fail to interdict on the primary inspections. According to these officials, without some secondary review using random sampling, they would only be able to provide Congress with data on the amount and number of illegal imports they were able to identify in their primary inspections. (A more detailed discussion of each agency\u2019s compliance review program can be found in app. IV.)", "By using statistically valid random samples, agencies can obtain compliance information from a small fraction of the program\u2019s population. For example, as shown in table 2, 55,000 food stamp recipients are sampled out of 7.9 million total recipients.

During fiscal year 2000, Customs processed about 482 million passengers arriving at land and airport ports of entry.", "Customs conducts several types of random audits as part of its management and quality control efforts. The largest of these random inspection programs is conducted at U.S. land border crossings, where during fiscal year 2000, Customs randomly selected over 326,000 privately owned vehicles entering the country for a detailed secondary inspection. In these inspections, Customs looks for illegal contraband, such as drugs, and other goods that were not declared.", "Similar random inspections are conducted at the top 20 commercial air passenger ports of entry, where in fiscal year 2000, over 232,000 passengers were randomly selected for detailed secondary inspections. According to Customs officials, these secondary inspections range from 5 minutes to 20 minutes. Longer inspection times occur at land ports of entry, where the inspector must conduct a comprehensive inspection of vehicles. A shorter period is needed at airports, where inspectors generally only look at the contents of baggage. Inspectors complete a one-page data collection instrument, obtaining information such as country of origin, passport information, and other demographic data. Customs also uses a law enforcement network as a data resource for determining criminal activities.", "Customs uses the information from these secondary inspections to provide an estimate of the number of violators and the effectiveness of its primary inspection process. These inspections also serve as a measure of how well Customs is meeting the goals it established to comply with GPRA. Results of primary inspections only provide data on the number of interdictions made--and not the number that are missed. Customs officials indicated that using random sampling for secondary inspections better meets GPRA goals because the secondary inspections allow them to estimate how much contraband they failed to interdict on the primary inspections. Consequently, using random samples helps them provide Congress with better inspection data overall.", "Customs officials indicated that the information gathered from these secondary inspections is used to develop training programs for inspectors and to indicate where changes in inspection programs are needed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "INS, Inspections\u2019 Traveler Examinations Program", "paragraphs": ["The mission of the Immigration and Naturalization Service is to ensure that individuals seeking entry to the United States are legally entitled to do so.
