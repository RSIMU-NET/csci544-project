Overall, the prices for Navy repairable spare parts continue to climb for the three aircraft and their engines that GAO focused on in its November 2000 report. GAO's assessment of selected parts being repaired showed that while nearly 45 percent of the parts decreased in price, about 55 percent increased an average of 91.5 percent between fiscal year 1999 and 2002. The price increases were primarily due to the dramatically higher costs of the materials needed to repair spare parts, although other factors, such as overhead fees and labor rates, contributed. However, GAO could not determine the underlying causes for the rising material costs because the Navy's database lacked key information on each repair. The Navy's progress in developing an overall plan to identify and address the reasons for higher spare parts prices has been limited. It has not yet identified and implemented ways to reduce and stabilize prices. Further, the Navy has undertaken several initiatives, but most of these efforts focused on improving the reliability or the maintenance processes for repairing spare parts rather than on identifying why prices continue to rise. One initiative, the establishment of an automated serial number tracking system for spare parts, however, has potential for providing the specific information needed to determine why the spare parts prices are increasing and develop a strategy for stabilizing them.

This report, along with one on the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) issued in April 2002, responds to your most recent request. It follows up on our November 2000 report on Navy aircraft parts in which we recommended actions to reduce and stabilize prices and overhead fees for aviation spare parts. As agreed, we also reviewed (1) the price increases for selected spare parts to identify the key factors contributing to those increases and (2) the Navy\u2019s progress in identifying and addressing the underlying causes for increased repairable spare parts prices.", "For this review, we analyzed the repair costs and pricing data, for fiscal years 1999 to 2002, of 453 selected spare parts from three Navy weapon systems: the H-53 helicopter, the F/A-18 Hornet fighter and attack aircraft, and the AV-8B Harrier attack aircraft and their engines. We chose these systems because they were the same ones cited in our prior report that had experienced higher-than-average price increases between fiscal year 1994 and 1999. We then visited two Navy depots to collect detailed information on 31 of the 453 parts to determine why their costs continued to rise.

Repair parts and components can include repairable parts, which are returned to the supply system to be fixed when they are no longer in working condition, and consumable parts, which cannot be repaired cost-effectively.", "The Navy owns and operates about 4,000 aircraft. These aircraft contain about 70,000 repairable spare parts, such as landing gear, navigational computers, and hydraulic pumps. These spare parts, in turn, consist of thousands of individual parts or items. When any of these spare parts or individual items fails to perform properly, or reaches the end of its service life, it must be replaced with a repaired or newly purchased part. This maintenance work takes place at government repair facilities and commercial contractor facilities across the country. Providing logistics support for these aircraft is the responsibility of the Naval Air Systems Command and the Naval Supply Systems Command. Overall Navy logistics policies and procedures are the responsibility of the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Logistics).", "The Navy\u2019s repairable spare parts are managed under the Navy Working Capital Fund. This is a revolving fund that relies on revenues generated from the sale of parts and services to customers, which are then used to finance subsequent operations. The fund is expected to generate sufficient revenues to cover the full cost of operations and to break even over time\u2014 that is, not to have a gain or a loss. Customers order parts from the Navy\u2019s supply system and pay the working capital fund from their budgets. Each fiscal year, the Navy establishes the prices for spare parts, setting them to correspond with the customers\u2019 aggregate budgeted amounts. This concept, in theory, ensures that customers have, in the aggregate, sufficient funds budgeted to purchase their anticipated requirements of spare parts.", "The process of setting prices for spare parts begins 2 years before the fiscal year in which the prices take effect and involves customers, a number of Navy entities, and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller). During this process, the customer price is set on the basis of projected customer requirements, as well as anticipated repair costs and management overhead fees.

Our analysis suggested that the major factor driving these increases was the cost of the materials used to repair spare parts, while other factors, such as higher overhead fees and growing labor costs, also contributed. However, because of the lack of relevant information in the Navy\u2019s maintenance and repair databases, we were unable to determine what the underlying reasons were for the increases and as a result, what management action might be appropriate to reduce or stabilize the prices."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Prices of Repairable Spare Parts Rise", "paragraphs": ["The prices of repairable aviation spare parts continued to increase dramatically. Between fiscal year 1999 and 2002, the total cost of spare parts increased from $1.6 billion to $2.7 billion. Of this total, the repair portion rose from $1.2 billion to $1.8 billion, an increase of 50 percent and represented 6.6 and 8.3 percent, respectively, of the Navy and Marine Corps\u2019 operation and maintenance funds that are used to sustain the readiness of the operating forces.", "Our analysis of 453 selected spare parts showed that the prices paid by customers increased an average of 37 percent between fiscal year 1999 and 2002 (see app. II). We looked at these because they were the most costly repair parts  from three aircraft (the H-53 helicopter, the F/A-18 Hornet fighter and attack aircraft, and the AV-8B Harrier attack aircraft) and their engines. We found that the prices for 195 of the 453 parts dropped an average of almost 35 percent (see app. III) due to reductions in both repair costs and overhead fees.

These parts were all repaired at government depots. As table 1 shows, the average increases in total repair costs for these 31 parts varied widely\u2014from a modest 8 percent for the F/A-18 Hornet aircraft to more than 200 percent for two engine systems (F-402 and T-64). A closer look at the repair data indicated that the largest increases were generally attributable to the higher costs of the materials used to repair the spare parts, while a smaller increase resulted from higher labor costs.", "For example, one of the parts, a rotor compressor for the F-402 engine, increased over 86 percent in price from $48,890 in fiscal year 1999 to $91,060 in fiscal year 2002. The material portion of the costs for repair had increased from $16,386 to $57,727 (over 252 percent), while labor had decreased from $10,739 to $9,092 (approximately 15 percent) and overhead had increased less than 12 percent from $21,765 to $24,241.

It shows that a significant portion ($30,893, or 69 percent) of the price stemmed from the cost of the materials used to fix the rotor.", "A recent Naval Air Systems Command study underscored that rising material costs used in repairing spare parts are a contributing factor to price increases. The study compared repair costs in its maintenance facilities for the first quarter of fiscal year 1997 with those for the first quarter of fiscal year 2000. It concluded that while the average annual repair costs for more than 26,000 parts increased by 5 percent, the cost of materials rose by 8 percent; in contrast, labor costs rose less than 1 percent. Furthermore, the study showed that in the case of 105 high- demand parts material costs jumped by about 16 percent while labor costs increased by 3 percent.", "We found a similar link between higher material costs and repairable spare parts price increases. Our examination of the aggregate prices of individual repair items used in the 31 spare parts indicated that three factors may have contributed to higher material costs for 25 of these parts: (1) higher prices for individual repair parts used, (2) the use of more parts in the repair process, and (3) changes in the mix of repair parts used. Another possible factor identified through discussions with Navy officials was that some repairs used new, more expensive repair parts. However, the Navy\u2019s data systems did not provide sufficient information on each repair event to allow us to determine why the prices increased for each spare part. For example, we could discern that more material had been used in a repair, but we could not determine why this had happened: Had maintenance procedures changed? Was the repairable part in unusually poor condition? Had there been extensive cannibalization of the part\u2019s components? Or were there other reasons? Without more specific information on each spare part or repair event, management would not be able to determine\u2014or address\u2014the reasons for rising repair costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Available Data Limits Ability to Identify Causes for Price Increases", "paragraphs": ["As noted above, our ability to determine the reasons for rising spare part costs was impaired because the Navy lacked an effective data system to collect and analyze information relevant to material costs and usage. The current data system tracks repair costs for groups of spare parts but not for individual parts. The costs are accumulated for the group, divided by the number of spare parts in the group and analyzed as an average cost per item in the group. As a result, government repair facilities cannot determine the cause of significant increases in repair costs for an individual spare part. For example, the average reported material cost for individual repair parts needed to repair compressors for the F-402 engine increased from $14,269 in fiscal year 1998 to $65,494 in fiscal year 2000. While the detailed requisition data identifies what materials were ordered, it is impossible to determine\u2014when more than one repair is associated with the requisition\u2014how much of the material was used in a specific repair. Consequently, the fact that more material is being used on multiple repairs can be discerned, but not the reason for the increased usage.

While this approach has merit, it focuses only on the demand side of the total flying hour program cost equation. As a result, significant price increases or decreases can occur without management being aware of the underlying causes.", "An April 2001 study by the Center for Naval Analyses showed that the cost of repairable parts continued to climb, even though the number of Navy flight hours recorded decreased. In examining why the cost per flying hour increased from fiscal year 1992 to fiscal year 1999, the study concluded that the main reasons were a decline in the number of hours flown and the increased age of Navy aircraft. The study also found that price increases for spare parts, overhead costs, quantity of materials ordered, and the mix of spare parts ordered also contributed significantly to higher flying hour costs. Price increases were identified as a significant factor that should be studied further. A Navy logistics official told us the service has used the study to justify a potential 2 percent budget increase for repairable spare parts starting in fiscal year 2000.", "The Navy has recently undertaken a number of initiatives, such as the Logistics Engineering Change Proposals program, that are designed to control the costs of individual spare parts by improving their reliability. These efforts focus on improving the reliability of repairable parts, and thereby reducing demand while reducing or eliminating support costs. Repairable parts are selected for the study on the basis of their high historical costs and low reliability. Then the proposals are evaluated to determine whether a change in the part would be justified based on the anticipated investment return equal to two times the cost within 5 years. While these efforts have resulted in some significant reported cost savings, they have been geared toward increasing the reliability of parts, thereby reducing the total costs of these parts.", "Other ongoing initiatives are directed at streamlining the maintenance operations at government repair facilities, and thus potentially lowering the overhead costs that are charged to repairs. The Business Process Reengineering effort, which began in fiscal year 1999, focuses on the repair and modification process at the government repair facilities. Through this effort, the Navy expects to reduce its acquisition costs and overhead charges by adopting new acquisition methods, such as prime vendors, direct vendor deliveries, and electronic commerce. It also expects to reduce its labor costs by automating the requisition process, outsourcing material handling functions, and improving the workload forecasting process. It plans to achieve additional savings from its component repair segment in the form of increased part reliability. Another related initiative is the Manufacturing Resource Planning effort, scheduled for completion by the end of fiscal year 2002. This initiative is designed to cut costs by reducing inventories and shortening lead times on parts requisitions at government repair facilities.
