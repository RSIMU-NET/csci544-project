Furthermore, given the scale of the pandemic, HIV/AIDS has grown beyond a public health problem to become a humanitarian and developmental crisis. For example, the U.S. National Intelligence Council concluded that the persistence and spread of infectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, are likely to aggravate and, in some cases, provoke economic decline, social fragmentation, and political destabilization. In 2000, the United States classified HIV/AIDS as a threat to national security, and the Congress approved approximately $466 million for international HIV/AIDS efforts in 2001.", "UNAIDS, funded in part by the United States, is one important international effort against HIV/AIDS.

UNAIDS was also expected to evaluate the progress made toward achieving its mission. UNAIDS is made up of a Secretariat and seven U.N. cosponsors with individual responsibilities that are to work together to achieve UNAIDS\u2019 mission. We reported in 1998 that UNAIDS had made limited progress toward achieving its mission. We found that U.N. cosponsors had not increased funding to integrate HIV/AIDS into their programs as expected and that UNAIDS had not been effective in coordinating the U.N. response at the country level or in helping developing countries respond to the worldwide epidemic. In January 1999, UNAIDS launched the International Partnership Against AIDS in Africa to enhance national and international efforts against the epidemic in Africa.", "This letter responds to your request that we examine UNAIDS\u2019 progress in achieving its mission since we last reported in 1998. In this report, we (1) assess UNAIDS\u2019 progress, especially at the country level, toward increasing the coordination and commitment of the U.N. and global community; (2) assess UNAIDS\u2019 progress in providing technical support and information and in developing a monitoring and evaluation plan to measure results; and (3) identify factors that may have affected UNAIDS\u2019 progress.

Later that same year, the U.N. General Assembly encouraged WHO to continue its efforts and urged all appropriate U.N. system organizations to support AIDS control efforts. In the early 1990s, U.N. officials and bilateral donors increasingly recognized the need for a multisectoral response to the complex challenges of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, including the social, economic, and development issues contributing to the spread of the virus. They realized that WHO\u2019s medically based approach was insufficient to effectively combat the virus. In response, the United Nation\u2019s Economic and Social Council established the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and operations started in 1996. The mission of UNAIDS is to strengthen and support an expanded response to HIV/AIDS aimed at preventing the transmission of HIV, providing care and support, reducing the vulnerability of individuals and communities to the worldwide epidemic, and alleviating its impact. UNAIDS was not expected to fund the efforts of the global community.", "Intended to be a model of U.N. reform, UNAIDS is the United Nations\u2019 first joint, cosponsored program of its type. UNAIDS is comprised of a Secretariat and seven U.N. cosponsors that act at the global, regional, and country levels. UNAIDS\u2019 Programme Coordinating Board is the governing body for all programmatic issues concerning policy, strategy, finance, and monitoring and evaluation of UNAIDS. Through the Committee of Cosponsoring Organizations, the cosponsors\u2019 executive heads or their representatives meet twice a year to consider matters concerning UNAIDS and to provide input into UNAIDS' policies and strategies. The UNAIDS Secretariat, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, and acting primarily at the global level, is in charge of the overall coordination and management of UNAIDS and leads the International Partnership Against AIDS in Africa. The seven cosponsors are independent U.N. agencies that have programs in regions and countries worldwide. By joining the UNAIDS partnership, they committed to joint planning and action against HIV/AIDS. Cosponsors are charged with integrating HIV/AIDS-related strategies, policies, programs, and activities into the work of their respective agencies. Figure 1 shows the organizational structure of UNAIDS.", "The United Nations creates U.N. \u201ctheme groups\u201d on specific issues to facilitate its efforts at the country level and to promote a more coherent U.N. response to national priorities. For example, one type of theme group focuses on the environment and sustainable development, and another on the empowerment of women. The U.N. has 132 theme groups on HIV/AIDS that serve as UNAIDS\u2019 primary mechanism for assisting developing countries. They are composed primarily of the senior staff of UNAIDS\u2019 cosponsors and are located in-country. The theme groups\u2019 principal objectives are to coordinate the U.N. response at the country level and to support national governments and others in their efforts to mount an effective and comprehensive response to HIV/AIDS. Theme groups are expected to share information, plan, and monitor coordinated actions with their U.N. partners and, in some cases, jointly finance major AIDS-related activities in support of host governments and national partners, such as nongovernmental organizations. In priority countries, the theme group may be supported by a Country Programme Advisor, a country-based Secretariat staff member. In addition to supporting the broader U.N. system, to build national commitment to HIV/AIDS action, this advisor is expected to provide information and guidance to a range of host country partners including government departments, nongovernmental and community-based organizations, and people living with HIV/AIDS.", "UNAIDS is funded through voluntary contributions from national governments, cosponsors\u2019 cash contributions, and private donations.

The budget for 2000-2001 is $140 million.  Cosponsors also provide funding for their HIV/AIDS-related activities from their core budgets and solicit supplemental funding for their country-level activities from bilateral donors and other sources, such as foundations. The United States is the largest contributor to UNAIDS, providing $34 million for the 1996-1997 biennium, $31 million for the 1998-1999 biennium, and approximately $32 million for the 2000-2001 biennium. The State Department is the United States\u2019 liaison with multilateral organizations such as the United Nations, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) manages U.S. funding to UNAIDS and coordinates and participates in the U.S. delegation to UNAIDS\u2019 governing board."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "UNAIDS Has Made Progress Toward Increasing Coordination and Commitment to HIV/AIDS, but Country-Level Efforts Need Strengthening", "paragraphs": ["UNAIDS has made progress toward increasing global coordination and commitment to HIV/AIDS since we last reported in 1998.

However, half of UNAIDS\u2019 donors surveyed did not believe that the Secretariat had been as successful as originally expected in facilitating the coordination of U.N. actions on HIV/AIDS. According to USAID officials, the Secretariat\u2019s lack of clear guidance and coordination produced, in part, confusion within the U.N. system about the roles of the Secretariat and cosponsors. In response, the Secretariat is facilitating the development of the U.N. System Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS for 2001-2005. The plan is designed to provide a more coherent U.N. response to HIV/AIDS, documenting the efforts of the Secretariat, 7 U.N. cosponsors, and 21 other U.N. agencies, such as the International Labour Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization. The Secretariat stated the plan will be presented to UNAIDS\u2019 governing board by June 2001. In addition, the Secretariat and cosponsors began conducting detailed reviews of each of the cosponsors\u2019 HIV/AIDS programs in March 2000. These reviews profile each cosponsor\u2019s mandate, structure, operations and budget, and HIV/AIDS-related work. The reviews are intended to improve UNAIDS\u2019 strategic planning and collaboration and to increase understanding within UNAIDS about each of the cosponsors\u2019 roles and responsibilities.", "UNAIDS cosponsors\u2019 commitment to HIV/AIDS has increased since we last reported. Over the past 2 years, the executive boards of several cosponsors have issued statements to strengthen agency action on HIV/AIDS. For example, in January 2000, WHO\u2019s Executive Board requested that the Director General strengthen the agency\u2019s involvement in the UNAIDS effort and give HIV/AIDS priority in its budget. All UNAIDS cosponsors\u2019 executive directors now speak at major international meetings and events, advocating for increased attention and activities to combat HIV/AIDS. Some cosponsors also have elevated the position of the HIV/AIDS unit or focal point organizationally to highlight the visibility and importance of the issue within the agency. For example, in 1999, to focus on its HIV/AIDS efforts in sub-Saharan Africa, the World Bank created a new office that reports to the agency\u2019s Office of the Regional Vice Presidents.  The same year, the U.N. Children\u2019s Fund established a senior- level post and unit at their headquarters.", "On the other hand, the cosponsors\u2019 progress toward integrating HIV/AIDS into their agency strategies, programs, and activities has varied and continues to evolve. For example, an external evaluation of the U.N. Development Programme\u2019s HIV/AIDS program, prepared in 2000, found that HIV/AIDS had not been fully integrated into the agency\u2019s work. In response, the Development Programme made HIV/AIDS one of its top priorities and launched a resource mobilization campaign to support country-level activities, among other efforts. The U.N. Population Fund also evaluated its HIV/AIDS programs and concluded in its 1999 report that many of the agency\u2019s efforts to integrate HIV/AIDS were superficial. In response, the Population Fund made HIV/AIDS a top priority as part of its 2001 agency realignment process\u2014an action that the agency expects will accelerate efforts to integrate HIV/AIDS into its existing programs. The Executive Director of UNAIDS said that further strengthening cosponsor commitment and integration of HIV/AIDS is a top internal challenge for UNAIDS. Appendix III briefly describes the HIV/AIDS programs and key activities of each of UNAIDS\u2019 cosponsors.", "UNAIDS\u2019 major donors, U.S. government officials, cosponsor officials, and others credit UNAIDS, especially the Secretariat, with contributing to the national and international communities\u2019 increased awareness of and commitment to the fight against HIV/AIDS.  They also credit UNAIDS and the Secretariat with helping to reframe HIV/AIDS as an issue involving all sectors rather than an issue involving only the health sector. Many national governments around the world were slow to respond to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, even those in the most affected areas in sub-Saharan Africa. In response, UNAIDS\u2019 Executive Director visited 21 developing countries in 1999 and 2000, including 14 African countries. In those countries, the Executive Director stressed the importance of mobilizing efforts to combat HIV/AIDS and taking a multisectoral approach to the countries\u2019 presidents and other high-level national leaders. For example, UNAIDS\u2019 Executive Director met with the Prime Minister of Ethiopia in September 1999 to advocate for a high-level, expanded, and multisectoral response. In April 2000, the President of Ethiopia launched the National Council on AIDS, supported by a National Secretariat in the Office of the Prime Minister and composed of multisectoral subcommittees. With assistance from the Secretariat and the World Bank, some countries are incorporating responses to HIV/AIDS into their country\u2019s long-term multisectoral development plans.", "UNAIDS also has worked with the international community, including the private sector, to broaden and increase efforts to combat HIV/AIDS. In December 2000, the Secretariat, several cosponsors, and the Japanese government collaborated to develop detailed strategies, goals, and targets for the Group of Eight\u2019s plan to address HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases. In addition, in September 2000, the Secretariat, WHO, and the European Commission conducted a high-level meeting to explore additional multisectoral actions that the European Union could take against poverty and communicable diseases such as HIV. UNAIDS also worked to get the private sector more involved in international efforts to combat HIV/AIDS. The Secretariat and the World Bank, together with USAID and several U.S. foundations, convened 15 major U.S. foundations in January 2000 and presented data on the foundations\u2019 limited expenditures on HIV/AIDS. According to the Secretariat, the foundations subsequently committed to providing more funding. In April 2000, one attendee the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation--announced a $57 million grant to expand national HIV/AIDS programs for youth in Botswana, Ghana, Uganda, and Tanzania. The Secretariat also has helped cultivate the involvement of the U.N. Foundation in global efforts against HIV/AIDS. Since 1998, the U.N. Foundation has allocated at least $25 million for HIV/AIDS-related activities implemented by UNAIDS\u2019 cosponsors in southern Africa and Ukraine."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.N. and Bilateral Donor Funding for HIV/AIDS Has Increased", "paragraphs": ["Cosponsors reported that estimated spending for HIV/AIDS programs has increased significantly in the past 2 years. However, most of the increased spending came from the World Bank, which provides loans to national governments for specific HIV/AIDS-related projects. Bilateral donor funding increased slightly in 1998 over previous years, but funding has increased considerably among some donors since then. Despite these efforts, total funding for HIV/AIDS efforts is well below what experts estimate is needed to effectively combat HIV/AIDS around the world.", "Table 1 shows estimated spending for HIV/AIDS by UNAIDS\u2019 cosponsors from 1996 to 1999. Overall, UNAIDS\u2019 cosponsors have increased spending for HIV/AIDS programs and activities from $296.9 million in the 1996-1997 biennium to $658.1 million in the 1998-1999 biennium. Most of this increase (96 percent) came from the World Bank. Four other cosponsors increased spending for HIV/AIDS-related activities, although some did so only slightly. The U.N. Development Programme decreased its spending for HIV/AIDS.", "Cosponsor officials cited several reasons that affected their ability to increase HIV/AIDS spending. First, several cosponsors\u2019 budgets have either declined or remained stable over the past few years. For example, the U.N. Population Fund\u2019s overall budget declined from $628.7 million in the 1996-1997 biennium to $581.7 million in the 1998-1999 biennium. Second, earmarked funds for activities other than HIV/AIDS have increased. For example, although the U.N. Development Programme\u2019s overall agency budget has increased from $4.3 billion in the 1996-1997 biennium to $4.8 billion in the 1998-1999 biennium, the percentage of its budget that was earmarked for specific efforts increased from 62 percent to 70 percent. Finally, the strength of the U.S. dollar has led to poor exchange rates with other countries, reducing the value of bilateral donor contributions to overall agency budgets. For example, according to U.N. Population Fund officials, some bilateral donors made substantial increases in contributions to the agency from 1999 to 2000, but these increases were neutralized by the exchange rate.", "According to the UNAIDS Secretariat, while bilateral donors maintained their spending for HIV/AIDS in 1996 and 1997 at $273 million each year, funding increased slightly in 1998 to $293 million. As of May 2001, the Secretariat could not provide us with more current data, but evidence from specific countries suggests that funding has increased further. For example, the United States committed approximately $466 million in 2001 compared with the $293 million spent by all bilateral donors, including the United States, in 1998. Canada announced in June 2000 that, over the next 3 years, it would increase its international HIV/AIDS spending from $20 million to $60 million per year. According to the Secretariat, most major bilateral donors have increased their HIV/AIDS funding for Africa since 2000. However, these increases are much less than the minimum of $3 billion that UNAIDS estimates may be needed annually for basic HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care in the sub-Saharan Africa region alone. The U.N. Secretary-General is currently advocating for the creation and funding of a global AIDS fund that would support HIV/AIDS activities in developing countries. The U.S. Administration pledged $200 million to the fund in May 2001."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "UNAIDS\u2019 Country-Level Efforts Need Strengthening", "paragraphs": ["One of UNAIDS\u2019 primary functions is to strengthen host nations\u2019 capacities to plan, coordinate, implement, and monitor the overall response to HIV/AIDS.

The performance of UNAIDS\u2019 theme groups varies widely, and their overall performance in facilitating the U.N. response at the country level and in providing effective assistance to host countries\u2019 efforts to combat HIV/AIDS has been weak.

However, overall theme group performance varies considerably. For example, in surveying 36 USAID missions worldwide, we asked about the extent to which the theme groups were strengthening the overall national government response to HIV/AIDS. Of the 24 missions responding, 8 said to a very or great extent, 7 said to a moderate extent, and 9 said to some, little, or no extent. In addition, UNAIDS\u2019 annual surveys of its theme groups from 1996-1999 indicate that they have made little progress in key areas, including developing an advocacy plan, mobilizing resources, and developing a U.N. system integrated plan on HIV/AIDS.", "According to the UNAIDS Secretariat, theme groups are expected to develop joint advocacy action plans to plan and manage joint advocacy work on HIV/AIDS and to clarify what the theme group is advocating and by whom and how.

In 1999, 37 percent of theme groups had developed an advocacy plan or strategy.", "Since UNAIDS is not a funding agency, mobilizing resources to support country-level efforts against the epidemic is another key role of the theme group. According to UNAIDS, in 1997, under one-half of UNAIDS\u2019 theme groups were mobilizing resources for HIV/AIDS activities, a figure that increased to about one-half in 1999. Most resource mobilization efforts were ad hoc, with only one-quarter of theme groups having developed a systematic approach to resource mobilization as expected.", "According to the UNAIDS Secretariat, a U.N. system integrated plan on HIV/AIDS is the basis for coordinated U.N. support to the national response and is the single most valuable indicator of the U.N.\u2019s commitment at the country level. However, according to UNAIDS, as of February 2000, only 18 out of 86 theme groups surveyed had completed an integrated plan and one-half had yet to take any steps to begin the process of completing one.", "In 1998, we found that UNAIDS\u2019 theme groups were ineffective for a number of reasons. The UNAIDS Secretariat did not provide timely guidance about operations or responsibilities. In addition, UNAIDS\u2019 cosponsor staff at the country level were not committed to the UNAIDS mandate, nor were they held accountable by their respective agencies for their participation in the theme groups or for the theme groups\u2019 results in supporting national HIV/AIDS efforts.", "In our most recent work, we found that some of the cosponsors and the Secretariat still do not hold theme group members accountable for results. For example, while the Director-General of WHO directed their country directors to participate in theme groups, WHO does not assess their involvement as part of their annual performance review. Neither the World Bank nor the U.N. International Drug Control Programme requires theme group involvement or includes it as a required element in annual performance reviews of senior country-level staff.  The UNAIDS Secretariat also does not hold theme groups accountable for results. While the Secretariat has no organizational authority over the cosponsors\u2019 country-level representatives, the theme groups are expected to undertake a number of activities, including developing advocacy and resource mobilization plans.

These intercountry teams\u2014 locate in Abidjan, Cote d\u2019Ivoire (western and central Africa); Pretoria, South Africa (eastern and southern Africa); and Bangkok, Thailand (Asia and the Pacific)\u2014are expected to facilitate existing intercountry initiatives or networks and develop new mechanisms of exchange and collaboration; help arrange for technical assistance from other organizations, universities, and private consultants; and mobilize additional resources for subregional HIV/AIDS efforts. To help determine whether these teams were meeting their objectives, the Secretariat commissioned an evaluation of the Inter-country Team for Western and Central Africa, published in January 2001, which assessed the team\u2019s relevance, effectiveness, and efficiency. The evaluation found that the team was very useful in exchanging and disseminating information, but that it was less successful in arranging for technical assistance.", "UNAIDS\u2019 best practice collection includes a series of technical updates, key materials, and case studies that provide strategies and approaches to prevent infection, provide care to those already infected, and alleviate the impact of HIV/AIDS on those affected. Topics include improving the safety of blood products, caring for individuals infected by HIV and tuberculosis, and increasing access to HIV-related drugs. In 1998, we reported that these materials were too general and lacked \u201chow-to\u201d guidance. In 1999, the Secretariat commissioned an independent evaluation of the effectiveness, relevance, and efficiency of the best practice materials. The review surveyed 164 users who considered the best practice materials to be authoritative, high quality, user friendly, and comprehensive in coverage. However, the review concluded that the Secretariat should develop materials more suited to local circumstances. Some steps have been taken to increase local specificity in best practice materials. The UNAIDS Secretariat has worked with some countries, such as Brazil, to develop best practices that focus on successful approaches and activities taken by organizations in that country. The review also concluded that the distribution of the materials should be improved. The review found, for example, that the Country Programme Advisors\u2014the Secretariat\u2019s country-based staff\u2014had not systematically distributed the materials and may not have been sufficiently aware of their responsibilities in this regard.

According to UNAIDS\u2019 2000 donor survey, donors believe that the Secretariat has done well in tracking the pandemic. For example, the Secretariat and WHO participate in the UNAIDS/WHO Working Group on Global HIV/AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Infection Surveillance to compile the best epidemiological information available. From this data, the Secretariat calculates national HIV infection rates, which are helpful in raising awareness about the spread of the virus and in stimulating action. The working group also established the Reference Group on HIV/AIDS Estimates, Modeling and Projections, which, according to UNAIDS, has helped set clearer international standards for assessing AIDS and its impact and is expected to improve the production of country-specific estimates of HIV prevalence. However, according to the Secretariat, efforts still need to be increased to support HIV surveillance activities at the country level.  The Secretariat also noted that WHO has taken steps to increase its efforts in this area.", "The UNAIDS Secretariat is also expected to track national and international responses to the pandemic. Various problems, however, have hindered its efforts in this area. To track funding, the Secretariat conducted a study with Harvard University in 1996 and then with the Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute\u2019s Resource Flows Project in 1999 to obtain data on HIV/AIDS spending by major bilateral donors, the United Nations, and developing countries. According to the Secretariat, getting these entities to report data to the contractor has been a major challenge, as has been reaching consensus on what counts as an HIV/AIDS project or activity. In addition, developing countries do not systematically track HIV/AIDS spending. To improve the monitoring and tracking of international and national resource flows, the Secretariat has established a specific unit with devoted staff resources. The Secretariat also has been developing and implementing the Country Response Information System since 2000. This database is intended to facilitate the compilation, analysis, and dissemination of relevant information by country on HIV epidemics and HIV/AIDS-related programs and activities by all relevant in-country partners.

UNAIDS' governing board approved a plan in December 1998 that consisted of multiple elements, including a draft conceptual framework, theme group surveys, and one-time evaluations of several of the Secretariat\u2019s specific functions, such as the best practice collection.  Since then, a unified budget and workplan with performance indicators was added. Key elements of the overall plan\u2014the conceptual framework and the unified budget and workplan\u2014need to be improved. Furthermore, despite these evaluative efforts, UNAIDS still cannot measure progress towards achieving its objectives or overall results, especially at the country level.", "Although the United Nations is not required to comply with the U.S. Government Performance and Results Act, we used the principles laid out in the act to identify the elements of a successful performance-based system. These include (1) a clearly defined mission, (2) establishment of long-term strategic and annual goals, (3) measurement of performance against the goals, and (4) public reporting of results. The act seeks to link resources and performance so that an organization can show what it has accomplished compared with the money it has spent and so that it can be held accountable for the levels of performance achieved.", "Using the Results Act as a guide, we identified four major weaknesses in UNAIDS\u2019 Monitoring and Evaluation Framework. First, the Framework primarily addresses the Secretariat\u2019s outputs even though the Framework\u2019s outcomes and impacts also apply to the cosponsors. Second, because the Framework\u2019s outputs focus on the Secretariat, which acts primarily at the global level, the Framework does not sufficiently address UNAIDS\u2019 performance at the country level. Third, the Framework\u2019s outputs, outcomes, and impacts are not clearly linked, making it difficult to assess the cause and effect of UNAIDS\u2019 specific activities. Fourth, the Framework does not establish specific performance baselines, targets, or other quantitative measures that could help UNAIDS measure overall results and progress towards achieving its objectives or expected outcomes.", "UNAIDS\u2019 Unified Budget and Workplan 2000-2001, a separate performance-related instrument, provides additional documentation that compensates for some of the shortcomings of the monitoring and evaluation framework. For example, the Workplan provides UNAIDS\u2019 mission statement, goals, and the strategic objectives leading to those goals. It also provides information on the Secretariat\u2019s and cosponsors\u2019 global and regional activities; includes more specific linkages between outputs, indicators, and objectives; and better accounts for the respective roles and responsibilities of the Secretariat and cosponsors. However, the Workplan also has a number of weaknesses. For example, the Workplan does not include quantifiable performance targets that would define success and help UNAIDS to measure its progress. The Workplan also does not always indicate what is needed to accomplish the stated objectives. For example, one objective is to \u201cmobilize political and public support for UNAIDS\u2019 priority themes and initiatives and to provide leadership and guidance in advocacy, public information, and resource mobilization efforts.\u201d The only output for this objective\u2014communication activities\u2014is vague. Furthermore, like the Framework, the Workplan does not always sufficiently link its components, making it difficult to assess the cause and effect of UNAIDS\u2019 actions.", "Senior Secretariat officials acknowledge that the Unified Budget and Workplan 2000-2001 has deficiencies. They said that it was the first document of its kind, compiled quickly, and did not have high-quality indicators. In addition, because it is organized thematically rather than functionally, they said it is difficult to track or assess UNAIDS\u2019 progress in achieving its overall objectives. They also said that developing a performance-based plan with quality indicators has been especially challenging because the U.N. system lacks an evaluative culture. However, they believe the Unified Budget and Workplan 2000-2001 is an important first step.", "UNAIDS Secretariat officials said that evaluation efforts overall have been hampered by inadequate and inconsistent resources. Changes in personnel and reliance on consultants over the past several years have resulted in a lack of continuity and variable levels of effort. It was not until early 1998 that a staff person was hired to lead a performance evaluation unit. The unit is currently authorized three full-time professional staff and is supplemented periodically by staff on part-time loan from other agencies.

UNAIDS was established to be the primary advocate for global action on HIV/AIDS and has advantages over other organizations, such as bilateral donor agencies, that combat HIV/AIDS. For example, as a U.N. organization, UNAIDS may have more credibility than other organizations, and thus be more effective, because it is seen as a neutral entity that does not represent any one government. In addition, UNAIDS often has access to higher-level government officials than do bilateral development agencies, and it sometimes operates in countries where bilateral agencies and other organizations do not because of conflict, political tension, or lack of compelling interest. However, UNAIDS\u2019 broad mission, organizational structure, initial lack of a political mandate, and a lack of timely follow-through have hampered its progress.", "While UNAIDS has a broad and challenging mission, its progress depends on actions taken by other entities, such as international donors, nongovernmental organizations, the private sector, and national governments. National government leadership on HIV/AIDS is particularly essential to an effective response to HIV/AIDS, but many national governments around the world have been slow to respond to the crisis. For example, until 1999, the President of Zimbabwe denied that HIV/AIDS was a problem in his country; the government of India was similarly slow to respond. HIV/AIDS is also an extraordinarily complex disease for which there is no cure. Combating the pandemic requires a multisectoral approach that involves addressing the many medical, cultural, behavioral, economic, social, and political aspects that surround the virus and contribute to its impact.", "As a joint and cosponsored program, UNAIDS\u2019 structure is complicated and progress depends heavily on the collegiality, cooperation, and consensus of the Secretariat and seven cosponsors. According to UNAIDS and U.S. government officials, these qualities were not evident during UNAIDS\u2019 first several years. They noted that, even though UNAIDS is a joint program, it was created without the buy-in of the cosponsors. According to senior Secretariat and cosponsor officials, because UNAIDS was imposed on the cosponsors, there was a certain amount of hostility within the program. Furthermore, the cosponsors viewed the Secretariat as competing for funding and were confused about their role within the joint program. As a result, until recently, cosponsors were not fully committed either to incorporating HIV/AIDS into their respective mandates or to participating in UNAIDS. Since each cosponsor is accountable only to its own independent executive board, neither the Secretariat nor UNAIDS\u2019 governing board had controlling organizational authority over the cosponsors. Thus, little could be done to exert pressure on the cosponsors to become effective partners within UNAIDS.", "UNAIDS\u2019 effectiveness was further hampered, according to U.S. government officials, because it was created without the necessary political mandate or funding from the major bilateral donors or the United Nations. According to a senior Secretariat official, the bilateral donors heavily influenced the creation of UNAIDS; however, when political pressure was needed to intensify and fund UNAIDS\u2019 cosponsors\u2019 HIV/AIDS programs, bilateral donors provided little assistance. In addition, according to U.S. officials, the United Nations, particularly the Secretary- General, had other priorities on which to focus. The bilateral donors and the United Nations are beginning to provide needed political and financial support. For example, in January 2000, the U.N. Security Council held a session, in part due to U.S. influence, to address the impact of AIDS on global peace and security\u2014the first session ever held on a health-related matter.", "Finally, according to U.S. officials, while UNAIDS initiates many activities, it does not always execute them in a timely way, further delaying an effective response. For example, according to USAID officials, UNAIDS has initiated various regional strategies to address HIV/AIDS, such as the International Partnership Against AIDS in Africa and the Eastern European Regional Strategy, but did not facilitate timely efforts to move these agreements forward.

Because there was no precedent, UNAIDS had to learn to function effectively, depending heavily on the collegiality and cooperation of the Secretariat and seven cosponsors. Despite these challenges, UNAIDS has made progress in many areas, especially in improving U.N. coordination and advocating for an enhanced global response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. However, while UNAIDS\u2019 cosponsors have recently intensified their commitment and efforts to integrate HIV/AIDS into their strategies and programs, their slow response has made it more difficult for UNAIDS to achieve its mission.", "UNAIDS has not lived up to expectations with regard to its efforts at the country level. Overall, UNAIDS\u2019 Secretariat and cosponsors\u2019 representatives in developing countries continue to have difficulty organizing their efforts and providing assistance to host governments and others, and UNAIDS does not hold them accountable for results. Some cosponsors still do not require their senior country-level representatives to actively participate in theme groups or have not established performance expectations related to theme group activities. In addition, while the Secretariat surveys theme group activities annually, oversight is limited because it does not focus on results. Five years after its creation, the Secretariat has yet to implement a monitoring and evaluation plan that would enable UNAIDS to determine the important results of its overall efforts and measure progress toward achieving its objectives. A quality performance evaluation plan is critical to assure UNAIDS\u2019 donors and others in the international community that UNAIDS is using its resources productively, that it is relevant, and that it is achieving its mission, especially at the country level.

The Partnership is made up of African governments, the U.N., donors, the private sector, and the community sector. The objective of the Partnership is to increase coordination among the five partners and to expand their efforts against HIV/AIDS in each African country. To achieve this objective, the Partnership aims to establish and maintain processes through which these groups can collaborate more effectively at the country level to curtail the spread of HIV and sharply reduce AIDS\u2019 impact on human suffering and declines in human, social, and economic development. The vision of the Partnership is that African nations with the support of the international community will implement and sustain larger-scale, more effective multisectoral national responses to HIV/AIDS within the next decade than they have in the past.", "According to the Partnership\u2019s guiding document, The International Partnership Against AIDS in Africa: A Framework for Action, dated May 2000, each partner has a specific role to play. African governments are expected to provide national leadership and adequate resources to fight HIV/AIDS in their respective countries. U.N. organizations are expected to enhance U.N. coordination and the global response and to provide program and financial support. Donors are expected to mobilize national and international efforts and to provide the necessary financial assistance to support the Partnership\u2019s actions to address HIV/AIDS. The private sector is expected to provide expertise and resources, and the community sector is expected to enhance local ownership of the Partnership. In addition, all partners have a role in advocacy, policy development, and resource mobilization. The UNAIDS Secretariat facilitated the development of the Partnership\u2019s framework and is responsible for coordinating the implementation of the Partnership. The Secretariat is not responsible for providing funding to the Partnership.", "According to the UNAIDS Secretariat, the Partnership has achieved many of its milestones and has made some progress toward achieving its objectives. For example, one of the Partnership\u2019s milestones was that, by the end of 2000, at least 12 countries were to have developed national strategic plans for HIV/AIDS, and according to the Secretariat, a total of 13 countries had achieved this goal. For example, the Partnership helped develop the National Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS in Ghana and Burkina Faso and helped revise the national strategic plans of Ethiopia, Malawi, Zambia, and Mozambique. According to the Secretariat, these plans have resulted in the formation of wider and more effective partnerships to combat HIV/AIDS and have encouraged increased internal and external mobilization of financial resources. Also, the UNAIDS\u2019 intercountry team in eastern and southern Africa helped establish technical networks on five subjects, including traditional medicine and AIDS counseling, and the intercountry team in Abidjan, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, helped establish networks on three subjects, as expected, by December 2000. According to the Secretariat, progress is still being made toward milestones that had not been met as of January 2001.", "However, several respondents to our survey of U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) missions expressed reservations about whether HIV/AIDS-related events occurring in the country could be directly attributed to the Partnership, since the Partnership is an enhancement of UNAIDS\u2019 and other partners\u2019 ongoing efforts in Africa. For example, USAID officials in Malawi stated that the Partnership\u2019s collaborative principles have been implemented in that country since 1997, which was prior to the Partnership\u2019s inception. The Secretariat also gives the Partnership credit for increases in World Bank loans and bilateral funding that have been announced by several bilateral donor countries, including the United States, Sweden, Canada, Norway, and Japan. While these events may have coincided with the implementation of the Partnership, a true cause and effect relationship is difficult to establish.", "Officials from USAID and the cosponsors have said that there is confusion about the Partnership and concern about its implementation. USAID agency officials said that the Partnership is poorly implemented and that there is general confusion within their own and other agencies, especially about how the Partnership will be implemented in country. For example, they had recently spoken to one cosponsor\u2019s representative to UNAIDS who thought that the Partnership had ended. A member of the U.S. delegation to UNAIDS\u2019 governing board told us that the Partnership generally lacked coordination among the five partners. Several cosponsor officials also indicated that there was confusion about the Partnership. One cosponsor told us that the Partnership did not have much substance beyond its guiding document and that their country-level offices in sub- Saharan Africa may be unaware of the Partnership. Agency officials stated that the UNAIDS Secretariat needs to provide the Partnership with greater leadership.", "In our survey of USAID missions in African countries key partners in the Partnership\u2019s coordination efforts we asked whether the Partnership had achieved its objective to increase coordination among the five partners and expand their efforts against HIV/AIDS in Africa. Two of the 10 USAID/Africa missions that responded to this inquiry said that the Partnership had resulted in better coordination, 3 said it had not, and 5 did not know. Of those that did not know, the USAID mission in Kenya said that the Partnership was not well understood and that they had not heard much about it. We also asked whether the Partnership had resulted in an expanded response to HIV/AIDS. Of the 10 responding, 4 answered yes, 3 said no, and 3 did not know. The USAID mission in Ghana reported that the Partnership had contributed to increased media attention on HIV/AIDS and more programs addressing the epidemic. However, the USAID mission in Tanzania reported that the Partnership was duplicating existing national programs and hindering constructive efforts to combat HIV/AIDS in that country.", "One factor that may contribute to the confusion and lack of coordination among partners is that, while the framework identifies the partners, their responsibilities, and the deadlines of some objectives and activities, it does not identify who is responsible or accountable for initiating the Partnership at the country level or the actions that should be taken if this leadership is not forthcoming. For example, a respondent to our survey from the USAID mission in Zimbabwe said that no one person or organization is leading the Partnership at the country level and thus nothing is being accomplished. A senior Secretariat official agreed that the Secretariat has been weak in communicating effectively about the Partnership. However, according to this official, the Secretariat is in the process of developing additional guidance on coordination for country- level partners, which will be based on lessons learned by partners in several countries, such as Burkina Faso and Tanzania, that have task forces to lead coordination efforts.

In 1999, to help reduce mother-to- child transmission, 11 countries took part in a UNICEF-supported pilot program that offers voluntary and confidential counseling and testing to women and their partners, administers anti-retroviral medication to pregnant HIV-positive women, and provides information about infant feeding options.

UNAIDS commented that they disagreed with our use of a response from the donor survey to support our finding that their efforts at the country level were weak. The donor survey stated that half of the donors responding (the survey was sent to 16 of UNAIDS\u2019 leading bilateral donors, and 12 responded) believed that UNAIDS was not as successful as expected in promoting broad-based political and social commitment at the country level. We did not rely solely on the donor survey; other evidence corroborates the donor\u2019s concern about UNAIDS\u2019 performance at the country level. First, the donor survey also found that donors believed that UNAIDS had not been as successful as they expected in strengthening governments\u2019 HIV/AIDS activities and ensuring that appropriate and effective policies and strategies are implemented to address HIV/AIDS. Second, the Secretariat\u2019s latest annual surveys of theme groups showed that, between 1997 and 1999, theme groups had made little progress in key areas, such as joint advocacy action plans and developing a U. N. system integrated plan on HIV/AIDS.  Our December 2000 survey of USAID missions showed that, after 5 years of experience, theme groups' performance in strengthening the overall national government response to HIV/AIDS varied widely. Third, senior UNAIDS officials and members of the UNAIDS governing board stated in December 2000 that UNAIDS needed to improve its country-level response. The governing board said that the performance of UNAIDS\u2019 theme groups required urgent attention, and UNAIDS' Executive Director said that strengthening UNAIDS\u2019 country- level efforts is one of UNAIDS\u2019 top internal challenges. This collective evidence demonstrates that UNAIDS must strengthen its efforts at the country level. 2.  While UNAIDS agreed with our finding that country-level efforts need to be strengthened, it also commented that we placed too much emphasis on theme group efforts at the country level without considering broader U.N. systemwide efforts. We recognize that there are broader U.N. efforts, such as the Resident Coordinator System and the Common Country Assessment/United Nations Development Assistance Framework process. However, UNAIDS\u2019 documents state that UNAIDS\u2019 theme groups are its \u201cmain mechanism\u201d for coordinating HIV/AIDS activities at the country level. Our analysis therefore focused on this mechanism. 3.  UNAIDS commented that we did not credit the U.N. Development Programme for actions taken as a result of an HIV/AIDS program evaluation, prepared in 2000, which found that the agency had not fully integrated HIV/AIDS into its strategies, programs, and activities. We revised the report to include updated information on action taken in response to the evaluation. 4.  UNAIDS was concerned that we did not reflect the cosponsors\u2019 creation of new positions and units focused on HIV/AIDS and cited numerous examples of these changes. While we may not have cited every example of actions taken by the cosponsors, we did recognize that some cosponsors had elevated the position of the HIV/AIDS issue organizationally and provided an example. We revised the report to include an additional example of steps taken by the U.N. Children\u2019s Fund. 5.  UNAIDS commented that, while they agreed that country-level coordination and implementation needs strengthening, we had downplayed how much progress the United Nations has achieved in coordinating action at the country level. UNAIDS stated that we did not sufficiently credit them for the Global Strategy Framework, regional strategy development processes, partner programme reviews, improved cosponsor responses to HIV/AIDS, and a greater understanding of the epidemic at the country level. UNAIDS comments also provided additional examples of activities they believed contributed to an enhanced country- level response. We disagree that we downplayed UNAIDS\u2019 efforts. For example, our report credits UNAIDS for facilitating the development of U.N. System Strategic Plan and conducting the detailed reviews of the cosponsors\u2019 HIV/AIDS programs (Partner Programme Reviews), as well as for the cosponsors\u2019 improved commitment and response to HIV/AIDS. The report does not discuss the Global Strategy Framework on HIV/AIDS because it has only recently been finalized and thus it is too soon to gauge whether this document will increase international commitment, action, or results. Also, in the absence of an effective monitoring and evaluation plan that has clear performance indicators, it is difficult to isolate UNAIDS contributions from those of the many entities working at the country level to combat HIV/AIDS, including national governments, bilateral donors, nongovernmental organizations, and foundations. 6.  UNAIDS stated that we characterized theme group responsibilities too broadly and that it was never envisioned that U.N. theme groups would serve as an operational entity or as the primary mechanism for assisting developing countries. Our report clearly explains the role of the theme groups in the background section and elsewhere as, among other things, a facilitator for coordinating the U.N. response at the country level. This characterization came from UNAIDS documents that state: \u201cIn developing countries, UNAIDS operates mainly through the country-based staff of its seven cosponsors. Meeting as the host country\u2019s U.N. Theme Group on HIV/AIDS, representatives of the cosponsoring organizations share information, plans and monitor coordinated action\u2026.\u201d 7.  UNAIDS commented that theme groups are not responsible for resource mobilization. However, UNAIDS provided us the Resource Guide for Theme Groups, which devotes one of its five sections to resource mobilization. This section states that \u201cresource mobilization at the country level is a key role of the Theme Group.\u201d To avoid any confusion, we modified the text. 8.  UNAIDS noted that our report lacked clarity with regard to the role of the Country Programme Advisor and the operation of the Programme Acceleration Funds. To avoid any confusion about the Country Programme Advisor\u2019s role, we modified the text.  The information we presented in the report on the operation of the Programme Acceleration Funds was taken directly from UNAIDS documents\u2014primarily the 1999 evaluation of the funding process. 9.  UNAIDS provided information on the additional number of integrated U.N. workplans that have been prepared, to demonstrate the progress theme groups have made in developing a more unified U.N. response to HIV/AIDS. However, we were not able to corroborate this information. In addition, while the information UNAIDS presented shows the number of workplans completed, it does not indicate the quality and content of the plans and the extent to which they have been implemented. 10. UNAIDS provided more current information on action taken to strengthen the performance of theme groups and Country Programme Advisors--the Secretariat\u2019s country-based staff. We revised the report to highlight some of these actions. 11. UNAIDS stated that the Unified Budget and Workplan 2000-2001 includes quantifiable performance targets. However, UNAIDS did not provide specific examples of such targets with its comments. In examining UNAIDS\u2019 Unified Budget and Workplan in detail during our review, we noted that it contained outcome indictors. However, the workplan did not identify specific performance baselines, targets, or other measures that would enable UNAIDS to determine whether it had succeeded in its efforts and measure progress toward its objectives. 12. UNAIDS commented that its overall monitoring and evaluation plan included several one-time evaluations of specific efforts, such as UNAIDS\u2019 development of best practices. We revised the report to clarify that UNAIDS considers these one-time evaluations part of its overall monitoring and evaluation plan. 13.  UNAIDS raised several concerns about the report\u2019s methodology and presentation.  First, UNAIDS commented that the report focused too much on the findings contained in our 1998 report and did not adequately credit UNAIDS for the progress it has made. We disagree. We believe we have given credit to UNAIDS for progress in a number of areas, several of which were of specific concern in our 1998 report. For example, the report highlights increased U.N. and international commitment and funding to HIV/AIDS efforts, as well as a broadened approach to addressing HIV/AIDS from one that was exclusively health oriented to one that is now multisectoral.  Further, the report notes the progress made on technical support and best practices, tracking the epidemic, and increasing U.N. coordination. However, our report also focused on those areas most needing improvement\u2014namely, UNAIDS\u2019 country-level efforts and monitoring and evaluation of UNAIDS\u2019 progress and results. These are areas that the Department of State, USAID, and UNAIDS agree need improvement. Where appropriate, we have modified our report and included some additional information.", "Second, UNAIDS commented that the report will be out of date by the time it is issued. We disagree.  The changing political climate surrounding HIV/AIDS issues does not negate the report\u2019s conclusions and recommendations. For example, UNAIDS\u2019 comments stated that not only did they agree that HIV/AIDS-related efforts at the country level need strengthening but that these efforts will certainly remain the central theme for \u201cat least the next decade.\u201d Furthermore, the current debate to establish a $7 billion to $10 billion global trust fund to address the HIV/AIDS crisis in developing countries makes the issues cited in our report even more timely and critical.  The challenges UNAIDS faced in mobilizing international support for HIV/AIDS efforts, marshalling donors\u2019 financial commitments, and establishing a system to evaluate program results are important lessons learned that should inform the current debate on a new global AIDS trust fund. UNAIDS\u2019 comments also noted that documentation used to support the report was largely constructed with data compiled from the previous year. We used the most current data supplied by UNAIDS and other information to conduct our analysis, including several of UNAIDS\u2019 and its governing board\u2019s commissioned evaluations. In addition, we conducted our own survey of USAID missions to obtain perspective on UNAIDS\u2019 country-level efforts in December 2000.", "Third, UNAIDS noted that the report contained selective quotations from several of UNAIDS\u2019 evaluations and surveys of specific functions, at the same time pointing out that UNAIDS\u2019 monitoring and evaluation efforts are insufficient. We believe our use of available data and information contained in UNAIDS\u2019 evaluations was appropriate for depicting the steps taken in and weaknesses of UNAIDS\u2019 efforts. However, while this information was useful, it does not provide the results of UNAIDS\u2019 overall efforts or progress made toward its objectives. With bilateral and other donors responding to UNAIDS\u2019 call for increased resources to combat HIV/AIDS, a quality monitoring and evaluation effort, which includes a clearly defined mission, long-term strategic and short-term goals, measurement of performance against defined goals, and public reporting of results, is even more important."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to Mr. Hutton, Leslie Bharadwaja, Sharon Caudle, Lynn Cothern, Francisco Enriquez, Aleta Hancock, Lynne Holloway, Stanley Kostyla, and Hector Wong made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
