Many factors\u2014including a large number of asymptomatic patients and patients with mild symptoms, and a lack of a consistent international case definition of Zika virus disease\u2014complicate understanding of the virus and may hinder responses to the current outbreak. For example, an estimated 80 percent of individuals infected with the Zika virus may not manifest clinical symptoms. As a result, incidence of the infection may be underestimated. Questions also remain regarding the strength of the association between Zika virus infection and two other conditions: microcephaly and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome.", "A lack of validated diagnostic tests, consistent international case definitions, and trend information may also contribute to difficulty in estimating the prevalence of the virus. The United States uses two diagnostic tests for Zika, and according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), while there are no commercially-available diagnostic tests for Zika, an antibody-based test for Zika virus was recently authorized for Emergency Use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Diagnosing Zika virus infection is also complicated because it is difficult to differentiate it from other similar diseases, such as dengue or yellow fever. For example, a person previously infected with dengue could be falsely identified as also having been exposed to the Zika virus (and vice-versa). Moreover, the World Health Organization has acknowledged the need for a consistent case definition\u2014that is, a set of uniform criteria to define the disease for public health surveillance and to determine who is included in the count and who is excluded. Additionally, a lack of pattern and trend data has made surveillance challenging.", "Because Zika virus disease cannot yet be prevented by drugs or vaccines, vector (mosquito) control remains a critical factor in preventing and mitigating the occurrence of this disease. There are three methods for mosquito control: (1) standing water treatment, (2) insecticides, and (3) emerging technologies. Mosquito control has been achieved in some locations by methods such as reducing or chemically-treating water sources where mosquitoes breed or mature, or by insecticide dispersal. Emerging technologies, including biological control methods\u2014such as infecting mosquitoes with bacteria\u2014 genetically-modified mosquitoes, and auto-dissemination traps, show some promise but are still in development and testing phases.", "The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the CDC have identified several high priority areas of research. Research priorities include basic research to understand viral replication, pathogenesis, and transmission, as well as the biology of the mosquito vectors; potential interactions with co-infections such as dengue and yellow fever viruses; linkages between Zika and the birth defect microcephaly; improving diagnostic tests; vaccine development; and novel vector control methods.

Infectious  diseases are a continuous threat for reasons that include: (1)  emergence\u2014at times rapid\u2014of new infectious diseases; (2) re- emergence of previously-known infectious diseases; and (3) persistence  of intractable infectious diseases. According to the National Institutes of  Health (NIH), infectious diseases continue to emerge and evolve.  Changes in human demographics, behavior and land use\u2014among other  factors\u2014bring people into closer and more frequent contact with  pathogens and are contributing to infectious disease emergence. This  may involve exposure to animal or insect carriers of disease. There is  also an increase in the opportunities for pathogens to jump between  animal and human reservoirs.

The  Zika virus is transmitted to people primarily through the bite of infected  Aedes species mosquitoes (primarily Aedes aegypti and possibly Aedes  albopictus). These are the same mosquitoes that spread dengue and  chikungunya viruses. These mosquitoes typically lay eggs in and near  standing water in containers like buckets, bowls, animal dishes, flower  pots, and vases. They prefer to bite people, and live both indoors and  outdoors. Mosquitoes that spread dengue, chikungunya, and Zika are  aggressive daytime biters, but also bite at night. Mosquitoes can become  infected when they feed on a person already infected with the virus.", "According to the CDC, the Zika virus is rarely transmitted from an infected  mother to child, and there have been no reports of infants contracting the  Zika virus through breastfeeding. It is possible but rare that an infected  mother would pass the virus to a newborn at delivery. However, an  infected mother can pass the Zika virus to her fetus during pregnancy.", "According to the CDC, it is possible for the Zika virus to be spread by a  man to his sexual partners. A few recent cases of Zika virus transmission  were reported through sexual contact. In December 2013, during a Zika  virus outbreak in French Polynesia, Zika was isolated from the semen of  a patient. In one known case of likely sexual transmission, the virus was  spread before symptoms developed. The virus appears to be present in  semen longer than in blood. Sexual transmission of the disease\u2014 acquired outside of the United States\u2014has been reported in the United  States. As of February 23, 2016, the CDC and state public health  departments are investigating 14 additional reports of possible sexual  transmission of the virus, including several involving pregnant women.", "Zika virus can also be transmitted through blood transfusion, according to  U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) documents. While there have  been no reports to date of Zika virus entering the U.S. blood supply, the  risk of blood transmission is considered high based on the most current  scientific research of how Zika virus and similar viruses (i.e. flaviviruses)  are spread, as well as recent reports of transfusion-associated infection  outside of the United States, according to the FDA. CDC reports that  there have been reports of possible blood transfusion transmission cases  in Brazil. During the French Polynesian outbreak in 2013, 2.8 percent of  blood donors tested positive for Zika. The maximum time the virus  remains in the bloodstream is unknown, but scientists estimate that it is  less than 28 days. On February 16, 2016, as a safety measure against  the emerging Zika virus outbreak, the FDA issued new guidance  recommending that blood donors be deferred for four weeks if they have  been to areas with active Zika virus transmission, potentially have been  exposed to the virus, or have had a confirmed Zika virus infection.", "While scientific studies have identified Zika viral components in saliva and  urine, they did not report disease transmission from those bodily fluids."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Questions Remain Regarding the Link between Zika Virus Infection and Neurological and Auto-Immune Disorders", "paragraphs": ["It is not currently known if infection with the Zika virus causes, facilitates,  or is otherwise associated with the development of certain neurologic and  auto-immune conditions.

First, because of the recent attention,  newborn babies with visible cranial deformities are likely to be fast- tracked for in-depth examination. This temporal increase in suspected  cases of microcephaly could also be distorted given both raised  awareness with more children than usual being measured and reported,  and the changing definition of microcephaly over time.

The current RT-PCR test  can detect infection only during the period of illness when the virus is  present. According to an NIH official, the PRNT diagnostic test is the most  specific for antibody detection, but is cumbersome and not suitable for  screening a large number of individuals.", "When detecting antibodies, diagnosing cases of Zika virus disease and  differentiating it from other diseases caused by other flaviviruses, such as  dengue or yellow fever, is difficult if someone has been infected by  another flavivirus. Some tests for Zika virus antibodies suffer from cross- reactivity with antibodies to similar viruses, such as from dengue virus  disease, meaning that tests using these antibodies for detection are not  specific for the Zika virus. For example, a person previously infected with  another flavivirus such as dengue could be falsely identified as also  having been exposed to the Zika virus (and vice-versa). In addition, new  outbreaks like Zika may not have known patterns or trends, making  effective surveillance challenging. For example, after the onset of illness,  Zika virus remains in the blood for about 5-7 days, according to the CDC.  After this period, called viremia, diagnosis of Zika virus disease at this  time relies on detection of antibodies against the Zika virus. Since  antibodies in the blood may persist longer than the virus, a positive result  for antibodies against the Zika virus indicates only that the patient was  previously exposed to the Zika virus. Thus, the window for detecting the  actual virus is small. It is not clear whether an antibody test could  determine how long ago the patient was exposed.", "According to the CDC, while there are no commercially-available  diagnostic tests for Zika, an antibody-based test for the Zika virus (Zika  MAC-ELISA) was recently authorized for Emergency Use by the FDA.  One of the main limitations of this test, among others, is its inability to  differentiate between infection with Zika and other closely related  flaviviruses such as dengue. This test in its current form may confuse the  practitioners because of its lack of specificity. Since closely related  flaviviruses such as dengue may also be present in Zika outbreak  countries, the utilization of this assay could wrongly identify non-Zika- virus associated infections, thus putting extra burden on the laboratory  and health care systems, and distort the epidemiological analyses.", "Adding to the limitations of these diagnostic systems are limited numbers  of facilities able to perform definitive confirmatory testing, particularly in  the developing world.

This notice was followed by a Funding Opportunity  Announcement issued on February 19th, 2016, to create an expedited  mechanism for funding exploratory and developmental research projects  on these topics.", "The CDC has identified priority areas of research focus on Zika including:", "Determining the link between Zika virus infections and the birth defect  microcephaly and measuring changes in incidence rates of the birth  defect over time; Improving diagnostics for the Zika virus, including advanced methods  to refine tests and support advanced developments for vector control;  and", "Enhancing international capacity for virus surveillance, expanding  laboratory testing, and health care provider testing in countries at  highest risk of Zika virus outbreaks.", "These research activities are intended to supplement other activities for  response, readiness and surveillance.", "The priority research areas identified by NIH and CDC are ambitious and  agencies may face some challenges in implementing this agenda,  including:", "Given that there are few known cases in the United States, NIH and  CDC may have to rely on the cooperation of other countries with  sufficient number of cases in order to carry on the proposed research.  However, data from other countries may be different due to different  definitions of Zika virus disease and microcephaly.", "Demonstrating the link between the Zika virus and microcephaly may  depend not only on the presence of the virus, but also on  environmental and nutritional factors. In addition, shifting case  definitions and a lack of baseline data makes it difficult to determine  the increase, if any, in microcephaly and how much can be attributed  to the Zika virus.", "The presence of a high percentage of asymptomatic cases makes it  difficult to conduct epidemiological studies, both in identifying exposed  and unexposed individuals for case control studies.", "Prior infection or co-infection with another virus such as dengue may  complicate any analyses.", "NIH officials told us that prior work on similar viruses has allowed them to  make rapid progress on both a DNA-based vaccine (based on prior work  on West Nile Virus), and a live attenuated virus vaccine modeled after the  dengue virus vaccine that is currently in phase 3 clinical trials in Brazil.  NIH officials told us that prior \u201cplatform\u201d work on similar viruses has  expedited response to the Zika outbreak, and in the development of  diagnostic tests and vaccines.", "With regard to the dengue vaccine, NIH provided us with the following  timeline:  It has taken more than 16 years, and trials are not yet complete. NIH  officials told us that given their past experience with the development of  vaccine for dengue fever, a vaccine for Zika could be ready for use in an  emergency situation in three to four years, in the best case scenario.  However, when we asked NIH about this estimate, NIH stated that the  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases plans to begin a  Phase I clinical trial within this calendar year. If a candidate vaccine  shows promise in Phase I testing, additional clinical testing could begin by  2017 in countries where the disease is found, if the outbreak is still  ongoing. The progress of these additional tests, and whether they can  contribute to successful licensure, depends on a number of factors,  including scientific and technical progress, as well as the size of any  ongoing Zika outbreaks during clinical testing. For this reason, it is difficult  to provide an exact estimate for the time it will take to develop a Zika  vaccine from preclinical studies through clinical testing and licensure.", "Zika virus disease poses new challenges to vaccine development and  testing. This disease has specific and important implications for pregnant  women. There are substantial knowledge gaps in current understanding  of Zika, irrespective of the affected population. Since Zika virus disease is  associated with, and may cause, adverse fetal outcomes, pregnant  women are at particular risk and may benefit from measures such as  vaccines. There are several current scientific and structural barriers to  developing and testing vaccines for pregnant women. Overcoming  these barriers may extend timeframes for vaccine testing and approval.  The information we have from NIH and our prior work suggests that  development of a Zika virus vaccine may take longer than anticipated by  NIH."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix I: Related GAO Work", "paragraphs": ["Biosurveillance: Ongoing Challenges and Future Considerations for DHS  Biosurveillance Efforts.
