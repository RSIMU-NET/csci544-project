However, NRC and agreement states have not taken some measures to better control some dangerous quantities of radioactive materials. The International Atomic Energy Agency established a system ranking quantities of certain radioactive materials into five categories based on their potential to harm human health, with, in descending order of danger, categories 1, 2, and 3 all considered dangerous. NRC developed revised guidance, screening criteria, and a checklist, among other things, and now directs NRC regions and agreement states to conduct prelicensing site visits\u2014focusing on questions related to the applicant's business operations, facility, radiation safety operations, and personnel qualifications for all unknown applicants. NRC, however, has not strengthened controls for all categories of radioactive material considered dangerous. Unlike its process for applicants for category 1 and 2 quantities of radioactive materials, for category 3 applicants NRC does not review specific security measures before a license is issued. NRC has also developed and deployed the National Source Tracking System (NSTS), the Web-based Licensing System (WBL), and the License Verification System to better control some materials. However, these systems focus on more dangerous category 1 and 2 quantities but not category 3 quantities. Further, NRC does not specifically require that the validity of category 3 licenses be verified by the seller with NRC or the agreement states\u2014creating risks that licenses could be counterfeited or that licensees could obtain radioactive materials in quantities greater than what is allowed by their licenses.", "GAO's covert testing of NRC requirements showed them to be effective in two out of our three cases; in a third case, GAO was able to obtain a license and secure commitments to purchase, by accumulating multiple category 3 quantities of materials, a category 2 quantity of a radioactive material considered attractive for use in a \u201cdirty bomb\u201d\u2014which uses explosives to disperse radioactive material. To test NRC's prelicensing processes, GAO established three fictitious companies, leased vacant space for each company (two in agreement states, one in an NRC state), and submitted an application to the appropriate agreement state or NRC office for a license to possess a category 3 source only slightly below the threshold for category 2. GAO made no attempt to outfit the site to make it appear as if a legitimate business was operating there. In the two cases where GAO was unable to obtain a license, the scrutiny provided by NRC or agreement state (regulatory body) officials during the prelicensing site visit led to the license not being granted. In the third case, the official from the regulatory body accepted GAO's assurances without scrutinizing key aspects of the fictitious business, which led to a license being obtained. NRC is currently taking corrective actions to provide training to NRC and agreement state officials to emphasize greater scrutiny in conducting prelicensing site visits. According to NRC officials, NRC and agreement state working groups are currently developing and evaluating enhancements to (1) prelicensing guidance overall and (2) license verification and transfer requirements for category 3 licenses."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making three recommendations to NRC, including that NRC (1) take steps to include category 3 quantities of radioactive materials in NSTS and WBL, and (2) require that transferors of category 3 quantities of radioactive materials confirm the validity of licenses with regulators before selling or transferring these materials. GAO provided a draft of this report to NRC for comment. NRC neither agreed nor disagreed with GAO's recommendations, but noted that the agency has formal evaluations underway considering all three recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Radioactive materials are commonly used throughout the world for a  variety of purposes in medicine and the oil and gas, electric power,  construction, and food industries. Radioactive materials are frequently  sealed in a capsule or permanently bonded in solid form for use as sealed  sources in various devices. For example, devices containing radioactive  materials in sealed sources are used to diagnose and treat millions of  patients each year, sterilize medical instruments and food, and detect  flaws in the metal welds in pipelines. Since terrorists attacked the United  States in 2001, concerns have grown that terrorists could obtain and use  radioactive materials to build a \u201cdirty bomb\u201d\u2014a type of radiological  dispersal device (RDD) that uses conventional explosives to disperse  radioactive material. The consequences of detonating an RDD would  depend on the amount and type of radioactive material used and the size  and characteristics of the area in which the material was dispersed. In  many scenarios, an RDD would cause few deaths or injuries, but would  likely have significant economic effects because the affected area would  need to be decontaminated and people who live and work there might not  return to their homes or businesses for an extended period of time  because of actual or feared contamination.", "Until 2001, oversight of radioactive sealed sources in the United States  largely focused on ensuring that such sources were licensed as required  and used and stored safely. The Atomic Energy Act gives the Nuclear  Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulatory authority over domestic  industrial, medical, and research uses of radioactive materials. The act  also authorizes NRC to enter into agreements with states (called  agreement states) so they assume, and NRC relinquishes, regulatory  authority over specified radioactive materials. NRC and agreement  states license, monitor, track, and require security for radioactive  materials in order to protect both workers and the public from exposure to  hazardous levels of radiation generated by the activities of licensees. To  date, NRC has relinquished authority to 37 agreement states to grant  licenses to possess and use radioactive materials and sealed sources  and to conduct regular inspections of licensees. NRC retains its mandate  to regulate the use of radioactive materials in the remaining 13 states  (NRC states). Given their mandate to regulate the radioactive material  covered by their licenses, NRC and state regulators focused on the  dangers posed by day-to-day occupational exposure to radiation and the  direct health effects from industrial accidents.", "In the years after 2001, security concerns surrounding radioactive  materials received greater attention nationally and internationally. For  example, in May 2003, NRC and the Department of Energy (DOE)  identified several radionuclides\u2014particular types of radioactive  material\u2014that are most commonly used in the United States and that  pose the greatest risk of being used by terrorists to make an RDD. That  same year, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) published a  system that ranked quantities of individual radionuclides into one of five  categories on the basis of their potential to harm human health. Under  IAEA\u2019s system, a given radionuclide is considered dangerous when  gathered in close proximity to people in sufficient quantity to cause direct  human health effects. A category 1 quantity of a radionuclide, the most  dangerous, is defined as an amount 1,000 times or more than the amount  necessary to cause permanent human injury. A category 2 quantity is  defined as an amount at least 10 times, but less than 1,000 times, the  amount necessary to cause permanent human injury. A category 3  quantity of a given radionuclide is defined as at least the minimum  amount, but less than 10 times the amount sufficient to cause permanent  injury. Category 4 and 5 quantities of radioactive materials are unlikely to  cause permanent injury.", "In September 2003, the United States and other nations endorsed IAEA\u2019s  Code of Conduct that set forth basic principles and guidance to promote  the safe and secure use of radioactive sources containing dangerous  quantities of radioactive materials and that countries should take  appropriate measures to ensure that such radioactive sources are safely  managed and securely protected. The Code of Conduct applies to  category 1, 2, and 3 radioactive materials\u2014all of which are potentially  dangerous to human health and could, if not properly controlled, cause  permanent injuries or death to a person who handled or was otherwise in  contact with them. Category 1 and 2 quantities of radioactive sources  listed in the Code of Conduct are considered the highest risk and most  dangerous and have been the focus of federal and state efforts to place  tighter controls on their licensing and use. Specifically, NRC, working with  agreement states, issued security orders beginning in 2003 requiring  several additional security measures. Subsequently, NRC issued  increased control orders in 2005 to protect certain radionuclides from  theft, diversion, or other unauthorized access when they are gathered in  quantities at or above a particular threshold. According to NRC officials,  agreement states also issued legally binding requirements at the same  time that required their licensees to take the same actions required in the  NRC increased controls orders. Additional security measures include 24- hour surveillance, multiple layers of physical security, and measures to  request assistance from local law enforcement agencies in the event of  any actual or attempted breach in security. These additional security  requirements have been incorporated into NRC regulations, including 10  C.F.R. Part 37, Physical Protection of Category 1 and Category 2  Quantities of Radioactive Material. Part 37 was promulgated on March  19, 2013. According to NRC, its regional offices have fully implemented  this rule. According to NRC officials, all agreement states have fully  implemented compatible requirements to Part 37 as of March 19, 2016;  state licensees operated under orders or other legally binding  requirements in the interim.", "In addition, in 2005, Congress passed the Energy Policy Act (EPAct)  establishing a radiation source protection and security task force (Task  Force) to make recommendations relating to the security of radiation  sources in the United States from potential terrorist threats. The EPAct  requires that at least once every 4 years, the Task Force submit to  Congress and the President a report providing its recommendations,  including possible legislative and regulatory changes on a variety of  topics that include the protection and security of radiation sources.  Accordingly, in 2007, the Task Force directed the Radiation Sources  Subgroup to reevaluate the list of radioactive sources that warrant  enhanced security and protection, among other things. In 2009, the  subgroup found that the IAEA Code of Conduct category 1 and 2  quantities for sealed and unsealed radiological sources remained valid as  these could result in a significant RDD event and therefore warrant  enhanced security and protection.", "We first reported that there were potential weaknesses in NRC and  agreement state licensing processes in 2003, and we made  recommendations to correct the problems at that time. By 2006, NRC  and agreement states had taken steps to improve their licensing  processes, and we later found that NRC had implemented three of our  recommendations to address weaknesses in NRC and agreement state  licensing processes made in GAO\u2019s 2003 report. In 2007, however, a  GAO covert vulnerability testing effort revealed that weaknesses  persisted as GAO investigators, after setting up a fictitious company,  were able to obtain a genuine NRC license and then alter it to obtain  agreements to purchase devices containing, in aggregate, a dangerous  (category 3) quantity of radioactive materials. In 2008, we found that  NRC had worked with the agreement states and others to (1) identify  sealed sources of greatest concern, (2) enhance requirements to secure  radioactive sources, and (3) ensure that security requirements were  implemented. In addition, we found that NRC had made progress toward  implementing recommendations to (1) modify its process for issuing  licenses to ensure that radioactive materials cannot be purchased by  those with no legitimate need for them and (2) examine whether certain  radioactive sources should be subject to more stringent regulations. Our  2008 work also found that NRC could do more to ensure the security of  radioactive materials. Specifically, we recommended that among other  things NRC take steps to develop and implement the systems it was then  planning to better track, secure, and control radioactive materials.", "This report provides our first review of NRC and agreement state  materials licensing programs since our 2007 covert vulnerability testing  and our 2008 report.

This report (1) examines what steps NRC and agreement states have  taken since 2007 to ensure that radioactive materials licenses are granted  only to legitimate organizations, and licensees can obtain materials only  in quantities allowed by their licenses, and (2) presents the results of our  covert vulnerability testing designed to test the effectiveness of these  controls.", "In conducting our work, we reviewed planning documents,  memorandums, and analyses of orders describing changes NRC made to  its licensing process since 2007. We also reviewed regulations, guidance  documents, and directives describing NRC and agreement states\u2019  licensing processes. To examine what steps NRC and agreement states  have taken since 2007 to ensure that radioactive materials licenses are  granted only to legitimate organizations, and that licensees can obtain  such materials only in quantities allowed by their licenses, we reviewed  GAO reports as well as reports and recommendations made by the  Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, the Independent  External Review Panel, the Materials Program Working Group, as well  as the radiation source protection and security task force. We also  examined NRC documents on the use of NRC\u2019s key data systems\u2014the  National Source Tracking System, Web-based Licensing System, and  License Verification System. Finally, we gathered testimonial evidence  through telephone and in-person interviews with NRC officials in  headquarters and regional offices, Organization of Agreement States  (OAS) officials, and officials from a nonprobability sample of agreement  states selected on the basis of an Integrated Materials Performance  Evaluation Program (IMPEP) review and periodic meeting findings,  number of licenses issued by the state, and geographic diversity. We also  obtained written responses to some of our questions from NRC officials.  We also reviewed documents describing NRC\u2019s IMPEP and IMPEP  policy, guidance, and criteria, including NRC management directives and  regulatory guides, and IMPEP reports that document NRC\u2019s reviews of  agreement states and NRC regional offices\u2019 radioactive materials  licensing programs. In addition, we reviewed a 2009 report by NRC\u2019s  Office of Inspector General that revealed weaknesses in IMPEP. We  obtained documents from NRC and agreement states that describe  measures taken to ensure compliance with guidance, rules, orders, and  other criteria outside of IMPEP reviews, including periodic self- assessments and other supplemental oversight processes.", "Finally, we tested the effectiveness of these controls through the use of  covert investigative techniques. Specifically, we established fictitious  businesses and applied for radioactive materials licenses in three  states\u2014two agreement states and one NRC state. In all three states, we  leased vacant space in an industrial or office park. We used these spaces  as the physical addresses of fictitious businesses, and these locations  were later the subject of prelicensing site visits by agreement state or  NRC officials as part their prelicensing reviews of our applications. We  selected these states based on a nongeneralizable sampling strategy  focusing on states with a history of issuing the largest numbers of  radioactive materials licenses for the type of devices we sought for our  fictitious businesses, and in one case, a state that was also known to  have a history of weaknesses in its radioactive materials regulatory  program.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2014 to July 2016 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

The different types of radiation\u2014including alpha, beta,  gamma, and neutron\u2014vary in how easy or difficult they are to block or  shield, which, in turn, affects the health threat posed by a particular type  of radiation. Depending on the radioactive material\u2019s intensity and the  length and manner of exposure to it, health effects range from death, to  severe injury, to the development of cancer, to no discernable damage.  For example, alpha radiation poses little threat to human health from  external exposure, but poses considerable health risks if inhaled or  ingested. Gamma radiation is more penetrating and, if not properly  shielded, can cause injury or death through external exposure. Neutron  radiation, like gamma radiation, if not shielded, can also cause injury or  death through external exposure. Although sources of neutron radiation  are less common, neutron radiation is emitted from some materials that  are used to make nuclear weapons.", "NRC oversees licensees of radiological material through three regional  offices located in Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Texas; radiological material  licensing responsibilities for the region II office in Georgia are handled by  the region I office in Pennsylvania. NRC has relinquished regulatory  authority for licensing and regulating certain radioactive material to 37  states that have entered into an agreement with NRC (agreement  states). Figure 1 shows which states are agreement states and in which  states NRC has maintained all regulatory authority (NRC states).", "NRC and agreement states issue two types of licenses authorizing the  possession and use of radioactive materials: specific licenses and  general licenses. Specific licenses, which are the focus of this report, are  issued for devices that contain relatively larger sealed radioactive  sources. These devices, such as medical equipment used to treat cancer,  cameras used for industrial radiography, and moisture and density  gauges used in construction, generally require training to be used safely  and may also need to be properly secured to avoid misuse. An  organization or individual seeking to obtain a specific license must submit  an application and gain the approval of either NRC or the appropriate  agreement state prior to receiving and using licensed radioactive  materials. According to NRC, of the approximately 21,000 specific  radioactive materials licenses in the United States, NRC administers  about 2,900, and agreement states administer the rest.", "Our prior work on security of radioactive materials found that NRC could  do more to ensure the security of these materials. Specifically, we  recommended in 2008 that among other things NRC take steps to  develop and implement the systems it was then planning to better track,  secure, and control radioactive materials. These systems are the National  Source Tracking System (NSTS), the Web-based Licensing System  (WBL), and the License Verification System (LVS).", "NSTS, deployed in January 2009, tracks category 1 and 2 sources of the  20 radionuclides that NRC determined are sufficiently attractive for use in  an RDD or for other malicious purposes and warrant national tracking.  NSTS is a transaction-based system that tracks each major step that  each tracked radioactive source takes within the United States from  \u201ccradle to grave.\u201d Licensees are responsible for reporting the  manufacture, shipment, arrival, disassembly, and disposal of all nationally  tracked sources. A nationally tracked source is a source containing a  category 1 or 2 quantity of certain radioactive materials specified in  NRC\u2019s regulations. More specifically, NSTS includes the radionuclide,  quantity (activity), manufacturer, manufacture date, model number,  serial number, and site address. The licensee has until the close of the  next business day after a transaction\u2014such as the sale of a source from  a vendor to a customer\u2014takes place to enter it into the system.

WBL also includes pdf images of all paper copies of  category 1 and 2 licenses for both NRC and agreement state licensees.  NRC also developed a third system\u2014LVS, deployed in May 2013\u2014which  draws on the information in NSTS and WBL and provides information to  regulators and vendors and other would-be transferors on whether those  applicants seeking to acquire category 1 and 2 sources are legitimately  licensed to do so. This is particularly important because paper licenses  issued by NRC and agreement states can be altered or counterfeited.  LVS provides a means to mitigate the risks of using paper licenses.", "While NRC and agreement states have taken steps to improve their  licensing programs and better ensure that radiological materials are safe  and secure, concerns about the theft of radioactive materials and the  possible consequences of a dirty bomb attack persist. In 2012, for  example, we identified security weaknesses at some U.S. medical  facilities that use high-risk radioactive materials, such as cesium-137,  and in 2014, we found that challenges exist in reducing the security risks  faced by licensees using high-risk radioactive materials for industrial  purposes.", "NRC periodically evaluates NRC regional offices\u2019 and agreement states\u2019  programs for licensing radioactive materials through its Integrated  Materials Performance Evaluation Program (IMPEP). NRC implemented  IMPEP in 1995 to periodically review NRC regional office and agreement  state radioactive materials programs to ensure that they are adequately  protecting public health and safety from the potential hazards associated  with the use of radioactive materials, and that agreement state programs  are compatible with NRC\u2019s program. As part of IMPEP, each NRC  regional office and agreement state regulatory program is typically  expected to undergo a program review every 4 years; reviews may occur  more or less frequently depending on a program\u2019s past performance. The  IMPEP reviewers examine a regional office\u2019s or an agreement state\u2019s  performance in areas such as licensing and inspections to determine if  the regional office\u2019s program is adequate to protect public health and  safety and if the agreement state\u2019s program is adequate to protect public  health and safety and compatible with NRC requirements.", "NRC also has the option to employ greater oversight of agreement state  programs if it discovers performance issues. Specifically, if performance  problems are found, a Management Review Board (MRB)\u2014comprised of  NRC officials and an agreement state liaison\u2014may decide to (in  ascending order of seriousness) institute Monitoring, Heightened  Oversight, Probation, Suspension, or Termination. The MRB may  decide to place an agreement state on Monitoring if weaknesses in the  program have resulted in or could result in less than satisfactory  performance in one or more performance areas. If an agreement state  program is found to have more serious problems (i.e., one or more  performance indicators are found to be unsatisfactory), the MRB may opt  to place a program on Heightened Oversight. Under Heightened  Oversight, a program may be requested to submit a program  improvement plan, which involves establishing a plan to address all  recommendations to eliminate unsatisfactory performance as well as  frequent contact with NRC to closely monitor progress. If the program  under IMPEP review does not correct performance weaknesses under  Heightened Oversight the MRB/NRC may place the program on  Probation or even suspend or terminate the agreement and reassert  regulatory authority.

LVS queries WBL and NSTS and enables users to confirm  that  1.  a category 1 or 2 license is valid and accurate,  2.  a licensee is authorized to acquire quantities and types of radioactive  3.  the licensee\u2019s current category 1 or 2 inventories in NSTS do not  exceed the possession limits.", "If the licensee is over their possession limit at the time the license  verification request is made, the LVS user would receive an error  message to contact the regulatory agency that issued the license for a  manual license verification, according to NRC officials. For category 1  and 2 licenses, deployment and use of these three systems, combined  with the requirement that transferors verify the legitimacy of licenses with  the appropriate regulatory body, serve as an impediment to those who  would attempt to illicitly obtain radioactive materials using a counterfeit or  altered license."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NRC Does Not Require Tracking or Agency Verification for Category 3 Quantities, Creating Risks to Public Health, Safety, and Security", "paragraphs": ["In contrast to the requirements for category 1 and 2 quantities of  radioactive materials, NRC does not require the tracking of category 3  materials or specifically require vendors to verify the legitimacy of  licenses with the appropriate regulatory body for those seeking to acquire  category 3 materials. Category 3 quantities of radioactive materials, which  are considered dangerous by IAEA, are not tracked in NSTS, nor are  licenses for such material issued by most agreement states in WBL. In  addition, unlike transfers of category 1 and 2 quantities of radioactive  materials, NRC regulations governing transfers of category 3 and smaller  quantities of radioactive materials, which were last updated in 1978, do  not specifically require transferors to contact the appropriate NRC  regional office or agreement state regulator to verify that those wishing to  take possession of the material are licensed to do so. Instead, transferors  have several options, including obtaining a copy of the transferee\u2019s  license, for verifying that the transferee has a license. We recommended  in 2008 that NRC include all potentially dangerous radioactive sources in  NSTS to address risks that a licensee could obtain radioactive materials  in quantities greater than what is allowed by their license.", "In 2009, after years of study, NRC staff recommended that the  Commission approve a final rule requiring that category 3 materials be  tracked in NSTS. The recommendation, according to NRC staff, was  based on several factors:", "Category 3 sources are considered dangerous by IAEA", "The potential to accumulate category 3 sources by aggregation to a  more dangerous category 2 level", "The additional burden to track category 3 was deemed justified given  the benefit in improved source accountability", "NSTS could accommodate additional data for newly tracked sources  When considering the recommendation to require that category 3  materials be tracked in NSTS, the Commission was evenly divided.  Specifically, the Commission split two to two, and thus did not adopt the  recommendation as Commission policy. Accordingly, it continues to be  the case that only category 1 and 2 sources are required to be tracked in  NSTS.", "In addition to not requiring tracking of category 3 quantities of radioactive  materials, NRC regulations governing transfers of category 3 and smaller  quantities of radioactive materials do not specifically require transferors to  verify the legitimacy of the license with the appropriate regulatory body.  Instead, transferors are required to choose one of several methods to  assure themselves that the purchaser has a license. Options include  obtaining a copy of the transferee\u2019s license and verifying directly with the  appropriate regulatory body that a purchaser has a license to acquire  sought category 3 or below radioactive materials. Because category 3  licensees are not specifically required to verify licenses through LVS or  directly with the appropriate regulatory body, most agreement state  category 3 license information is not in WBL, and transferors cannot verify  through LVS that a purchaser is legitimately licensed. Instead, to get  agency verification, transferors would need to contact the appropriate  NRC regional office or agreement state regulatory body. By contrast,  those transferring category 1 and 2 quantities of radioactive materials to  other parties must verify license validity either by using LVS or by  contacting the relevant NRC regional office or agreement state regulatory  authority. The NRC regulations applicable to category 3 and smaller  quantities of radioactive materials have not been updated since 1978.  According to NRC officials, many transferors of category 3 and smaller  quantities of radioactive materials comply with NRC requirements by  obtaining and keeping a copy of the transferees\u2019 licenses for their  records. However, there is presently no specific requirement that they do  so. Because they do not require transferors of category 3 and smaller  quantities of radioactive materials to verify the validity of a transferee\u2019s  license by contacting the appropriate regulatory body directly, and do not  make LVS available for use by these transferors, NRC and agreement  states do not have assurance that their systems would prevent bad actors  from altering licenses or fraudulently reporting the details of their licenses  to transferors, accumulating dangerous materials by aggregation to  category 2 or larger quantities on the basis of those fraudulent licenses,  and thereby endangering public health and safety. On this point, we  recommended in 2007 that NRC explore options to prevent individuals  from counterfeiting NRC licenses, especially if this counterfeiting allows  transferees to purchase more radioactive materials than they are  approved for under the terms of their original licenses."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Our Testing of NRC and Agreement State Programs Showed Them to Be Effective in Some Cases but Not Others, Allowing Us to Obtain Commitments to Purchase a Dangerous Quantity of Radioactive Materials", "paragraphs": ["Our testing of NRC and agreement state programs showed guidance\u2014 including the suspension of the good faith presumption, screening criteria,  and checklists, as well as inspectors\u2019 application of scrutiny during  prelicensing site visits\u2014to be effective in two out of our three cases.

In our view, a prelicensing site visit, conducted with  adequate scrutiny, would likely reveal that our fictitious companies were  not suitable for a license.

To do  this, GAO established two fictitious businesses  and submitted a radioactive materials  application to the relevant regulatory body for  each state. GAO did not rent office space for  its fictitious businesses but instead used post  office boxes for addresses. GAO was able to  obtain a genuine radioactive materials license  from one of the two regulatory bodies.  After obtaining a (paper) license, GAO  investigators altered the license so the  fictitious company could purchase a much  larger quantity of radioactive material rather  than the maximum listed on the license. GAO  then sought to purchase, from two suppliers,  devices containing radioactive materials.  These suppliers gave GAO price quotes and  commitments to ship the devices containing  radioactive materials in an amount sufficient to  reach the International Atomic Energy Agency  category 3 level\u2014considered dangerous if not  safely managed or secured. Importantly, GAO  could have accumulated substantially more  radioactive material.  GAO withdrew its application from the second  regulatory body after the license examiners  indicated that they would visit the fictitious  company\u2019s office before granting the license.  An official with the regulatory body told GAO  that conducting a site visit was a standard  procedure before license applications are  approved. adequate to protect public health and safety and minimize danger to  life and property. To reach this conclusion, they asked us numerous  detailed questions about the nature of our business and our past  business experience. We had difficulty answering some of these  questions because of the fictitious nature of our business. They asked  for key business documents that we could not provide, such as a copy  of a business license from the state. Further, they contacted us the  day after the site visit about not being able to verify the work history of  the company\u2019s radiation safety officer. (We had fabricated this  individual\u2019s work history.) This regulatory body performed satisfactorily  for all performance indicators during its most recent IMPEP review  and was rated satisfactory on all performance indicators in two  consecutive IMPEP reviews.", "In the second case, officials from the regulatory body stated that we  would not receive a license until the site was significantly more  developed, consistent with operating as a genuine business, and had  installed on-site an appropriately safe and secure storage container  for the radiological source and posted requisite safety placards  specified in the application, among other things. These comments are  consistent with NRC officials\u2019 statements that the purpose of the site  visit is to have a face-to-face meeting with the applicant to determine  whether there is a basis for confidence that the sought radioactive  materials will be used as represented in the application. Moreover, the  regulatory body stated in a follow-up e-mail that the company must  submit additional information on several aspects of the application  before a license could be issued: new facility drawings (as the ones  provided were not accurate), public radiation dose calculations (as the  proposed facility was next to an office building), descriptions of the  security measures that would be implemented, and more specific  information about how the company planned to transfer the source  from the facility to the company\u2019s truck since there was no garage  door in the facility. In summary, the regulators stated that they wanted  to \u201csee everything that is in place right before you go into business.\u201d  This regulatory body had recently been subjected to Heightened  Oversight by NRC because of problems uncovered regarding, among  other things, the qualifications, retention, and depth of its licensing  staff during an earlier IMPEP review.

Importantly, this material is 1 of the 20 radionuclides  that NRC previously determined are attractive for use in an RDD (also  known as a dirty bomb). Once we obtained a license, we contacted a  vendor of the category 3 radioactive source that we specified on our  license application. We provided a copy of the license, among other  things, to the vendor and subsequently obtained a signed commitment  from this vendor to sell us the source. We then altered the paper license  and contacted another vendor who also agreed to sell us a category 3  source we specified on our altered license. When combined, these two  high-level category 3 sources aggregate to a category 2 quantity of  radioactive material. According to IAEA, a category 2 quantity, if not  safely managed or securely protected, could cause permanent injury to a  person who handled it, or was otherwise in contact with the material, for a  short time (minutes to hours). NRC and agreement states require  additional security measures for those seeking to acquire this quantity of  material. Our fictitious business was not subjected to these more stringent  measures and provisions, however, because we were seeking a category  3 quantity of material.", "It is important to note that we undertook a very similar covert testing of  NRC and agreement state radioactive materials licensing programs in  2007 with very similar results. In 2007, we obtained a real radioactive  materials license for a below category 3 quantity of material and then  altered it to obtain commitments from multiple vendors to sell us, in  aggregate, devices containing a category 3 quantity of a radioactive  material considered attractive for use in an RDD. This time, we were able  to complete a similar covert vulnerability test in which we obtained a real  license for a category 3 quantity of radioactive material and altered it to  obtain commitments from multiple vendors to sell us, in aggregate, a  more dangerous category 2 quantity of a type of radioactive material  considered attractive for use in an RDD.", "Once we received our license from the agreement state and secured  commitments from vendors to sell us radiological material, we met with  NRC officials in October 2015 to alert them to the outcomes of the  investigative component of our work. As a result of our findings, NRC  officials told us that they are taking a number of corrective actions.  Specifically, NRC is updating training courses for new NRC and  agreement state inspectors to reinforce the importance of properly  implementing the prelicensing guidance. A key part of this training is to  reinforce the suspension of the good faith assumption during  prelicensing\u2014particularly during site visits. NRC also developed and  provided a training webinar for NRC and agreement state staff to further  emphasize prelicensing guidance and providing adequate scrutiny during  site visits. In addition, NRC requested that NRC regional offices and  agreement states conduct self-assessments of their implementation of the  prelicensing guidance and site visits. Finally, according to NRC officials,  NRC and agreement state working groups are currently developing and  evaluating enhancements to (1) current prelicensing guidance overall,  and (2) license verification and transfer requirements and prelicensing  guidance for category 3 licenses in particular. However, NRC officials  informed us that since the Commission did not adopt a proposal to  include category 3 quantities of radioactive materials in NSTS in 2009,  NRC had no current plans to take action on requiring category 3  quantities be included in NSTS. Because of this, NRC and the agreement  states will continue to be very limited in their ability to track these  dangerous quantities of radioactive material."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Since 2007, NRC has taken steps to implement several of the  recommendations made by GAO and others to enhance the control and  accountability of radioactive sources and materials. NRC has deployed  data systems\u2014NSTS, WBL, and LVS\u2014that are helping to better track,  secure, and control category 1 and 2 quantities of radioactive materials.  NRC also developed revised guidance, screening criteria, and checklists  covering all five IAEA categories of radioactive materials, and now directs  regions and agreement states to conduct prelicensing site visits for all  unknown applicants. However, NRC chose not to implement  recommendations to better track, secure, and control category 3  materials. GAO testing of the revised guidance, checklists, and  prelicensing site visits showed these revised systems to be only partially  effective in that our attempts to obtain a license using a fictitious company  was successful in one of our three cases\u2014allowing us to obtain  commitments from vendors to sell, in aggregate, a category 2 quantity of  radioactive material considered attractive for use in an RDD. This  demonstrates vulnerabilities similar to those we found in 2007.", "To its credit, NRC has taken a number of corrective actions in response  to our findings, including more training on prelicensing guidance to ensure  that NRC and agreement state staff provide adequate scrutiny during  prelicensing site visits. NRC has also formed working groups to consider  enhancements to the prelicensing process. It will be important for NRC to  continue these efforts as part of its process to ensure that its prelicensing  guidance, including site visits, is effectively performed. Nonetheless, our  work shows that NRC can do more to strengthen its processes of  licensing radioactive materials. Specifically, we continue to believe that  NRC should implement the recommendations by GAO and others for  enhancing the ability to track, secure, and control category 3 sources by  including such sources in both NSTS and WBL. Doing so would also  enable LVS to query these systems and better enable transferors to verify  the legitimacy of those seeking to purchase radioactive materials. As the  results of our covert vulnerability testing show, it is possible for someone  to obtain a license, which is printed on paper; make alterations to this  paper license; and use the altered license for a category 3 source to  acquire another category 3 source and thereby accumulate more  dangerous, high-risk category 2 quantities. Including category 3 quantities  in NSTS and WBL, and requiring transferors to verify the legitimacy of  licenses of those seeking to purchase radioactive materials through LVS  or with the appropriate regulatory body, would provide greater assurance  that a bad actor could not manipulate the system by, for example, altering  a paper license, to acquire radioactive materials in aggregate greater than  what they are authorized to possess.", "Moreover, NRC regulations governing the steps that transferors of  category 3 quantities of radioactive materials must take to verify that  those wishing to take possession of the material are properly licensed to  do so have not been updated since 1978 and may not be adequate to  protect public health and safety. In contrast, NRC has taken several steps  to update its licensing guidance by, among other things, directing regions  and agreement states to conduct site visits for unknown applicants and  suspending the good faith presumption, which fosters greater scrutiny of  applicants. However, because paper licenses are vulnerable to being  altered, not requiring transferors of category 3 quantities of radioactive  materials to verify the validity of their licenses with the appropriate  regulatory body may still allow bad actors to accumulate dangerous  materials and in quantities that threaten public health and safety.", "Finally, prior to issuing a license to a new applicant for category 1 and 2  quantities, NRC and agreement states conduct an on-site security review  to verify that the applicant is prepared to implement the required security  measures before taking possession of licensed radioactive materials.  However, such on-site security reviews are not conducted for applicants  of category 3 quantities and below, and regulators told us that they may  take up to a year to ensure that applicants have implemented all required  health, safety, and security measures.
