The budgetary impact on Hawaii is smaller but is expected to grow as Hawaii absorbs health care costs once covered by the U.S. government. Public health is an important concern for all three U.S. island areas. Migrants from the region with limited financial means are able to enter the United States with few restrictions, and U.S. island areas are absorbing much of the health care costs of this population. Furthermore, Guam, Hawaii, and the CNMI can be expected to continue to experience migration as long as weak economic conditions persist in Micronesia and the Marshall Islands.

Compact enabling legislation states that, in approving the Compacts, the Congress did not intend to cause any adverse consequences for U.S. territories, commonwealths, or the state of Hawaii. While many of the provisions of the Compact with the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, including those providing U.S. economic assistance, are due to expire in 2001 and are being renegotiated, the Compact\u2019s migration provisions do not expire. However, the governments of the U.S. island areas of Guam (an unincorporated U.S. territory in the western Pacific), Hawaii (a U.S. state), and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (a self-governing commonwealth of the United States), have raised concerns about the adverse financial and public health impact that they attribute to the many citizens from the Compact nations that have availed themselves of Compact migration rights. Therefore, the Department of State\u2019s Director of the Office of Compact Negotiations testified in June 2000 that he intends to address migration in the context of the ongoing negotiations.(As of September 21, 2001, the Director of the Office of Compact Negotiations resigned.

The United States entered into a trusteeship with the United Nations Security Council and became the administering authority of the four current states of the FSM, as well as the Marshall Islands, Palau, and the Northern Mariana Islands. The UN TTPI made the United States responsible financially and administratively for the region. The four states of the FSM voted in a 1978 referendum to become an independent nation, while the Marshall Islands established its constitutional government and declared itself a republic in 1979. Both locations remained subject to the authority of the United States under the trusteeship agreement until 1986. Late that year, an international agreement called the Compact of Free Association went into effect between the United States and these two new nations and provided for substantial U.S. direct economic assistance for 15 years in order to help both countries move toward a goal of economic self-sufficiency. The Department of the Interior\u2019s Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) has been responsible for disbursing and monitoring this direct economic assistance, which totaled almost $1.6 billion from 1987 through 1998. In 2000 we reported that both nations have made some progress in achieving economic self-sufficiency but remain heavily financially dependent upon the United States. In addition to economic assistance, under the Compact the United States provided access to federal services and programs, an obligation to defend the two Pacific Island nations, and migration rights. For its part, the United States received defense rights in these two countries under the Compact.", "The Compact exempts FSM and RMI citizens migrating to the United States from meeting U.S. passport, visa, and labor certification requirements of the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended (P.L. 82-414). The same migration provisions are included in the 1994 Compact with the Republic of Palau. The migration provisions of the two Compacts also allow FSM, RMI, and Palau (or, collectively, Freely Associated States\u2013FAS) migrants to enter into, lawfully engage in occupations, and establish residence in the United States (including all U.S. states, territories, and possessions) without limitations on their length of stay. U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) officials have stated that these rights granted to FAS migrants are unique; there are no other nations whose citizens enjoy this degree of access to the United States. At the time of the original negotiations, the U.S. Compact negotiator stated that the Compact\u2019s migration rights were meant to strengthen ties between the United States and the Freely Associated States.", "All Compact migrants in the United States are legally classified as \u201cnonimmigrants,\u201d a status that typically signifies nonpermanent visitors such as tourists or students. However, while not legally classified as such, Compact migrants can behave similarly to \u201cimmigrants,\u201d in that they can stay in the United States as long as they choose with few restrictions.Compact migrants can become U.S. citizens by applying for legal permanent resident status under standard immigration procedures.", "The Congress authorized compensation in the Compacts\u2019 enabling legislation for U.S. island areas that might experience increased demands on their educational and social services by Compact migrants from these Pacific Island nations. Further, the legislation required the President to report and make recommendations annually to the Congress regarding adverse consequences resulting from the Compact.

The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, as amended, (P.L. 104-193), referred to as the Welfare Reform Act, cut certain federal public benefits to some legal aliens, including migrants who enter under the Compact. Medicaid, a program to provide funding to low-income individuals for health care and whose costs are shared between the federal and state governments, is one of the federal programs that is no longer available to FAS migrants.

Nonetheless, the CNMI is now studying the issue and considering whether to establish limitations on habitual residents.

It has also based its reports on the previously discussed FAS migrant population surveys it has funded using technical assistance from the U.S. Bureau of the Census.

These guidelines, which were drafted in the context of reviewing a Guam impact assessment for 1993, addressed key areas such as health and education. The guidelines also stated that a \u201cbaseline\u201d population of migrants who were on Guam prior to the Compact (and whose impact thus, in Interior\u2019s view, cannot be easily attributed to the Compact) should be subtracted from Guam\u2019s impact estimate. Guam subsequently took action to implement OIA\u2019s guidelines. However, while an OIA official reported that he submitted these guidelines to the CNMI, officials from the CNMI could not confirm ever receiving such guidelines and stated that their impact assessments have not been based on OIA guidelines. An Hawaii State official said that while the state did not receive written guidelines from OIA, verbal discussions were held regarding issues such as using per student costs for education estimates.", "Further, OIA has not provided consistent review of impact estimates submitted by the three U.S. island area governments. For example, while OIA has instructed Guam and the CNMI in its annual reports and elsewhere to remove pre-Compact migrants from impact estimates (i.e., subtract a \u201cbaseline\u201d), no such guidance has ever been provided to Hawaii in OIA\u2019s annual reports, despite the fact that Hawaii has estimated costs for all FAS migrants living in the state and had a pre-Compact migrant population that was roughly comparable to that of Guam. In addition, OIA\u2019s 1999 impact report mentioned Hawaii\u2019s lost revenues resulting from the fact that FAS college and university students pay resident tuition, after having noted in its 1994 guidelines that higher education costs could not be justified for Guam. OIA has also not addressed the fact that many of Guam\u2019s impact estimates do not include Palauans (while estimates for the other two areas do include this group of migrants) and that Hawaii no longer includes public safety costs in its assessments. As a result, all three areas have included different areas of impact and have defined the impact population differently and impact estimates, though providing valuable data, do not easily allow comparisons across U.S. island areas to determine actual relative impact.

However, the snowball method misses some individuals who are not connected or networked into the mainstream migrant communities. Thus, it may miss some of those that are living in remote locations/islands, or are in areas with political, economic, or racial tensions. Fears on Guam and Hawaii about being deported may have led some migrants either to not participate at all or to not fully disclose their personal information, according to interviews with FAS migrants in Guam and Hawaii. The snowball approach may also miss transient migrants as well as some who have assimilated into the U.S. areas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Examples of Possible Undercount of the Actual Number of FAS Migrants", "paragraphs": ["Based on our review of island government administrative data and interviews with migrants, we have found the following examples that suggest the OIA\u2019s survey data appear to undercount of the actual population of FAS migrants in U.S. areas:   While OIA\u2019s 1998 census identified 92 Marshallese and their children living in the CNMI, a Marshallese migrant we met with in the CNMI in 2000 showed us a list of Marshallese families, which she explained totaled 260 persons. While there is a 2-year difference in the data, the population of RMI migrants is very stable, with few people coming or going in recent years, according to this Marshallese community representative.", "One of the Marshallese migrants living in Hawaii who assisted with OIA\u2019s 1997 survey of FAS migrants estimated that the survey missed around 15 percent of the Marshallese population living on the Hawaiian island of Oahu.", "The OIA surveys report a smaller number of FAS students enrolled in public schools (kindergarten through grade 12) in each of the three U.S. areas than do the administrative data provided to us by each school district. An analysis of the data shows that: (1) in 1997, OIA counted only 1,205 ethnic FAS students in Guam, whereas Guam counted 3,009 ethnic FAS students; (2) in 1998, OIA counted only 422 FAS-born students in the CNMI, whereas the CNMI counted 575 FAS-born students; and (3) in 1997, OIA counted only 1,054 FAS-born students in Hawaii, whereas Hawaii\u2019s Department of Education counted 1,283 FAS-born students in their English as a Second Language program alone.", "The possibility of an undercount on Guam is also illustrated by the discrepancies in the numbers of Palauans living on that island in 1997. An Ernst & Young report issued on the impact of Micronesian migration to Guam that compared the OIA 1997 survey with the 1995 census of Palauans on Guam, found 1,716 fewer Palauans in Guam in 1997 than in 1995 (dropping from 2,276 to 560 persons). Moreover, the report noted that confusion in the Palauan community as to why a survey was being conducted in 1997 (since a Palauan-only census was administered just 2 years prior in the form of the 1995 Census of Palauans on Guam) may have led to an undercount of Palauans on Guam in the OIA 1997 survey."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments From the Department of the Interior", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Department of the Interior\u2019s letter dated September 7, 2001. 1.  The report number has been changed from GAO-01-1028 to GAO-02-40. 2.  We do not believe that it has become more difficult each year to measure the impact of Compact migration, and in fact may have become an easier task.  For example, a Guam official told us that when the Compact was implemented, the territory could not quantify impact from available data; since that time, Guam agencies have collected the necessary data on FAS migrants.  Further, the CNMI government has reported that it is now taking action to better review data in order to provide more specific information regarding FAS migrants and their use of public services.  However, it is worth noting that over time the Department of the Interior will need to define the eligible Compact impact population as U.S.-born children of FAS migrants begin to have children of their own."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments From the Department of State", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Department of State\u2019s letter dated August 22, 2001. 1.

It is worth pointing out that criminals have been identified upon entry into the United States using other means.  For example, the U.S. embassy in the RMI is providing the INS with a list of convicted RMI felons for determining admissibility at the port of entry. 2.  This report examined Hawaii, Guam, and the CNMI because these destinations received the initial influx of Compact migrants, comprehensive surveys of these migrants had been conducted in each location, and impact compensation is authorized for each of the three locations.  As acknowledged by the Department of State in its letter, we intend to undertake a review of migration to the mainland following publication of this report. 3.  We maintain that our comments on p. 8 of the report are accurate: While FAS migrants are classified as nonimmigrants, their behavior is often like that of immigrants in that they can stay indefinitely in the United States with few restrictions.  Further, the habitual residence restrictions cited in the Department of State letter only apply to Guam."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments From the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the letter from the government of the Federated States of Micronesia dated August 31, 2001. 1.  We agree that the Compact\u2019s migration provisions strengthen ties between the United States and the FSM and the RMI. As we discussed on p. 8 of this report, at the time of the Compact negotiations, the Compact negotiator stated that the migration rights were to strengthen ties between the United States and the Freely Associated States (FAS). The current Compact negotiator has reiterated this point, referring to the migration rights not only as an important \"safety valve\" for the FAS population, but as the \"glue\" between the nations. The negotiator further stated that because the children of FAS migrants born in the United States are U.S. citizens, ties between the United States and the FAS are further deepened. 2.  As we reported on p. 16 of this report, the governments of Guam, Hawaii, and the CNMI all acknowledge that FAS migrants have had positive impacts such as contributing to the tax base and filling employment needs.  However, the Compact enabling legislation specifically requires reports only on the adverse impact of the Compact. As noted on p. 16 of this report, the CNMI's impact estimate for 1996 quantified $3.6 million in positive benefits from the taxes paid by FAS migrants, compared with their reported cost of $11 million that year.  The Congress authorized compensation in the Compact's enabling legislation for U.S. island areas that may have experienced increased demands on their educational and social services by Compact migrants, but did not include compensation for other impact costs, such as infrastructure. Consequently, the U.S. island areas are not submitting claims for total costs in their impact estimates. In addition, available data on investment and savings reported by FAS migrants in Department of the Interior surveys show that few migrants invest and save. For example, of 2,053 Compact FSM households surveyed, only 15 reported any interest, dividend, or net rental income in 1997 in Guam and Hawaii or 1998 in the CNMI.  Reviewing the impact of Compact expenditures on U.S. companies is not within the scope of this review. 3.  We believe our description of the number of FAS migrants and the income levels of these households is neither damning nor inaccurate. Surveys have identified thousands--about 14,000--of Compact FAS migrants in Guam, Hawaii, and the CNMI. FAS migrants reported their income in surveys conducted in Guam, Hawaii, and the CNMI. In total, about 61 percent of FAS migrants lived in households with income levels below the poverty level, based on the U.S. poverty definition. 4.  We do not suggest that FSM migrants \u201cchoose\u201d to live in poverty, but report that their employment has been primarily in private sector jobs requiring few skills and paying low wages. 5.  Our report does not contain data on the number of FAS migrants on the U.S. mainland. As reported on p. 11 of this report, according to OIA surveys, FAS migrants accounted for about 5 percent of Guam\u2019s total population in 1997 and around 4 percent of the CNMI\u2019s total population in 1998. These migrants accounted for 0.5 percent of Hawaii\u2019s population in 1997. As noted on p. 11, we believe that these figures underestimated the number of FAS migrants in these three U.S. locations. 6.  Issues regarding U.S. employer recruitment were not raised by island government officials or FAS migrants concerning Guam, Hawaii, or the CNMI. We recognize that FSM officials have raised this issue regarding U.S. mainland employers who are recruiting FSM citizens for work. 7.  The number of FAS citizens who return to the islands after schooling or a period of employment is not known. The FSM and RMI governments were not able to provide such data, although one FSM government official estimated that perhaps one-fourth of migrants return. 8.  When reporting on OIA migrant survey information, we identified the FSM, the RMI, and Palau separately where notable data differences existed. For example, see table 1 on p. 11 and table 2 on p. 14. With respect to Compact impact estimates, we relied upon data provided to us by Guam, Hawaii, and the CNMI. These data often combined all FAS migrants, making it impossible for us to report on the impact of the three FAS nations separately. Guam, Hawaii, and the CNMI are eligible to receive Compact impact compensation for the impact of migrants from all three FAS nations. 9.  The issue of FAS citizens who enlisted in the U.S. armed forces will be addressed in a separate GAO report on Compact defense and security issues. This report will be issued before the end of 2001. 10. As we reported on p. 13, the pursuit of educational opportunities was one of the motivations for migration, according to migrants and FAS government officials. OIA migrant surveys for Guam, Hawaii, and the CNMI did not ask FAS migrants whether education was a reason for migration, and thus contain no data on this issue. 11. The report\u2019s recommendation was not drafted with the intent to end migration. The recommendation has two purposes. In addition to providing an option that could reduce some of the incentives to migrate, the recommendation also recognizes that improvements in the health and education systems in FAS nations could reduce the impact of migration on the receiving areas. 12. Consideration of alternatives available to the U.S. government to increase opportunities and improve conditions in FAS nations was beyond the scope of this report. 13. Our report does not contend that FAS migrants have introduced (i.e., provided the first case of) any communicable disease into the United States. However, Hawaii has repeatedly emphasized public health concerns regarding FAS migrants. According to a report prepared by Hawaii\u2019s Department of Health and included in Hawaii\u2019s January 31, 2001 Compact impact report, the FSM has the highest prevalence of Hansen\u2019s Disease (leprosy) in the world, at 35 cases per 10,000 people. For 1992 through 1999, 151 cases of this disease were detected among the Marshall Islanders and Micronesians in Hawaii. Hawaii also identified cases of tuberculosis, pertussis, and hepatitis A occurring within the FAS population communities in the state. In addition, Guam and CNMI health officials also raised public health concerns regarding FAS migrants. 14. We believe this report is objective and fair. It reports on the migration experience under the Compact of Free Association relying on the best available data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Comments From the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the letter from the government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands dated September 4, 2001. 1. This GAO report is one in a series of reviews of U.S. relations with the FSM and the RMI under the Compact of Free Association. Previously, we have published an assessment of the use, effectiveness, and accountability of U.S. Compact economic assistance. In addition to this migration report, forthcoming reviews cover the use, effectiveness, and accountability of U.S. domestic programs extended to both nations, as well as defense and security relations. Taken together, these reports will illustrate the larger context of the free association relationship between the three countries. 2.  The determination of poverty levels is based on the U.S. nationwide standard as established by the U.S. Bureau of the Census. These levels are adjusted annually for family size. The measure of poverty is required for statistical purposes by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget in Statistical Policy Directive No. 14. We have added a footnote on p. 14, stating that poverty levels are based on the single U.S. standard discussed previously.", "Regarding education, our report does not state that FAS migrants are \u201cuneducated.\u201d Instead, we report that migrants have not been highly educated, based on OIA migrant survey data. According to U.S., Guam, and CNMI government reports, FAS migrants have lower educational levels than the overall population in Guam, Hawaii, and the CNMI. For example, 55 percent of Compact migrants over the age of 25 had high school degrees in Hawaii in 1997, while 84 percent of the total Hawaiian population over the age of 25 had a high school degree. 3.  We have added text on p. 23 to state that the RMI government does not have an official policy regarding migration. 4.  We have modified the title of the report in recognition that \u201cforeign relations\u201d is a more appropriate way to classify the migration relationship between the United States and FAS nations.   We continue to believe that the Compact economic and program assistance is most accurately referred to as \u201cforeign assistance.\u201d 5.  We made the suggested change. 6.  We made the suggested footnote change. 7.  We made the suggested footnote change. 8.  We did not make this change. The report states that migration is viewed as a \u201csafety valve\u201d by government officials; it does not state that this view constitutes a matter of official government policy. 9.  While we did not alter this particular sentence, on p. 14 of the report we added text to note that, in Hawaii, a higher percentage of Compact RMI migrants reported that they migrated to Hawaii for medical reasons (10 percent) than reported moving for employment (7 percent). However, we note that 43 percent of Compact Marshallese surveyed chose \u201cother\u201d as their reason for migrating. 10.

The data we present on p. 17 of the report regarding the impact of FAS migrants on Guam, Hawaii, and the CNMI include public safety costs. We acknowledge that FAS migrants create impact on the criminal justice system in Guam. For example, in Guam, where FAS migrants make up about 5 percent of the population, 12 percent of the cost of the corrections system was attributed to FAS migrants in fiscal year 2000. FAS migrants represented 26 percent of all convictions in fiscal year 1999/2000 in Guam. We did not separately discuss this area of impact in our report because it is smaller than the impact reported on the health and education systems. For example, for fiscal year 2000 public safety costs estimated by Guam was 6 percent of the total impact amount, compared with 54 percent for education and 40 percent for health and welfare.", "Reviewing the impact immigration to Guam from countries other than FAS nations was beyond the scope of this report. 2.  The issues of economic development and employment opportunities in the FSM and the RMI have been addressed in a prior GAO report. In this review, we reported that the considerable funds provided to the FSM and the RMI under the Compact had resulted in little economic development. See Foreign Assistance:  U.S. Funds to Two Micronesian Nations Had Little Impact on Economic Development (GAO/NSIAD-00-216, Sept. 22, 2000). We have not assessed the extent to which long-term stability in FAS nations can be created in the future through economic development and employment opportunities. 3.  We maintain that the report\u2019s recommendation provides an option that could reduce some of the incentives to migrate. For example, targeted investments for dialysis treatments would allow some FAS citizens to remain at home instead of moving to U.S. locations. Further, the recommendation also recognizes that improvements in the health and education systems in FAS nations could reduce the impact of migration on the receiving areas.  For example, improved immunization in FAS nations could reduce the public health concerns currently voiced by Guam, Hawaii, and the CNMI with regard to FAS migrants. 4.  OIA migrant survey data have shown that employment has been a key reason for FAS migration to Guam, Hawaii, and the CNMI since the Compacts were implemented. However, we noted on p. 15 of our report that \u201c\u2026Guam government officials told us that as Guam\u2019s unemployment rate has reached about 15 percent in recent years, the demand for FAS workers may have decreased.\u201d This development does not necessarily mean, however, that Guam is now viewed in FAS nations as a location without employment opportunities. For example, an elected Guam official pointed out to us that as difficult as the employment situation may be in Guam, conditions are worse in the FSM state of Chuuk (the poorest state in the FSM and the birthplace of the largest group of FAS migrants in Guam). 5.  As Guam rightly states in its comments, our report does not address how the two options available in the Compact and its enabling legislation should be used to address the impact caused by the migration from FAS.  As our report points out, however, the Compact\u2019s enabling legislation does not require compensation for impact costs. Rather, it says that the Congress will act \u201csympathetically and expeditiously\u201d to redress adverse consequences.  As such, it is at the Congress\u2019 discretion to compensate for Compact impacts.  Similarly, since the INS recently instituted regulations on habitual residents in the territories, we felt it was premature to recommend further regulations until the results of the new regulations can be assessed. 6.

We recognize in our report that FAS migrant eligibility for Medicaid is an important issue for the state of Hawaii.  As Hawaii noted in its letter, the Congress recently reinstated FAS citizen eligibility for federal housing programs; a similar reinstatement of eligibility for federal Medicaid benefits would require a congressional policy decision. 2.  We have not undertaken an analysis to determine whether there might be sufficient potential Compact health sector funds to pay FAS debts to U.S. health care facilities or what the impact of such payments would be on the FAS health care systems. 3. We have discussed the possibility of requiring health screenings with Department of State officials.  They informed us that such screenings are not feasible, as the Department does not have sufficient resources to administer such a system in FAS countries.  Further, INS officials noted that requiring such screenings would be unfair treatment against FAS migrants, as nonimmigrants are not required to undergo health screenings. While we recognize that requiring health screenings would address a key concern for all three U.S. locations, we believe that the likelihood of the U.S. government implementing such a recommendation is low. 4. Financial compensation is not required under the Compact or its enabling legislation, but can be made at the discretion of the Congress. 5. While we agree that Hawaii has developed its own methodology for calculating impact, we note that Hawaii officials have told us that the state\u2019s Department of Education includes pre-1986 migrants in its Compact impact estimates. 6. On p. 1 of our report, we have better highlighted the fact that Hawaii is a state with a different status than Guam and the CNMI.  We then explain in a footnote that we chose the term \u201cU.S. island areas\u201d to refer collectively to a U.S. state, a U.S. territory, and a U.S. commonwealth. We view this term as a neutral, concise reference to the three locations. Further, we list \u201cGuam, Hawaii, and the CNMI\u201d in descending order based upon the number of FAS Compact migrants each location has received. 7.  We have retained the footnote as is.  We do not believe that Interior\u2019s recalculation of Compact impact estimates for 1 year out of 15 merits inclusion in the body of the report.  Further, we are not convinced that OIA\u2019s approach to adjusting the data was valid. 8.  We have modified the text to note that Hawaii has estimated $86 million in Compact impact costs, but has received no compensation to date. 9.  We agree, and have recommended in a previous report that future Compact economic assistance include specific measures (including grant requirements) that will ensure the effectiveness of, and accountability over, future spending.
