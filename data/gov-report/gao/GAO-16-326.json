As one CO-OP ceased operations in early 2015, GAO was asked to review the CO-OP program again. This report examines (1) how CMS monitors the CO-OPs' performance and sustainability; (2) how CO-OP premiums changed from 2014 to 2015, and in 2015, how they compared to premiums for other health plans; and (3) how CO-OP enrollment changed from 2014 to 2015, and in 2015, how it compared to projections.

CMS's initial monitoring activities, starting when it began to award CO-OP program loans in early 2012, focused on the CO-OPs' progress as start-up issuers and their compliance with program requirements. Since then, CMS refined and expanded its monitoring to evaluate CO-OP performance and sustainability. CMS officials use enrollment and financial data to identify CO-OPs for which actual performance differed substantially from what was expected. CMS officials also perform routine assessments of each CO-OP's risk in various areas, such as working capital and management. To evaluate and respond to financial or operational issues identified at CO-OPs, CMS formalized a framework that it called an escalation plan. Under this plan, CMS may require that a CO-OP take corrective actions or the agency may implement an enhanced oversight plan based on its evaluation of the issue. As of November 2015, CMS used its escalation plan to evaluate and respond to issues at 18 CO-OPs, including 9 of the CO-OPs that have ceased operations. CMS officials told GAO that they plan to work with states' departments of insurance to continue monitoring CO-OPs that have ceased operations to the extent possible in order to minimize any negative impact on members and, if possible, recover loans made through the program.", "GAO found that in 14 of the 20 states where CO-OPs offered health plans during both 2014 and 2015, the average CO-OP premiums for 30-year-old individuals purchasing silver health plans\u2014the most commonly selected plan\u2014were lower in 2015 than the average premiums for such plans in 2014.

Across the 23 states, average silver health plan premiums were lower for CO-OPs than other issuers in 31 percent to 100 percent of rating areas.", "In addition, GAO found that the combined enrollment for the 22 CO-OPs that offered health plans in 2015 was over 1 million as of June 30, 2015, more than double the enrollment of a year earlier. More than half of these members were in CO-OPs that ceased operations. GAO also found that the combined enrollment for all 22 CO-OPs in 2015 exceeded their projections for 2015 by more than 6 percent. Of the 11 CO-OPs that have ceased operations, 6 did not meet their individual enrollment projections for 2015. Among the 11 CO-OPs that continue to operate in 2016, 4 CO-OPs had not yet reached a program benchmark of enrolling at least 25,000 members.

For this purpose, PPACA  appropriated funding for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS), the agency within the Department of Health and Human Services  (HHS) that administers the CO-OP program, to award loans totaling more  than $2.4 billion.

However, 12 CO-OPs ceased operations on or before   January 1, 2016, renewing questions previously raised about the  long-term sustainability of the CO-OPs and the effects that they will  ultimately have on states\u2019 health insurance markets. Such questions led  to our first review of the CO-OP program. In April 2015, we reported that  as of January 2015, CMS disbursed more than two-thirds of the $2.4  billion in CO-OP program loans awarded. We also reported that while the  average premiums for CO-OP health plans were generally lower than  those for other issuers, most CO-OPs did not meet their initial enrollment  projections during the first enrollment period (October 1, 2013, through  March 31, 2014).", "Given that questions about CO-OP sustainability and their ultimate impact  continue, you asked us as the first CO-OP began to cease operations in  early 2015 to conduct a follow-up review of the CO-OP program.

We also obtained comparable premium data from the 7 states that  had state-based exchanges where CO-OPs participated. For the 20  states where CO-OPs offered health plans on an exchange during both  the 2015 open enrollment period and the 2014 open enrollment period  (October 1, 2013, through March 31, 2014), we calculated and compared  the state-wide average CO-OP premium for silver tier health plans\u2014the  most commonly selected of the five levels of benefit coverage, including  plans specified by metal level, as well as catastrophic plans\u2014for 30-year- old individuals in 2014 and 2015. To examine how 2015 premiums for  CO-OP health plans compared to the premiums for other health plans in  the 23 states where CO-OPs operated in 2015, we calculated and  compared the average CO-OP premium with the average premium for  other health plans for each rating area (geographical areas established by  states and used, in part, by issuers to set premium rates) and for each  health plan tier. We did this for eight different categories of policyholder:  30, 40, and 60-year-old individuals and couples, and 30 and 50-year-old  couples with two children.", "To examine how enrollment in CO-OP health plans changed from 2014 to  2015, we obtained data from the National Association of Insurance  Commissioners (NAIC) on quarterly statements dated June 30, 2015, and  annual statements dated December 31, 2014, filed by each of the  CO-OPs that operated in 2015.

CMS also developed a tool to assess risk based on  data collected through its established monitoring activities. CMS officials  told us that they use this tool on a quarterly basis to assess risk across  seven factors:  1.  Long-term sustainability. CMS assesses risk based on whether a  CO-OP expects to break even financially by 2017 and, if so, the  extent to which a CO-OP expects to repay start-up loans while  maintaining required reserve levels. CMS officials told us that  although some viable CO-OPs might not expect to break even by  2017, they selected this date, in part, to provide a common basis for  developing a risk score, because the first repayments of CO-OP loans  are due in 2017.  2.  Working capital. CMS assesses risk based on whether a CO-OP  expects to generate net revenues from premiums, risk mitigation  programs, or other funding sufficient to cover operating expenses over  the next 12 months and, if not, the extent to which the CO-OP plans to  rely on the disbursement of any remaining solvency loan funds.  3.  Profitability. CMS assesses risk based on whether the CO-OP\u2019s  performance is consistent with the projections in its business plan.  This risk category does not measure current profitability.  4.  Compliance with state requirements. CMS assesses risk based on  whether a state department of insurance determined that a CO-OP  was non-compliant with state requirements and, if so, the extent to  which remedial action has been implemented. CMS also considers  whether the CO-OP has had a history of non-compliance and the  severity of any regulatory action taken by a department of insurance.  5.  Compliance with CO-OP program requirements. CMS assesses risk  based on whether the agency has determined that a CO-OP was non- compliant with CO-OP program loan terms and provisions and, if so,  the extent to which the CO-OP has been responsive to CMS officials\u2019  requests. CMS also considers whether the CO-OP experienced any  legal compliance issues that would affect participation in the program.  6.  CO-OP management. CMS assesses risk based on whether the  agency identified conflicts of interest with CO-OP management and  performance concerns including high turnover, fraud, or a lack of  appropriate internal controls.  7.  CO-OP infrastructure issues. CMS assesses risk based on whether  the agency identified concerns involving the CO-OP\u2019s key operating  systems\u2014including claims, enrollment and billing, customer service,  and utilization management.", "For quantitative factors included in the risk assessment, CMS officials told  us they compare individual CO-OP data to benchmarks and assign a risk  level (high, medium-high, medium, and low) based on the extent of  deviation from the benchmarks. For qualitative factors, CMS officials told  us they assign CO-OPs a risk level based on responses to a standard set  of questions completed by account managers.", "To help ensure the most current data are available to be used in the  direct analysis and risk assessment tools, CMS enhanced certain  reporting requirements associated with the core monitoring activities it  previously established. While the agency continues to require routine  teleconferences with CO-OPs and standard reporting, CMS enhanced its  initial reporting requirements to include submission of enrollment and  selected financial data on a monthly basis rather than on a quarterly  basis. CMS also now requires CO-OPs to provide certain financial  projections quarterly rather than annually.", "To respond to issues identified at individual CO-OPs using the direct  analysis and risk assessment tools, as well as its other monitoring  activities, in November 2014, CMS formally established a framework,  known as an escalation plan, for evaluating and responding to concerns.  The identification of an issue at a CO-OP is the first of four steps  described in the written guidance for establishing and implementing the  escalation plan. (See fig. 3.)", "Issue identification. CMS initiates the escalation plan when the agency  identifies an issue of potential concern at a CO-OP. Identification may be  based on information obtained through a variety of sources, including  internal channels (e.g., the core monitoring activities, direct analysis, and  risk assessments described above) and external channels (e.g.,  communication with state regulators).", "Issue assessment.

Using a standard set of questions, the account manager assesses the  issue in light of five sets of considerations: (1) whether the issue was self- reported by the CO-OP and the frequency with which the CO-OP  experienced the same or other issues, (2) the potential impact on the  CO-OP\u2019s state licensure and exchange participation, (3) the potential  impact on the CO-OP\u2019s approved business plan, (4) the potential impact  on the CO-OP\u2019s compliance with program requirements, and (5) the  potential impact on the CO-OP\u2019s members and markets where it  participates. Answers to questions about these considerations result in a  score that indicates whether the issue\u2019s severity and urgency is of minor,  moderate, elevated, or greatest concern. The account manager then  refers the preliminary assessment for review and approval by other CMS  officials, including a team that has responsibility for evaluating CO-OP  program integrity.", "Enforcement action. CMS determines an enforcement action based on  the final assessment of the issue as of minor, moderate, elevated, or  greatest concern. Enforcement actions generally require a corresponding  response from the CO-OP to resolve the issue. If the CO-OP\u2019s response  to an enforcement action does not result in an acceptable resolution to an  issue, the agency may elevate the assessment to a higher level and  require additional responses from the CO-OP.", "Minor. CMS communicates with CO-OP officials to resolve the issue  and prevent a recurrence. Examples of issues that might be assessed  as minor\u2014if no other issues were identified\u2014would be challenges in  submitting a required report or a divergence of less than 20 percent  between the CO-OP\u2019s actual enrollment and its most recently  projected enrollment.", "Moderate. CMS sends a formal written notice of the issue, known as a  warning letter, to CO-OPs that have an issue assessed as a moderate  concern. In response, CO-OP officials are required to submit evidence  of the development and implementation of a plan to resolve the issue.  As of November 9, 2015, CMS had issued warning letters to 11  CO-OPs, of which 7 continue to operate. According to CMS officials,  issues for which CMS issued warning letters included the execution of  a contract that is core to the CO-OP\u2019s business activity (e.g., a  contract for a top executive) without the requisite prior CMS approval,  and the submission of incomplete data for one of the risk mitigation  programs.", "Elevated. CMS sends CO-OPs a formal written notice that a  corrective action plan is required, an enhanced oversight plan will be  implemented, or both. According to CMS officials, they generally  require the CO-OP to develop a corrective action plan when they  determine that the CO-OP can take action to address the issue and  that the action and its effect can be documented; the corrective action  plan is subject to CMS approval and monitoring. CMS officials  implement an enhanced oversight plan when the issue is urgent or  has the potential to become more severe. In response to an enhanced  oversight plan, a CO-OP may be required to submit additional reports  or may be subjected to additional audits. As of November 9, 2015,  CMS had required corrective action plans or implemented enhanced  oversight plans (or both) for 15 CO-OPs, of which 8 continue to  operate in 2016. Issues for which these were required include  CO-OPs failing to comply with state laws and experiencing high  enrollment and significant losses. CMS noted that some of the  corrective action plans and enhanced oversight plans were the result  of unresolved issues that required stronger enforcement actions.", "Greatest. CMS sends CO-OPs a formal written notice, and if a  correction action plan and/or enhanced oversight plan cannot resolve  the issue, CMS may consider terminating the CO-OP from the  program or taking other enforcement measures, such as withholding  loan disbursements. As of November 9, 2015, CMS officials had  identified an issue of greatest concern at two CO-OPs. For one  CO-OP, it required a corrective action plan, and for the other CO-OP,  it issued a termination letter. CMS officials noted that these two  CO-OPs had issues involving serious and pervasive management  problems or financial losses substantial enough to question the  CO-OP\u2019s sustainability. Both CO-OPs ceased operations on, or  before, January 1, 2016.", "Resolution. CMS monitors the CO-OP\u2019s progress for resolving an  identified issue through status calls, additional reporting requirements, or  other actions as appropriate. For some issues determined to be of  elevated or greatest concern, CMS may conduct an on-site visit. If CMS  determines that an issue has been resolved, CMS returns to a more  routine level of monitoring, mindful of the history that the CO-OP had with  the issue. If the problem is not resolved, or if the process of investigating  an issue reveals other issues, CMS can re-assess the issue and take  further actions, and it has done so with several CO-OPs. As already  noted, CMS may ultimately determine that a satisfactory resolution is not  likely and therefore pursue the option to terminate its loan agreement with  the CO-OP. As of November 1, 2015, CMS had issued one termination  letter following use of the escalation plan.", "Escalation Plan Case Study: Louisiana Health Cooperative, Inc.  CMS officials learned in December 2014, through routine communication with the  CO-OP and the Louisiana Department of Insurance (LDI), that LDI was preparing to  notify the CO-OP that it had been found in a condition that would render continuance of  its business hazardous to policyholders, creditors, or others. CMS had previously noted  certain risks with the CO-OP\u2019s finances. CMS assessed the issue as an elevated  concern and issued a letter in January 2015 requiring the CO-OP to provide information  and a corrective action plan. The CO-OP responded in February 2015, citing problems  with its third-party administrator\u2014an entity with which the CO-OP had contracted to  process claims\u2014and describing its corrective action plan. CMS determined that the plan  was not sufficient and issued a letter in March 2015 requesting revisions. The CO-OP  submitted a revised corrective action plan, which CMS officials also found insufficient.  Meanwhile, in response to LDI, the CO-OP submitted updated enrollment and financial  data, which led CMS to question whether enrollment was sufficient for financial stability.  CMS issued another letter in April 2015, asking for information and a corrective action  plan to address these issues and stating that CMS would conduct a site visit. During  that visit, CMS officials observed a number of serious and pervasive deficiencies. In  response, CMS reassessed the issue as one of greatest concern and issued a letter in  June 2015, summarizing its findings and stating that a complete and quick resolution  was necessary to avoid termination of the loan agreement; the letter included specific  milestones and dates. The CO-OP\u2019s board met in July and decided to cease operations  by the end of 2015. According to CMS officials, the agency continues to monitor and  oversee the CO-OP as the CO-OP and LDI work to cease operations with as few  negative consequences as possible.", "In addition to developing the tools to evaluate performance and  sustainability and the escalation plan, CMS formed a committee that,  according to CMS officials, is to look at the CO-OP program as a whole\u2014 beyond individual issues or CO-OPs. The committee is to identify and  address risks to, and concerns about, the program and make  recommendations to address any risks or concerns identified. CMS  officials told us that the committee consists of officials from across the  agency with actuarial, health insurance, financial, legal, and health  insurance exchange experience and expertise.", "CMS is also using an independent auditor to conduct another review of  CO-OPs, focusing on compliance and financial management. A  preliminary audit phase was conducted to determine whether each  CO-OP had established and documented controls and processes for five  key areas, in accordance with the NAIC Market Conduct Examination  Standards: (1) claims, (2) policyholder service, (3) complaint handling, (4)  provider credentialing, and (5) marketing and sales. Based on the  results of the preliminary phase, the auditor is to perform one of two types  of reviews\u2014a general review or a focused review\u2014at each CO-OP; a  more focused review is to be performed at CO-OPs that did not appear to  have initially met the NAIC Market Conduct Examination Standards. CMS  officials told us that the preliminary phase was completed in June 2015,  and that the second phase is on-going and is expected to be completed  by the middle of 2016 for the 11 CO-OPs that continued to operate as of  January 4, 2016.", "CMS officials told us that prior to the start of the 2016 open enrollment  period, they assessed the CO-OPs with particular attention to their  sustainability through 2016. According to CMS officials, they worked with  CO-OPs and states\u2019 departments of insurance to address concerns  relating to CO-OP sustainability. The goal of these efforts was to provide  some assurance that CO-OPs with serious financial or operational  difficulties (or both) took timely and effective action to address those  difficulties or made plans to cease operations before the 2016 open  enrollment period, which began on November 1, 2015. In addition, CMS  officials told us that, to the extent possible, they plan to monitor CO-OPs  that have ceased operations. When a CO-OP closes, the state\u2019s  department of insurance takes the lead responsibility in winding down  operations. CMS officials told us that their goal is to work with the  CO-OPs and their states\u2019 departments of insurance to bring operations to  an end in a way that minimizes negative effects on members, as well as  to recover program loan funding to the extent possible."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CO-OPs\u2019 2015 Premiums Were Generally Lower than Their 2014 Premiums and Other Issuers\u2019 2015 Premiums", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Most CO-OPs\u2019 Premiums for 2015 Were Lower than Their 2014 Premiums", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis showed that in most of the 20 states where CO-OPs offered  health plans on the exchange during both the 2014 and 2015 open  enrollment periods, the state-wide average monthly premium for a   30-year-old individual to purchase a CO-OP silver health plan was lower  for 2015 than for the previous year.
