Using this  method, she said, has enabled her to identify opportunities for more  targeted assistance. For example, meetings with the Mauritanian military  led her and other DOD colleagues to modify a preexisting proposal to  provide the Mauritanians with two technically sophisticated video cameras  costing about $10,000 each and to instead purchase $1,100 cameras that  were more rugged, easier to use, and better suited to the Mauritanians\u2019  needs. In another case, she learned from her meetings that the  Mauritanian military has limited access to the Internet, after which she  developed a project proposal to instead use satellite communications to  transmit real-time intelligence to the Mauritanian military\u2019s national  command center. In Niger, USAID and implementing partner officials  stated that as part of the Peace through Development program, they meet  regularly with community action committees\u2014entities composed of  representative members of the communities where the program is  conducted. As USAID and implementing partner officials explained, the  community action committees play a vital role in gauging the needs of the  communities they represent, proposing activities to address the needs,  and using firsthand knowledge of their communities to nominate  participants for the activities who they believe to be at risk of becoming  involved in violent extremism. A USAID official stated that the committees  also assist in identifying absorptive capacity, as they help to ensure that  the skills individuals learn through their participation in Peace through  Development activities, such as vocational training, are ones for which a  market exists in their home communities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Use Bilateral and Multilateral Outreach to Identify Other Donor Efforts, but Some Donors Are Reluctant to Share Information", "paragraphs": ["U.S. agencies rely on various forms of bilateral and multilateral outreach  to identify and consider the counterterrorism efforts other donors are  conducting in TSCTP countries. With respect to bilateral outreach,  agency officials in all three TSCTP countries we visited reported using  meetings to coordinate efforts. For example, the regional security officer  in Algeria stated that through discussions with her French counterparts,  she had gained an awareness of the types of law enforcement training  the French were providing to Algeria. Similarly, a DOD official in  Mauritania cited a briefing she received from her Spanish counterparts  that provided her insight into the security assistance activities Spain is  conducting in Mauritania. Additionally, the regional security officer in  Niger stated that he has contacted security officers at several other donor  nations\u2019 embassies in Niger about their capacity-building efforts.", "With respect to multilateral outreach, U.S. and other donor officials  identified a variety of multilateral efforts that have facilitated donor  coordination and informed U.S. assistance decisions. For instance,  several officials named the Global Counterterrorism Forum and its Sahel  Working Group as key multilateral venues for sharing information and  insights on the counterterrorism activities of other donor nations. In July  2013, for example, State officials noted that a recent meeting of the Sahel  Working Group had been used to take inventory of the participant nations\u2019  civilian assistance efforts in the Sahel to ensure that U.S. efforts are not  duplicative. In addition, a European Union civilian mission in Niger has  assisted with international coordination. For example, through the  assistance of this mission, the U.S. embassy in Niger was able to  coordinate with the French on efforts to provide Niger with radios.", "These efforts notwithstanding, officials identified several donor nations  that typically do not share information on their efforts with the United  States. For example, the official who chairs the counterterrorism working  group at the U.S. embassy in Niger stated that China does not participate  in international donor coordination meetings. As a result, he said, neither  the United States nor other donor countries have visibility into China\u2019s  activities in Niger. In addition, officials at the European Union\u2019s civilian  mission in Niger stated that Turkey and some of the wealthier TSCTP  partner countries, including Algeria and Morocco, have provided  counterterrorism aid to Niger but do not customarily share information on  such activities with other donors."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Terrorist groups in northwest Africa continue to pose a national security  threat to the United States.

As  neither State nor USAID routinely collects or maintains these funding  elements in a central source, the agencies had to gather the data from  various databases. The process of gathering the data took several  months and, according to State and USAID officials, was very time- consuming and labor-intensive. To determine the reliability of the funding  data we received from State and USAID, we compared and corroborated  information from the sources the agencies relied upon, requested  information from State and USAID officials regarding the processes they  use to collect and verify each data source, and checked the complete  agency data sets for reasonableness and completeness.
