Prior GAO reports have found DOD's reported GWOT cost data unreliable and found problems with transparency over certain costs. In response, DOD has made several changes to its cost-reporting procedures. Congress has shown interest in increasing the transparency of DOD's cost reporting and funding requests for GWOT. Under the Comptroller General's authority to conduct evaluations on his own initiative, GAO assessed (1) DOD's progress in improving the accuracy and reliability of its GWOT cost reporting, and (2) DOD's methodology for reporting GWOT costs by contingency operation. For this engagement, GAO analyzed GWOT cost data and applicable guidance, as well as DOD's corrective actions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While DOD and the military services continue to take steps to improve the accuracy and reliability of some aspects of GWOT cost reporting, DOD lacks a sound approach for identifying costs of specific contingency operations, raising concerns about the reliability of reported information, especially on the cost of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Specifically, the department has undertaken initiatives such as requiring components to sample and validate their GWOT cost transactions and launching a new contingency cost-reporting system that will automate the collection of GWOT cost data from components' accounting systems and produce a new report comparing reported obligations and disbursements to GWOT appropriations data. Also, the military services have taken several steps to correct weaknesses in the reliability of their cost data. Limitations in DOD's approach to identifying the costs of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom may, in some cases, result in the overstatement of costs, and could lead to these costs being included in DOD's GWOT funding requests rather than the base budget. DOD guidance emphasizes the importance of accurately reporting the cost of contingency operations. However, while the Army and Marine Corps are capturing totals for procurement and certain operation and maintenance costs, they do not have a methodology for determining what portion of these GWOT costs are attributable to Operation Iraqi Freedom versus Operation Enduring Freedom and have reported all these costs as attributable to Operation Iraqi Freedom. In addition, the military services have reported some costs, such as those for Navy forward-presence missions, as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom, even though they are not directly attributable to either operation. In September 2005, DOD expanded the definition of incremental costs for large-scale contingencies, such as those for GWOT, to include expenses beyond direct incremental costs. This expanded definition provides no guidance on what costs beyond those attributable to the operation can be considered incremental and reported. Consequently, the military services have made their own interpretations as to whether and how to include costs not directly attributable to GWOT contingency operations. Without a methodology for determining what portion of GWOT costs is attributable to Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom, reported costs for Operation Iraqi Freedom may be overstated. Furthermore, unless DOD reconsiders whether expenses not directly attributable to specific GWOT operations should be included as incremental costs, the military services may continue to include these expenses as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, reported costs for both operations may be overstated, and DOD may continue to request funding for these expenses in GWOT funding requests instead of including them as part of the base budget. Expenses beyond those directly attributable to either operation may be more reflective of the enduring nature of GWOT and its cost implications should be part of the annual budget debate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the Department of Defense  (DOD) has been engaged in domestic and overseas military operations in  support of the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) around the world. These  operations include Operation Noble Eagle aimed at defending the United  States homeland against terrorist attacks; Operation Enduring Freedom  that takes place principally in and around Afghanistan, but also covers  additional operations in the Horn of Africa, the Philippines, and elsewhere;  and Operation Iraqi Freedom that focuses principally on Iraq. Congress  has provided about $808 billion in supplemental and annual appropriations  for GWOT since 2001, and DOD has reported total GWOT costs of about  $654.7 billion as of September 2008. For fiscal year 2009, Congress has  provided DOD with about $65.9 billion for GWOT as of March 2009, and  DOD plans on requesting an additional $75.5 billion for GWOT for the  remainder of the fiscal year. This is in addition to about $512.7 billion  already provided in DOD\u2019s base budget for other functions. Obtaining an  accurate picture of DOD costs is of critical importance given the need to  evaluate trade-offs and make more effective use of defense dollars in light  of the nation\u2019s long-term fiscal challenge and the current financial crisis. In  the past, we have reported on the need for DOD to become more  disciplined in its approach to developing plans and budgets, including  building more GWOT costs into the base defense budget.", "To meet internal and legislative reporting requirements, DOD compiles  GWOT cost data and prepares various reports that itemize these costs by  appropriation account, military service or defense agency, and  contingency operation. DOD uses these cost data, along with other  information, internally to evaluate cost trends and formulate GWOT  funding requests, and externally to inform Congress on the costs of the  war. Congress uses DOD\u2019s historical cost data to monitor costs, evaluate  funding needs, and to make GWOT-related funding decisions. Over time,  DOD\u2019s approach to reporting costs and requesting funds for GWOT  contingency operations has evolved. Since GWOT contingency operations  began in 2001, DOD has used existing financial-management guidance,  designed for small-scale contingency operations, to establish policies and  procedures for estimating the budget and reporting costs. In 2005, DOD  amended this guidance to include large-scale contingency operations, like  those in support of GWOT. In contrast to the guidance for small-scale  contingency operations, the amended guidance for large-scale  contingencies allows DOD components to include expenses in their cost  reporting beyond direct incremental costs, but provides no guidance on  what costs beyond those attributable to the operation can be considered  incremental and reported. Incremental costs are defined as additional  costs to DOD components that would not have been incurred had the  contingency operation not been supported. DOD has also revised its  guidance for building GWOT funding requests, beginning with its fiscal  year 2007 supplemental funding request, directing DOD components to  include funding needs related to what it characterized as the \u201clonger war  on terror,\u201d or costs beyond those directly attributable to Operation  Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. DOD\u2019s previous  guidance for building GWOT funding requests directed components to  request funding only for the incremental costs above base-budget funding  needed to support specific forces and capabilities required to execute  Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom during the  fiscal year.", "Over the years, we have reported on the need to improve the accuracy and  reliability of DOD\u2019s cost reporting and transparency of funding requests  for GWOT, and have made a series of recommendations to the Secretary of  Defense. For example, we previously identified inaccuracies in reported  costs for GWOT, and noted the lack of a systematic process and sufficient  management oversight to ensure GWOT cost data are accurately recorded.  DOD has implemented many of our recommendations, and continues to  focus greater management attention to improve GWOT cost reporting.", "More recently, we reported on the lack of transparency of DOD\u2019s funding  requests for GWOT, raising concerns over DOD\u2019s expansion of allowable  incremental costs to include costs for longer-term items. Specifically, in  November 2007, we reported that changes in DOD\u2019s funding guidance  resulted in billions of dollars being added to DOD\u2019s GWOT funding  requests for the \u201clonger war against terror,\u201d making it difficult to  distinguish between the incremental costs to support specific contingency  operations and longer-term costs typically associated with DOD\u2019s base  budget. We recommended that DOD issue guidance defining what  constitutes the \u201clonger war against terror,\u201d identify what costs are related  to that longer war, and build these costs into the base defense budget.  Although DOD agreed with our recommendations to some extent, as of  March 2009, it has not yet taken specific action.", "In the past few years, Congress has shown interest in increasing the  transparency of DOD\u2019s cost reporting and funding requests for GWOT,  particularly in the amount of detail available on the costs of specific  contingency operations. In fiscal year 2006, Congress required DOD to  submit reports of war-related procurement, equipment maintenance, and  infrastructure costs by contingency operation. In fiscal year 2007,  Congress required the President, for each fiscal year thereafter, to submit  full-year estimates of all funds required to support GWOT along with its  annual budget submission. More recently, in the Duncan Hunter National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009, Congress required that in  any future annual or supplemental budget request, DOD separately display  any funding requested for military operations in Afghanistan and military  operations in Iraq, and provide a detailed description of the assumptions  underlying this funding request for each operation.", "Ensuring reliability and transparency in DOD\u2019s cost reporting will be  important as the new administration and Congress evaluate DOD\u2019s funding  needs for GWOT in fiscal year 2009 and beyond. To assist Congress in its  oversight role, we assessed (1) DOD\u2019s progress in improving the accuracy  and reliability of its GWOT cost reporting, and (2) DOD\u2019s methodology for  reporting GWOT costs by contingency operation, including the types of  costs reported for those operations. We prepared this report under the  Comptroller General\u2019s authority to conduct evaluations on his own  initiative.", "To assess DOD\u2019s progress in improving the accuracy and reliability of its  GWOT cost reporting, we analyzed information reported in DOD\u2019s monthly  Supplemental and Cost of War Execution Report (cost-of-war report) and  cost data in the military services\u2019 individual accounting systems. We then  obtained and reviewed guidance issued by DOD and the military services  regarding data analysis and methods for reporting costs for GWOT. We  also interviewed key officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense (Comptroller), the Defense Finance and Accounting Service  (DFAS), the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force to obtain  information about specific processes and procedures DOD and the  military services have undertaken to improve the accuracy and reliability  of reported GWOT cost information. To assess DOD\u2019s methodology for  reporting GWOT costs by contingency operation, including the types of  costs reported for those operations, we analyzed GWOT cost data in  DOD\u2019s monthly cost-of-war reports, including the source data for those  reports in the military services\u2019 individual accounting systems. We then  obtained and reviewed guidance issued by DOD and the military services  for identifying and reporting GWOT costs by contingency operation. We  also interviewed officials from the Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller), Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force to determine how  they interpreted and implemented this guidance. As previously reported,  we found the data in DOD\u2019s cost-of-war reports to be of questionable  reliability. Consequently, we are unable to ensure that DOD\u2019s reported  costs for GWOT are complete, reliable, and accurate, and they should  therefore be considered approximations. Further details about our scope  and methodology can be found in appendix I.", "We performed our work from January 2008 through March 2009 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The costs incurred for contingency operations include the pay of  mobilized reservists, as well as the special pays and allowances for  deployed personnel, such as imminent danger pay and foreign duty pay;  the cost of transporting personnel and materiel to the theater of operation  and supporting them upon arrival; and the operational cost of equipment  such as vehicles and aircraft, among many other costs. Costs that are  incurred regardless of whether there is a contingency operation, such as  the base pay of active duty military personnel, are not considered  incremental and therefore are funded in DOD\u2019s base budget.", "DOD reports its GWOT-related costs in terms of obligations, which are  incurred through actions such as orders placed, contracts awarded,  services received, or similar transactions. When obligations are incurred,  the DOD components enter them into their individual accounting systems.  An obligation entry may include a number of different identifiers,  including information such as funding source and the contingency  operation, and the category of cost as determined by the individual  component. Volume 12, chapter 23 of the DOD Financial Management  Regulation directs components to capture contingency costs within their  existing accounting systems and at the lowest possible level of  organization.

In  addition, DOD\u2019s financial management has been on GAO\u2019s list of high-risk  areas requiring urgent attention and transformation since 1995. Factors  affecting the reliability of DOD\u2019s reported obligations include long- standing deficiencies in hundreds of nonintegrated financial management  systems requiring manual entry of some data in multiple systems, and the  lack of a systematic process to ensure that data are correctly entered into  those systems. On its own initiative and in response to our  recommendations, DOD has placed greater management focus on  weaknesses in GWOT cost reporting, such as establishing additional  procedures for analyzing variances in reported obligations and disclosing  underlying reasons for significant changes. In addition, DOD established a  Senior Steering Group in February 2007, including representatives from  DOD, DFAS, and the military services, in an effort to standardize and  improve the GWOT cost-reporting process and to increase management  attention to the process. In conjunction with the Senior Steering Group, a  GWOT Cost-of-War Project Management Office was established to monitor  work performed by auditing agencies and to report possible solutions and  improvements to the Senior Steering Group.

DOD also required its  components to review randomly sampled non-GWOT obligations to  determine whether the transactions were properly classified as non-GWOT  versus GWOT. According to DFAS officials, the new requirement has  improved the reliability of reported GWOT obligations because DOD  components are taking actions to improve their GWOT cost reporting  procedures and are making corrections when errors such as missing or  illegible supporting documentation, missing codes, and miscoded  transactions are found. DFAS plans to include a requirement to review and  validate GWOT obligation data in an update to volume 3, chapter 8 of the  DOD Financial Management Regulation.", "Second, DOD is initiating a new contingency cost-reporting system in  fiscal year 2009 called the Contingency Operations Reporting and Analysis  System.

This system pulls elements of GWOT transaction data directly  from DOD components\u2019 accounting systems into its data store. Limited  features of the system became available for use in October 2008 and it  should be fully operational by September 2009. Upon completion of the  project, this system should allow DOD and external users to have a  consolidated location to view and analyze data for the cost of war, disaster  relief, and all other contingencies. Users will have access through a Web  browser and should be able to filter data and perform various analyses.

As these GWOT  contingency operations have evolved over time, it has become increasingly  difficult to determine what costs can be deemed as incremental expenses  in support of these operations from costs that would have been incurred  whether or not these contingency operations took place, such as ship  operating costs for the Navy. For example, the Atlantic and Pacific surface  commands, which are responsible for managing the Navy\u2019s surface ships,  reported obligations for costs associated with ship operations and port  visits for ships deployed on forward-presence missions in the Western  Pacific. Navy officials told us that some of these ships are stationed out of  Hawaii, Japan, and Guam and operate near Malaysia, the Philippines, and  Thailand. According to Navy officials, these ships are spending more time  at sea and visiting more foreign ports in an effort to provide additional  presence in support of GWOT. In 2008, Navy officials stated that Navy  guidance expanded the definition of incremental costs in support of  Operation Enduring Freedom to include those costs associated with forces  operating in the Southern Command area of responsibility. We found that  the Atlantic and Pacific surface commands reported obligations for ship  operating costs and port visit costs for ships deployed on humanitarian  missions in Central and South America. Navy officials said that ships  deployed on humanitarian missions have visited countries such as El  Salvador and Peru. These officials told us that the Navy considers the  humanitarian missions to be GWOT-related because they benefit the  security of the United States by spreading goodwill and reducing the  expansion of terrorism in foreign nations. Costs for these missions are  included within the Atlantic and Pacific surface commands\u2019 ship operating  costs for GWOT, which according to our analysis represented about 21  percent (about $875 million) of the Atlantic Fleet and Pacific Fleet\u2019s total  GWOT reported obligations for operation and maintenance (about $4.2  billion) in fiscal year 2008.", "Until DOD reconsiders whether expenses not directly attributable to  specific GWOT contingency operations are incremental costs, the military  services may continue to include these expenses as part of Operation Iraqi  Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.

As the department prepares additional GWOT  funding requests for military operations in support of Operation Iraqi  Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, reliable and transparent cost  information will be of critical importance in determining the future  funding needs for each operation. However, DOD\u2019s approach to cost  reporting does not reliably represent the costs of these contingency  operations. Although DOD has reported significant costs for Operation  Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, the cost for Operation  Iraqi Freedom may be overstated, since DOD does not have a methodology  to determine what portion of its total reported GWOT obligations for  procurement and certain operation and maintenance costs is attributable  to each operation. Furthermore, it is difficult to determine whether some  expenses not directly attributable to Operation Iraqi Freedom and  Operation Enduring Freedom are actually incremental costs and incurred  to support those operations. Expenses beyond those directly attributable  to either operation may be more reflective of the enduring nature of  GWOT and the United States\u2019 changed security environment since 9/11 and  thus should be part of what DOD would request and account for as part of  its base budget. Due to the enduring nature of GWOT, its cost implications  should be part of the annual base budget debate, especially in light of the  competing priorities for an increasingly strained federal budget."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to improve the transparency and reliability of DOD\u2019s reported  obligations for GWOT by contingency operation, we recommend that the  Secretary of Defense direct the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)  to (1) ensure DOD components establish an auditable and documented  methodology for determining what portion of GWOT costs is attributable  to Operation Iraqi Freedom versus Operation Enduring Freedom when  actual costs are not available, and (2) develop a plan and timetable for  evaluating whether expenses not directly attributable to specific GWOT  contingency operations are incremental costs and should continue to be  funded outside of DOD\u2019s base budget."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, DOD agreed with our first  recommendation and partially agreed with our second recommendation.

In its  comments, DOD noted that it believes its components, for the most part,  have established formal guidance to strengthen internal controls and  capture all costs associated with Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation  Enduring Freedom from within their accounting systems. However, DOD  noted that the DOD Financial Management Regulation does include  guidance for DOD components to develop auditable methodologies, and  when actual cost by operation is not available, its components are  required to internally document the methodology used to develop a  derived estimate of the cost. DOD stated that it intends to strengthen the  guidance in its Financial Management Regulation to require an annual  review of the methodologies used to allocate these costs. DOD believes  this action will help promote reasonable cost allocations and consistent  cost-of-war reporting throughout the department.", "DOD partially agreed with our second recommendation that it develop a  plan and timetable for evaluating whether expenses not directly  attributable to specific GWOT contingency operations are incremental  costs and should continue to be funded outside of DOD\u2019s base budget.   DOD noted that it has been reporting contingency costs for several years  and its objective is to include all incremental costs attributable to the war  effort. DOD also stated that, as part of its continuing efforts to improve  both budgeting and reporting of war costs, it collaborated with the Office  of Management and Budget to refine the criteria used for determining  where costs will be budgeted, either in the base or contingency budgets,  and ultimately reported. DOD noted that it will use the refined criteria to  inform the development of portions of the fiscal year 2009 Overseas  Contingency Operations Supplemental Request and the full fiscal year  2010 Overseas Contingency Operations Request, which has not yet been  submitted to Congress. As a result, we have not yet been able to evaluate  DOD\u2019s actions to assess whether they meet the intent of our  recommendation, but will review these actions when the budget requests  are finalized and submitted to Congress.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional  committees; the Secretary of Defense; the Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller); and the Director, Office of Management and Budget.
