In fiscal year 2003, CFSA's total budget was about $200 million. Concerns have been raised about CFSA's supply of caseworkers, the foster care and adoptive homes, and the quality and timeliness of mental health services for foster care children. To help address these issues, the Congress appropriated $14 million in fiscal year 2004 to CFSA, the Department of Mental Health (DMH), and the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (COG) specifically for foster care improvement. GAO examined CFSA's (1) strategies for recruiting, retaining, and managing its caseworkers; (2) efforts to license an adequate supply of safe foster and adoptive homes; and (3) efforts to collaborate with DMH and the Family Court to provide timely mental health services to foster care children. GAO also reviewed plans for and use of the federal foster care improvement funds."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["CFSA actively recruited caseworkers and implemented retention strategies; however, caseworkers cited several management practices they said lowered their morale and adversely affected their ability to perform their duties. CFSA employed several recruitment approaches recommended by a number of child welfare organizations and exceeded most of its staffing goals for fiscal year 2003. Caseworkers cited high salaries and the training for new caseworkers as factors that encouraged them to remain at CFSA. However, GAO found a general consensus among the caseworkers with which GAO met that some management practices--poor communication, a lack of resources, poor supervision, and no rewards and recognition program--adversely affected their performance and morale. Agency officials said they had made some changes and were planning to take other actions to address these issues. CFSA has developed goals and strategies for recruiting new foster and adoptive homes and improved licensing requirements. CFSA has made progress licensing new families, although more families have stopped serving than expected. Further, CFSA does not have processes for identifying the reasons foster parents stop serving or for determining the effectiveness of its recruitment strategies. CFSA has standardized and raised licensing requirements for all foster and adoptive homes, but as of May 2004, 308 foster homes were unlicensed, with about 22 percent of CFSA's foster children residing in them. CFSA has begun collaborating with DMH and the Family Court to centralize and track mental health services for foster care children, but challenges remain to ensuring timely delivery. CFSA and DMH designed a standard process for referring foster care children to DMH for assessment and treatment and for tracking service delivery. DMH has also started expanding its service capacity for foster care children. For example, it has begun recruiting additional evaluators to perform assessments. While CFSA began using a database to track service delivery in August 2004, it has not analyzed the service delivery data collected on paper prior to August 2004 to determine whether foster care children were receiving timely services. Additionally, CFSA and DMH still face certain challenges, such as integrating caseworkers and Family Court judges into the new referral process. CFSA, DMH, and COG have spending plans that are consistent with the statutory language providing the federal funds, but only a small portion of the foster care improvement funds had been obligated or spent as of June 2004, in part because funding was not received until March 2004. Further, it is unclear how the District and COG plan to support some of these programs in the long-term because future funding is uncertain."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The District of Columbia\u2019s Child and Family Services Agency (CFSA) is the  agency with primary responsibility for the child welfare system in the  District of Columbia (the District). In fiscal year 2003, CFSA was  responsible for about 3,000 children, and its operating budget, which was  comprised of funds from the District of Columbia government, the federal  government, and private sources, was about $200 million. Many parties are  involved in the District\u2019s child welfare system, and several agencies  provide essential services. For example, the Department of Mental Health  (DMH) is responsible for arranging, among other things, evaluations to  determine the mental health status and treatment needs of children in  foster care. The D.C. Family Court was created as a court solely dedicated  to matters concerning the District\u2019s children and families and, as such, it  has jurisdiction over cases involving child abuse and neglect. In addition,  CFSA works with agencies in Maryland, Virginia, and other states to  arrange for placements of District children and also works with private  agencies to place children in foster and adoptive homes.", "Because CFSA was plagued with mismanagement and had failed to protect  some of the children under its care, the U.S. District Court has been and  remains involved with the agency\u2019s management and operations. In   1995, the U.S. District Court placed CFSA in receivership. In 2001, the  receivership ended, and CFSA then served a 1-year probationary period.  The U.S. District Court appointed the Center for the Study of Social Policy  (CSSP) to monitor and assess CFSA\u2019s performance. CSSP worked with  CFSA and developed an implementation plan to help the agency achieve  reforms ordered by the court and meet professional standards of care for  the children it serves. This plan, which the court approved on May 15,  2003, covers outcomes and activities for CFSA through December 31, 2006,  and sets performance benchmarks at 6-month intervals.", "The court-appointed monitor and we have reported that the management  and operations of CFSA have improved since the receivership. Yet, there  are still concerns that the agency may not have an adequate supply of  skilled caseworkers or safe homes for foster care and adoptions and that  mental health services needed for some children in foster care have not  been provided in a timely manner. To help address these and other  concerns about the District\u2019s foster care program, the Congress  appropriated $14 million in fiscal year 2004 to CFSA, DMH, and the  Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (COG)\u2014an  organization of government officials from the greater Washington, D.C.,  metropolitan area that works cross jurisdictionally to address issues  facing the area. CFSA received funds to upgrade its technology, expand  services to foster children, and implement a student loan repayment  program for caseworkers. DMH received funds to help it provide mental  health assessments and treatment to foster children in a timely fashion.  Finally, COG was appropriated funds to develop a plan for recruiting new  foster parents and a respite care program\u2014a support network of  individuals to care for foster children when the foster family needs to take  a break or attend to other matters.", "Congress is interested in knowing whether CFSA\u2019s strategies, processes,  and operations will help it to sustain the improvements previously  reported and further improve the District\u2019s foster care system as well as  what steps are planned or have been taken to use the appropriated funds.  Specifically, we were asked to assess (1) CFSA\u2019s strategies for recruiting,  retaining, and managing its caseworkers; (2) CFSA\u2019s efforts to license an  adequate supply of safe foster and adoptive homes; (3) CFSA\u2019s efforts to  collaborate with DMH and the Family Court to provide timely mental  health services to foster care children; and (4) CFSA\u2019s, DMH\u2019s, and COG\u2019s  plans for and use of the federal foster care improvement funds.", "To make these assessments, we reviewed and analyzed key documents  and discussed these issues with knowledgeable and affected parties. Our  steps included reviewing best practices and standards for child welfare  agencies developed by various child welfare organizations, CFSA\u2019s  recruitment and retention plans for caseworkers and for foster and  adoptive parents, licensing requirements for all foster and adoptive homes,  as well as relevant reports and data. We conducted discussion groups with  CFSA\u2019s caseworkers and supervisors; we also held a group interview with  foster and adoptive parents. For the discussion groups with caseworkers  and supervisors, we selected participants on a random basis, with  participation being voluntary. We also reviewed key DMH and COG  documents, and we analyzed the spending plans and budget data for  CFSA, DMH, and COG. Additionally, we interviewed CFSA, DMH, Family  Court, and COG officials, as well as national experts.", "We conducted our work between October 2003 and September 2004 in  accordance with U.S. generally accepted government auditing standards.

Families become  involved with the child welfare system after a report of abuse or neglect  has been made and confirmed. When agency officials determine that a  child may be further harmed or mistreated if left in the home, the child  may be placed in foster care. The federal government has allocated about  $7 billion each year to investigate abuse and neglect of children in this  country, provide placements to children outside their homes, and deliver  services to help keep families together. The federal Department of Health  and Human Services (HHS) is responsible for the administration and  oversight of federal funding to states to support the child welfare system.  Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, as amended, is a major source of  federal funding and is primarily used to pay for the room and board of  children in foster care.", "While HHS is responsible for setting standards and monitoring the nation\u2019s  child welfare system, state child welfare agencies are responsible for  administering the programs and monitoring the children and their families.  Child welfare caseworkers, assisted by their supervisors, are at the core of  the child welfare system. They are responsible for the management of  individual cases and for performing many critical tasks. For example, child  welfare caseworkers investigate reports of abuse and neglect; arrange  placements when children must be removed from their homes; develop  plans for the care of individual children; conduct visits with the children  and foster families; attend court hearings; maintain records on each case;  and coordinate with other agencies to obtain services for the children,  including mental health care. The primary role of supervisors is to help  caseworkers perform these functions, thereby meeting the needs of  families and carrying out the agency\u2019s mission.", "Child welfare agencies face a number of challenges in recruiting and  retaining caseworkers and supervisors. We previously reported that low  salaries hindered agencies\u2019 abilities to attract and retain child welfare  workers and their supervisors. Furthermore, we found that high  caseloads, administrative burdens, a lack of supervisory support, and  insufficient time to take training were issues that impacted caseworkers\u2019  abilities to work effectively and their decisions about staying in the child  welfare profession.", "CFSA manages the child welfare system for the District. CFSA receives  Title IV-E funding as well as other funds to support its programs. In fiscal  year 2003, CFSA\u2019s budget included $65 million primarily from two federal  sources\u2014Medicaid and Title IV-E. The Medicaid funds are used to cover  various expenses related to services for children in foster care, such as  specific therapeutic and medically necessary care. Other sources of  funding for CFSA include the District government and private grants. In  fiscal year 2003, CFSA\u2019s operating budget was $208 million. CFSA\u2019s  strategic goals for 2002-2004 are to (1) recruit and retain caseworkers,   (2) investigate abuse and neglect reports, (3) expedite permanency for  children, (4) recruit and retain foster homes, (5) promote agency and  neighborhood-based resources, (6) enhance agency information system,  and (7) complete court requirements.", "Like CFSA, the District\u2019s mental health service agency was placed in  receivership in the 1990s. When DMH was established in 2001, the mental  health system lacked the infrastructure to meet the needs of children,  youth, and their families. Among other problems, DMH lacked a sufficient  number of providers to accommodate the needs of the District\u2019s foster  care children. To better link foster care children to mental health services,  CFSA began to contract directly with mental health providers for services.  Consequently, the mental health service delivery system for foster care  children was fragmented with no single system of providers or service  standards and no centralized information system to track the provision of  services to foster care children. Further, the courts had no aggregate  information on court-ordered mental health services for foster care  children.", "Mental health services are considered critical for children who have  suffered abuse or neglect. For children in the District, assessment and  treatment are among the mental health services available through DMH.  Assessments are evaluations conducted by mental health professionals to  determine the mental health status and treatment needs of an individual.  For children in foster care, assessments are generally requested or ordered  on a case-by-case basis. Treatment, such as individual or family counseling  and group therapy, can be initiated when the result of an assessment  indicates that it is needed.", "Over the years, the Congress has enacted laws and provided funds to help  improve the District\u2019s child welfare system. The D.C. Family Court Act of  2001 established the D.C. Family Court and, among other things,  established procedures intended to improve interactions between the  court and social service agencies in the District. Also, the Congress  authorized funds to the District in fiscal year 2002 for the completion of a  plan to integrate the District\u2019s computer systems with those of the Family  Court and for CFSA\u2019s caseworks to help implement family court reform.  On January 23, 2004, the Congress passed the District of Columbia  Appropriations Act, 2004, (the act), which included an appropriation of  $14 million for foster care improvements in the District. Funds were  appropriated for fiscal year 2004 only, to CFSA, DMH, and COG for  specific programs.", "The act appropriated the funds as follows    $9 million for CFSA, of which $2 million would be to establish an early  intervention program to provide intensive and immediate services to  foster children; $1 million would be to establish an emergency support  fund to purchase necessary items to allow children to remain in the  care of a licensed, approved family member; $3 million would be to  establish a student loan repayment program for caseworkers; and   $3 million would be to upgrade CFSA\u2019s automated case management  system, known as FACES, to a Web-based system and to provide  computer technology to caseworkers;    $3.9 million for DMH to provide all court-ordered or agency-required  mental health screenings, assessments, and treatment to children in the  care of CFSA; and    $1.1 million for COG to develop a program in conjunction with the  Foster and Adoptive Parents Advocacy Center to provide respite care  for and recruitment of foster parents.", "The act also stipulates a timeframe for DMH to provide mental health  services to foster care children. The law requires the DMH Director to   (1) initiate court\u2013ordered or agency-required mental health services within  3 days of notification, (2) complete court\u2013ordered or agency\u2013required  assessments within 15 days of the request, and (3) provide the court with  all assessments within 5 days of completion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CFSA Has Actively Recruited Caseworkers and Implemented Retention Strategies; however, Caseworkers Cited Management Practices That Adversely Affected Their Performance and Morale", "paragraphs": ["CFSA has implemented various caseworker recruitment and retention  strategies; however, caseworkers told us about several management  practices that adversely affected their ability to perform their duties and  lowered their morale.

To help meet these goals, the agency has done the  following:    Sought employee feedback to identify good practices as well as  areas in need of improvement. CFSA officials conducted surveys,  held discussions with staff, and reviewed data from exit interviews to  identify good practices as well as areas for improvement. CFSA began  conducting exit interviews and issued an exit interview analysis report  in fiscal year 2003.

CFSA\u2019s pre-service training for new caseworkers  was cited as a positive experience by several caseworkers that  participated in our discussion groups and several who completed exit  surveys. This training lasts 8-\u00bd weeks and greatly exceeds the average  training time of about 3-\u00bd weeks offered by most child welfare agencies.  CFSA\u2019s training program involves both classroom study and on-the-job  training, and gradual assumption of case responsibilities under close  supervision. Caseworkers also cited CFSA\u2019s high salaries as a key  incentive for continuing to work with the agency. CFSA\u2019s current average  salary for a master\u2019s level caseworker is $41,440 compared with the  national average of $37,097 at other public agencies.", "The student loan repayment program funded by the Congress in fiscal year  2004 may further help CFSA\u2019s retention and recruitment efforts, once the  program has been implemented.

Also, they reported not having adequate office space to hold  confidential discussions with families and others involved with their cases.  Supervisors also cited the lack of resources as a problem that hindered  caseworkers\u2019 abilities to perform their duties. According to CFSA  managers, in May the agency bought a fleet of new cars, and in June of  2004, the agency bought new cell phones for every caseworker.  Additionally, CFSA is planning on adding shuttles to drop and pick up  caseworkers from regularly traveled destinations to help reduce the need  for cars.", "CFSA caseworkers also told us that management did not consistently  communicate with them about issues affecting the agency and its  operations. We also reported on this concern in our December 2000  report. During our recent meetings with caseworkers and supervisors,  they said, for example, that changes in policy and procedures were not  always communicated effectively or consistently throughout the agency.  Many caseworkers said that they were not aware of such changes until  they were in the process of completing an essential task, such as  requesting a clothing voucher for a foster care family, and that  caseworkers often heard of policy changes from each other. In exit  interviews from January 2003 through May 2004, some employees  suggested that communication be improved between all levels of  management and staff, especially related to policy changes. For example,  one employee filling out the exit interview form said that, \u201cWhat is policy  on Monday may not be policy on Friday\u2026. CFSA must improve the way it  communicates policy to its caseworkers. E-mails do not appear to be  effective. The trickle down method of providing information to  supervisors is also ineffective.\u201d National child welfare organizations and  other human capital experts suggest that management should maintain  clear lines of communication and involve employees in the decision  making process of changing policies. CFSA managers explained that while  they have a formal procedure for communicating policy changes and  routinely include caseworkers in the decision making process, changes to  practice standards that affect day-to-day operational matters are  communicated through less formal methods. According to agency officials,  these changes are communicated during staff meetings, via e-mail  messages, and newsletters.", "In addition, caseworkers said that many supervisors had not fulfilled their  responsibilities. They cited examples of supervisors not being available to  help them during a crisis to provide guidance and support and not  providing answers to questions affecting their work. One caseworker said  in an exit interview, \u201cMy supervisor seldom kept our supervisory  conferences or team meetings scheduled. She pushed tasks down that  were managerial duties and failed to state priorities when assigning  multiple tasks.\u201d Several caseworkers said that their supervisors had not  provided them feedback about their performance. We reviewed a random  sample of caseworkers\u2019 personnel files and analyzed those for   31 caseworkers who were hired on or before December 31, 2000.  According to a CFSA official, these caseworkers should have had  performance appraisals in their files for 2001, 2002, and 2003. While nearly  all of the performance appraisals for 2003 were in the files, only 1 of the   31 files included an appraisal for all 3 years. The primary role of child  welfare supervisors is to help caseworkers perform their duties. In  addition to assigning cases, supervisors should monitor caseworkers\u2019  progress in achieving desired outcomes, provide feedback to caseworkers  in order to develop their skills, support the emotional needs of  caseworkers, and help make decisions about cases. The quality of  supervision of caseworkers at CFSA is not a new issue. We also reported  that social workers cited the quality of supervision as a reason for their  decisions to resign in December 2000. Subsequently, to help improve the  quality of supervision, CFSA required its supervisors to complete several  training courses. However, as of August 2004, 12 of CFSA\u2019s 59 case- carrying supervisors have completed the training, as required.  Furthermore, according to agency officials, CFSA\u2019s supervisors were not  held accountable for performing their supervisory duties. CFSA officials  indicated in 2000 that they planned to take steps to help enhance  accountability for management and supervisory employees, including  developing a new agency performance appraisal system. CFSA\u2019s managers  acknowledged in 2004 that the performance of some of its supervisors still  needed to improve. The agency\u2019s 2004-2005 recruitment and retention plan  includes a new goal that focuses on providing supervisors and managers  with more training and support to help increase the quality of supervision.  Also, agency officials said that CFSA is developing new performance  measures to better hold caseworkers and supervisors accountable for  performing their duties.", "Furthermore, caseworkers said and CFSA managers confirmed that the  agency does not have a program to reward or recognize individuals who  perform well, make outstanding contributions, or achieve exceptional  results. The agency honors all of its caseworkers annually during the  month of May for Social Worker Appreciation Month with a Social Worker  Appreciation Day celebration. Human capital experts have said that an  individual recognition program is an important element and that workers  who are recognized and rewarded for hard work are more likely to achieve  maximum performance. Some caseworkers said in discussion groups with  us and during exit interviews that a formal rewards and recognition  program would enhance their morale, help create a positive work  environment, and improve staff retention.

In addition, the plan calls  for increasing the roster of licensed foster families by 50 at the close of  fiscal year 2004. For 2005, the agency plans to increase its supply of foster  families by another 100 homes. In order to have an additional 50 families  licensed, CFSA estimated that it must bring approximately 1,000 interested  families to its orientation sessions since about one-tenth of the families  who have attended past sessions became licensed, and an average of   50 families have left the program each year. Figure 2 summarizes the  foster family recruitment and attrition patterns.", "In addition to CFSA\u2019s own recruitment plan, COG prepared a report for  CFSA in 2003 that identifies specific, targeted recruitment strategies. This  report identifies strategies designed to attract potential foster and  adoptive parents with certain demographic characteristics from different  neighborhoods in the District. For example, the COG report suggests that  CFSA should partner with a local women\u2019s professional sports team to  host a \u201cFoster Care Day\u201d and conduct a presentation on foster parenting  during halftime. The report states that this recruitment strategy would  reach families from various District neighborhoods who would work well  with children who have special needs. In commenting on a draft of this  report, agency officials said that they have incorporated some of the  suggestions in the COG report, such as involving coaches and others  working with children in sports by partnering with the District\u2019s  Department of Parks and Recreation.", "CFSA also plans to establish a second unit dedicated to recruiting new  foster and adoptive parents.

Kinship homes house about   30 percent of the children in CFSA\u2019s care. Requirements for the temporary  license include a home study, criminal background check via the National  Crime Information Center (NCIC), and a health history of primary  caregivers.  Once a child is placed, the family must apply for a  nontemporary foster family license. Temporary licenses are good for   120 days and may be renewed once for 90 days as long as the family has  made a good faith effort to comply with the nontemporary licensing  process. According to agency officials, CFSA\u2019s goal is to be able to issue a  temporary license in 3 days. As of May 2004, two temporary licenses had  been issued and both took 2 weeks to process. Agency officials reported  that they are currently working with Maryland officials to develop a  temporary license for Maryland kinship placements\u2014a step designed to  further expand safety checks and decrease the length of time some  children spend in emergency placements.", "In August 2001, CFSA instituted new licensing standards for congregate  care homes, and in 2003 CFSA closed those that did not meet these  standards. Prior to these new standards, congregate care facilities  received a facility inspection but were not licensed. The standards cover  the physical safety of the facility, staff credentials, staffing ratios, and  required background checks for staff. In 2002, just after the publication of  the new licensing standards, most of these facilities\u201425 of the 28  facilities\u2014were issued provisional licenses in order to allow them time to  make physical upgrades required in the new standards. However, as of  June 2003, 4 of the 25 congregate care homes had been closed because  they could not meet these licensing requirements. Like traditional foster  homes, congregate homes are monitored regularly and licenses must be  renewed each year. Agency officials reported that although some  challenges remain\u2014for example, facilities have had difficulty finding staff  with the credentials needed to meet CFSA\u2019s requirements\u2014the new  licensing requirements have greatly improved the quality of congregate  care.", "CFSA broadened its oversight of out-of-state and private agency  placements in order to help ensure a consistent level of safety. In 2003, the  agency added staff to a unit that reviews the licenses of out-of-state  homes and manages contracts with private agencies that help place  CFSA\u2019s children in neighboring states. This oversight process gives CFSA  the opportunity to remove a child from a home if it finds a serious problem  with a family\u2019s license and, in the case of a less significant licensing issue,  the agency can work with the private agency to help correct the problem.  Because of previous problems, CFSA began requiring out-of-state private  agencies to provide foster families with support workers\u2014caseworkers  who make monthly visits and act as a liaison between the agency and the  foster parent. Foster parents who live in Maryland and participated in our  discussion groups told us that in the past they experienced many problems  obtaining a support worker but for the most part these problems had been  resolved.", "Additionally, CFSA has taken steps to establish performance-based  contracts with congregate care providers and private agencies. Agency  officials expect performance-based contracting to further improve the  quality of foster care homes by requiring contractors to achieve specific,  measurable outcomes on the level of safety and quality of care they  provide to foster children. As a first major step in moving toward  performance-based contracting, CFSA issued two requests for proposals  (RFPs). The first RFP, which closed in September 2003, sought contracts  for congregate care facilities that provide emergency care, group homes,  homes for teen parents and their children, and/or independent living  services. CFSA received 30 viable proposals for congregate care providers,  and agency officials planned to make awards for congregate care in  August 2004. The second RFP closed in February 2004 and sought  contracts to help place children in traditional foster homes. As of August  2004, CFSA was in the process of evaluating the proposals it received.

As of June 30, 2004, the agency reported having  processed 448 families through orientation, just under 50 percent of its  goal to have 1,000 interested families participate in an orientation session.  CFSA also reported that about 170 new families were licensed\u2014exceeding  its goal of 100 new families.

If CFSA continues to find adoptive homes for  children at its current rate, the agency should exceed the 315 adoptions it  finalized at the close of 2003.", "However, CFSA has not determined why foster families stop serving each  year. Child welfare experts recommend that agencies conduct exit  interviews with foster families and use these data to help improve the  program. Agency officials said that they believe the main reasons families  stop serving as foster parents are that they become adoptive families, have  served for many years, and are \u201cretiring\u201d from service, or cannot meet  licensing requirements because of issues such as a change in employment  status. However, agency officials could not provide documented support  for these statements and, therefore, cannot be certain that foster parents  do not stop serving for other reasons. In addition to systematically  identifying the reasons families leave the foster program, agency officials  can learn about ways to improve the program from exit interviews. Foster  parents we met with identified several ways that CFSA could improve the  program. For example, foster parents suggested that CFSA change some of  its training requirements and that CFSA improve the way information  about a foster child is maintained because information has been lost when  a  child\u2019s caseworker changed. We previously reported that CFSA\u2019s  automated case management system, FACES, lacked data on many foster  care cases and noted that information missing from the automated  systems can be lost and that such missing information requires  caseworkers to spend more time to become familiar with children\u2019s cases  that are transferred.", "By increasing the net supply of foster homes available, the agency reports  that it expects to achieve other important benefits. If there are more  traditional foster homes, CFSA can reduce the number of children placed  in congregate homes as required by the implementation plan. Further, with  more traditional foster homes, CFSA reports that it will likely be able to  facilitate more adoptions, given that foster parents often decide to adopt  once they live with a child. For example, as of March 2004, 614 foster  children (about 62 percent of children under CFSA\u2019s care with a goal of  adoption) were living with a family who intended to adopt them.", "Furthermore, the respite care program being developed by COG with the  foster care improvement funds may also help increase the net supply of  homes. Foster parents said during congressional hearings and group  interviews that a respite program would, in the long run, reduce attrition  because it would reduce stress and burn-out. COG has designed a respite  program that will recruit families from the District and other surrounding  jurisdictions who will voluntarily provide respite care. COG\u2019s goal is to  make 700 respite care placements by March 2005; however, the  organization does not yet know how many respite families will be required  to provide this number of placements. As of August 9, 2004, COG officials  reported that 6 families already licensed as foster care providers had  verbally committed to serving as respite families. In addition, 10 families  had completed training but were not yet licensed. COG officials also  reported that on August 6, 2004, they began soliciting respite requests from  foster families and that they plan to begin offering respite services on  August 30, 2004.

In an effort  to collaborate on the new referral process, CFSA and DMH officials have  held regular meetings and workgroups to plan, make decisions, and share  information regarding mental health services for foster care children. For  example, the agencies have made hiring and contracting decisions  together and have begun efforts to co-locate staff.

A child\u2019s case is forwarded to BSU  when a Family Court judge issues an order for mental health services or  when a caseworker makes a request for services. In the case of  assessments, a BSU specialist determines whether the type of assessment  requested or ordered is clinically appropriate for the child. When the  assessment request or order is deemed appropriate, the caseworker  submits a referral package to BSU. After reviewing the package for quality  and completeness, BSU forwards it to DMH\u2019s Assessment Center, which is  responsible for coordinating assessments of foster care children for the  Family Court and CFSA. Unless an evaluator is specified in a court order,  the Assessment Center assigns the child to the first available evaluator to  conduct the assessment. Upon completion of the assessment, DMH sends  the report to BSU and to the Family Court. When a child is referred for  treatment, BSU contacts DMH\u2019s Access Helpline\u2014a telephone hotline  providing crisis emergency services, enrollment assistance and  information, and referral 24 hours a day and 7 days a week\u2014to enroll the  child in the mental health system. Enrollment, which the Access Helpline  is to complete within 24 hours of referral, includes assigning the child to a  core services agency. The core services agency is notified of the  enrollment and is required to contact the child\u2019s caseworker within 7 days  of enrollment to set the first appointment for treatment. Figure 3  summarizes the referral process.", "To electronically track mental health service delivery, CFSA created a  database to capture data on new referrals for services for foster care  children and, began entering service delivery information in August 2004.  Prior to the implementation of the database, BSU was using paper referral  forms to manually collect information on foster care children being  referred for mental health services. According to CFSA officials,  preliminary data showed that as of July 2004, BSU was receiving between  80 and 100 referrals for mental health services a week, 40 percent of which  were for assessments and 60 percent for treatment. CFSA and DMH also  reported that, from mid-March 2004 through May 2004, CFSA completed  141 assessments and DMH\u2019s Assessment Center completed   111 assessments. With regard to treatment, from mid-March 2004 through  May 2004, DMH enrolled 286 foster care children to begin treatment in a  certified core services agency, of which there are 13. According to CFSA  officials, DMH\u2019s core services agencies were able to accept 95 percent of  the referrals of foster care children for treatment. CFSA treatment  providers accepted the remaining 5 percent, which were for specialized  services that a DMH provider did not offer, such as attachment therapy.  While officials were able to report some of the data collected manually,  CFSA had not analyzed the information to determine whether foster care  children were receiving mental health services within the statutory  timeframes.  However, Family Court judges and a CFSA report noted that  completed assessments could take from 30 to 60 days.", "BSU officials indicated that once CFSA\u2019s database is fully operational,  every child\u2019s electronic file would include information from caseworkers,  court orders, and DMH. For example, the file will capture demographic  data, the assigned caseworker, the child\u2019s mental health diagnosis, and,  where applicable, the judge assigned to the case. Additionally, the  database will allow BSU to establish an electronic record for each service  referral. According to CFSA officials, these electronic records would  reflect when the service was requested or court-ordered, the mental health  evaluator or treatment provider that accepted the referral, and the date the  service was delivered. To collect data on the first treatment appointment,  BSU staff plan to call the child\u2019s core services agency to ensure that  treatment was delivered. This approach may be burdensome for BSU,  since approximately 50 to 60 children are being referred to the core  services agencies on a weekly basis. CFSA officials anticipate that the  database will capture information on all referrals made after the initial  date of implementation. CFSA officials also said that temporary staff were  hired to enter the data for the referrals made since March 17, 2004.

In addition to new evaluators and treatment providers, DMH  has begun a competitive grant process to make several new types of  treatment available to foster care children.

For example, before assessments can be  conducted, caseworkers must prepare referral packages, which include  extensive amounts of information on a child. The caseworkers\u2019 ability to  prepare and submit referral packages to BSU quickly can depend in part  on how well they know the child or can obtain access to information about  the child\u2019s demographics; previous school, police or health reports; and  developmental history. A CFSA official estimated that it could take  caseworkers from 2 days to several weeks to prepare a referral package.  Further, the need for more intensive, complex assessments for some foster  care children can affect the extent to which services are provided on a  timely basis. In particular, DMH officials noted that meeting the statutory  timeframes for completing and reporting on assessments could be  problematic, because some complex assessments such as bonding studies,  which determine the extent to which a child has bonded with his or her  caregiver, require multiple appointments, and may take longer to complete  than other assessments. (See table 4 for a list of the types and purposes of  assessments for children in foster care.) Additionally, some types of  assessments have prerequisites that can lengthen the time needed for  completion. For example, to complete a neuropsychological assessment,  the child must first undergo a psychological assessment. To the extent that  some foster care children may require more complex, time-consuming  assessments than others, it may be difficult for DMH to meet the statutory  timeframes of completing the assessment within 15 days of the request or  court order and providing the results to the Family Court within 5 days of  its completion. According to one national expert in mental health system  reform, other jurisdictions generally have not legislated timeframes for  mental health systems to provide services, in part because different  assessments vary in the length of time required for completion.", "In addition to operating in a working environment that has extensive  information requirements and variations regarding individual need, CFSA  and DMH are working to better integrate caseworkers and judges into the  new referral system. While BSU is in place to provide clinical expertise in  making mental health service referrals, caseworkers and judges may not  be aware of or understand how to use the office. For example, one Family  Court official said that some judges have ordered that a specific DMH  evaluator perform an assessment, which may delay its completion due to  the evaluator\u2019s availability. A CFSA official working as a liaison to the  Family Court also indicated that caseworkers continue to contact DMH  directly to link children to mental health services, which may delay the  court order going through BSU for processing. To help educate  caseworkers about the new referral process, officials from BSU created a  fact sheet providing caseworkers guidance on how to link children to  mental health services. In addition, in May 2004, a BSU official began  meeting with caseworkers to formally present the new process and answer  questions.

Also, DMH officials said that they are working to include the new  types of treatment in the services reimbursed under the District\u2019s Medicaid  program as a longer-term mechanism to fund additional services. With  regard to assessment, it is unclear how the District plans to sustain the  funding necessary for the additional evaluators.  According to the DMH  director, DMH would continue to fund evaluators to provide assessments.  In addition, COG officials told us that they would likely need an additional  $500,000 from the federal government to continue their respite care  initiative through the end of fiscal year 2005 and hope that private sources  would support the respite program in the future. In commenting on a draft  of this report, COG officials said that they had received a partnership  commitment from a private source and would seek further funding as  needed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "As of June 30, 2004, Only a Small Portion of the $14 Million Had Been Obligated or Spent", "paragraphs": ["The District and COG did not receive authority over their funding until   6 months into fiscal year 2004.

CFSA has implemented effective  recruitment strategies and established retention incentives to help recruit  and retain skilled caseworkers. CFSA has also developed a plan to recruit  foster and adoptive families and instituted practices to better ensure the  safety of foster and adoptive homes. While these efforts are promising,  CFSA will need to continue to support these initiatives and monitor their  effectiveness. Several other initiatives have just begun and will need  sustained attention to ensure they are fully implemented. COG has not yet  licensed families to provide respite or offered respite placements and is  not certain about the number of families that will be needed to support the  program. CFSA\u2019s and DMH\u2019s process for providing mental health services  for foster care children was recently initiated, and it is uncertain whether  these services are being provided in a timely fashion. In addition, there are  several challenges remaining to ensuring the timely delivery of mental  health services, including DMH\u2019s ability to expand its capacity to provide  services. Furthermore, while the expenditures proposed in the District and  COG spending plans appear to be in line with the intentions of the act, it is  unclear how the District and COG plan to support some of the programs  and initiatives outlined in the spending plan in the long-term.", "However, some of CFSA\u2019s management practices have not created a  positive work environment for its caseworkers. Caseworkers play a  critical role in the District\u2019s child welfare system, and CFSA needs its  caseworkers to be productive, motivated, and committed in order to make  further improvements to the District\u2019s child welfare system. Without  making further changes in its management practices, CFSA may  experience decreases in productivity and increases in attrition of its  caseworkers. Further, low morale may affect caseworkers efforts to fulfill  their duties and provide adequate care to the children they manage.  Without consistent and effective communication strategies, caseworkers  may not be aware of what services they can provide to foster care children  and their families or the processes for obtaining such services. Without  supervisors fulfilling their responsibilities, CFSA caseworkers are left  without guidance and direction on how to improve on their performance  and fulfill their case management duties. Additionally, caseworkers may  not be making the best decisions about their cases, which in turn can  affect the care and services provided to children and their families.", "In addition to having a cadre of highly skilled and motivated caseworkers,  an adequate number of safe, foster, and adoptive homes is a critical factor  to improving foster care in the District. Despite CFSA\u2019s new efforts and  attention to recruiting foster and adoptive families, the agency does not  have a process for assessing the effectiveness of its recruitment efforts.  Therefore, the agency does not know which efforts are most productive  and which strategies should be continued or abandoned. Additionally,  CFSA does not have sufficient information about the reasons foster  families stop serving and leave the foster care system because it does not  have a process to solicit feedback from them. Such information could help  the agency improve its program and help reduce the attrition of foster  families."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To build upon the improvements underway, we recommend that the  director of CFSA take the following three actions:    Address human capital management issues that affect caseworkers by  establishing processes to consistently and effectively communicate  information about agency operations and developing strategies to help  ensure that supervisors fulfill their responsibilities.", "Develop a systematic method to evaluate its foster parent recruitment  efforts to help identify the most effective strategies.", "Conduct exit interviews with foster parents who stop serving to  identify the factors affecting their decisions and develop an action plan  to address those factors that relate to systematic issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We received written comments from CFSA on a draft of this report.

We reviewed CFSA data, such  as worker caseload counts, attrition data, and exit interviews. To check  the frequency with which performance appraisals were being held, we  reviewed personnel folders for a random sample of 80 caseworkers, of  which we excluded 49 caseworker files to include only those hired on or  before December 31, 2000. We reviewed national standards for child  welfare agencies set by the Child Welfare League of America and the  Council on Accreditation. Additionally, we met with several CFSA  program officials and the court-appointed monitor, the Center for the  Study of Social Policy (CSSP).

The  results from the discussion groups are descriptive, showing the range of  opinions and ideas among participants. However, the results cannot serve  as a basis for statistical inference because discussion groups are not  designed to (1) demonstrate the extent of a problem or to generalize  results to a larger population, (2) develop a consensus for an agreed-upon  plan of action, or (3) provide statistically representative samples with  reliable quantitative estimates. The opinions of many group participants  showed a great deal of consensus, and the recurring themes provide some  amount of validation.", "After an initial group interview with supervisors selected by CFSA  officials, we conducted four discussion groups\u2014one with supervisors and  three with caseworkers. We randomly selected participants to help ensure  that they represented a cross section of the organization. Attendance on  the part of invited participants was voluntary. For the three discussion  groups that were held with caseworkers, we had one with employees who  had been at CFSA for 1 year or less, one discussion group with employees  who had been at CFSA 1-6 years, and one with employees who had been at  CFSA more than 6 years. A trained discussion group moderator led the  discussions while our analysts took notes. We developed a discussion  group guide to assist the moderator in leading the discussions.", "To assess CFSA\u2019s efforts to license an adequate number of safe homes for  foster care placements and adoptions, we reviewed CFSA documents,  analyzed related data, interviewed agency officials, and held group  interviews with foster and adoptive parents.
