Using these services can inappropriately influence government decisionmaking if proper oversight is not provided. The five agencies generally did not consider and mitigate risks of acquiring professional and management support services prior to awarding the 12 contracts GAO reviewed. The Federal Acquisition Regulation requires agencies to provide enhanced management oversight for contracts that closely support inherently governmental functions. For the 12 contracts, few of the officials said they considered whether contracted services included such functions. In some cases, officials said they later became concerned that contractors might perform inherently governmental functions or that government employees lacked expertise to oversee contracted work, and took steps to mitigate risks.

The five agencies have participated in these efforts, including service contract inventories and multisector workforce pilots, to varying degrees, but only DHS has taken steps to incorporate related OMB efforts into processes that examine their use of professional and management support services. A September 2011 OMB policy letter requires agencies to develop procedures to improve their management of risks when contracting for these services, but does not include an implementation deadline.

They  were chosen in part to represent a variety of agency missions and based  on the proportion of their obligations for professional and management  support services in relation to their overall service obligations. Together,  these agencies accounted for one-third of civilian agency obligations for  professional and management support services in fiscal year 2010.  Because FPDS-NG does not provide definitions for service codes, to  better understand the services provided we judgmentally selected a  nongeneralizable sample of 235 SOWs from the five agencies, selecting  50 each from DHS, DOT, HUD, and USAID and 35 from NSF (which had  fewer contracts and task orders to select from compared to the other four  agencies).

Without proper management  and oversight, such services risk inappropriately influencing the  government\u2019s control over and accountability for decisions that may be  supported by contractors\u2019 work. Thus, the policy directs agencies to  ensure that they maintain sufficient government expertise to manage the  contracted work. The FAR also addresses the greater need for  management oversight associated with contractors providing services  that have the potential to influence the authority, accountability, and  responsibilities of government employees. Contractors are prohibited  from performing inherently governmental functions, such as determining  agency policy, directing federal employees, and approving contractual  documents, which require such discretion in applying government  authority or value judgments in making decisions that they can only be  performed by government employees. The FAR also identifies services  that can approach being inherently governmental, based on the nature of  the function or the manner in which the work is performed or  administered. Contractors can provide services that closely support  inherently governmental functions, but agencies must provide greater  scrutiny and enhanced management oversight to ensure that the  contractors\u2019 work does not limit the authority, accountability, and  responsibilities of government employees. The FAR includes an  illustrative list of 19 services that closely support inherently governmental  functions, many of which\u2014such as supporting policy development and  providing legal advice\u2014are captured in FPDS-NG codes in the  professional and management support services category.

The selected contracts or task orders originated from 2005  through 2009 and included a mix of both long-standing and new contract  requirements. For example, the DOT project management oversight  contracts at the Federal Transit Administration include services that have  been performed by contractors for more than 20 years.", "Contracting and program officials identified several reasons why their  agencies chose to award contracts for these professional and  management support services. Six of the 12 contracts or task orders were  issued or expanded in response to new requirements or workload  increases, such as the watch officer positions created to provide surge  capacity at DHS\u2019 Transportation Security Administration, an expanded  Sudan mission support contract at USAID, and short-term need for  procurement office support at HUD.

Often, agency  officials pointed to constraints on the use of federal employees such as  limitations for hiring federal staff or budget restrictions as a factor that led  to contracting for services. For example, NSF provides support to two  interagency offices established by memorandums of understanding,  which program officials told us have the effect of limiting the number of  government personnel who can work in the offices, so the majority of the  work is performed by contractors. Similarly, a senior Federal Transit  Administration official said that while Congress has authorized a portion  of annual program funds to be used for oversight services, the  administration is constrained from using these funds to hire federal  employees for this purpose. In another case, officials from HUD\u2019s  Government National Mortgage Association said that the agency  increasingly used contractors for data analysis related to mortgage- backed securities, in part because their hiring authority had not increased  in several years, so they did not have enough government staff to meet  their increased workload."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Officials Generally Did Not Consider and Mitigate Risks Associated with Contracts for Professional and Management Support Services", "paragraphs": ["Agency officials generally did not consider the risks of acquiring  professional and management support services before awarding the 12  contracts we reviewed.

In cases where officials did have  additional oversight measures in place, they did not link their actions to  concerns associated with risks from acquiring professional and  management support services. For example, the Federal Transit  Administration program office at DOT had developed standard oversight  procedures to address the contractors\u2019 roles and responsibilities for  overseeing grant recipients, including their responsibilities for conducting  assessments of the grantees and providing recommendations to the  agency. While the procedures acknowledge the government\u2019s decision- making role, they are an application of long-standing guidance that  officials said was created to ensure that each project meets its goals,  rather than additional oversight to address the risk of contractors  supporting inherently governmental functions. For other contracts,  contracting or program officials became concerned during the course of  contract performance that contractors were at risk of performing  inherently governmental functions, or that government personnel might  lack the expertise needed to oversee contractors\u2019 work, and took various  steps to help mitigate those risks. In these cases, we found that concerns  were generally raised by officials who were new to a program office or  contracting officials who had assumed responsibilities for an existing  contract. For example:", "A senior official in DOT\u2019s Office of Airline Information became  concerned about the lack of government employee expertise to  oversee information technology functions that had been developed  and exclusively operated by contractors for several years. The office  is planning to convert some of the contractor duties to federal  employee positions, but efforts to hire new employees have not been  completed because of budget constraints and competing priorities  within the Research and Innovative Technology Administration.", "The contracting officer and COTR in USAID\u2019s Sudan Mission had  concerns about interaction among federal employees and contractor  staff in a newly established mission office, fearing that security and  logistic challenges had left the government overly reliant on  contractors\u2019 expertise. To prevent the performance of inherently  governmental work by contractors and to ensure appropriate oversight  and capacity among the federal employee workforce, they developed  a mission order nearly 3 years after the contract was awarded that  outlined the government\u2019s responsibilities and provided training for all  personnel in the mission office.  In the two NSF contracts we reviewed, contracting and program  officials developed policy and procedure manuals after the contracts  were awarded to outline the responsibilities and workflow among  contractor and federal staff. Officials said that because each of these  offices is staffed primarily by contractors, with only one or two federal  employees, these technical documents primarily serve a business  continuity function. However, officials also said they help to ensure  that contractors will not accidentally perform or be tasked with  inherently governmental work.  In two of the DHS contracts we reviewed, officials identified risks  associated with some of the activities performed by contractors and  are now requiring the work to be performed by government  employees. According to a senior procurement official with Citizenship  and Immigration Services, the component has reduced the number of  contractors supporting the contract from 90 to approximately 22,  primarily by insourcing work\u2014moving it from contractor to government  performance\u2014such as acquisition and budget support. The contract  positions that remain are largely administrative specialist positions  that officials determined do not support inherently governmental  functions. Likewise, the Transportation Security Administration  insourced 12 contracted watch officer support positions, which involve  collecting information and monitoring domestic events that affect air  passenger security, and program officials said they plan to insource  the remaining call center positions in the near future.", "According to agency officials, at least 6 of the 12 contracts we reviewed  have been recently recompeted or will be in the coming year. Officials  identified various changes to the contracts going forward, but only a few  indicated that the changes were due to concerns with contractors  providing professional and management support services. For example,  USAID\u2019s policy office is changing some of the types of work performed by  contractors in that office, but officials indicated that these changes are  determined by how contract support can most effectively help the office  function, not by consideration of risk or reliance on contractors. Similarly,  HUD\u2019s Office of the Chief Procurement Officer ended its use of  contractors when it received additional funding for federal employees,  though program officials did not express any concerns about the type of  work done by those contractors. DOT\u2019s Office of Airline Information is  rolling its current contract into a larger, administrationwide contract  vehicle for the sake of potential cost savings, not to address its concerns  about the type of work being performed.

Through these efforts, Congress and OMB have  emphasized the need to examine contracted functions where agencies  risk becoming overreliant on contractors, such as professional and  management support service contracts. By focusing on the role that both  government and contractor employees have in performing work that  supports agency missions, these efforts emphasize the need to consider  how contracted functions fit into agency goals and priorities as part of  strategic planning processes.

Recent efforts that address professional and management support  services are described in table 4.", "OMB established criteria to help agencies respond to the statutory  requirement to develop a process for reviewing service contractor  activities to consider if contractor performance is appropriate, referred to  as insourcing guidance.

In 2009,  OMB also required agencies to conduct multisector workforce planning  pilots in one office or unit to gain experience with determining optimal  workforce balance and submit summary reports on their workforce  analysis. More recently, in 2010, OMB issued guidance to help agencies  conduct inventories of their fiscal year 2010 service contracts and an  analysis of the inventory, which provides a more detailed list of  professional and management support service codes, including program  management support and intelligence services that require increased  attention from agencies. OMB stated that it will issue additional guidance  to agencies for the preparation of the fiscal year 2011 inventories, taking  into consideration experiences with the development and use of the initial  fiscal year 2010 inventories effort.

In its most recent guidance, OMB\u2019s OFPP Policy Letter 11-01  reiterates a statutory requirement that agencies must give special  consideration to using federal employees to perform work that closely  supports inherently governmental functions.", "DHS developed insourcing guidance in 2009, and later expanded its  efforts by introducing a strategy that provides a more comprehensive  review process to help program offices balance their use of contracted  and government personnel. The Balanced Workforce Strategy includes a  decision-making tool intended to help program offices and the department  assess various risks associated with service contracts, including whether  the service supports a critical agency function. Using the tool, DHS  program offices are systematically reviewing all of their existing service  contracts to determine, among other factors, whether the services  requested closely support inherently governmental functions, their degree  of criticality, and the appropriate number of government personnel  needed to maintain workforce balance. According to DHS officials, the  review is being conducted in segments and contracts considered to be at  higher-risk\u2014including professional and management support service  contracts\u2014were prioritized for the initial reviews.", "The Balanced Workforce Strategy leverages the efforts of DHS reviews,  including the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review and Bottom-Up  Review completed in 2010. According to DHS officials, it is also in  response to congressional concerns about their use of contracted  services and our 2007 report on their use of professional and  management support services. However, DHS is also developing the  strategy to meet the various statutory and OMB requirements associated  with the multisector workforce, such as developing insourcing guidelines  as required in statute and identifying critical functions, as was outlined in  OMB\u2019s OFPP Policy Letter 11-01. At the time of our review, DHS officials  said the strategy was moving forward, but they considered the guidance  to be a draft because it had been based on OMB\u2019s notice of proposed  policy letter, and they were anticipating the final policy letter might require  changes to the DHS strategy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OMB May Have Missed Opportunities to Address Cost Savings and Risk in Two Recent Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["Two recent OMB efforts have highlighted a group of service codes for  increased attention as agencies address their use of service contracts,  but do not contain two codes\u2014Other Professional Services and Other  Management Support Services\u2014that accounted for a significant amount  of dollars obligated by civilian agencies on professional and management  support service contracts in fiscal year 2010 and may contain risks to the  government\u2019s control of mission and operations. At a White House forum  in July 2011, OMB announced an effort to achieve cost savings by  reducing agencies\u2019 spending on management support service contracts  by 15 percent by the end of fiscal year 2012. OMB later identified 12  service codes to define management support service functions, but did  not include these two codes, which together comprised 30 percent of  dollars obligated on professional and management support service  contracts in fiscal year 2010. The two codes were also not included in a  similar list of service codes provided in OMB\u2019s November 2010 guidance  for conducting service contract inventories and analysis.

(See table 5.) For example, requests for acquisition support  were included in contracts in the two codes at all five of the agencies we  reviewed. Additionally, because contracts in these codes can include a  wide range of functions, they may include multiple activities that  potentially support inherently governmental functions. For example, a  DHS contract coded Other Professional Services requested services  ranging from supporting program development and implementation,  policy, workforce analysis, statistical and financial analysis, and economic  analysis, to technical writing, web maintenance, mail and file operations,  training, and information technology support for various programs.", "According to a senior OMB official, OMB kept its list of inventory service  codes concise to help agencies focus their attentions on a manageable  number of services. However, by omitting these codes from receiving  priority attention in agencies\u2019 inventory analysis, particularly considering  that many of the services requested under these codes may closely  support inherently governmental functions, agencies may not conduct a  full analysis of risks related to loss of control and operations. While the  services specified in the inventory analysis list are intended to be  illustrative, the significant amount of obligations spent in the two excluded  codes also warrants attention, particularly for efforts aimed at reducing  spending for such services."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Long-standing OMB and FAR guidance has established the need for  federal agencies to consider risks associated with contractors providing  professional and management support services, particularly with services  that closely support inherently governmental functions. However, the five  agencies we reviewed generally did not consider these risks prior to  contract award. Additionally, only one of the five agencies had developed  guidance or practices over time to improve management of these risks.  Recent OMB efforts associated with the multisector workforce look to  increase agency focus on services acquired, not necessarily to reduce  the number of contractors, but to ensure agencies have sufficient  knowledge of the activities performed by contractors. The efforts  particularly focus on whether the government may be overly reliant on  contractors for certain functions and whether such reliance presents risks  to government control and accountability for decision making. OMB\u2019s  most recent policy guidance, OFPP Policy Letter 11-01, requires  agencies to develop procedures to address these issues. Such  procedures are an important step toward improved agency consideration  of risks. However, OMB has not established a deadline for when agencies  need to complete these procedures, which, if established, may help better  focus agency efforts to address risks.", "In the context of better managing the multisector workforce, there are  further opportunities to enhance the results of OMB\u2019s efforts. Agencies  are required to conduct inventory analyses to help them understand the  extent to which contractors support their work. Under current OMB  inventory guidance, agencies have been asked to focus on a detailed list  of professional and management support service codes, but not two  codes that account for one-third of fiscal year 2010 obligations under this  services category. According to our analysis, these codes contain the  same risks to mission and operation that OMB is intending to address.

DOT, HUD, and NSF also provided technical comments that were  incorporated into the report as appropriate.  USAID responded that it did  not have comments.", "OMB\u2019s Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) provided comments  by e-mail on this report. OFPP generally agreed with our findings and  recommendations, but provided technical comments on our  recommendations. For our first recommendation, OFPP commented that  the OFPP Policy Letter 11-01 addresses multiple management  responsibilities related to professional and management support service  contracts and it would likely establish agency time frames for agencies to  develop the required internal procedures more broadly, not just for  services that closely support inherently governmental functions. In  recognition of the interrelatedness of the critical functions that may be  performed by contractors, including those that closely support inherently  governmental functions, we modified the recommendation to reflect the  broader scope of OMB\u2019s policy letter.", "For our second recommendation, OFPP commented that it would  consider addressing contracts coded in FPDS-NG as Other Professional  Services and Other Management Support Services in the planned service  contract inventory guidance to agencies, but expressed concerns with  including these contracts under its current cost savings initiative for  management support services contracts. OFPP noted that the initiative is  focused on this fiscal year\u2019s spending and that changing the baseline  several months into the fiscal year would create confusion at the  agencies. OFPP stated that it viewed having clear and consistent  baselines as consistent with our recommendations on OMB\u2019s fiscal year  2010 contracts savings initiative and that it could consider expanding the  list of codes for a future service contract cost savings initiative. As our  analysis has shown, Other Professional Services and Other Management  Support Services accounted for a significant amount of dollars obligated  by civilian agencies on professional and management support services  contracts in fiscal year 2010 and may contain risks to the government\u2019s  control of mission operations. Including them in the planned service  contract inventory guidance to civilian agencies will be a good step in  expanding the agencies\u2019 focus on the use of contractors. In recognition  that agencies may have already started to respond to the cost savings  initiative for this fiscal year, we modified the recommendation to provide  OMB some flexibility for including these codes under the cost savings  initiative in the subsequent years.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

We requested 35 SOWs from NSF,  which had a smaller number of contracts and task orders from which to  select in these codes.
