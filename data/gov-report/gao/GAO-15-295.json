RTT accelerated education reforms underway and spurred new reforms in all 19 RTT states and in an estimated 81 percent of districts, according to GAO's surveys of RTT grantees and districts that received RTT funds. At the same time, states and districts noted various challenges to their capacity to successfully support, oversee, and implement these reform efforts. For example, about one-quarter to one-third of RTT states reported that their greatest challenges involved obtaining support from stakeholders such as teacher organizations. In contrast, districts primarily reported that their greatest challenges involved financial and human capital capacity, especially with competitive compensation and standards and assessments. Additionally, rural districts reported facing greater challenges than urban and suburban districts. Education is to assist grantees in achieving successful project outcomes according to its grants handbook, while holding them accountable for their RTT reform plans. Yet, GAO found no specific activities tailored to rural needs in areas grantees identified as most challenging. A better understanding of the capacity challenges rural districts face could help Education better target its technical assistance to districts that need it the most.", "In response to GAO's survey, many RTT states reported that technical assistance from Education officials and its contractor was more helpful than other RTT resources, such as web-based materials. Ten states also reported they would benefit from additional support in areas such as training and professional development. Education created a new office to oversee and provide coordinated support to RTT and other programs, and intends to develop office-wide coordinated technical assistance policies. Federal internal control standards note that adequate policies help ensure that actions are taken to address risks to achieving an agency's objectives. However, Education has not determined the type or amount of technical assistance to be provided and its policies are still being developed. RTT's $43 million technical assistance contract ends in June 2015, which may create a gap in assistance to states. Unless Education focuses on technical assistance activities that states found most useful, it risks providing ineffective assistance to programs supporting these education reforms.", "GAO's panel of RTT and grant experts identified key lessons learned, such as leveraging existing funding flexibilities under federal formula grants, to help address capacity needs and sustain reforms when RTT ends in September 2015. Districts and schools may not, however, be using these flexibilities to their fullest extent, in part because of uncertainty about what is allowed under federal requirements. Federal internal control standards state that information should be communicated in a form that enables an agency to achieve its objectives. Education lacks time frames for finalizing and disseminating new guidance for states to clarify federal formula grant flexibilities; and recognizes the need for, but has not developed guidance to help auditors better understand these flexibilities.

For example, according to RSN\u2019s evaluation report,  participants indicated they were satisfied with the quality of the support,  the format and content of the technical assistance activities provided by  RSN. Individualized technical assistance had the highest ratings because,  according to the evaluation report, it was designed to address a state\u2019s  specific implementation challenges. In addition, participants in the RSN  evaluation indicated that on average, technical assistance activities had a  moderate effect on states\u2019 ability to build capacity overall. The results of  the RSN evaluation also showed that while webinars were useful for  disseminating information to larger audiences and convening states on a  regular basis, they received lower ratings than other forms of assistance.  Our body of work on performance measures and evaluations has shown  that successful organizations conduct periodic or ad hoc program  evaluations to examine how well a program is working. These types of  evaluations allow agencies to more closely examine aspects of program  operations, factors in the program environment that may impede or  contribute to its success, and the extent to which the program is operating  as intended. Information from periodic reviews of RSN\u2019s technical  assistance efforts are an important factor in determining if adjustments  are needed to help grantees meet their goals for education reform.", "State officials we surveyed also identified additional activities that  Education could undertake that would better assist states with  implementing RTT. Specifically, 10 of 19 states reported wanting ongoing  professional development throughout the grant period, as opposed to  during the early stages of the grant. Ten of 19 states reported wanting  training to be provided in their respective states to make it more easily  accessible, rather than having to travel to Washington, D.C. Further, 11 of  19 states reported wanting assistance identifying skilled contractors who  could assist with reform efforts. Education officials stated that any  assistance it provides to identify contractors cannot compromise the  fairness and objectivity of the states\u2019 procurement processes. Education  officials also pointed out other legal challenges to identifying contractors,  such as prohibitions against endorsements of private entities. However,  Education officials stated they can assist grantees by, for example,  helping them to develop objective criteria, analysis, or research regarding  the qualifications of skilled contractors. They said they can also provide  resource lists using objective criteria, as well as technical assistance in  this area."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Education Established a New Office and Aims to Develop Policies that Reflect a Coordinated Approach to Providing Technical Assistance", "paragraphs": ["In October 2014, Education created the Office of State Support to expand  and sustain the collaborative approach to providing oversight and  technical assistance that began under the Implementation and Support  Unit.

Education officials noted that it was unlikely  that the department would receive such a large amount of funding ($43  million) for technical assistance again. They explained that the type and  extent of technical assistance efforts to states after the end of the RSN  contract will, in turn, be dependent upon the funding available for that  purpose.

Education has a monitoring and technical assistance plan for RTT, which  it has been using for the past four years and has continued to use during  the transition from the Implementation and Support Unit to the Office of  State Support. However, officials from the Office of State Support stated  that they planned to establish coordinated technical assistance processes  and procedures for all of the programs administered by the new office,  while meeting the needs of the states and their particular initiatives. For  example, they said they need to consider how to bring the various kinds  of monitoring and technical assistance conducted by different program  offices together to provide support for and make connections across  programs, and be less burdensome for states. Officials stated that they  formed a working group of staff from various Education program offices,  including former Implementation and Support Unit staff, to help inform the  new office\u2019s coordinated technical assistance policies.

Three experts  stated that there are several ways that states and districts can leverage  the funds they receive annually in formula grants to help sustain  reforms. The Title I formula grant\u2014designed to improve schools with  high concentrations of students from low-income families\u2014gives districts  and schools flexibility to use federal funds to support instructional  strategies and methods that best meet local needs. For example, schools  where at least 40 percent of students are from low-income families may  operate \u201cschool-wide\u201d Title I programs, which allow schools to combine  Title I funds with other federal, state, and local funds to improve the  overall instructional program for all children in a school. In the 2012\u20132013  school year, approximately 40,632 schools, or 74 percent of all Title I  schools, operated school-wide programs.", "Despite the large number of schools running a school-wide program,  districts and schools may not be using the flexibilities to combine Title I  funds with other federal funds to their fullest extent due, in part, to a lack  of organizational capacity at the state and district levels. According to  Education officials and two experts on our panel, states and districts are  often uncertain about whether they are allowed to combine federal  formula grants in new ways to support comprehensive reforms. For  example, Education officials told us that historically, states and districts  have used Title II funds\u2014formula grants designed in part to increase  student academic achievement through strategies such as improving  teacher and principal quality\u2014to reduce class size. However, according  to Education\u2019s guidance, states and districts could also choose to  combine Title I and Title II funds to sustain reforms initiated under RTT,  such as providing academic support coaches and financial incentives and  rewards to attract and retain qualified and effective teachers to help low- performing schools. According to five experts on our panel,  uncertainties about what is allowed may stem from lack of communication  and coordination among the multiple federal education program and  financial management offices, and because these offices are not always  focused on helping states and districts better leverage their funds.", "GAO/AIMD-00-21.3.1. programs to support the four core reform areas. Further, in 2013, the  Council of Chief State School Officers developed a toolkit for states to  help clarify how districts and schools may spend K-12 federal formula  grants. This toolkit encourages states to improve collaboration among  offices supported by federal grants to help ensure they effectively  leverage federal funds. Currently, Education is working with RSN to  develop another toolkit for states and districts on ways to leverage federal  formula grants to sustain educational reforms. Education officials could  not provide definitive time frames for the release and dissemination of the  toolkit, but noted that they are hoping to release it sometime in 2015. This  toolkit, when finalized, may help states and districts better understand  how to leverage their formula grants to sustain reform activities and help  raise student achievement\u2014a primary objective of education reform.", "Education officials and one expert participating on our panel also said that  states and districts do not use funding flexibilities to their fullest extent  because they have concerns about compliance with state audit  requirements. Education officials explained that states and auditors may  believe that federal law prohibits certain activities, even when the law and  its implementation rules do not. Education officials told us they tried to  address these uncertainties by issuing guidance to clarify how states and  districts can leverage federal funds to support reforms. According to this  guidance, states may use Title I funds to provide technical assistance to  low-achieving schools, and districts may consolidate Title I, Title II, and  IDEA funds in schools under the school-wide program to support  comprehensive reforms by, for example, extending the school day or  school year. However, Education officials said that there is still confusion about this issue, particularly among the audit community, and  that it needs to provide new guidance to help auditors better understand  allowable spending within federal formula grants, especially with Title I  funds. However, it does not have a definitive plan for developing and  implementing this guidance. Such guidance\u2014when developed and fully  implemented\u2014may help auditors better understand funding flexibilities in  existing formula grants and help states and districts fully leverage these  flexibilities.", "Further, the pending reauthorization of ESEA also provides an  opportunity to address these capacity issues. Education told us that it is  exploring new options to help states and districts build capacity to  implement comprehensive reforms, including increasing the portion of  Title I grant funds that can be set aside for administrative purposes.  Currently, two of the set-asides in the Title I program limit the maximum  percentage of funds that can be set aside to support state administrative  functions and districts\u2019 school improvement activities. Specifically, ESEA  requires that a state generally spend no more than 1 percent (or  $400,000, whichever is greater) of its Title I funds on state  administration and 4 percent on district school improvement activities.", "Education told us that the current portion of funds under the ESEA Title I  grant that may be used for administrative functions may be inadequate  given the range and complexity of state-level work in supporting effective  implementation of local Title I projects. In its fiscal year 2016 budget  proposal, the Administration proposed increasing the funds a state can  spend on administration from 1 percent to 3 percent. According to  Education officials, the trade-off, particularly in a tight fiscal environment,  is that larger set-asides may reduce the portion of available funds that  would transfer to districts and schools to implement programs. In the  current Congress, the Student Success Act, which was reported out of  the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, would make  changes to both of these set-asides.", "To help address human capital and stakeholder capacity challenges, five  experts on our panel noted the importance of fostering partnerships  between a state and its districts, among districts within a state, and with  non-governmental entities by, for example, convening groups of experts  across the state to share expertise, solve problems, and share lessons  learned to help leverage knowledge and talent. They further noted the  potential for such a strategy to solve common challenges, such as how to  develop effective strategies for evaluating teachers who teach subjects  that are not assessed using standardized tests (e.g. foreign language or  art). Universities with research and professional development institutes  are another potential resource to help states and districts build and  sustain human capital capacity. For example, one expert noted that  strong relationships with higher education institutions and teacher unions  are needed to revamp teacher, principal and superintendent training  programs and teacher licensure requirements. Lastly, three panelists said  that to maintain key stakeholder support for reforms, states need to show  progress in meeting their established time frames for RTT reform, or  increase student achievement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Observations from Experts May Help Education Address Capacity Concerns in Future Grant Competitions", "paragraphs": ["Three experts on our panel noted that competitive grants may be better  suited than formula grants for spurring reforms and innovative  approaches, but varying levels of capacity among states and districts  raises concerns about their ability to win competitive grants and  successfully implement large-scale education reforms. Research  suggests that states\u2019 capacity was an important variable in helping to  predict who applied for RTT funds and which states scored well during  the competition. In particular, a 2011 study found that states with quality  standards and accountability procedures, and that had achieved overall  student gains, were more likely to receive higher scores during the RTT  grant competition. When making competitive grant awards in the future,  Education officials told us they expect to look at demonstrated capacity as  evidenced by a state\u2019s performance under previous grants and may offer  a competitive priority for previous success. To help states and districts  that may be struggling in these areas, experts participating on our panel  made four observations that they believe could be incorporated into the  design of future competitive grants to help level the playing field between  high- and low-capacity states and districts. Education has incorporated  some of the observations into its competitive grant programs to varying  degrees and pointed out some advantages and disadvantages of each.", "Observation 1: Allow joint applications so that states and  districts with greater capacity can partner with those with less  capacity. Education noted that it used this approach in recent grant  competitions. Education encouraged states that opted to adopt a  common set of college- and career-ready standards to form  collaborative groups to apply for RTT assessment grants to develop  assessments aligned with the new standards. A 2011 study  proposed that such arrangements could help states with less capacity  more easily benefit from the initiatives of ones with more capacity by  helping them identify partners and providing them access to funds that  may help valuable reforms gain traction. Education officials told us,  however, that when they have allowed joint applications or consortia  for some competitive grants, the complexity of implementing the  grants increased because states have different procurement rules  which take longer to navigate. Education officials also noted that  these joint initiatives sometimes take longer to implement because  states have to establish a framework for how they are going to  coordinate.", "Observation 2: Staggering or \u201cphasing\u201d competitive grant  funding to allow for varying capacity needs of grantees.  Education officials told us that they have had mixed success using  planning grants to allow grantees additional time to build capacity to  implement plans. For example, Education used a two-phase strategy  for awarding competitive grants under its Promise Neighborhoods  grant program, including 1-year planning grants to organizations to  enhance the grantees\u2019 capacity and a separate competition for a 5- year implementation grant to organizations that demonstrated they  were ready to implement their plans. However, we recently reported  that Education did not communicate clearly to grantees about its  expectations for the planning grants and the likelihood of receiving  implementation grants. Education officials told us that they do not  always have the authority to offer this feature, but they consider it  where it is possible. Education officials told us that they are  considering adding a planning year to the School Improvement Grant,  which is federal money awarded to states that states, in turn, award to  districts using a competitive process. Education officials told us that  they believe that low-capacity districts could benefit from this  approach, but noted that it will be important to emphasize their  expectation that grantees use the planning year to build capacity to  implement their reform plans.", "Observation 3: Allowing intermediary entities that often help  coordinate or provide technical assistance to districts to apply  for competitive grants. Education officials told us that they see a  benefit to using partners such as nonprofit organizations to drive  reform, noting, for example, that the Investing in Innovation program  allows nonprofits to partner with school districts as part of the  application process and throughout the grant period. Research  supports such an approach as well. A 2011 RAND study examining  the federal and state role in improving schools in 15 states found that  although some states assumed primary responsibility for assisting  low-performing schools, others relied on regional organizations, area  education agencies, or intermediate school districts to fill this role.However, Education officials noted that applicant eligibility is generally  defined in statute.", "Observation 4: Streamlining Education\u2019s grant application  processes to make it easier for states and districts with less  capacity to apply. Education officials told us that one example of  streamlining the grant process was allowing states that did not win an  award in the first phase of a competition to revise the same  application and resubmit for subsequent phases. Education adopted  this strategy in the RTT grant competition. Another way to streamline  the grant application process is by encouraging shorter applications.  Education officials said it used this approach in a grant competition for  the Investing in Innovation program.

Further, as the RTT  grant period comes to an end, RTT states may need to better leverage  their federal formula grants to continue to support comprehensive reform  in the absence of RTT funds. Education officials and other experts have  emphasized the importance of leveraging existing funding flexibilities in  education formula grants to help states implement and sustain large-scale  reform efforts. However, concerns about a lack of communication  between states\u2019 program and financial management offices, as well as  concerns about non-compliance with state and federal requirements may  be limiting states\u2019 willingness to use the funding flexibilities present in  current law to develop and implement strategies tailored to their unique  local needs.

These could include: providing individualized technical assistance to states, such as that  currently provided by Education program officers;  facilitating communities of practice to promote opportunities for  collaboration across states; providing professional development (or training) throughout the grant  period, as opposed to only during the early stages of the grant; making training more easily accessible by conducting training locally  in their respective states, when possible; and  to the extent permissible in the context of federal and state  requirements and restrictions, exploring the possibility of assisting  states in identifying skilled contractors to help implement reform  efforts.", "To help states address capacity challenges as they sustain  comprehensive education reforms similar to RTT, we recommend that the  Secretary of Education direct the Office of State Support to take steps,  such as: providing ongoing individualized technical assistance to states to help  them target assistance to rural districts, particularly in the reform  areas that were most challenging for rural districts;  finalizing and disseminating guidance to be included in Education\u2019s  toolkit to help states leverage federal formula grants to sustain  education reforms; and  clarifying and improving understanding of how funding flexibilities in  existing formula grants could be used to support education reform  efforts to help states and the audit community address impediments to  using formula grants in different ways."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Education for  comment.

To this end,  Education described plans to build on its generally successful RTT  monitoring strategy to develop a consolidated technical assistance  strategy for all programs under the auspices of the Office of State  Support. We have added clarifying language in the body of the report to  better reflect existing elements of the RTT monitoring and technical  assistance plan.", "Education\u2019s plan to provide coordinated policy development, performance  management, technical assistance, and data analysis services through a  structure intended to more effectively support the implementation of key  reforms and provide individualized support is a positive step. These  coordinated policies and procedures could continue to support RTT  grantees as well as other grantees under other Office of State Support  programs that have a role in helping states implement comprehensive  education reforms. However, we continue to believe that until these  policies are fully implemented, Education risks providing less effective  support than it otherwise might. Further, as Education\u2019s technical  assistance contract for RSN comes to an end, we continue to believe that  Education should take explicit steps to incorporate into its new  consolidated assistance strategy for all programs under the Office of  State Support the technical assistance activities that RTT grantees  identified as being most helpful to them in sustaining their reforms. In  addition, Education should incorporate those additional supports that  states reported as desirable. We have clarified the intent of our  recommendation accordingly.", "In response to our second recommendation, Education agreed that it is  important to identify ways to help states target assistance to rural districts.  Education stated, however, that the draft report does not adequately  recognize the actions it has taken to support RTT grantees in rural states  and districts, and provided a list of 17 activities it has undertaken through  RSN to support rural areas. We acknowledge Education\u2019s efforts to  provide support to rural areas and have incorporated additional  information in the draft report, as appropriate, to reflect this. However, in  further reviewing these 17 activities, we found significant limitations and  believe our overall finding and corresponding recommendation is still  warranted.

According  to our survey of all 19 RTT states, web-based resources were among  the least helpful to RTT states in building and sustaining the  necessary capacity to implement reforms. Only one of the 17 activities  provided individualized technical assistance which, according to our  survey, was the most helpful form of assistance to RTT states. We  realize that Education formed RSN to provide support in a variety of  formats and agree that RSN has generally well supported RTT  grantees. However, given the unique capacity challenges that rural  districts face, we believe there is value in offering technical assistance  tailored to the individual needs of rural areas.", "According to our generalizable survey of districts that received RTT  funds, rural districts faced statistically significantly greater challenges  than urban districts in implementing reforms in two areas: standards  and assessments and data systems. However, 14 of the 17 RSN  activities focused on the other two reform areas (school turnaround  and effective teachers and leaders). RSN\u2019s efforts to focus resources  on assisting states in implementing RTT reforms are important ones,  and we believe that many states and districts may have benefitted  from these efforts. However, in order to best support states that are  working to implement and sustain reforms in their rural districts,  Education should target future support in the reform areas in which  rural districts most struggled: standards and assessments and data  systems. Accordingly, we modified our recommendation to clarify that  Education should take steps to provide targeted assistance to states  in those reform areas that we have identified as statistically  significantly more challenging for rural districts.", "Many of the activities undertaken to support rural districts were  conducted in 2012 and 2013 (6 of the 11 that included specific dates)  when states and districts were fully engaged in implementing RTT  reforms. However, our survey of districts that received RTT funds was  deployed from June through September 2014, and the results  indicated that rural districts continued to face challenges long after  they would have availed themselves of these resources.", "Some of the activities (6 of 17) provided support that was not  specifically tailored for rural districts; rather, it could be applied in  rural, suburban, and urban school settings alike. We continue to  believe that opportunities exist to help states better target support to  rural districts. Without a better understanding of the unique capacity  challenges that rural districts face, and a more focused approach to  providing support, Education may not be able to help the states and  districts that need it the most.", "Finally, Education recognized the importance of clarifying its guidance on  the use of funding flexibilities and provided several examples of \u201cDear  Colleague\u201d letters it has provided to states. We referenced one of these  letters in the draft of the report. We did not include the other two \u201cDear  Colleague\u201d letters (guidance related to leveraging federal funds to support  school counselors and digital education) because they do not address the  use of funding flexibilities in support of education reform initiatives, which  was at the heart of our finding and corresponding recommendation. To  address this apparent confusion we have clarified our recommendation  accordingly. We noted in our report, and Education emphasized, that it is  working with RSN to release new guidance in 2015 on ways to leverage  federal grants to sustain educational reforms.

We pretested draft versions of the instrument with state  educational agency officials in three states and officials in four districts to  check the clarity of the questions and the flow and layout of the survey.  On the basis of the pretests, we made revisions to both surveys. We  contacted respondents to clarify any questions or responses where  appropriate. Further, using a web-based survey and allowing state and  district officials to enter their responses into an electronic instrument  created an automatic record for each state and district and eliminated the  errors associated with a manual data entry process. In addition, the  programs used to analyze the survey data were independently verified to  ensure the accuracy of this work."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Expert Panel", "paragraphs": ["To obtain information on lessons learned from RTT that could inform  future education reform efforts, we convened a group of knowledgeable  individuals for an expert panel. In identifying the experts, we compiled a  preliminary list of 15 individuals with research or professional experience  related to RTT reforms, state and district capacity, federal grant making,  and state or federal education policy. These experts represented the  following entities: state educational agencies, school districts, education  associations, academia, and education think tanks. They also included a  former Education official and a representative from Education\u2019s Office of  Inspector General. We identified a state educational agency official based  on participation in RTT and the state\u2019s proximity to Washington, D.C.  where the panel was convened.", "To obtain a different local perspective, we selected a school district  official from a different state. In addition, we selected the school district  based on proximity to Washington, D.C. and the extent to which the  district had completed questions in our district survey. An external expert  who conducted extensive research on K-12 education and federal policy  vetted our initial list of panelists. We used feedback from this expert,  along with biographical information about the experts, to determine which  experts would be invited to participate.", "The resulting 10 experts participated in a 1-day panel focused on capacity  challenges and their implications for RTT reforms and future competitive  grants (see appendix V for list of participants). Each panelist completed a  questionnaire to document any conflicts of interest. This information was  not used to determine the qualification of the expert for the panel, but to  ensure that we were aware of circumstances that could be viewed by  others as affecting the expert\u2019s point of view on these topics. We  developed discussion topics and questions for the panelists based on  information gathered from the surveys, interviews, and academic  literature. A contractor recorded the panel and transcribed the discussion.  We performed a content analysis of the transcript of the panel discussion  to develop common themes among the experts on lessons learned from  RTT that could help sustain reform efforts, inform the design or  implementation of future education competitive grants, and inform future  education reform efforts. We tallied responses for each panelist who  commented on those themes.

We reviewed RTT  applications to identify commitments states made to build capacity to  implement RTT initiatives. To identify actions taken to build capacity, we  compared the states\u2019 commitments to information provided in their  progress reports for school year 2012-2013. We also reviewed  information on Education\u2019s efforts to assist states with building capacity,  such as guidance, technical assistance, webinars, and other information  on the RTT website. We interviewed federal officials from the  Implementation and Support Unit in Education\u2019s Office of the Deputy  Secretary and staff from the newly established Office of State Support. In  addition, we conducted interviews with a variety of interested parties,  such as educational organizations, researchers, and university  professors. For example, we met with representatives from the American  Association of School Administrators, the Council of Chief State School  Officers, and the Center on Reinventing Public Education, among others.  We also conducted follow-up interviews with officials in four state  educational agencies and three districts to obtain more detailed  information and illustrative examples.
