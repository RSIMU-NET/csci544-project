NextGen will transform the current radar-based air traffic control system into a satellite-based system. Pilot and air traffic controller roles and responsibilities are expected to become more automated, thereby requiring an understanding of human factors, which studies how humans' abilities, characteristics, and limitations interact with the design of the equipment they use, environments in which they function, and jobs they perform. FAA and NASA are tasked with incorporating human factors issues into NextGen. As requested, this report discusses the extent to which FAA's and NASA's human factors research (1) is coordinated and (2) supports NextGen. To address these issues, GAO reviewed coordination mechanisms and planning documents and synthesized the views of nine aviation human factors experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While FAA and NASA officials are coordinating their NextGen human factors research efforts in a variety of ways, they lack a cross-agency human factors plan for coordination. FAA and NASA have participated in research advisory committees and interagency research transition teams, signed interagency agreements, and held cross-agency meetings and conferences focused on human factors issues. FAA also created a human factors portfolio to identify and address priority human factors issues but not a cross-agency human factors coordination research plan in cooperation with NASA, as previously recommended by FAA's Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO)--an interagency organization responsible for planning NextGen. As a result, FAA has not established an agreed-upon set of initial focus areas for research that identifies and capitalizes on past and current research and establishes focus areas for human factors research and development, among other things. The experts GAO contacted generally agreed that FAA's and NASA's human factors research efforts adequately support NextGen, but made several suggestions, including enhancing human factors research leadership, for further incorporating human factors issues into NextGen systems. FAA and NASA have undertaken a variety of human factors efforts to support NextGen, including, among other things, creating planning documents detailing how human factors research will be incorporated into NextGen and dedicating financial resources specifically to NextGen human factors research. While the human factors experts GAO interviewed stated that these efforts support NextGen, a majority offered the following suggestions for further integrating human factors issues into NextGen: (1) Better ensure that human factors issues are fully integrated throughout the development of NextGen systems. FAA did not do this in the development of past systems, a fact that led to schedule slippages and cost increases. (2) Improve collaboration of human factors efforts within FAA departments. (3) Establish strong leadership. A 2008 National Academy of Public Administration's report identified leadership as the single most important element of success for large-scale systems integration efforts like NextGen. FAA has not prioritized consistently staffing the top two human factors positions. Specifically, the position of the Chief Systems Engineer for Human Factors (now referred to as the human factors integration lead) has been vacant since January 2010. Moreover, FAA did not have a permanent program director of its Human Factors Research and Engineering Group from January 2009 until June 2010. These two positions currently lack the authority to ensure that human factors issues are addressed early and throughout the NextGen system development process to prevent the need to redesign these systems after implementation, which can cause delays and add costs. As a result, FAA may lack consistent leadership with the sufficient authority to not only prioritize human factors issues but ensure that human factors issues are addressed throughout NextGen. FAA should (1) create a coordination plan and (2) give priority to filling vacant leadership positions and provide the positions with authority for prioritizing human factors.

As such, human  factors combines features of many disciplines, including psychology,  engineering, anthropology, sociology, and linguistics. Human factors R&D  focuses on people as they interact with the design of products. The goal of  human factors is to minimize the potential for design-induced error by  ensuring that the equipment is suitable for the users and their  environment. The human factors discipline can be described as having two  components: human factors research, which seeks to acquire information,  and human factors engineering, which seeks to apply the information  gained from research to equipment, systems, software, and training,  among other things.", "Recognizing the importance of human factors considerations, FAA issued  a Human Factors Policy Order in 1993 that requires human factors issues  to be integrated into the planning and execution of all FAA activities  associated with system acquisitions and operations. FAA offers several  guidance documents on implementing human factors considerations,  which, FAA officials told us, helped aviation stakeholders, such as  contractors and research institutions, meet the requirement. For example,  officials with the MITRE Corporation told us that\u2014in collaboration with  FAA, airlines, and others\u2014they researched human factors issues in the  development of the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast System,  which is an information-reporting technology that, when used in  conjunction with other navigation technologies, is expected to enable  more precise information about aircraft position. MITRE collected human  factors data on how pilots use the broadcast system, collaborated with  human factors engineers, and asked human factors personnel to observe  pilots\u2019 in-flight interaction with the system while it was being tested.", "FAA has several offices that are tasked with ensuring that FAA programs  integrate human factors issues. FAA\u2019s Human Factors Research and  Engineering Group (HFREG) is responsible for conducting the human  factors R&D for NextGen, with the program director serving as the  principal advisor to the FAA Administrator on human factors issues.  HFREG is divided into three R&D areas: (1) Flight Deck/Aviation  Maintenance/System Integration, which develops human performance  information that the agency uses in fulfilling its regulatory responsibility  and provides to the aviation industry for use in designing and operating  aircraft and training pilots and maintenance personnel; (2) Air Traffic  Control/Technical Operations, which researches human factors issues  with respect to the roles of air traffic controllers, air traffic managers, and  maintenance technicians; and (3) general Human Factors Research and  Engineering, which attempts to ensure that the incorporation of human  factors engineering is explicit, timely, systematic, comprehensive,  efficient, and effective. In fiscal year 2009, HFREG conducted dozens of  R&D activities including the following:    Mitigating fatigue in flight operations.

FAA has established chief systems engineers to  focus on agencywide, cross-cutting technical and operational issues  pertaining to NextGen. Because of the scope of NextGen, FAA contracted  with Volpe to provide a chief system engineer for human factors to identify  and help the agency better ensure that human factors issues are integrated  into the development of NextGen aviation systems. As a result of the  observations and recommendations of that Volpe expert, FAA has  designated a new position for human factors integration lead and assigned  that position to FAA\u2019s System Engineering and Safety organization.", "NASA has two units primarily responsible for ensuring human factors  consideration in aviation: the Airspace Systems Program and the Aviation  Safety Program, both within its Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate.  The Airspace Systems Program is the unit chiefly responsible for NASA\u2019s  input into NextGen. The primary research role for the Airspace Systems  Program is to contribute to the operations of the airspace system by  developing concepts, capabilities, and technologies for high-capacity,  efficient, and safe airspace systems. The Aviation Safety Program is  dedicated to improving the safety of current and future aircraft operating  in the national airspace system. The research focus is on the way aircraft  are designed, built, operated, and maintained. Scientists and engineers in  this program develop concepts and tools to address aircraft aging and  durability, among other areas.", "FAA and NASA have each invested about $121 million in human factors  R&D from fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2009 (see fig. 1). Starting in fiscal  year 2005, NASA adjusted the size of its human factors research staff by  reassigning some staff to other programs and reducing the contractor and  academic technical support for human factors R&D. NASA reorganized its  aeronautical research plan to focus on what it calls \u201cfundamental  research,\u201d which takes a technology to a point where it can be further  matured by manufacturers and eventually integrated into new aircraft or  engine designs. FAA\u2019s investment in human factors R&D is increasing,  along with additional appropriations for overall research development,  though overall R&D appears to be increasing at a higher rate (see fig. 2).  NASA takes the lead in both identifying human factors concepts that need  to be implemented to support a particular technology or system and  developing the human factors engineering models and algorithms. NASA  then works with FAA on testing the new concept and hands off the  responsibility to FAA to make the concept operational. NASA officials told  us that it generally takes a concept 5 to 7 years to become operational  after NASA transfers responsibility to FAA. Furthermore, in June 2010,  NASA officials informed us of a new Integrated Systems Research  Program that is to focus on maturing and integrating NextGen  technologies into operational systems. The program began in fiscal year  2010 at a funding level of $62.4 million.", "NextGen is a major transformation of the aviation system that will have  significant implications for human factors considerations. NextGen will  transform aviation procedures and the design of the aviation system and  introduce new technologies that pose dramatic changes to the roles and  responsibilities of both air traffic controllers and pilots and change the  way they interface with their systems. According to FAA, under NextGen,  a satellite-based system would guide all phases of a flight, including climb,  cruise, descent, and taxi. Instead of monitoring aircraft movements using  ground-based radar and transmitting voice flight instructions to aircraft,  air traffic controllers would primarily monitor automated systems and  intervene when anomalies and emergencies occur. As a result, FAA and  NASA need to research the human factors considerations associated with  the new roles of both flight crew and air traffic management staff, and  incorporate the results into the implementation of the new system. In  addition, FAA and NASA will have to identify and develop the training  necessary for these changing roles, including the time frame before  NextGen is fully realized, when some aircraft will be equipped with  NextGen systems and others will not.", "FAA and NASA structure their NextGen human factors R&D according to  a planned three-phase implementation of the NextGen system to align and  prevent duplication of NextGen R&D efforts. FAA\u2014which is ultimately in  charge of implementing NextGen\u2014is mainly responsible for the R&D to  help address near-term implementation (2009-2013), which addresses the  day-to-day promotion of the safe and efficient operation of the current  aviation system and the implementation of some NextGen systems, and  midterm implementation (2012-2018), which consists of leveraging existing  aircraft capabilities and introducing new aircraft capabilities to establish a  foundation for a longer-term evolution of the aviation system. Within FAA,  the Air Traffic Organization is responsible for implementing near- and  midterm improvements in coordination with other FAA lines of business.  Within the Air Traffic Organization, several offices have different roles in  the development of NextGen. For example, within the NextGen and  Operations Planning Office, the NextGen Integration and Implementation  (NGII) office is tasked with monitoring the progress of NextGen  development and implementation and facilitating necessary coordination.  These offices are also responsible for ensuring that human factors R&D  conducted by HFREG is integrated into NextGen. NASA is responsible for  conducting research to help address far-term implementation (2018-2025).

First, they use the Research,  Engineering, and Development Advisory Committee (REDAC), which  advises on FAA\u2019s research, engineering, and development activities with  experts from industry, academia, and other government agencies. REDAC  was established in 1989 to advise the FAA Administrator on research and  development needs in human factors, air traffic services, airport technology,  aircraft safety, and environmental issues. According to officials from both  agencies, their collaboration on REDAC helps to coordinate human factors  R&D efforts. One of the REDAC subcommittees is devoted to human  factors, and according to officials with HFREG and NGII, has provided  important perspectives on research management and coordination among  agencies, including human factors R&D. Several REDAC subcommittees  have held meetings at NASA to facilitate its participation and ensure that  REDAC is briefed on relevant NASA human factors projects as well as  FAA\u2019s human factors R&D efforts. NASA officials also use REDAC to brief  FAA officials on their human factors R&D efforts as well.", "In 2007, FAA and NASA took steps to better coordinate their human  factors efforts as a direct result of REDAC\u2019s influence. The REDAC human  factors subcommittee recommended that FAA and NASA exchange  information about their human factors R&D efforts to better facilitate  research coordination, which FAA and NASA did. In addition, in 2009, the  subcommittee noted that while the agencies had improved coordination of  human factors R&D, they could further improve coordination of FAA and  NASA human factors R&D related to the NextGen Controller Efficiency  Program. In response, officials with HFREG and NGII told us that they  now review NASA human factors research announcements to determine  their applicability for FAA NextGen R&D. NASA proposals encompass  research that includes human factors issues as part of the proposed work.", "In addition, FAA and NASA take advantage of existing forums, meetings,  and interagency agreements to coordinate their human factors R&D  efforts. Officials with HFREG and NGII told us that FAA and NASA  exchange R&D results through reports, presentations, and joint panel  discussions at various seminars and professional conferences, including  the annual Human Factors and Ergonomics Society conference. FAA  officials added that they also attend NASA\u2019s technical interchange  meetings to share ideas, learn of NASA\u2019s human factors research efforts,  and coordinate research projects. FAA also exchanges R&D planning  documentation with NASA annually and as needed to facilitate human  factors R&D coordination activities.", "The agencies also have undertaken specific efforts to coordinate human  factors R&D related to NextGen. FAA established research transition  teams to address research gaps and coordinate research between FAA and  NASA related to the primary NextGen systems. In September 2008, we  reported that FAA and NASA established four research transition teams  to outline how the two agencies will jointly develop research  requirements. These teams help FAA and NASA identify R&D needed to  implement NextGen and ensure that the research is not only conducted  but effectively transitioned to the implementing agency. FAA is to provide  requirements for users of the technologies, while NASA is to conduct the  research and provide an understanding of the engineering rationale for  design decisions. According to FAA, these research transition teams  facilitate coordination and transition of new technologies and concepts  related to NextGen, including human factors components. For example,  FAA and NASA are using the research transition teams to coordinate  human factors research on the roles and responsibilities of air traffic  controllers and pilots, as well as their information needs and procedures,  among other issues.", "In addition, over the past several years, FAA and NASA officials have  established memorandums and interagency agreements that allow the  agencies to collaborate on research projects and coordinate human factors  R&D related to NextGen. The agreements include reimbursable  interagency agreements between HFREG and NASA to leverage resources.  According to interagency agreements and FAA officials, leveraging  activities include:  researching, modeling, and testing the advanced technologies, automation,  and services and capabilities that are required for successful  implementation of NextGen with particular emphasis on the issues  associated with the NextGen flight deck,     allowing collaborative research to develop NextGen data communications,  human factors collision avoidance requirements, aircraft merging and  spacing separation assurance systems, and guidance for use of NextGen  synthetic vision systems, enhanced flight vision systems, and advanced  cockpit vision technologies, and    developing models, simulations, and demonstrations that will quantify  efficiencies and benefits for the included programs, and evaluate the  operational feasibility of concepts.", "HFREG has approved or initiated 35 human factors research activities in  partnership with NASA, universities, and private corporations.

The research includes projects related to  NextGen communication systems, automation and human roles and  responsibilities, risk and error management, decision making, aircraft  separation assurance and collision avoidance, ground operations, aircraft  trajectory management, instrument procedures, personnel training and  qualifications, and single pilot operations. NASA officials have agreed to  consult HFREG officials about their NextGen human and automation roles  and responsibility research and inform them about the research.

FAA not only conducts focus  groups and interviews with a panel of human factors experts, but also  conducts live simulations and field trials to evaluate system and human  performance in different scenarios. For example, FAA conducted human  simulations with pilots and air traffic controllers in fiscal year 2008 and  planned further simulations for its High Density Airport Capacity and  Efficiency Improvement Project in fiscal year 2009.

Prior to  fiscal year 2008, FAA used funding from its overall human factors R&D  budget for NextGen projects, one of various types of human factors R&D;  however, since fiscal year 2008, FAA has had a specific human factors  research and development budget for NextGen. To incorporate human  factors issues into NextGen, for example, conducting additional human  simulations and field trials, FAA invested $25.5 million in human factors  R&D specifically dedicated to NextGen from fiscal year 2008 through fiscal  year 2010, and has requested additional funding for fiscal year 2011 to  fiscal year 2013. NASA officials told us that NASA conducts applied human  factors research across its Aviation Safety and Airspace Systems programs  and does not have a specific line item budget for NextGen. According to  these officials, this research addresses human factors considerations for  new concepts and technologies applicable to NextGen. In addition,  NASA\u2019s Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate programs were  realigned in 2006, causing difficulty in assessing funding trends across  several years of similar research activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Experts Cited Suggestions Regarding Human Factors Efforts Supporting NextGen", "paragraphs": ["For the most part, aviation human factors experts we interviewed stated  that FAA\u2019s and NASA\u2019s human factors R&D efforts adequately support  NextGen. For example, experts commended FAA and NASA for  appropriately conducting human factors R&D according to the three-phase  implementation structure for NextGen systems. As previously mentioned,  FAA is mainly responsible for R&D to support near-term implementation  and midterm implementation, while NASA conducts much of the research  to address far-term implementation. One expert also told us that FAA, in  response to REDAC input, has developed a good method for  understanding likely human performance. NASA also has modeled  NextGen systems to predict how beneficial NextGen systems will be to  users. However, a majority of experts offered suggestions for further  incorporating human factors issues into NextGen. Experts specifically  identified the following suggestions:  Better ensure that human factors issues are fully integrated  throughout design and development of NextGen systems. Human  factors must be considered and integrated throughout the design and  development of aviation systems. Failure to fully consider human factors  issues at all stages can increase costs and delay projects. Six of nine  experts and a senior official at the Volpe National Transportation Systems  Center were concerned that NextGen developers may not be adequately  considering human factors R&D throughout the entire NextGen planning  and implementation process. FAA has not fully integrated human factors  considerations into the development of some aviation systems. For  example, FAA did not fully address human factors considerations in  developing the En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) system,  which FAA plans to complete by 2010. According to the National Air  Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), air traffic controllers involved in  initial operations capabilities tests at an air traffic control center in Salt  Lake City have come across significant problems with using the system.  According to NATCA, controllers have found the new formats  cumbersome, confusing, and difficult to navigate, thus indicating that FAA  did not adequately involve those who operate the system (controllers) in  the early phases of system development. As a result, to better ensure  optimal performance of ERAM, FAA will have to address these human  factors issues before it deploys the new system. This could increase the  costs or delay the implementation of other components of NextGen, such  as the previously mentioned Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast  System, since the operation of numerous NextGen components will  depend on this new system. FAA officials within the En Route Automation  Modernization office agreed with NATCA\u2019s views on the new system and  added that the simulation capabilities of its Technical Center in Atlantic  City, New Jersey, where the agency conducts human factors testing, were  not robust enough to capture all of the problems subsequently identified  by controllers. In May 2010, however, FAA announced the building of an  Aviation Research and Technology Park near FAA\u2019s Technical Center to  provide a central location for partners in academia, industry, and other  state and federal government agencies to work on NextGen. According to  FAA, the park is being built with no direct cost to FAA and has amassed  $3.5 million in grant funding. In June 2010, FAA issued a task order to  MITRE Corporation to conduct a programmatic review of the ERAM  problem and make an assessment of what circumstances led to the current  delay, among other things. The MITRE Corporation is expected to issue a  final report on October 1, 2010.", "Similarly, in reviewing the development of the Operational and  Supportability Implementation System, the Department of  Transportation\u2019s Inspector General reported that FAA identified a number  of significant human factors concerns with the system, such as  inadequately addressing weather information.  The Inspector General  concluded that system developers did not adequately consider human  factors research throughout design and development, thereby contributing  to the delay of the system\u2019s implementation. Similarly, as noted in a report  we issued in 2005, FAA\u2019s failure to provide adequate attention to human  factors issues when implementing the Standard Terminal Automation  Replacement System resulted in schedule slips and a significant cost  increase of $500 million. As noted, however, since fiscal year 2008, FAA  has designated funding solely for human factors R&D supporting NextGen.  It remains to be seen if FAA\u2019s added emphasis on human factors research  and engineering will better ensure that human factors issues are fully  integrated into the development of future NextGen components.", "Ensuring the mitigation of human factors issues also involves oversight of  contractors. HFREG officials told us that they do not track vendors to  make sure they are considering human factors R&D issues in their  development, as this is a responsibility of the program managers who lead  procurement efforts for FAA systems. However, once contracts are  awarded, contractors are supposed to follow the contract specifications,  which can include human factors system performance requirements.  HFREG officials told us that in the past they collaborated with program  office human factors coordinators to assess outside vendors\u2019 compliance  with human factors issues; they found that the contractors were not in  compliance in all aspects, particularly human factors. In April 2010, the  Department of Transportation\u2019s Inspector General also expressed concern  about FAA\u2019s ineffective oversight of a contractor in developing NextGen  systems, adding that NextGen implementation will require significant  contract oversight. Furthermore, FAA\u2019s post-implementation review of  the Advanced Technologies and Oceanic Procedures system concluded  that FAA and the contractors who developed the system did not, from a  human factors perspective, develop the system to meet FAA\u2019s needs. The  post-implementation review recommended that for future systems, FAA  should ensure that it articulates to contractors in unambiguous terms the  human factors-related characteristics that the proposed system must meet.  According to the Chief Scientist for NextGen and Operations Planning, a  contractor developing an aviation system may have implemented human  factors designs that were originally flawed or may have had a flawed  methodology for incorporating human factors issues into system  development. FAA program offices and contractors often support the  incorporation of human factors consideration in a system by convening a  panel of controllers and obtaining their feedback. Such a method may  result in the controllers providing information regarding their preferences  instead of information regarding the usability of the system to the  controller panel. An alternative method may be to conduct a modeling  effort that analyzes data on human performance for certain components of  the system. HFREG officials also noted that under the best of  circumstances, all major and most human factors issues should be  identified and mitigated during system development, making it unusual for  additional problems to arise when a system is being implemented. To  address this issue, experts stated FAA should ensure system developers  consider human factors in all phases of the development of aviation  systems (as required by the Human Factors Policy Order). Having  oversight of system developers (including contractors) that develop  NextGen systems to make sure they adhere to FAA\u2019s Human Factors  Policy Order would significantly reduce the possibility of expensive and  untimely delays. FAA has taken action to improve its oversight of  contractors. For example, in its June 2010 letter to MITRE, FAA requested  an assessment of the ERAM contractor\u2019s program management procedures  and practices as part of an overall review of the program.", "Improve collaboration of human factors efforts across FAA  departments. Collaboration within FAA departments is important to  ensure that aviation systems are designed and developed with agency  input from human factors researchers. Several experts we interviewed  stated that system development projects with a human factors research  component take place in different departments and offices at FAA, and  that those developing the systems do not always collaborate. While  HFREG provides R&D and engineering support, HFREG officials told us  that there is no requirement for program offices or developers to consult  with HFREG. HFREG conducted a post-implementation review of the  Advanced Technologies and Oceanic Procedures that implied that system  managers did not properly consider human factor issues. This suggests  that the system managers either did not consult human factors  stakeholders (including HFREG) or did not fully address their human  factors issues through a collaborative working relationship. As a result,  the post-implementation review concluded that from a human factors  perspective, the system that was implemented in the field was not the  system FAA had asked for. FAA\u2019s experience in developing the Advanced  Technologies and Oceanic Procedures is an indication of what can happen  when system developers fail to collaborate with human factors specialists  and develop a comprehensive human factors program. To improve  collaboration, HFREG officials also told us that the Chief Scientist of the  NextGen and Operations Planning unit sponsored a technical interchange  meeting in January 2010 to better ensure that all FAA units involved in  NextGen development are aware of the need to fully consider human  factors in their work. The Chief Scientist plans to host another technical  interchange meeting on July 29, 2010."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Strong Leadership Would Improve Consideration of Human Factors Issues", "paragraphs": ["A majority of the experts we interviewed agree that strong leadership is  needed to provide adequate consideration of human factors issues within  NextGen. Furthermore, a September 2008 National Academy of Public  Administration\u2019s report identified leadership as the single most important  element of success for large-scale systems integration efforts like  NextGen. That report highlighted leadership as a NextGen implementation  challenge. The critical impact of human factors issues on NextGen  indicates that human factors issues require strong leadership to ensure  they are a priority for NextGen. FAA has not prioritized consistently  staffing the top two leadership positions within FAA that are formally  responsible for human factors R&D. Specifically, the Chief Systems  Engineer for Human Factors position has been vacant since the previous  chief retired in January 2010. Moreover, FAA did not assign a permanent  program director of HFREG for 16 months, from January 2009 until FAA  filled the position in June 2010.", "The leadership void was the issue most frequently identified by the nine  experts. Seven of nine experts we interviewed told us that the lack of  leadership within FAA is a significant challenge in ensuring that human  factors R&D supports NextGen. Although a majority of the experts were  concerned that the leadership void could have prevented human factors  issues from being fully considered for NextGen, subsequently delaying the  implementation of a system, none could identify any specific examples.  Nevertheless, FAA officials emphasized the importance of both positions.  FAA officials told us that the Chief System Engineer position could be  pivotal in integrating and maximizing the effectiveness of human factors in  support of NextGen and is thus critical to prioritizing NextGen research  and resources within FAA. JPDO officials we interviewed stressed that the  program director of HFREG is the single most important position needed  to ensure that the necessary human factors R&D is conducted and that the  results are integrated into the development of NextGen systems.", "According to FAA officials, FAA has not had a chance to fill the position of  Chief System Engineer\u2014which FAA now refers to as the human factors  integration lead\u2014because of a hiring freeze and uncertainty as to which  unit to put the position. FAA has resolved those issues and plans to begin  the process for filling the position. Officials cautioned, however, that it  may take a long time to find a qualified candidate with the right human  factors expertise and other relevant skill sets. Nonetheless, FAA would  like to fill the position by the close of fiscal year 2010. FAA officials also  told us that it took a long time to fill the position of program director for  HFREG, in part because of the long process of completing required  personnel administrative procedures. The new program director of  HFREG was formerly the acting program director and had been in that  position since the previous program director left. The assignment to  program director involved a change in the position classification that  involved several time-consuming administrative procedures to address,  according to HFREG officials and an FAA senior executive.", "Experts also told us in filling these positions that the new leaders should  have adequate authority to make sure that human factors issues are  considered (particularly early in system development) and prioritized  during all phases of NextGen development. These positions currently lack  the authority to ensure that human factors issues are addressed early and  throughout the NextGen system development process. Such authority  could mitigate the need to redesign these systems after implementation  has begun, which can cause delays and add costs. For example, as  previously discussed, it has been found that FAA\u2019s human factors plans  have not adequately addressed how humans will use newly developed  NextGen weather information. One of the experts we consulted who has  worked extensively with FAA on human factors R&D told us that a  program director of the HFREG or Chief System Engineer who has  adequate authority could have reviewed the weather information to ensure  that human factors were fully integrated into that and other NextGen  systems. However, in filling the position of program director of HFREG,  FAA did not authorize the new program director with additional authority  to review NextGen programs and ensure that human factors issues are  addressed. HFREG officials told us that FAA is conducting a review of  distribution among HFREG, service units, and other offices for  responsibility and authority to conduct human factors activities to better  serve the human factors needs of NextGen."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Human factors research must be incorporated into NextGen to ensure that  controllers, pilots, and other aviation system users can operate NextGen in  a safe and efficient manner.

However, these and future efforts will require a sustained focus not only  across agencies but from the beginning to the end of the long process of  developing a complex system like NextGen. Some suggest that FAA can  meet this challenge by incorporating two elements into its human factors  R&D efforts:    a cross-agency plan developed in cooperation with NASA to identify,  prioritize, and coordinate NextGen human factors issues, and    strong and consistent leadership with the authority to not only prioritize  human factors issues but ensure that they are taken into account  throughout NextGen."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Transportation direct the FAA  Administrator to take the following two actions:    create a cross-agency human factors coordination plan in cooperation  with NASA, as JPDO has previously recommended, that establishes an  agreed-upon set of initial focus areas for research, inventories existing  facilities for research, and capitalizes on past and current research of all  NextGen issues, and    assign a high priority to filling the vacancy of human factors integration  lead and structure that position and the program director of HFREG  position in a manner that provides the authority to ensure that human  factors research and development is coordinated, considered, and  prioritized in all phases of NextGen development."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Transportation and  NASA for review and comment.
