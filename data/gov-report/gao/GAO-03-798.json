State and INS officials said they use the revocation process to prevent suspected terrorists from entering the country, but none of the agencies has a policy that covers investigating, locating, and taking action when a visa holder has already entered. This lack of formal written policies and procedures has contributed to systemic weaknesses in the visa revocation process that increase the possibility of a suspected terrorist entering or remaining in the United States. In our review of 240 visa revocations, we found that appropriate units within INS and the FBI did not always receive notifications of all the revocations; names were not consistently posted to the agencies' watch lists of suspected terrorists; 30 individuals whose visas were revoked on terrorism grounds had entered the United States either before or after revocation and may still remain; and INS and the FBI were not routinely taking actions to investigate, locate, or resolve the cases of individuals who remained in the United States after their visas were revoked."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As stated in the President\u2019s National Strategy for Homeland Security, the  U.S. government has no more important mission than protecting the  homeland from future terrorist attacks.

As shown in figure 1, the Departments of State, Homeland Security, and  Justice play key roles in this process.", "The border security process begins at the State Department\u2019s overseas  consular posts, where consular officers adjudicate visa applications for  foreign nationals who wish to temporarily enter the United States for visits  related to business, tourism, or other reasons. At the port of entry, an INS  inspector determines whether the visa holder is admitted to the United  States and, if so, how long he or she may remain in the country. Until  recently, after INS successfully screened and admitted foreign visitors,  these individuals were generally not monitored unless they came under the  scrutiny of INS or a law enforcement agency, such as the FBI, for suspected  immigration violations or other illegal activity.", "On March 1, 2003, the Department of Homeland Security assumed  responsibility for many elements of the border security process. For  example, the new department incorporated the INS Inspections Unit into  its Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, which will focus its  operations on the movement of goods and people across U.S. borders. It  also folded the INS National Security Unit into its Bureau of Immigration  and Customs Enforcement, which is designed to enforce the full range of  immigration and customs laws within the United States. According to  Department of Homeland Security officials, the new department also  gained broad authority over the visa process under section 428 of the  Homeland Security Act, covering the development of policies, regulations,  procedures, and any other guidance that may affect visa issuance or  revocation.The State Department remains responsible for managing the  consular corps and the function of issuing visas.", "The FBI\u2019s Counterterrorism Division, within the Justice Department, plays  a key role in the border security process. The division includes the Foreign  Terrorist Tracking Task Force, which is now part of the FBI\u2019s Office of  Intelligence. The mission of the task force, an interagency group, is to (1)  deny entry into the United States of aliens associated with, suspected of  being engaged in, or supporting terrorist activity and (2) aid in supplying  information to locate, detain, prosecute, or deport any such aliens already  present in the United States. The National Joint Terrorism Task Force is  comprised of 36 federal agencies co-located in the Strategic Information  and Operations Center at FBI headquarters. This task force provides a  central fusion point for terrorism information and intelligence to the 66  Joint Terrorism Task Forces, which include state and local law  enforcement officers, federal agents, and other federal personnel who  work in the field to prevent and investigate acts of terrorism.", "At each stage of the process, the responsible departments and agencies rely  on terrorist or criminal watch list systems\u2014sometimes referred to as tip- off or lookout systems\u2014in fulfilling their respective border security  missions.  For example, State relies on its Consular Lookout and Support  System (CLASS) as the primary basis for identifying potential terrorists  among visa applicants. CLASS incorporates information on suspected  terrorists from State\u2019s interagency terrorist watch list, known as TIPOFF, as  well as from the FBI, INS, and many other agencies. Further, INS inspectors  at ports of entry use the Interagency Border Inspection System (IBIS) to  check whether foreign nationals are inadmissible and should be denied  entry into the United States. When a person enters the United States by air  or by sea, INS inspectors are required to check that person against watch  lists before the person is allowed to enter the country.

These officials  explained that prior to September 11, 2001, State revoked only a small  number of visas for terrorism-related reasons. This relatively small number  resulted in State and INS operating in an informal manner when  cooperating on denying admission to revoked visa holders at ports of entry.  State officials said that State and Justice had agreed to informal  notification procedures between the two agencies and had crafted  language for the visa revocation certificates several years ago; however, the  two agencies did not develop formal written procedures. These officials  said that State did not coordinate its visa revocations with the FBI.  In  commenting on a draft of this report, State said that the Visa Office  generally worked under the impression that, under long-standing practice,  INS was passing relevant information onto the FBI as appropriate.", "State and INS officials articulated their agencies\u2019 policies on how  revocations help their agencies prevent suspected terrorists from entering  the United States. State officials told us that they envision the revocation  process as taking place before the visa holder enters the country. This  would allow State and other agencies more time to investigate and  determine whether a suspected terrorist is in fact ineligible for a visa on  terrorism grounds before allowing the visa holder to enter the country. As  these officials explained, since the September 11 attacks, State\u2019s Bureau of  Consular Affairs has been receiving a large volume of information on  suspected terrorists from the intelligence community, law enforcement  agencies, overseas posts, and other units within State. The department  reviews this information to determine if a suspected terrorist has a U.S.  visa. If the identifying information is incomplete, as is often the case, State  may have difficulty in determining whether a visa holder with the same or a  similar name as a suspected terrorist is in fact the suspected terrorist. The  department may also lack sufficient proof of a specific act that would  render the suspected terrorist ineligible for a visa, as required by the INA.", "In these cases, State would revoke the person\u2019s visa under the Secretary of  State\u2019s discretionary authority, requiring the person to reapply for a visa if  he or she still intended to visit the United States. State would then use the  visa issuance process to obtain additional biographic and other data on the  visa applicant and make a determination on the person\u2019s eligibility.", "INS officials viewed the process as a means of notifying INS inspectors to  deny suspected terrorists entry into the United States. These officials did  not view a visa revocation, even if based on terrorism concerns, as a reason  for investigating someone who had already entered the United States. They  said the INA does not specify visa revocation as a reason for removing a  person from the country. (App. II provides more information on legal issues  associated with visa revocations.)", "According to Justice and FBI officials, the FBI does not yet have a policy on  how to use the visa revocation process in its counterterrorism efforts. The  FBI has not developed such a policy because the visa revocation  information State sends to the bureau does not indicate that the FBI may  want to take follow-up action in these cases. For instance, the notice of visa  revocation does not explicitly state that the reason for revocation is  terrorism-related.", "State and INS had written policies that covered some aspects of visa  revocations. State\u2019s policies and procedures, contained in the Foreign  Affairs Manual, specify when and for what reason a consular officer may  or may not revoke a visa, including for terrorism-related reasons. The  manual instructs consular officers to obtain a security advisory opinion  from the department before determining that a visa holder is ineligible for a  visa on terrorism grounds. In practice, according to State officials, this  means that department officials at headquarters acting under the authority  of the Secretary of State\uf8e7not the consular officers at overseas  posts\uf8e7revoke visas on the basis of terrorism concerns. State Department  officials told us that they follow specific, but unwritten, operating  procedures when the department revokes visas, as described in more detail  later in this report. INS has some general policies related to the posting of  lookouts for inadmissible aliens and for the revocation of visas by  immigration officers at ports of entry.

Under the INA, the Secretary of State has discretionary authority to revoke  any visa that a consular officer has issued, including cases in which the  Secretary believes that the visa holder may be ineligible for a visa under the  INA\u2019s terrorism provision.

State should notify its consular officers  so that they would ask for a security advisory opinion before issuing a new  visa to the person whose visa had been revoked. In addition, State would  have to provide notice of the revocation, along with supporting evidence, to  Homeland Security and the FBI. This would allow Homeland Security to  notify its inspectors at ports of entry so that they could prevent the  individuals from entering the United States. It also would allow Homeland  Security and the FBI to determine whether the person had already entered  the country and, if so, to investigate, locate, and take appropriate action in  each case.

According to State officials,  once the Deputy Assistant Secretary signs a revocation certificate, the  department is supposed to take the following actions, as soon as possible  after the visa is revoked: (1) notify the INS Lookout Unit via a faxed copy of  the revocation certificate so that the unit can enter the individual into the  National Automated Immigration Lookout System, which is uploaded into  IBIS; (2) notify consular officers at all overseas post that the individual may  be a suspected terrorist by entering a lookout on the person into State\u2019s  watch list, CLASS; and (3) notify the issuing post via cable so that the post  can attempt to contact the individual to physically cancel his visa.  Information-only copies of these cables, which do not explicitly state that  the reason for the revocation is terrorism-related, are also sent to INS\u2019s and  FBI\u2019s main communications centers.

Ideally, information on suspected terrorists  would reach the State Department before it decides to issue a visa.   However, there will always be some cases when the information arrives too  late and State has already issued a visa. Revoking a visa can mitigate this  problem, but only if State promptly notifies the appropriate border control  and law enforcement agencies and if these agencies act quickly to (1) notify  border patrol agents and immigration inspectors to deny entry to persons  with a revoked visa and (2) investigate persons with revoked visas who  have entered the country. Currently there are major gaps in the notification  and investigation processes. One reason for this is that there are no  comprehensive written policies and procedures on how notification of a  visa revocation should take place and what agencies should do when they  are notified. As a result, there is heightened risk that suspected terrorists  could enter the country with revoked visas or be allowed to remain after  their visas are revoked without undergoing investigation or monitoring."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To strengthen the visa revocation process as an antiterrorism tool, we  recommend that the Secretary of Homeland Security, in conjunction with  the Secretary of State and the Attorney General:  develop specific policies and procedures for the interagency visa  revocation process to ensure that notification of visa revocations for  suspected terrorists and relevant supporting information is transmitted  from State to immigration and law enforcement agencies, and their  respective inspection and investigation units, in a timely manner;   develop a specific policy on actions that immigration and law  enforcement agencies should take to investigate and locate individuals  whose visas have been revoked for terrorism concerns and who remain  in the United States after revocation; and   determine if persons with visas revoked on terrorism grounds are in the  United States and, if so, whether they pose a security threat."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Departments of Homeland  Security, State, and Justice for their comment.", "The Department of Homeland Security agreed that the visa revocation  process should be strengthened as an antiterrorism tool.
