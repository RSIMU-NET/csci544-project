One licensee said that delays in receiving an invoice resulted in late fees. NRC is undertaking an initiative to transition to electronic billing, which may address the challenges the licensees identified and, according to NRC staff, improve the agency's billing process. However, NRC has not developed planning documents for this initiative and, according to staff, the planning phase is already past its original deadline of October 2017.

To reach this amount, NRC assesses two types  of fees\u2014service fees and annual fees\u2014that are set through an annual  rulemaking process. Service fees encompass reimbursable contract  costs and reimbursable NRC staff time costs, which include time spent  performing work for a specific licensee and certain overhead costs. In  cases where NRC hires a contractor to perform work related to a specific  licensee, NRC pays the contractor for the work and then bills the licensee  for reimbursement. NRC assesses service fees for agency staff time by  establishing an hourly rate to recover the full cost of specific regulatory  services. In cases where the cost of an activity will change very little from  licensee to licensee, NRC has established flat service fees based on the  hourly rate. For service fees, charges on the invoice are to recover the  costs for work completed in the previous quarter up to the date of the  invoice and invoices are mailed to licensees quarterly via the U.S. Postal  Service to collect service fees. NRC assesses annual fees to recover  regulatory costs that are not otherwise recovered through service fees in  order to meet the 90 percent statutory requirement.

To select licensees for our sample, we used service fee- collection data produced by NRC\u2019s financial management system, called  the Financial Accounting and Integrated Management Information  System. From seven of NRC\u2019s nine fee classes, we selected to interview  the 2 licensees that held the licenses that were assessed the highest  amount of service fees from October 2015 through July 2017. However,  one of the seven fee classes had only 1 licensee that was assessed  service fees in that class during this established period. Also, two fee  classes were excluded from our sample. Our selection process resulted  in 13 licensees of varying size and scope, including 1 holding multiple  licenses that was assessed service fees of almost $28 million during the  established period, and another holding a single license that was  assessed service fees of almost $420,000 during the same period. If a  licensee meeting our selection criteria was unwilling or unable to  participate, we elected to interview the licensee that held the license that  was assessed the next highest amount of service fees during this period.  We interviewed licensees using a standard set of questions to collect  consistent information. We analyzed licensee responses to our standard  set of questions to identify key themes and grouped their responses into  common categories.

Also, 10 of the 13 licensees we interviewed told us that  detailed information on contract work would be useful, but 9 of them did  not know this information is available and can be requested.", "Not all licensees know the supplemental information is available because,  according to NRC staff in the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, the  agency has not instituted a formal process to inform all licensees of its  availability. These staff added that the agency has announced the  availability of this supplemental information at industry conferences or has  told individual licensees about it. NRC staff explained that the agency is  meeting statutory requirements for issuing invoices and provides the  supplemental information as a courtesy to licensees, but is not required to  do so. According to NRC staff in the Office of the Chief Financial Officer,  the agency has not formally notified all licensees about the availability of  this supplemental information because it is time-consuming to provide it  to licensees. These staff also said that they have found that not all  licensees may need this information. This is consistent with information  from the licensees we interviewed. For example, 2 licensees told us that  they do not need biweekly reports; one said that it operates on a fixed  annual budget, so additional information on biweekly costs would not be  useful. In contrast, NRC staff noted that licensees with more complex  invoices\u2014such as multiple sites and multiple inspections and licensing  actions\u2014may find the supplemental information useful. Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government explains that management  should communicate quality information externally so that external parties  can help the entity achieve its objectives and address related risks.  Furthermore, being open and transparent in communications is part of  NRC\u2019s Organizational Values, which guide every action it takes, how it  performs administrative tasks, and how it interacts with stakeholders.  Communicating to licensees about what information is available could  help improve the transparency of NRC\u2019s invoices, in accordance with the  agency\u2019s values.", "Additionally, 2 licensees told us that they requested information on work  being done by a contractor but NRC staff told them that the information  could not be provided. NRC staff in the Office of the Chief Financial  Officer acknowledged that some NRC project managers may not be  aware that licensees can request contract information because there is no  policy or guidance to instruct NRC staff on what information they can  provide or how to do so. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government states that agency management should clearly document\u2014 in management directives, administrative policies, or operating manuals\u2014 the processes it uses to ensure that it is achieving its objectives. By  developing a policy and guidance for NRC staff, the agency could help  ensure that staff are aware of the agency\u2019s processes and provide quality  information consistently."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Licensees Identified Challenges with NRC\u2019s Method for Delivering Invoices, and NRC\u2019s Recent and Planned Changes May Address These Challenges, but Its Plans Are Incomplete", "paragraphs": ["Licensees we interviewed said that NRC\u2019s method for delivering paper  invoices by mail created challenges related to the format and timeliness  of the invoice, though NRC\u2019s recent and planned changes may help  address these challenges. For example, one licensee told us that, without  the sorting and filtering capabilities of an electronic spreadsheet, this  licensee is not able to verify the accuracy of charges for specific  components of the work that NRC is doing. Another licensee told us that it  is difficult to track costs of projects to completion without an electronic  spreadsheet of charges. NRC now provides biweekly reports in an  electronic spreadsheet format, which may help address the challenges  these licensees cited. However, as discussed above, NRC does not  provide these biweekly reports unless they are requested, and some  licensees do not know that they are available.", "Licensees also cited challenges with the timeliness of invoices they  receive via mail. For example, 2 licensees stated that, with invoices taking  up to 10 days to arrive in the mail, licensees sometimes do not have  sufficient time to conduct a proper review of charges and remit payment  to NRC within the 30-day deadline. According to one licensee we  interviewed, delays in receiving the invoices have resulted in late fees. To  address the challenge of timeliness, NRC will, upon request from a  licensee, e-mail a copy of the invoice to the licensee after the hardcopy  invoice has been mailed. This practice allows the licensee to begin  reviewing its charges while waiting for the mailed copy to arrive. However,  of the 11 licensees that told us an e-mailed copy of the invoice would be  useful, 4 of them did not know this option was available.", "NRC staff said the agency intends to transition to electronic billing\u2014that  is, sending invoices in electronic format via e-mail or providing licensees  with web access to review and pay invoices. According to NRC staff, the  agency\u2019s transition to electronic billing is being done to improve efficiency  and internal controls in NRC\u2019s billing process. However, doing so may  also help address challenges that some licensees experience with the  format and timeliness of invoices. For example, 11 of the 13 licensees we  interviewed affirmed that receiving electronic invoices or periodic  statements of charges electronically would be beneficial.", "In October 2016, NRC\u2019s Commission directed NRC staff to examine  opportunities to accelerate the transition to an electronic billing system.  The agency has indicated its intent to complete the planning phase by  October 2017 and fully implement a new system by October 2019.  However, according to NRC staff, the planning phase was not completed  because the agency needed to fully implement the recent changes to its  billing process before planning for the transition to electronic billing. As a  result, the agency has not yet developed any planning documents to help  ensure that it meets its deadlines, achieves its goal of increasing  efficiency, or addresses licensees\u2019 challenges. NRC staff in the Office of  the Chief Financial Officer said that they recognize there could be delays  in planning, but still expect to implement electronic billing by October  2019.", "We have previously found that federal information technology projects too  frequently incur cost overruns and schedule slippages, but that proper  planning\u2014including incorporating best practices for project planning and  scheduling\u2014may help mitigate these effects. The Project Management  Institute\u2019s A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge  identifies standards related to project management processes, including  project planning. In particular, the guide explains that the project plan is  a comprehensive document that defines the basis of all project work and  describes how the project will be executed, monitored, and controlled.  The project plan integrates and consolidates plans for project  components, such as plans for managing the project\u2019s scope, schedule,  cost, quality, and risk, among others. Among other things, the project  management plan may also include requirements and techniques for  communication among stakeholders and key reviews by management. By  developing a project management plan that is consistent with best  practices, NRC would have more reasonable assurance that it is better  managing its transition to electronic billing.", "Furthermore, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  also states that, in deciding what information is required to achieve  objectives, management should consider the needs of both internal and  external users. Additionally, we have previously identified common factors  critical to successful information technology acquisitions. Among these  factors are (1) involving end users and stakeholders in developing  requirements and (2) including end users in testing of system functionality  prior to formal end user acceptance testing. As NRC develops a project  management plan, by involving licensees in developing system  capabilities for electronic billing, which includes soliciting and considering  licensees\u2019 information needs, the agency would have better assurance of  a successful transition to electronic billing.", "Additionally, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  states that management should design control activities to achieve  objectives. Control activities may include establishing performance measures and indicators and management reviews that compare actual  performance to planned or expected results and analyze significant  differences. As NRC develops a project management plan, including  steps to assess the results of implementing electronic billing, which  includes comparing actual performance of the new electronic billing  system to planned results, would provide the agency more reasonable  assurance that the project meets desired outcomes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["NRC has recently implemented or plans to implement a number of  changes to its billing process that\u2014if implemented as intended\u2014could  address challenges that licensees identified in our interviews.

Licensees told us that they could use more detailed information,  more timely information, and information in an electronic format. NRC has  made more detailed information on staff charges available in biweekly  reports and has developed a process to provide detailed information on  contractor work, upon request from a licensee. NRC is also providing  invoices in electronic format to some licensees, when requested.  However, some licensees that would find the information on staff and  contractor charges useful do not know that it is available, and some NRC  staff are not aware that they can provide it or how to do so.
