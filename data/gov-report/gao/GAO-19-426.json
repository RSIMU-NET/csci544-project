For example, in response to a pipeline incident, TSA coordinates information sharing between federal and pipeline stakeholders and PHMSA coordinates federal activities with an affected pipeline operator to restore service. However, TSA has not revised the plan to reflect changes in at least three key areas: pipeline security threats, such as those related to cybersecurity, incident management policies, and DHS's terrorism alert system. By periodically reviewing and, as appropriate, updating its plan, TSA could better ensure it addresses changes in pipeline security threats and federal law and policy related to cybersecurity, incident management and DHS's terrorism alert system, among other things.

As a result, the Annex is not current and may not fully reflect  the agencies\u2019 pipeline safety and security-related activities. For example,  Homeland Security Presidential Directive/HSPD-7 (HSPD-7), which is  cited as an underlying authority in both the 2004 MOU and 2006 MOU  Annex was revoked and replaced by PPD-21 in 2013.

These responsibilities include  coordinating with sector-specific agencies to carry out its cybersecurity  and critical infrastructure activities. TSA and PHMSA officials stated that  they have closely coordinated in identifying critical infrastructure when  responding to past national emergencies. For example, TSA identified  and provided PHMSA with information on the pipelines that supplied fuel  to specific airports during the hurricane seasons in 2017 and 2018.  However, PHMSA officials stated that both TSA and PHMSA should  consider reviewing how these types of efforts may need to be coordinated  with CISA in the future and whether any adjustments to respective roles  and responsibilities in the MOU Annex are needed. In addition,  representatives from all of the industry associations that we interviewed  stated that the agreement should be revised to consider how the  establishment of CISA may impact current TSA and PHMSA pipeline  security roles and responsibilities. TSA officials stated that they do not  believe that the establishment of CISA impacts TSA\u2019s roles and  responsibilities for identifying pipeline critical infrastructure. While CISA  may or may not have impacts on TSA and PHMSA\u2019s pipeline security  roles, reviewing the MOU Annex in light of new developments, such as  the CISA, would allow the TSA and PHMSA to determine whether  updates are necessary.", "TSA and PHMSA officials stated that distinctions in current inspections  and enforcement operations necessitate a revision to the MOU Annex.  The MOU Annex states that agencies are to explore opportunities for  collaboration in inspection and enforcement activities. According to TSA  and PHMSA officials, they have since explored the possibility for  conducting joint activities and found that distinctions in their respective  operating environments and roles and responsibilities do not allow for  joint inspection and enforcement activities. For example, PHMSA  conducts physical inspections of facilities to assess pipeline operators\u2019  compliance with pipeline safety regulatory requirements and relies on a  range of enforcement activities, such as civil penalties to ensure that  pipeline operators correct safety violations and prevent safety problems.  TSA, however, conducts voluntary security assessments of pipeline\u2019s  corporate security programs and critical facilities and relies on pipeline  operators\u2019 willingness to participate and implement recommended  changes to improve pipeline security. As a result, TSA and PHMSA  officials stated that pipeline operators are reluctant to participate in a  voluntary assessment that might include PHMSA inspectors because they  represent a regulatory agency. TSA, PHMSA and industry association  representatives we interviewed agreed that the annex should be updated  to accurately reflect current distinctions in the agencies\u2019 roles and  responsibilities and their respective operating environments.", "PHMSA officials stated that they had planned to review the MOU Annex  in 2018 to assess current roles and responsibilities and determine  whether any updates to the MOU Annex were needed, but efforts were  delayed because of competing priorities such as addressing the aftermath  of major hurricanes in 2017 and 2018. Specifically, TSA and PHMSA had  agreed to an initial list of timeframes for reviewing the MOU Annex and  these timeframes called for the agencies to complete the MOU Annex  revision in 2018. However, as of March 2019, TSA and PHMSA have yet  to complete the review and although both agencies stated that the review  is ongoing, neither agency could provide updated timeframes for  completion.

TSA and PHMSA  officials also reported that they communicate their agencies\u2019  respective roles and responsibilities for pipeline safety and security to  stakeholders when conducting general outreach, information sharing  efforts, or inspections or assessments. TSA and PHMSA officials  noted that these activities provide opportunities for agency officials  and pipeline stakeholders to clarify their roles and responsibilities  should pipeline operators have questions. Examples of such  community outreach activities include attending meetings of the Oil  and Natural Gas subsector SCC or the Pipeline Modal SCC, and  TSA\u2019s annual International Pipeline Security Forum. TSA officials  also said that TSA\u2019s monthly and quarterly unclassified threat  briefings provided TSA officials and pipeline stakeholders the  opportunity to discuss and clarify their roles and responsibilities.  Additionally, TSA produces classified and unclassified threat  assessments on physical and cyber threats to pipelines, which  according to agency officials can help to clarify TSA\u2019s security role.  Finally, TSA and PHMSA officials said that pipeline security  assessments and safety inspections and other enforcement activities  that the agencies regularly conduct are also opportunities to  communicate their roles and responsibilities. For example, TSA  officials reported that should an operator ask for assistance regarding  a safety issue while TSA staff was conducting a security review, TSA  staff would be able to refer the operator to PHMSA to address the  issue. Similarly, PHMSA officials stated that inspectors would refer an  operator to TSA or its pipeline security guidelines should the operator  have questions regarding, for example, what security measures to  implement.", "The representatives of the four pipeline associations we interviewed  reported that TSA and PHMSA had clearly communicated their respective  roles and responsibilities to pipeline stakeholders.

In addition,  internal control standards also states that changes in an entity\u2019s programs  or activities, organizational structure, personnel, or technology can affect  the operating environment and management can respond by revising  internal controls on a timely basis to ensure effectiveness.

In December 2016, DHS  issued its National Cyber Incident Response Plan (NCIRP). The NCIRP  is to be the primary framework for stakeholders, including pipeline  operators, to understand how federal departments and agencies provide  resources to support response operations for a significant cyber  incident. NCIRP identifies the FBI and the National Cyber Investigative  Joint Task Force as responsible for investigating reported cyber  incidents. NCIRP also identifies the National Cybersecurity and  Communications Integration Center (NCCIC), an agency within DHS, as  responsible for providing technical assistance to affected entities, such as  pipelines, to mitigate vulnerabilities and reduce impacts of cyber  incidents. NCCIC is also to share information across the public and  private sectors to protect against similar incidents in the future.", "In addition, NCIRP provides guidance detailing when and to which federal  agencies or entities the public should report a cyber incident. These  include the FBI, the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force, U.S.  Secret Service, and NCCIC. For example, NCIRP states that any  cybercrime\u2014including computer intrusions or attacks, theft of trade  secrets, criminal hacking, terrorist activity, espionage, sabotage, or other  foreign intelligence activity\u2014is to be reported to FBI field offices\u2019 cyber  task forces. However, TSA\u2019s plan does not include this information or  describe what measures, if any, the agencies with pipeline-related roles  and responsibilities listed in NCIRP are to take in response to a pipeline  cyber incident.", "Moreover, the 2010 plan does not account for other agencies whose roles  and responsibilities are related to critical infrastructure, such as pipelines  and cybersecurity. Specifically, the plan does not account for the role of  NCCIC, which was established in 2009. In addition, TSA\u2019s 2010 plan  does not account for CISA\u2019s role in cyber threat response activities or  how it may affect other agencies\u2019 roles and responsibilities for pipeline  incident response.", "TSA officials acknowledged that reviewing and, as appropriate, revising  the plan would be beneficial to ensuring the plan addresses current  pipeline security threats, technology, and federal laws and policies. They  stated TSA had not updated the plan to include cybersecurity response  protocols because an overarching cybersecurity response protocol for all  critical infrastructure sectors\u2014not just pipelines\u2014should first be  developed. According to TSA officials, developing a pipeline cybersecurity  response protocol would require a whole-of-government approach, as  well as coordination with private sector and input from many sectors  because of the challenges and complexity of critical infrastructure  cybersecurity in general.", "However, through NCIRP, DHS provided a cybersecurity response  protocol across all critical infrastructure sectors in December 2016.  Further, NCIRP states that public and private sector entities should  consider creating an operational cyber incident response plan to further  organize and coordinate their efforts in response to cyber incidents.  Therefore, TSA could potentially provide such an operational cyber  incident response plan for the pipeline sector in its plan.", "TSA could also better ensure that pipeline operators understand how  federal agencies may provide support in response to a cyber incident by  periodically reviewing and, as appropriate, revising the plan to include its  cyber incident response plan. Representatives of the four pipeline  associations we interviewed told us that their membership more clearly  understood federal agencies\u2019 roles and responsibilities related to physical  incidents than to cybersecurity. For example, for physical incidents the  representatives stated that their members clearly understood that they  are to first notify local first responders (often through the emergency 911  system) and appropriate state or federal regulators, and are to contact  either the National Response Center or TSA\u2019s Transportation Security  Operations Center (TSOC), depending on the nature of the incident.", "However, they stated that they did not believe all of their members clearly  understand that they are to report any actual or suspected cyber incidents  that could impact pipeline industrial control systems or other information  technology-based systems to the NCCIC. All of the association  representatives told us that the process for reporting a cyber incident is  less clear because, in part, of the large number of federal agencies with a  cybersecurity-related role. One of the representatives also attributed the  lack of clarity to the reorganization of NCCIC, and the establishment of  CISA. Further, all of the representatives we interviewed indicated that  clarifying the cybersecurity roles and responsibilities of DOE, Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and TSA would, among other  things, improve operators\u2019 ability to appropriately report and respond to a  cyber incident."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Incident Management Policies", "paragraphs": ["TSA also has not updated the plan to address changes in federal incident  management and response policies that have occurred since the plan  was developed in 2010.

The NRF was first issued in 2008 and described the roles, responsibilities  and coordinating structures for delivering core capabilities during incident  response. According to FEMA, it revised the NRF in 2013 and 2016 to  reflect lessons learned from real world events and other experiences  since the framework was first developed. Likewise, NIMS was developed  in 2004 as a comprehensive, national approach to incident management  that was to be applicable at all jurisdictional levels and across functional  disciplines, such as law enforcement, public health, or public works.  According to FEMA, it revised NIMS in 2017 to reflect and incorporate  policy updates and lessons learned from exercises and real-world  incidents. The revision was also intended to clarify that NIMS applies to  all stakeholders with incident management roles, and to enhance  guidance on information management processes, data collection plans,  social media integration, and the use of geographic information systems.

During the prevention/protection phase,  pipeline operators are to use TSA\u2019s pipeline security guidance and the  Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration\u2019s (PHMSA)  safety regulations as the framework to prepare and prevent against an  incident. TSA is responsible for monitoring pipeline owners and  operators\u2019 implementation its security guidelines, and PHMSA is  responsible for enforcing its safety regulations.

It also states that if the FBI receives intelligence about a  pipeline threat, it is to share this information with TSA. TSA is then to  notify the pipeline operator and, if necessary, provide  recommendations for additional protective measures.", "Finally, the prevention/protection section of the plan defines actions  various agencies can implement during a heightened security threat  level to increase protection from a potential attack. For example,  when there is a high risk of a terrorist attack (i.e., red: severe  condition) and threat is general and not specific to pipelines, TSA and  PHMSA are to coordinate to identify the potential for any related or  cascading events that may impact the pipeline sector.

According to the plan, pipeline owners or operators are to  notify local first responders and state regulators through the  emergency 911 system. After the pipeline operator has notified local  government, they are to contact the National Response Center (NRC)  if the incident results in an unintentional release or causes significant  damage. As we previously reported, pipeline operators are also  requested to report any physical security incident that is indicative of a  deliberate attempt to disrupt pipeline operations or activities that could  be considered precursors to such an attempt to TSA\u2019s Transportation  Security Operations Center (TSOC). Once TSA has been notified of  an incident by a pipeline operator, its Pipeline Security Branch is to  monitor the incident, notify relevant federal agencies, and, if deemed  appropriate, activate the Interagency Threat Coordination Committee  (ITCC). PHMSA may also deploy on-scene pipeline inspectors and  investigators which are to among other things, coordinate federal  agencies\u2019 activities with the affected pipeline operator and state  pipeline safety agency, provide subject matter expertise to the  incident command, and direct safe restoration of pipeline facilities and  services.", "The plan also states that, during the response phase, responsibility for  investigating the incident falls to NTSB or the FBI depending on  whether the incident is determined to be the result of criminal activity.  The FBI is solely responsible for investigating any pipeline security  incident that appears to be an intentional criminal act. For example,  if the incident were suspected to be the result of terrorist attack, the  National Joint-Terrorism Task Force would conduct an investigation of  the attack, and if appropriate, with assistance from other FBI assets.  If, however, the incident resulted in fatalities, substantial property  damage, or significant injury to the environment, NTSB would have  responsibility for investigating the incident, and may issue safety  recommendations to help prevent future accidents.", "Recovery. When response activities are complete, PHMSA is to have  primary responsibility for overseeing pipeline operators\u2019 safe  restoration of service with TSA and other federal agencies serving  primarily in support roles. PHMSA, for example, is to work with the  owner/operator to facilitate restoration of service by, among other  things, providing technical oversight, advice, and guidance to  owner/operators; coordinating recovery activities with state pipeline  safety agency, and evaluate whether to a special permit is necessary  to facilitate an expedited restoration of services.
