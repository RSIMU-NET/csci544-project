IBD patients often have difficulty digesting food. As a result, they may require parenteral nutrition (intravenous feeding) or enteral nutrition (tube feeding), medically necessary food products to supplement their diets, and medications. In addition, some IBD patients must care for their ostomies--surgically created openings for the discharge of digested food. IBD advocates have recently expressed concerns regarding the ability of IBD patients to obtain the health care they need. The Research Review Act of 2004 directed GAO to study the Medicare and Medicaid coverage standards for individuals with IBD, in both home health and outpatient delivery settings. GAO (1) identified the Medicare and Medicaid coverage standards for five key therapies used for the treatment of IBD and (2) determined what specific supplies used in these therapies Medicare and Medicaid programs will pay for. In this work, GAO examined Medicare's national and local coverage policies and conducted a survey of Medicaid programs in the 50 states and the District of Columbia."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Medicare generally provides coverage for parenteral and enteral nutrition and ostomy supplies in both home health and outpatient delivery settings. However, specific standards regarding medical conditions and appropriate documentation must be met for parenteral and enteral nutrition to be covered. Medicare has one coverage standard governing the provision of ostomy supplies--that beneficiaries receiving these items have had an ostomy. Medicare does not cover medically necessary food products and generally does not cover self-administered drugs, which include most drugs taken by IBD patients. However, medically necessary drugs, including those that are self-administered, will be covered by Medicare's voluntary prescription drug benefit, which becomes effective in January 2006. State Medicaid programs reported covering, at least partially, each of the five therapies. The survey indicated that most states' Medicaid coverage standards are generally comparable to Medicare's coverage for parenteral and enteral nutrition and ostomy care. Once Medicare coverage standards are met, the program will generally cover all medically necessary supplies associated with parenteral and enteral nutrition and ostomy care. The survey of state Medicaid programs showed variation in the specific supplies that states will provide. While many states pay for most supplies associated with parenteral and enteral nutrition, the specific ostomy supplies states cover vary. Most states--46--reported covering at least some medically necessary food products. GAO also found that states generally cover the drugs listed in the survey. CMS said that GAO correctly described its Medicare coverage policies and suggested that we clarify our description of Medicare's coverage policy for prescription drugs that are not self-administered. It also said that it will continue to consider access issues for Medicare and Medicaid IBD patients."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) refers to two chronic autoimmune  diseases of the intestinal tract\u2014Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis.  These diseases may result in abdominal pain, weight loss, fever, rectal  bleeding, and diarrhea, and are associated with a decreased quality of life.  IBD generally involves periods of active inflammation alternating with  periods of remission.", "The estimated one million Americans with IBD\u201410 percent of whom are  children\u2014have difficulty digesting food and may require different  treatments, depending on the specific nature of their condition. As a  result, some IBD patients may periodically require parenteral nutrition\u2014 the provision of nutrients intravenously. Others may receive enteral  nutrition, which is delivered through a feeding tube inserted into their  noses or stomachs. Some IBD patients may require nutrition in the form of  medically necessary food products, such as formulas that are more easily  digested than normal foods. IBD patients may also require medication,  and some may have ostomies\u2014surgically created openings in their  abdominal wall for the discharge of digested food\u2014and therefore depend  on a pouching system to collect, contain, and manage disposal of solid  body waste.", "A number of IBD patients depend on Medicare and Medicaid, the nation\u2019s  largest health insurance programs, for coverage of their treatment.  Medicare serves approximately 41 million elderly and certain disabled  beneficiaries and is administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services (CMS), an agency within the Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS). Based on the Social Security Act, CMS, and the claims  administration contractors that assist it in administering the Medicare  program, determine whether specific medical procedures, devices, and  services should be covered. Medicaid is a federal-state program that  finances health care coverage for approximately 54 million low income  individuals, about half of whom are children. Under CMS\u2019s oversight, each  state administers its own Medicaid program. Within broad coverage  requirements set by law and CMS, states have discretion to develop  specific coverage policies for their Medicaid programs. In fiscal year 2004,  Medicare paid about $298 billion for services and supplies provided to  beneficiaries while Medicaid programs paid close to $272 billion.", "Over the past few years, IBD advocates have tried to raise awareness  about IBD and the challenges IBD patients face, including concerns about  obtaining the health care that they need to manage their disease. The  Research Review Act of 2004 contains several provisions related to IBD,  including a mandate that we conduct a study on the Medicare and  Medicaid coverage standards for IBD patients. The act required us to  focus on five specific therapies\u2014in both home health and outpatient  delivery settings\u2014parenteral nutrition, enteral nutrition formula, ostomy  care, medically necessary food products, and drugs approved by the Food  and Drug Administration (FDA) for Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis.  In this report, we (1) identify the Medicare and Medicaid coverage  standards for these five therapies, and (2) determine which specific  supplies used in these therapies Medicare and Medicaid programs will pay  for in home health and outpatient delivery settings.", "To determine Medicare\u2019s coverage standards for the five therapies, we  obtained and reviewed relevant Medicare laws, regulations, national  coverage policies, and manuals to identify pertinent material. We also  interviewed CMS officials and the medical directors of the Durable  Medical Equipment Regional Carriers (DMERC)\u2014the four claims  administration contractors involved in making local coverage decisions for  applicable therapies in our study. In addition, we discussed and obtained  documentation regarding specific supplies used in the five therapies that  Medicare would pay for in both home health and outpatient delivery  settings.", "To obtain information on Medicaid\u2019s coverage of the five therapies, we  developed a survey that we sent to Medicaid offices in all 50 states and the  District of Columbia and asked them to identify applicable coverage  standards. The survey asked state officials to identify specific supplies  their Medicaid program would pay for. It also asked them to note any  distinctions between supplies covered in home health and outpatient  delivery settings, and to indicate whether they had different coverage  policies for adults and children. Our survey was generally based on  relevant Medicare coverage standards and provided states with the  opportunity to describe how their coverage policies varied from  Medicare\u2019s policies and to report other pertinent standards they may have  established. In addition, our survey included a list of drugs to treat IBD  that was developed in consultation with the FDA. Specifically, the survey  listed nine brand name drugs and two generic drugs that the FDA told us it  had approved to treat Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis.", "We received responses from all of the states and reviewed these data for  obvious inconsistency errors and completeness. For responses that were  unclear or incomplete, we contacted survey respondents to obtain  clarification before conducting our analyses. When necessary, we  compared our electronic data files of survey responses to the actual  surveys that we obtained from states. Based on these efforts, we  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report. To obtain detailed background on the specific supplies that are  associated with each of the therapies, we also contacted representatives  from eight organizations representing patients with IBD, and medical  experts. (See app. I for additional information on our scope and  methodology.) We conducted our work from December 2004 through  November 2005, in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["IBD refers to Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. Crohn\u2019s disease can  involve any area of the gastrointestinal tract but most commonly affects  the small intestine, which is responsible for the body\u2019s absorption of most  needed nutrients, and the beginning of the large intestine, or colon. This  inflammation can result in excessive diarrhea, severe rectal bleeding,  anemia, fever, and abdominal pain. In addition, malnutrition or nutritional  deficiencies are also common among Crohn\u2019s disease patients, particularly  if the disease is extensive and of long duration. Two-thirds to three- quarters of patients with Crohn\u2019s disease will require surgery\u2014in most  cases, to remove the diseased segment of the bowel and any associated  abscess. In some cases, an ostomy to remove the colon also may be  required. However, surgery is not considered a cure for Crohn\u2019s disease  patients because the disease frequently recurs. Ulcerative colitis only  affects the colon. This condition causes diarrhea and bleeding, and can  ultimately lead to colon cancer. In one-quarter to one-third of patients with  ulcerative colitis, medical therapy is not completely successful or  complications arise. Under these circumstances, an ostomy operation may  be performed. Because inflammation in ulcerative colitis is confined to the  colon, the disease is curable by this operation.", "IBD may occur at any age, but it most commonly develops between the  ages of 10 and 30. One-third of IBD patients develop symptoms before  adolescence. In such cases, the disease poses special problems because it  can impair children\u2019s bodies\u2019 ability to absorb nutrients and thus adversely  affects their growth and development.", "IBD patients, depending on each individual\u2019s unique circumstances, may  rely on one or more of the following key therapies in either home health or  outpatient delivery settings to manage their disease:    Parenteral nutrition is the intravenous administration of nutrients through  a catheter that carries liquid nutrients directly into the bloodstream, where  they are absorbed by the body, entirely bypassing the gastrointestinal  tract. It is typically used to treat patients with severe cases of IBD. In such  instances, patients\u2019 gastrointestinal tracts cannot tolerate nutrition by  mouth or a feeding tube. The provision of parenteral nutrition allows the  intestines to rest and heal, and may relieve acute attacks and delay or  avoid the need for surgery. Supplies used in parenteral nutrition include  parenteral nutrition solutions and various products necessary to  administer the solutions to the patient, such as infusion pumps and  intravenous poles. Parenteral nutrition supply kits include supplies  necessary to transfer the solution to the infusion pump, such as tubes, and  sterilization pads. Parenteral nutrition administration kits include supplies  necessary to transfer the solution from the pump to the patient, such as  intravenous catheters, dressings, tapes, antiseptics, and sterile gloves.", "Enteral nutrition is indicated for patients with a functioning  gastrointestinal tract but whose oral nutrient intake is insufficient to meet  their nutritional needs. Enteral nutrition employs a feeding tube to deliver  a liquid nutritional formula to the stomach or small intestine\u2014it is  administered either through the nose or directly through the abdominal  wall into the gastrointestinal tract. For IBD patients, and particularly for  Crohn\u2019s disease patients whose inflamed small intestine may not allow  them to absorb enough nutrients, this method\u2014either used alone, or in  combination with food or liquids taken orally\u2014may restore good nutrition  to patients weakened by severe diarrhea and poor nutrition. In addition,  according to gastrointestinal disease experts, enteral nutrition may have  therapeutic effects as well, by inducing remission. Supplies used in enteral  nutrition include enteral formulas and supplies necessary to administer  this therapy, such as enteral nutrition infusion pumps, intravenous poles,  catheters, and tubes. Enteral feeding supply kits include supplies  necessary to administer the formula to the patient, such as syringes, tubing  to transfer the formula to the catheter, tube connectors, and sterile  gloves. Tubing that goes inside the patient\u2019s body to administer the  nutrients\u2014i.e., nasogastric tubing that delivers the formula to the patient\u2019s  gastrointestinal system through the nose, or gastrostomy tubing that  delivers the formula through a surgically created opening in the stomach\u2014 is also necessary. Other supplies needed may include additives, such as  fiber, to thicken enteral formulas.", "Medically necessary food products are products that can be taken orally.", "They include food supplements, such as the formulas used in enteral  nutrition, and prescription strength vitamins. For example, because  Crohn\u2019s disease and surgical procedures that remove parts of the small  intestine can inhibit absorption of vitamins, fats, and other important  nutrients, taking certain supplements, such as fish oil, antioxidants, and  mineral supplements, may be beneficial for patients with Crohn\u2019s disease.", "Medications are often required to treat Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative  colitis. The FDA has approved both brand name drugs and generic drugs  to treat IBD. These drugs are typically self-administered and taken to  reduce inflammation in the intestinal wall. In addition, there are other  medications approved by the FDA\u2014but not specifically to treat IBD\u2014that  may be effective in treating the disease.", "IBD patients who have had an ostomy operation need to use specific  supplies for their ostomy care. An ostomy surgery creates an opening in  the abdomen. This opening, called a stoma, permits digested food to exit  the body. In most cases, this type of surgery results in a permanent  opening. Subsequent to the operation, ostomy patients need certain  supplies to manage the abdominal opening and the waste. For example,  the patient wears a pouch over the opening to collect the waste and then  empties the pouch as needed. Other necessary supplies include skin  barriers to protect the skin and irrigation and fluid discharge supplies.", "Medicare pays for beneficiaries\u2019 medically necessary health care needs as  long as they fit into one of the broadly-defined categories of benefits  established in the Social Security Act. Among other things, these  categories include commonly used medical services and supplies such as  physician visits, inpatient hospital stays, diagnostic tests, durable medical  equipment, and prosthetic devices. While the act provides for broad  coverage of many medical and health care services, it does not provide an  exhaustive list of all services covered. Similarly, the act generally does  not specify which medical devices, surgical procedures, or diagnostic  services the program covers. In addition, the act states that the program  cannot pay for any supplies or services that are not \u201creasonable and  necessary\u201d for the diagnosis and treatment of an illness or injury. With  the Social Security Act serving as the primary authority for all coverage  provisions, CMS has established coverage policies that specify the  procedures, devices, and services that are covered in the broad benefit  categories established in the act. In addition, CMS has established the  criteria used to determine whether these supplies are reasonable and  necessary for a beneficiary\u2019s treatment. CMS\u2019s national coverage  determinations (NCDs) describe the circumstances for Medicare coverage  for a specific medical service, procedure, or device and they outline the  conditions for coverage. CMS interpretive manuals further define when  and under what circumstances items or services may be covered.", "Claims administration contractors are required to follow CMS\u2019s national  coverage policies. However, if an NCD does not specifically exclude or  limit coverage for an item or service, or if the item or service is not  mentioned at all in an NCD or CMS manual, it is up to the contractors to  determine whether they will cover a particular item or service within their  geographic area. This is often done through a local coverage determination  (LCD). LCDs specify under what circumstances the item or service is  considered to be reasonable and necessary, in accordance with the Social  Security Act, and are supplemented by additional instructions from the  contractors. LCDs related to durable medical equipment, prosthetic  devices, orthotics, and a number of other supplies are made by the  DMERCs\u2014the four CMS claims administration contractors that process  claims exclusively for these supplies. The DMERCs are required by CMS to  coordinate their coverage development process with one another and they  publish identical LCDs.", "Medicaid coverage policies vary by state. While all state Medicaid  programs must pay for certain services, such as inpatient and outpatient  hospital services, and early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and  treatment services for individuals under the age of 21, states have broad  discretion in setting up their Medicaid programs. They may set different  eligibility standards, scope of services, and payments, and can elect to  cover a range of optional populations and benefits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coverage of IBD Therapies Is Subject to Medicare and Medicaid Standards", "paragraphs": ["Medicare generally covers parenteral and enteral nutrition and ostomy  care in home health and outpatient delivery settings for beneficiaries who  meet certain medical standards. These three IBD therapies are included in  specific benefit categories established by the Social Security Act\u2014 primarily the prosthetic devices benefit category, and in the case of  ostomy care provided in a home health care delivery setting, the home  health benefit category. Medicare does not cover medically necessary food  products or most drugs approved by the FDA that are used to treat IBD.  However, in January 2006, Medicare will begin to cover medically  necessary drugs when the program\u2019s new prescription drug benefit  becomes effective. None of the five therapies we examined for this report  are mandatory services under Medicaid. However, our survey of Medicaid  programs indicates that most of these programs provided eligible  individuals some coverage for all five therapies.

CMS\u2019s coverage standards for  parenteral nutrition therapy are outlined in both an NCD and in local  coverage policy. Coverage is provided in both home health and outpatient  delivery settings. The NCD requires the patient to have a severe pathology  of the alimentary tract that does not allow absorption of sufficient  nutrients to maintain weight and strength commensurate with the patient\u2019s  general condition. A period of hospitalization is required to initiate  coverage for parenteral nutrition and to train the patient in how to  prepare, manage, and administer the formula and equipment. The NCD  also requires a physician\u2019s written order or prescription and sufficient  medical documentation to show that the prosthetic device coverage  requirements are met and that parenteral nutrition therapy is medically  necessary. In addition, before approving coverage, the carrier must agree  that a particular condition qualifies for parenteral nutrition therapy.  Medicare will approve coverage of parenteral nutrition at periodic  intervals of no more than three months. In addition, Medicare will pay for  no more than one month\u2019s supply of nutrients at a time.", "Building upon the coverage standards in the NCD, the DMERCs\u2019 local  coverage policy on parenteral nutrition provides significantly more  detailed requirements. The policy consists of specific clinical criteria for  showing that parenteral nutrition is considered reasonable and necessary.  Like the NCD, the local policy specifies that a patient must either have a  condition involving the small intestine that significantly impairs the  absorption of nutrients, or a disease of the stomach or intestine that  impairs the ability of nutrients to be transported through the  gastrointestinal system. The local coverage policy also requires that the  patient\u2019s inability to maintain proper weight and strength necessitates  intravenous nutrition, and that the patient is unable to be treated through  either diet modification or with drugs. It also describes specific clinical  conditions that meet these criteria. For patients who do not meet the  standards for these clinical conditions, coverage for parenteral nutrition  will be considered on an individual basis if detailed documentation is  submitted. However, some patients with moderate abnormalities may not  be covered unless they have experienced an unsuccessful trial of enteral  nutrition.", "Medicaid: Our survey responses indicated that all states provide some  parenteral nutrition coverage for children and all but one\u2014Georgia\u2014 provide such coverage for adults. However, Georgia reported that it would  consider coverage for adults under an appeal process to its medical  director. Our results showed variation among states in the standards used  to determine coverage for parenteral nutrition. Seven states used all six of  the coverage standards listed in our survey to determine whether Medicaid  would cover parenteral nutrition therapy for adults and children. The  remaining 44 states used a variety of the six coverage standards. For  example, Arkansas, California, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Oregon  require individuals to meet three of the six standards, including pathology  and documentation. Forty-five states indicated that before covering  parenteral nutrition therapy for individuals, they would require some form  of documentation, such as proof of a medical condition. Forty-one of these  same states also required individuals to have a severe pathology of the  gastrointestinal tract that would not allow absorption of sufficient  nutrients to maintain weight and strength. Only one state\u2014Minnesota\u2014 provided coverage for parenteral nutrition therapy without listing any  specific conditions that individuals must meet to receive therapy.

As with  parenteral nutrition, coverage for enteral nutrition is provided in both  home health and outpatient delivery settings. However, for enteral  nutrition, the patient may have a functioning gastrointestinal tract but  must be unable to maintain appropriate weight and strength due to  pathology to, or the nonfunction of, the structures that normally permit  food to reach the digestive tract. The only other differing requirement in  the NCD between the two therapies is that there is no hospitalization  requirement for a patient seeking Medicare coverage for enteral nutrition.  The NCD also requires a physician\u2019s written order or prescription and  sufficient medical documentation to show that the prosthetic device  coverage requirements are met and that enteral nutrition therapy is  medically necessary.", "The local coverage policy on enteral nutrition is simpler than the local  policy for parenteral nutrition. It provides coverage for enteral nutrition so  long as adequate nutrition is not possible by either dietary adjustment or  oral supplements. Tube feedings of enteral nutrition must be required to  provide sufficient nutrients to maintain weight and strength  commensurate with the patient\u2019s overall health status due to either one of  two conditions: (1) a permanent non-function or disease of the structures  that normally permit food to reach the small bowel, or (2) a disease of the  small bowel which impairs digestion and absorption of an oral diet.  However, coverage is possible for patients with partial impairments, such  as a Crohn\u2019s disease patient who requires prolonged infusion of enteral  nutrients to overcome a problem with absorption.

Six states reported that they  cover enteral nutrition therapy for patients who meet all six coverage  standards listed in our survey. The remaining states used a variety of the  six coverage standards.

Washington reported that, in addition  to subjecting individuals to most of the criteria listed in our survey, it also  requires prior approval of enteral nutrition therapy based on  documentation showing that the therapy is medically necessary and  outlining why traditional food is not appropriate. We also found that for  both adults and children, 45 of the 49 states that cover enteral nutrition  therapy require individuals to have specific documentation in their  medical records before the states would render coverage.

For  example, if the physician orders enteral nutrition supplies for a longer  period of time than is indicated on the original certificate of medical  necessity, the enteral nutrition policy will require recertification. However,  the enteral nutrition policy generally has fewer documentation  requirements than that of parenteral nutrition.", "Based on our survey, state Medicaid programs\u2019 payment for seven of the  most commonly used enteral nutrition therapy supplies varies depending  on the type of product, delivery setting, and whether the patient is an adult  or a child. Table 3 shows that states reported that their Medicaid programs  pay for enteral feeding supply kits and tubing more than other therapy  supplies. In addition, more states pay for enteral supplies for children than  adults and more states pay for supplies in outpatient delivery settings than  in home health delivery settings.", "Further analysis revealed that 15 states pay for all seven supplies listed in  our survey in both home health and outpatient delivery settings for adults  and children. Thirty states pay for five or more enteral nutrition supplies  for adults and children in these same settings. We also found that additives  for enteral formula, such as fiber, are the least covered product, with only  21 states covering it in both home health and outpatient delivery settings  for adults and children. For specific results of enteral nutrition supplies  provided by each state, see app. VII."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ostomy Supplies Covered by Medicare and Medicaid", "paragraphs": ["Medicare covers all of the types of ostomy supplies used by IBD patients  who require ostomy care. However, there are two restrictions regarding  the types of ostomy supplies covered. First, Medicare will only provide a  beneficiary with one type of liquid skin barrier if one is needed\u2014either a  liquid or spray barrier, or individual wipes. Second, Medicare will only pay  for one type of drainage supply\u2014a stoma cap, a stoma plug, or gauze  pads\u2014on a given day. These restrictions are imposed by the DMERCs in a  local coverage policy, which also specifies the \u201cusual maximum quantity\u201d  of supplies that typically meet the needs of ostomy patients for a specific  time period (generally for either 1 or 6 months) for each of the most  commonly used ostomy supplies. However, according to the four DMERC  medical directors, these quantities only serve as guidelines. Because the  need for ostomy supplies can vary substantially among patients, DMERCs  may cover supplies that exceed the usual maximum quantities if the need  is justified.", "Medicare\u2019s coverage of ostomy supplies is different for IBD patients who  receive care under a home health plan of care than for those who receive  it in an outpatient delivery setting. If an IBD patient is being served by a  home health agency and is under a home health plan of care, all of the  patient\u2019s medical supplies, including ostomy supplies, are considered part  of the Medicare home health services benefit. This is generally the case  even when the IBD is a pre-existing condition unrelated to the immediate  reason for home health care, such as hip replacement surgery. Medicare  pays a fixed amount determined under a prospective payment system to  the home health agency for the cost of all covered home health visits,  including ostomy supplies delivered during these visits. The home health  agency is obligated to provide the beneficiary with the necessary ostomy  supplies, which are bundled with all other necessary home health services.  The home health agency selects the type of ostomy products to be used  and if the patient wishes to use different products, the patient must do so  at his or her own expense. This practice can be contrasted to the  outpatient delivery setting, where the products are generally selected by  the patient, or the patient\u2019s doctor.", "All states responded that their Medicaid programs pay for ostomy supplies  for adults and children who have had ostomies; however the range of  supplies covered varied. Because of the relatively large number of supplies  commonly used by ostomy patients we grouped these supplies in nine  categories, based on input from a representative of the United Ostomy  Association. Table 4 shows the median percent of states covering ostomy  supplies in home health and outpatient delivery settings, after they have  been placed in these categories. For example, for the 14 supplies in the  drainable pouch with standard barrier supplies category\u2014half of supplies  are covered by at least 84 percent of states in home health delivery  settings and 85 percent of states in outpatient delivery settings. In general,  states\u2019 coverage of ostomy supplies was greater in outpatient, than in  home health delivery settings. For more details on the individual ostomy  supplies included in each category and the percent of states covering each  supply, see app. VIII.", "Twenty-four states reported covering all of the ostomy supplies listed in  our survey in both delivery settings. Nine of the 24 states that covered all  supplies imposed no supply limits or dollar caps on individuals. The  remaining 15 states reported that they had supply limits or dollar caps;  however five of these states\u2014Arizona, Hawaii, North Dakota, Rhode  Island, and Virginia\u2014added that they often allowed individuals to exceed  these limits and caps for certain supplies. For example, one state reported  that while it has a supply limit of one box of 50 skin barrier wipes and  dollar cap of $9.36 per month, it will often allow individuals to exceed  limits and caps.

In examining Medicare and  Medicaid coverage of these therapies and the related supplies, we  considered whether each program would cover these items in both home  health and outpatient settings. For purposes of this study, we defined  these settings as follows:    Home health care refers to the situation in which a medical supply is being  provided to the individual by a home health aide or others through an  arrangement made by a home health agency, in accordance with a plan for  furnishing the supply that a physician has established and periodically  reviews. The supply is provided through visits made to an individual\u2019s  residence.", "Outpatient care refers to any situation in which a patient receives a  medical supply but does not require an overnight hospital stay.

Specifically, we examined CMS\u2019s database of national coverage  determinations (NCD) as well as its interpretive manuals, which address  coverage policies. We also reviewed local coverage policies established by  CMS\u2019s four Durable Medical Equipment Regional Carriers (DMERC). In  addition, we reviewed relevant Medicare laws and regulations. To clarify  our understanding of these materials, we interviewed CMS officials and  the medical directors of the four DMERCs.

The survey addressed each state\u2019s coverage  policies and medical criteria that an individual must meet to receive each  of the five therapies as a Medicaid benefit. Specifically, we asked states to  indicate whether their program provides coverage of each of the five  therapies and the criteria and conditions they have established, if  applicable. In general, we used Medicare\u2019s coverage policies as a basis for  the survey\u2019s coverage questions, and we provided states the opportunity to  describe how their policies varied from Medicare\u2019s policies. We also  provided states with the option of describing other pertinent criteria they  may have established. The survey asked them to indicate whether they had  different coverage policies for adults and children for such therapies.  Because Medicare does not cover medically necessary food products and  self-administered prescription medications, we formulated our survey  questions on applicable coverage standards for these two items based on  discussions with medical experts and organizations that represent IBD  patients, and our review of pertinent literature. Regarding drugs used to  treat IBD, we consulted with the FDA, which provided us with a list of  nine brand name drugs and two generic drugs that it had approved to treat  Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis.

For responses that were unclear or incomplete,  we contacted survey respondents to obtain clarification before conducting  our analyses.
