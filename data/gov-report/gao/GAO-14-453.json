IRS does not have a similar study for partnerships. Using IRS data and the study results, GAO derived a rough-order-of-magnitude estimate of $91 billion per year of partnership and S corporation income being misreported by individuals for 2006 through 2009.", "IRS examinations and automated document matching have not been effective at finding most of the estimated misreported income. For example, IRS reported that examinations identified about $16 billion per year of misreporting in 2011 and 2012, the bulk of which related to partnerships. However, such information about compliance results is not reliable. IRS estimated that 3 to 22 percent of the misreporting by partnerships was double counted due to some partnership income being allocated to other partnerships or related parties. Further, IRS does not know how income misreporting by partnerships affects taxes paid by partners. IRS does not have a strategy to improve the information. As a result, IRS does not have reliable information about its compliance results to fully inform decisions about allocating examination resources across different types of businesses.", "IRS's processes for selecting returns to examine could be improved. Not all partnership and S corporation line items from paper returns are digitized, and IRS officials said that having more return information available electronically might improve examination selection. In 2011, about 65 percent of partnerships and S corporations electronically filed (e-filed). Certain large partnerships and S corporations are required by statute to e-file. Expanding the mandate would increase digitized data available for examination selection. Further, in 1995 GAO found that IRS's computer scoring system for selecting partnership returns to examine used outdated information. IRS does not have a strategy to update and use this information to select partnerships for examination. Relatively few partnerships are examined compared to other business entities, and many examinations result in no change in taxes owed. Improved examination selection based on more current information could generate more revenue and reduce IRS examinations of compliant taxpayers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO suggests that Congress consider requiring more partnerships and corporations to e-file their tax returns.

By  not transcribing more partnership and S corporation line items, IRS might  be forgoing proposed adjustments to income that could result in  increased tax assessments that might offset the cost of added  transcription. However, according to an IRS official, more transcription  might not be IRS\u2019s highest-priority partnership data problem. A higher- priority problem would be the issues described earlier with the accuracy,  completeness, and timeliness of K-1 data.

Likewise, in calculating net misreported income, we considered only  partnership and S corporation income that was separately reported on  Form 1040\u2019s Schedule E, Supplemental Income and Loss. Some income  from partnerships and S corporations may also be included within, and  reported under, other line items on Form 1040, such as capital gains.", "IRS has not issued its own estimate of misreporting of partnership and S  corporation income for 2006 or later. Our estimate of lost tax revenue  cannot be used to compute a tax gap estimate (defined by IRS as the  amount of tax liability faced by taxpayers that is not paid on time), as IRS  may perform additional adjustments for its tax gap estimates.", "To calculate the amount of taxes that corresponded to our misreporting  estimate, we used NRP data to calculate the income and misreporting  that related to individuals with different effective tax rates (defined as total  tax divided by adjusted gross income). From 2006 to 2009, taxpayers with  effective tax rates of less than 15 percent had an aggregate annual net  loss on income from partnerships and S corporations, while taxpayers  with effective tax rates of 15 percent or higher had aggregate net income.  The highest tax bracket was 35 percent. Looking at taxpayers with  effective tax rates between 15 and 35 percent, and using the minimum  and maximum tax rates within each effective tax rate grouping and point  estimates for misreporting, we calculated lower and upper bounds for the  amount of tax that would have been owed on their misreported income  from partnerships and S corporations. With this, we arrived at an estimate  of $5 billion to $6 billion. Adjusting our point estimate for taxes based on  the same methodology discussed above for our misreporting estimate, we  arrived at an estimated $19 billion in taxes owed on the misreported  income."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comparison of Individual Misreporting of Income from S Corporations and Partnerships with Misreporting of Other Income Types", "paragraphs": ["There are several ways to compare the extent and nature of misreporting  of partnership and S corporation income with individuals\u2019 misreporting of  other types of income, which are shown in table 5. To compare net  misreporting of income from partnerships and S corporations with other  types of income, we needed to use unadjusted data, because IRS had  not issued adjusted results for 2006 or later at the level of detail needed  for the table. For example, the unadjusted net misreporting amount for  partnership and S corporation income shown in the table is $27 billion, as  opposed to the adjusted amount of $91 billion.", "In general, frequency of misreporting of income from partnerships and S  corporations was lower than for income from sole proprietorships, and  higher than for misreporting of income from nonbusiness sources. There  is a general pattern in misreporting of income. The more third-party  information reporting there is for a type of income (such as W-2s for  wages), the less misreporting there is for that type of income (see table  5). According to IRS, information reporting increases voluntary tax  compliance because taxpayers know that IRS is aware of their income.  For example, employer information on wages and earnings is sent both to  employees and to IRS, and for tax years 2006 through 2009, the net  misreporting percentage for wages was less than 1 percent.", "Partnerships and S corporations send partners, shareholders, and IRS  Schedules K-1 that state the amount of income distributed to each partner  or shareholder. In comparison, most other types of business income  earned by individuals are covered by little to no information reporting.  However, according to IRS officials, many partnerships and S  corporations issuing K-1s are closely held, i.e., controlled by the individual  taxpayers receiving the K-1s. In these cases, the information on the K-1  does not truly come from an unrelated third party."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Additional Information about K- 1 Matching", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "K-1 Matching Is Complicated for Several Reasons", "paragraphs": ["Schedule K-1 reporting is complex for several reasons:", "Some taxpayers with K-1 income have K-1s from multiple  partnerships and S corporations, which adds complexity. For  example, a taxpayer may net the income/loss amounts from different  K-1s, so that the netted amount reported on the 1040 will not match  the individual K-1s, but correct information may turn out to be  contained within the netted numbers, according to IRS officials.", "One tax return preparer we interviewed noted that when tiered  networks are involved (e.g., partnerships that have other partnerships  as partners), each tier must wait for the tier above it to send its K-1s in  order to have accurate information, yet they all have the same filing  deadline. If the top-tier entity sends its K-1s close to the deadline, the  lower tiers must estimate the amounts to put on their own K-1s in  order to file on time. This can lead to inaccuracies and mismatches.", "When taxpayers respond to notices about mismatches, IRS guidance  directs AUR reviewers to consider the reasonableness of taxpayers\u2019  responses, but reviewers generally do not examine the accuracy of  the information in the responses because they do not have  examination authority.", "K-1 matching is only designed to detect noncompliance at the  taxpayer level, not at the entity level. According to an IRS official,  because many partnerships and S corporations issuing K-1s are  controlled by the individual taxpayers receiving the K-1s, the  information on K-1s may match what is on the Forms 1040 but still  understate taxes owed.", "Because of issues like these, K-1 matching is only part of IRS\u2019s efforts to  ensure compliance with tax rules about income from partnerships and S  corporations.

As shown in figure 10,  about 61 percent of the returns with partnership and S corporation K-1  mismatches in IRS\u2019s AUR workload were screened out. That is, the AUR  examiner determined that despite the mismatch, the taxpayer was in  compliance with tax law or within a small tolerance threshold (i.e., income  or expenses were misreported by an amount below what IRS considers  productive to address), and the AUR examiner did not contact the  taxpayer. In contrast, about 18 percent of all returns in the total AUR  workload were screened out.
