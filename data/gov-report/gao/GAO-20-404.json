In addition, cyberattacks, such as those that  affected San Francisco\u2019s mass transit system in 2016 and Deutsche Bahn  in Germany in 2017, as well as derailment attempts in Germany in 2018,  demonstrate the evolving nature of the threat to passenger rail. In 2017,  there were more than 4.8 billion passenger trips on rail systems in the  United States. Rail operators and federal agencies are faced daily with  the challenge of protecting passengers without compromising the  accessibility and efficiency of rail travel.

We also conducted site visits to two foreign countries and  interviewed government officials and officials from three passenger rail  agencies in these countries. We conducted these interviews and visits  to obtain perspectives on both domestic and foreign passenger rail  security standards and key practices, as well as TSA engagement in this  area. To select domestic rail agencies, we first identified agencies with  the largest passenger volume by type of agency (heavy, light, or  commuter rail). We then selected specific agencies to interview based on  the following factors: type of system, geographic diversity, the presence  of a large intermodal station, expert referral, and experience with security  threats or incidents. We selected the foreign countries we visited based  on the size of passenger rail operations, presence of a large intermodal  station, expert referral, and experience with security threats or incidents.  While the perspectives of rail agencies and officials we interviewed are  not generalizable to all rail agencies and countries, they provided a range  of perspectives on the topics within the scope of our review.", "To further address our second objective, we reviewed documentation  from domestic and international rail security working groups and  meetings, such as those hosted by the American Public Transportation  Association (APTA), and the International Working Group on Land  Transport Security, among others. We further reviewed all available  security-related standards and recommended practice documents APTA  produced from calendar years 2009 through 2019 to determine whether  TSA participated in developing or reviewing the documents. In addition,  we interviewed TSA officials as well as representatives from APTA, the  Association of American Railroads, and the Mineta Transportation  Institute to identify current threats, existing key practices in passenger rail  security, and TSA\u2019s role in identifying these practices. To further  understand TSA\u2019s efforts to engage with foreign passenger rail  stakeholders, we interviewed TSA Representatives (TSARs) located in  two countries we visited.

Passenger rail operators, however, have the day to day responsibility for  carrying out safety and security measures for their systems. Unlike the  aviation environment, where TSA has operational responsibility for  screening passengers and baggage for prohibited items prior to boarding  a commercial aircraft, the agency has a limited operational role for  securing mass transit (including rail). To secure passenger rail, TSA  primarily partners with public and private transportation operators to  address their security needs by conducting vulnerability assessments and  sharing intelligence information and key practices, among other  measures. The agency also engages with the passenger rail industry  through associations, such as APTA and Association of American  Railroads. Additionally, TSA is responsible for assessing the risk from  terrorism and cyber threats to passenger rail, as well as other  transportation modes.", "In addition to engaging with domestic passenger rail stakeholders, TSA\u2019s  Office of Policy, Plans, and Engagement is responsible for coordinating  domestic and international multimodal transportation security polices,  programs, directives, strategies, and initiatives, including conducting  outreach to foreign stakeholders. TSA also engages with foreign  stakeholders through TSARs. TSARs are primarily located in posts  overseas and communicate with foreign government officials to address  transportation security matters involving all modes of transportation,  including aviation, rail, mass transit, highways, and pipelines. The TSAR  role was originally created in response to the 1988 bombing of Pan Am  Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, when the Aviation Security  Improvement Act of 1990 was enacted, which provided that foreign  security liaison officers were to serve as liaisons to foreign governments  in carrying out U.S. government security requirements at specific  airports. TSARs are responsible for ensuring the implementation of  TSA\u2019s requirements primarily as they relate to passenger and cargo air  transportation departing the specific country en route to the United States.  The primary focus of the role remains on aviation; however it has evolved  over time to include maritime and land transportation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Physical and Cybersecurity Threats to Passenger Rail", "paragraphs": ["According to TSA, recent attacks overseas and online terrorist messaging  point to public transportation systems, which include passenger rail  systems, as continued high-value targets for terrorists.

As such, these systems are inherently vulnerable to physical  attacks (such as improvised explosive devices, active shooters, and  chemical or biological attacks) due in part to factors such as high  ridership, open access points, limited exit lanes, and fixed, publically  available schedules. In addition, TSA has reported that risks increase in  urban areas where multiple transportation systems and high volumes of  travelers merge at intermodal stations.", "Transportation systems, including passenger rail systems, rely on  technology and internet-connected devices to manage and secure certain  business/enterprise functions, such as the operation\u2019s website,  communications, and reservations and ticketing mechanisms. They also  increasingly rely on computer-networked systems for tracking, signals,  and operational controls of transportation equipment and services.

Most recently updated in  2013, the NIPP uses a risk management framework as a planning  methodology intended to inform how decision makers take actions to  manage risk. The framework calls for public and private partners to  conduct risk assessments. The NIPP defines risk as a function of three  elements: threat, vulnerability, and consequence, as shown in Figure 2.  Threat is an indication of the likelihood that a specific type of attack will be  initiated against a specific target or class of targets. Vulnerability is the  probability that a particular attempted attack will succeed against a  particular target or class of targets. Consequence is the effect of a  successful attack.", "In 2010, DHS, through TSA and the U.S. Coast Guard, developed the  Transportation Systems Sector-Specific Plan to conform to requirements  in the NIPP.

Specifically, the assessments  featured various scenarios that targeted intermodal stations, which could  include rail systems. For example, a scenario might describe attacks  using various numbers of improvised explosive devices on an intermodal  station. TSA did not include cybersecurity attack scenarios in the calendar  year 2015, 2016, or 2017 assessments. According to the 2016  assessment and TSA officials we interviewed, threat experts have  indicated that cyber threats, due to their unique nature and other factors,  do not lend themselves to traditional TSSRA attack scenarios. However,  as discussed below, the agency does conduct cyber threat assessments.  Further, TSA\u2019s Cybersecurity Roadmap 2018, states that, as one  objective, the agency will include cybersecurity in its risk assessments for  all modes. According to TSA officials, the implementation plan for the  Roadmap, which was approved in September 2019, provides guidance  and direction for meeting this objective. TSA officials confirmed that they  plan to include basic cybersecurity scenarios for all modes in the 2020  TSSRA, and that they plan to engage with TSA mass transit experts and  consult with industry experts as needed to inform future cyberattack  scenarios.", "BASE. The BASE is a voluntary security assessment of national mass  transit, passenger rail, and highway systems conducted by TSA surface  transportation inspectors that addresses potential vulnerabilities, among  other things. It consists of an assessment template with 17 security  action items developed by TSA and the Federal Transit Administration  that address, among other best practices, security training programs, risk  information sharing, and cybersecurity. TSA developed this assessment  in 2006 to increase domain awareness, enhance prevention and  protection capabilities, and further response preparedness of passenger  transit systems nationwide.

The update  included, among other changes, revised guidance for TSA surface  inspectors and the addition of questions concerning active shooter  events. In fiscal year 2016, the agency also developed a more targeted  BASE assessment that focuses the assessment on an entity\u2019s areas of  concern as identified by surface inspectors in a previous BASE review of  that operator. As of 2017, TSA had completed initial and follow-up  assessments for the top 100 mass transit agencies in the country, which  comprise approximately 80 percent of the ridership in the United States.  TSA officials told us that their goal is to conduct follow-up assessments  every one to three years.", "As previously shown in table 1, our analysis of the BASE template for  mass transit and passenger rail indicates that it includes questions that  address selected rail agency concerns about intermodal station security,  and questions related to cybersecurity issues. Specifically, we found that  while the template does not contain security action items or questions that  directly refer to intermodal stations, questions in the template do  correspond to topics that domestic rail agencies we interviewed identified  as significant to intermodal station security, such as coordination among  security forces, visible security measures, and establishing roles and  responsibilities. For example, one BASE question asks if the agency\u2019s  system security plan has procedures or protocols for responding to  security events with external agencies such as law enforcement or fire  departments. This question corresponds to the challenge of coordination  among security forces in intermodal stations identified by six of the seven  agencies we interviewed.", "Cybersecurity is the focus of one of the security action items, which  includes a series of general questions related to whether the transit  agency has developed a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy.  According to TSA officials, the agency added cybersecurity questions to  the BASE in 2013 and the questions are intended to be a high level  review. For example, the BASE addresses whether the transit agency has  conducted a cybersecurity risk assessment, ensured employee training  covers cybersecurity roles and threats, and established a protocol for  reporting cyber incidents. It also provides a list of available cybersecurity  resources for agencies to consult.", "Threat Assessments.

Additionally, the threat assessment  analyzes intelligence gaps for the mass transit mode. TSA  supplements the annual assessment with a semiannual threat  assessment that reviews terrorist threats against mass transit and  passenger rail for a 6-month period. Our analysis of threat  assessments TSA issued for calendar years 2015 through 2019  indicates that they addressed stations, in general, and intermodal  stations specifically, when they are the subject of an attack.

Information  about intermodal stations and cybersecurity can be identified and  exchanged through both of these mechanisms. For example,  representatives from the United Kingdom delivered a presentation on  securing intermodal stations at a 2016 working group meeting, and both working group and RAILPOL meetings have included cybersecurity  discussions.", "Figure 3 provides an image of St. Pancras International Station in  London, an intermodal station where international, local, and long  distance trains converge with the London Underground.", "Regarding bilateral engagement, TSA identifies foreign rail security  standards and practices through one-on-one relationships with other  countries. TSA officials noted that their level of engagement with other  countries can depend on a variety of factors, including how much the  countries have in common regarding transportation systems and threats,  and whether or not there are formal agreements in place that allow for  regular, detailed information sharing. While some relationships are  ongoing, officials stated that TSA interactions with other countries are  often situational or transactional\u2014countries may reach out either directly  to TSA or through the TSAR for information about a specific issue, such  as perimeter protection for surface transportation. For example:", "TSA holds biannual meetings with Transport Canada, the Canadian  government department responsible for transportation policies and  programs. Discussion topics from the meetings in 2017 and 2018  included Canadian efforts to develop passenger rail regulations,  results from TSA derailment device testing, and opportunities for  collaboration.", "According to TSA officials, TSARs in several countries have facilitated  engagement with foreign surface transportation officials, including  passenger rail officials. For example, officials stated that one TSAR  facilitated the use of TSA\u2019s Exercise Information System for an  exercise on the metro system in a foreign city, as well as joint rail  security training at TSA facilities in the United States. Officials further  noted that another TSAR has taken initiative to facilitate quarterly  meetings between foreign government and TSA surface  transportation officials, including research and development and  passenger rail officials.", "In addition to quarterly meetings facilitated by the TSAR, TSA officials  stated that they are in regular contact with research and development  officials in one country to share testing information, such as the  results of derailment device testing and explosives testing on railcars,  and to discuss security issues related to unmanned aircraft systems.", "TSA officials also reported that representatives attended an APTA- sponsored study trip to Brussels and London after the 2016 and 2017  rail attacks in those cities, in part, to observe lessons learned from the  attacks.", "Foreign governments and international rail associations also produce a  variety of passenger rail security standards and key practice documents.  Table 3 below provides examples of these documents and the types of  threats they address.", "TSA officials noted that while multilateral forums provide valuable  opportunities to communicate with other countries about evolving threats,  emerging security technologies, and potential key practices, interest in  forums such as the International Working Group on Land Transport  Security has been in decline. For example, while the working group  charter calls for annual meetings and quarterly conference calls, the full  group has not met since 2016. TSA and foreign government officials we  spoke with stated that interest in the working group may be in decline due  to factors such as retirements of key officials and lack of engagement  from certain countries. These officials also noted that, as leaders in rail  security, they typically provide more information about key practices to  other countries in large forums than they receive. Additionally, TSA  officials noted that other countries frequently used the working group- developed SMARTbox initially, but that use declined in recent years in  part due to its location on the Homeland Security Information Network  because users may find it difficult to navigate. Further, eight of the 10  domestic and foreign rail agencies we interviewed said they were either  unfamiliar with the application or did not use it. For example, officials  from one domestic agency said that there was little incentive to contribute  and that they found informal networks to be more useful for sharing  information. In contrast, TSA and other officials we spoke to stated that  bilateral relationships with trusted partners with similar sophisticated rail  operations may allow for more detailed exchanges of current and  emerging key security practices."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "TSA Provides Limited Guidance to TSARs on Engaging with Foreign Rail Stakeholders", "paragraphs": ["TSA has provided limited guidance to TSARs on engagement with foreign  passenger rail stakeholders through the TSAR Toolkit (or handbook),  which states that TSARs should engage with officials involved in multiple  modes of transit, including rail; however, the primary focus of the  document is engagement with aviation stakeholders. TSA further provides  comprehensive and specific guidance for TSAR aviation engagement as  part of its foreign airport assessments and air carrier inspections, but  does not do so for surface transportation. As discussed above,  according to TSA officials, some TSARs have taken the initiative to  facilitate meetings and share testing and training information related to  surface transportation, including passenger rail. Passenger rail officials  we talked to in one country stated that these TSAR-led initiatives served  as a valuable source of information and communication with TSA. In  addition, one TSA official cited the value of discussing preliminary testing  findings, as well as new guidelines on topics such as security in station  designs, which address concerns about security in public spaces. These  efforts, however, are dependent on the individual initiative of each TSAR  and are not universal. For example, one TSAR we interviewed stated that  TSA\u2019s expectations and priorities for surface transportation engagement  were unclear and, as a result, he focused almost exclusively on aviation.", "TSA officials stated that they have focused TSAR guidance on aviation  engagement because of the agency\u2019s regulatory role in this area, which,  as discussed above, includes foreign airport assessments and air carrier  inspections. In lieu of detailed guidance on surface transportation, officials  noted they defer to the individual TSARs on how or whether to engage  foreign surface transportation stakeholders. Officials emphasized this  individual approach and stated that in some countries, TSAR engagement  on passenger rail security issues may be limited by legal or cultural  barriers. Because rail (unlike aviation) does not directly connect to the  United States in most cases, officials noted that there may be less  incentive for some host countries to engage. Further, some countries may  not have a rail system, or may not be as advanced in rail security policies  and procedures, and therefore may be less able to offer key practices.", "In November 2019, TSA officials noted that they were considering adding  guidance for engaging with surface transportation officials and addressing  intermodal concerns to TSAR Regional Operational Implementation  Plans. According to officials, these plans provide targeted guidance to  TSARs for engagement within their specific regions. As of February 2020,  officials stated that draft plans for two regions (Western Hemisphere and  Africa/Middle East) were under review at TSA. Officials further stated  that these drafts, and drafts for the remaining regions currently in  development, would include surface transportation-related guidance. TSA  officials stated that they hoped to complete all regions\u2019 plans by the end  of calendar year 2020, but they did not provide documentation for us to  verify that the final plans would contain surface transportation guidance  for TSARs.", "The 2018 TSA Administrator\u2019s Intent document includes a goal to  promote security partnerships across surface transportation systems by,  in part, identifying and communicating best practices and lessons learned  to stakeholders and international partners. In addition, the NIPP states  that officials should share actionable and relevant information across the  critical infrastructure community to build awareness and enable risk  informed decision making. The TSAR Toolkit further states that, even in  locations without modal connections to the United States, there is still  great value in establishing key points of contact who can share best  practices or facilitate the exchange of information in the event of an  emergency in modes of transit outside of aviation. As the primary  overseas point of contact for security matters involving all modes of  transportation, TSARs are responsible for developing bilateral  relationships and facilitating information sharing with foreign stakeholders,  among other things.", "Further leveraging formal or informal bilateral relationships could allow  TSA to obtain additional passenger rail security information. While several  TSARs have individually taken initiative with regard to rail, without  additional guidance from TSA, there is no assurance that they will engage  in these exchanges with modes outside of aviation. As a result, TSA is  less likely to be fully aware of key passenger rail security practices in  other countries, such as those listed in table 3 above, among others.  Moreover, specific guidance will also provide TSARs with clear  expectations for engaging with stakeholders, and provide TSA with  greater assurance that they are engaging in a consistent manner. TSA\u2019s  new Regional Operational Implementation Plans provide an opportunity  for TSA to more clearly incorporate targeted guidance to encourage  TSAR outreach and information sharing in specific areas.

According to TSA officials, the APTA standards and recommended  practices, which evolve based on threats and lessons learned, form  the basis for the BASE assessment template. One way in which TSA  helps communicates these standards and practices to agencies is  through the questions in the template. Officials noted that lessons  learned from foreign rail security incidents have been used to further  support certain security concepts in the BASE, such as assessment  questions related to whether agencies engage in public outreach for  security awareness (e.g. \u201cIf You See Something, Say Something\u201d)  and report suspicious activity.", "TSA officials reported that they consider overseas and domestic  attack methods and tactics when planning Intermodal Security  Training and Exercise Program exercises to raise awareness of  emerging tactics and threats. These exercises are intended to share  best practices and lessons learned, among other things. Officials  noted that they recently incorporated cyber, chemical, and vehicle- ramming attacks into the program\u2019s objectives based on recent  domestic and overseas incidents, and that they shared resources,  information, and best practices for security solutions. For example,  officials reported conducting two regional exercises that focused on  chemical threat elements as the result of a 2017 plot in Australia.", "TSA further reported hosting a series of vehicle ramming program  workshops in the wake of attacks in New York City and Europe.", "According to TSA officials, TSA has not made any recent changes to  the Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response program directly as a  result of lessons learned or key practices resulting from a foreign rail  security incident; however, officials said they regularly integrate  information about foreign incidents and threats when planning  program deployments. Officials also noted that the majority of current  deployments are for surface transportation, which includes rail.", "Regarding cybersecurity, TSA has shared information about cybersecurity  key practices, including the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, through a  series of regional cybersecurity Intermodal Security Training and Exercise  Program workshops since 2017. These \u201c5N5\u201d workshops listed five  nontechnical cybersecurity actions an agency could take in 5 days,  including: (1) develop familiarity with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework;  (2) implement a unique password change policy; (3) understand the latest  phishing and spam trends and how to message awareness; (4)  differentiate access control among staff; and (5) report cybersecurity  incidents.", "Six of the seven domestic rail agencies we spoke with were generally  satisfied with TSA\u2019s efforts to share security and key practice  information; however officials from two of these six agencies also  expressed concerns about timeliness and quality of cybersecurity  information provided by TSA. For example, officials from one agency  stated that they received limited cybersecurity information from TSA and  that the information they did receive was of limited use because it was  targeted at agencies without a sophisticated cybersecurity program. An  official from another agency noted that while there were opportunities to  discuss cybersecurity, the information provided was often general in  nature and there was limited time for discussion in certain mechanisms  because of the large number of people involved. This official also noted  that while the information TSA provides is valuable and there are  mechanisms available to share information about a range topics,  discussions are typically related to security incidents and threats, as  opposed to key practices.", "TSA officials acknowledged that the agency\u2019s cybersecurity efforts were  still in the early stages. They further noted that the implementation plan  for the 2018 Cybersecurity Roadmap, which, among things, calls for  improving information sharing and partnering with stakeholders to  promote the adoption of best practices and industry and/or international  standards, was only recently signed in September 2019.", "In addition to TSA\u2019s information sharing mechanisms, domestic rail  agency officials we spoke to reported learning about foreign key practices  through personal experience and direct engagement with foreign rail  counterparts. For example, officials from two agencies we spoke to  hosted visits from foreign rail officials to study security measures, among  other things. Officials from one agency noted they provided information to  Hong Kong through APTA on key practices for managing large protest  crowds in an urban transit environment. Officials from another agency  noted that they participate in international information sharing surveys  and research to learn about cybersecurity practices by foreign rail  operators, and sent representatives to an international mass transit  training forum on the development of threat, vulnerability, and risk  assessments.", "Domestic rail agencies also identified several changes they have made to  their physical security systems as a result of key practices or lessons  learned from foreign rail incidents. For example: increasing random  patrols and high visibility deployments of security officers, changing  security camera placement to better capture station exits, and increasing  security awareness messaging to employees and passengers.  Additionally, officials from one agency noted that they revised subway  evacuation plans to direct people towards areas less vulnerable to an  attack after reviewing lessons learned from recent vehicle-based attacks  in Europe. With regard to cybersecurity, one domestic agency we spoke  to noted that recent wide-spread global cyberattacks reinforced  challenges they have securing legacy Information Technology systems  against threats such as ransomware threats. As a result, the agency is  focused on identifying expiring technologies and replacing those that can  no longer be patched or updated.
