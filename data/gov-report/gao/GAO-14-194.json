Many shortages are of generic sterile injectable drugs. Provider association representatives reported that drug shortages may force providers to ration care or rely on less effective drugs.", "The immediate cause of drug shortages can generally be traced to a manufacturer halting or slowing production to address quality problems, triggering a supply disruption. Other manufacturers have a limited ability to respond to supply disruptions due to constrained manufacturing capacity. GAO's analysis of data from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also showed that quality problems were a frequent cause. GAO also identified potential underlying causes specific to the economics of the generic sterile injectable drug market, such as that low profit margins have limited infrastructure investments or led some manufacturers to exit the market.", "While shortages have persisted, FDA has prevented more potential shortages in the last 2 years by improving its responsiveness. Among other things, FDA implemented Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) requirements and recommendations GAO made in 2011. FDA has also initiated other steps to improve its response to shortages, such as developing procedures to enhance coordination between headquarters and field staff. However, there are shortcomings in its management of drug shortage data that are inconsistent with internal control standards. For example, FDA has not created policies or procedures governing the management of the data and does not perform routine quality checks on its data. Such shortcomings could ultimately hinder FDA's efforts to understand the causes of specific shortages as well as undermine its efforts to prevent them from occurring. In addition, FDA has not conducted routine analyses of the data to proactively identify and evaluate the risks of drug shortages."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["FDA should strengthen its internal controls over its drug shortage data and conduct periodic analyses to routinely and systematically assess drug shortage information, using this information to proactively identify drug shortage risk factors.

UUDIS broadly defines a shortage as a supply issue that  affects how pharmacies prepare and dispense a product or that influences patient care  when prescribers must choose an alternative therapy because of supply issues. Once  UUDIS identifies a shortage, it generally does not consider a shortage to be resolved until  the drug is available again in all strengths and package sizes from all manufacturers that  currently produce the drug. For example, UUDIS could be notified of a shortage involving  three manufacturers: Manufacturer A has no product available; Manufacturers B and C  still do, but have limited supply of certain package sizes. According to a UUDIS official,  UUDIS would consider the shortage to be resolved (1) when Manufacturers A, B, and C all  have all strengths and package sizes back in stock; (2) if Manufacturer A decides to  discontinue its product, when Manufacturers B and Manufacturer C both have all strengths  and package sizes back in stock; or (3) when UUDIS obtains other information indicating  that a shortage has been resolved, such as FDA telling UUDIS that Manufacturers B and  C have increased supply and all market need has been met. identified as critical because alternative medications were unavailable,  the shortages affected multiple manufacturers, or it received multiple  reports from different institutions.

During a  shortage, providers may have to cancel or delay procedures, which can  have detrimental health effects on patients. Providers may also have to  ration care by prioritizing the patients who have a greater need for the  drug. For example, provider association representatives said that if a drug  is used in patients across age groups, but is essential for the care of  newborns, a hospital may institute a policy that the drug can only be  administered to newborns and will no longer be administered to adults.", "In addition, representatives from the provider associations noted that  identifying effective, alternative drugs for those in shortage can be  difficult. In some cases, it may not be possible to find a suitable  alternative. For example, representatives from one of the associations we  spoke to said that emergency service providers have reported significant  difficulties finding alternative medications for stopping seizures and are  concerned with the viability of alternative therapies in certain emergency  situations. A representative from another association said that when  effective alternatives are identified and located, medication errors may  increase because the dosage of the alternative drug may differ from what  providers are accustomed to using.", "Drug shortages may result in higher drug costs as well as greater risks to  patients. To obtain drugs in short supply, providers may turn to suppliers  they do not typically use, including authorized alternative suppliers,  compounding pharmacies, or gray market suppliers\u2014those not  authorized by the manufacturer to sell the drug\u2014who typically obtain  small quantities of a drug that is in short supply and offer it for purchase  at an inflated price. Drugs from alternative suppliers can cost  significantly more, and, in the case of compounding pharmacies, and gray  market suppliers, may pose risks to patients. An outbreak of fungal  meningitis in 2012 linked to contaminated compounded drugs\u2014resulting  in over 60 deaths and hundreds of people becoming ill\u2014has led to  questions about the safety and quality of compounded drugs. Because  the origin of a gray market drug may be unknown, there is no assurance  that it was stored and transported appropriately. As a result, patients who  receive treatment with such drugs may experience adverse events or  receive inadequate or inappropriate treatment. (See app. III for a  description of steps federal agencies have taken to respond to gray  market activities.)", "Managing drug shortages also can detract from patient care. Providers  may develop and institute polices for distributing drugs in short supply to  patients, which some provider association representatives said may take  time away from caring for patients. They may also need to become  familiar with new products and different dosages, which may increase the  risk for medication errors and take time away from patient care.  Representatives from one provider association said that hospital  pharmacists might need to devote more time than usual to work with the  physician prescribing a drug that is in shortage to determine an  appropriate therapeutic alternative. In some instances, providers have  hired full-time staff whose positions are entirely devoted to managing drug  shortages. One provider association representative said a well-known  hospital system has eight full-time employees who only work on  addressing drug shortages. However, a few representatives noted that  smaller providers may not have the resources to hire full-time employees  and existing staff may have to take on additional responsibilities in order  to respond to shortages.", "Finally, the mere threat of a potential shortage can cause problems for  patients and providers. While some provider association representatives  reported that the lack of advance notice of a shortage hinders their ability  to respond, most of the provider organizations we spoke with expressed  concern that reports of an impending shortage can lead to the hoarding or  stockpiling of drugs making it more difficult to access the drugs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Quality Problems Coupled with Constrained Manufacturing Capacity Are Often the Immediate Causes of Drug Shortages, but There Are Potential Underlying Causes", "paragraphs": ["Quality problems resulting in supply disruptions coupled with constrained  manufacturing capacity were frequently cited as the immediate causes of  recent drug shortages.

These supply disruptions were  linked to, among other things, such problems as bacterial contamination  or the presence of glass or metal particles in drug vials. Representatives  from all eight manufacturers that we interviewed said that quality  problems have contributed to recent shortages. Our analysis of FDA  data shows that 40 percent of the shortages reported between January 1,  2011, and June 30, 2013, resulted from quality concerns, such as  particulate matter or plant maintenance issues.", "In addition, most of the  studies we reviewed (16 of 20) reported that concerns about product  quality that led to supply disruptions have been the immediate cause of  most shortages. For example, one analysis found that quality problems  were the cause linked to the majority of shortages of sterile injectable  drugs. Another study found that the immediate cause of 46 percent of all  drug shortages in 2011 was a quality problem. According to this study,  the specific issues contributing to recent shortages have ranged from an  inability to ensure the sterility of products to the identification of particulate  matter in products.", "According to another study, some of the largest manufacturers of sterile  injectable drugs have had quality problems that they chose to address by  temporarily closing or renovating their establishments, thereby reducing  or temporarily ceasing manufacturing of multiple drugs and leading to  supply disruptions. Some of the temporary plant closures were  proactively undertaken by the manufacturers themselves, while others  were undertaken as part of their response to a warning letter from FDA.  Such plant closures to address quality problems with certain drugs or  production lines can result in shortages of other drugs manufactured at  these establishments, including those not associated with quality  problems. One study noted that many shortages that are classified as  being caused by delays and capacity issues are technically caused by  supply disruptions related to quality. Our analysis of FDA data indicates  that manufacturing delays or capacity issues accounted for 30 percent of  the shortages reported between January 1, 2011, and June 30, 2013.  FDA officials told us that delays or capacity issues that triggered  shortages typically involved temporary shutdowns or slowdowns  undertaken to perform maintenance or, in many recent cases, for  remediation efforts, which then caused supply disruptions.", "Although quality problems were a frequently cited issue, there was not  complete agreement as to whether quality problems were truly the trigger  for the supply disruptions that cause shortages. Specifically, one study  concluded that FDA has applied CGMPs more rigorously in its  inspections of manufacturing establishments, resulting in a greater  number of quality problems being identified and thus leading to  manufacturing supply disruptions that then triggered shortages. Another study suggested that an increase in FDA inspections of injectable drug  manufacturing establishments without evidence of an increase in quality  problems has contributed to shortages of generic sterile injectable  drugs. In addition, one manufacturer representative noted that FDA  investigators throughout the country may differ in their interpretations of  CGMPs, which the representative said creates uncertainty about whether  a manufacturer\u2019s current processes will be found to be in compliance  during an FDA inspection. Therefore, from this manufacturer\u2019s  perspective, FDA\u2019s compliance actions have been the primary cause of  shortages with quality problems being a secondary cause. A second  manufacturer representative said that though quality problems have  contributed to recent shortages, from the manufacturer\u2019s perspective,  quality standards have also been raised. However, one study countered  the claim that FDA\u2019s enforcement has changed by stating that  manufacturers often identify quality problems and it is their discoveries  that trigger FDA inspections in the first place, rather than an increase in  agency scrutiny. This study also noted that CGMPs, which provide a  framework for a manufacturer to produce safe, pure, and high-quality  drugs, have not changed in recent years. One manufacturer  representative concurred that the CGMPs themselves had not changed.  However, this representative noted that as manufacturing technology  advances, the expectations of FDA investigators as to what represents  quality manufacturing may advance as well. For example, as new  manufacturing equipment becomes available, FDA investigators may  expect manufacturers to install the new equipment, even if using older  equipment will result in drugs of the same quality."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Immediate Causes of Shortages", "paragraphs": ["Although not as prominently cited in the literature or the FDA data as  quality problems, we identified a number of additional factors that can  cause supply disruptions and ultimately result in shortages.", "Permanent product discontinuations: Permanent product  discontinuations were another immediate cause of shortages. Our  analysis of FDA data shows that 12 percent of the shortages reported  between January 1, 2011, and June 30, 2013, resulted from product  discontinuations. According to several studies, the generic drug market is  extremely concentrated, with few manufacturers producing each drug. For  example, one study found that most generic sterile injectable drugs are  made by three or fewer manufacturers. As a result, the discontinuation  of a drug by a single manufacturer can have a significant impact on drug  availability. Two studies noted that older generic drugs may be  discontinued in favor of producing newer drugs that are more profitable or   Three manufacturer representatives said that  that have more demand.they take a number of factors into account when determining whether to  discontinue manufacturing a drug. The first manufacturer representative  said that in addition to price, they will also account for factors such as the  medical necessity and importance of the drug when making decisions  about what drugs to manufacture. The second manufacturer  representative said that they do not discontinue products if they know that  doing so would cause a shortage or exacerbate an existing one, although  the same representative also said that products with low sales or  profitability may be de-emphasized in favor of producing drugs with  greater demand. The third manufacturer representative also noted that it  is likely that a lower-margin product would be discontinued rather than a  higher-margin product. Two manufacturer representatives said that if a  drug is already in shortage, they will try to continue to manufacture it,  even at low or negative profit margins, to ensure that the drug remains in  the market.", "Unavailability of raw materials or components: The unavailability of  raw materials, such as an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), and  non-API components, such as vials, also contributes to shortages.", "The  majority of the studies we reviewed cited the unavailability of raw  materials or non-API components as a cause of shortages and two  reported that there is often only one API source for a given drug. This  dependency on a sole API source can lead to shortages if availability  becomes a problem, regardless of the number of manufacturers of a  particular product. Most of the manufacturers\u2019 representatives agreed  that the unavailability of API has caused some shortages, although some  representatives said that it was a relatively small percentage of them. For  example, a representative from one manufacturer said that the 2011  tsunami in Japan disrupted the API supply for one of its products and led  to a shortage. Although the manufacturer ultimately identified another  source for the needed material, FDA had to approve the manufacturer\u2019s  new source, which was time-consuming. In addition, two manufacturer  representatives mentioned that issues with non-API components had  contributed to shortages. Our analysis of FDA data shows that 9 percent  of the shortages reported between January 1, 2011, and June 30, 2013,  resulted from the unavailability of APIs or non-API components.", "Loss of a manufacturing site or site change: Our analysis of FDA data  shows that 3 percent of the shortages reported between January 1, 2011,  and June 30, 2013, were due to either the loss of a manufacturing site or  site change. One manufacturer representative said that while  manufacturers have experienced disruptions due to natural disasters, this  has been rare. In the literature, half of the studies (10 of 20) mentioned  natural disasters, such as floods or hurricanes, as a cause of shortages.  Loss of, or damage to, a manufacturing site was typically given as an  example of the supply disruption resulting from the disaster.", "Increased demand: In addition to events that result in changes in supply,  we found that shortages can also be triggered by changes in demand.  Our analysis of FDA data shows that 6 percent of the shortages reported  between January 1, 2011, and June 30, 2013, were due to increased  demand. An increase in demand, which may occur for a variety of  reasons, such as the approval of an already marketed drug for a new  indication or new therapeutic guidelines, can trigger a shortage. A  shortage results because manufacturers cannot keep up with the  increase in demand that exceeds their expectations or planned  production. Increased demand was cited as a cause of shortages in 9 of  the 20 studies we reviewed.", "Figure 6 summarizes information reported by manufacturers to FDA  about the causes of drug shortages that the agency then analyzes and  categorizes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Constrained Manufacturing Capacity Often Viewed as Limiting Manufacturers\u2019 Ability to Respond to Supply Disruptions", "paragraphs": ["The inability of other manufacturers to make up for supply disruptions  experienced by their competitors due to constrained manufacturing  capacity was another immediate cause of shortages. Several of the  studies we reviewed generally concluded that the heavy concentration of  the generic drug industry leaves few manufacturers available to respond  to supply disruptions, leading to market-wide shortages. One study  found that seven manufacturers dominate the generic sterile injectable  market overall and also found that this market is even further  concentrated for specific therapeutic classes. Specifically, this analysis  indicated that in 2008, three manufacturers produced 71 percent of all  generic sterile injectable oncology drugs and that three manufacturers  held 91 percent of the market share of generic sterile injectable nutrients  and supplements. Illustrating the interplay between supply disruptions  and constrained manufacturing capacity, one 2010 study reported that a  shortage of the generic sterile injectable anesthesia drug propofol  resulted after one of the three manufacturers of the drug permanently  discontinued its manufacturing and another experienced quality problems  leading to a temporary halt in production, leaving the remaining  manufacturer unable to meet the demand of the entire market.", "In addition to consisting of few manufacturers overall, we also found that  the manufacturing capacity of the generic drug industry has been further  challenged in recent years as the industry has expanded the number of  generic products it manufactures. This expansion has resulted as a large  number of brand-name drugs have lost patent protection, clearing the  way for generic manufacturers to produce generic equivalents of these  drugs. Two of the studies we examined cited the decisions of  manufacturers to begin producing the generic equivalents of brand-name  drugs as contributing to shortages by stretching already limited capacity.  For example, one study found that the generic sterile injectable market  had expanded by 52 percent between 2006 and 2010 without a  commensurate increase in manufacturing capacity, leading to high  utilization of available manufacturing capacity.manufacturers said that faced with limited capacity, when new generics  are available for production a manufacturer may make the decision to  stop producing some drugs to make room for the new products. As a  result, such discontinuations could lead to shortages, but representatives  from both manufacturers characterized this as a small factor in causing  shortages.", "In addition to the challenge presented by having few manufacturers and  the increase in the number of generic drugs, pressures to produce this  large number of drugs on only a few manufacturing lines leaves the  manufacturers that do participate in the generic sterile injectable market   Since multiple drugs are often manufactured on the  with little flexibility. same line, increasing production of one drug reduces the supply of other  drugs and can lead to shortages. For example, one manufacturer  representative said that there are usually anywhere from 30 to 50  different drugs manufactured on a given line. Further, according to one  study, manufacturers of generic sterile injectable drugs do not typically  have redundant manufacturing facilities.almost 900 generic sterile injectable applications that were submitted to  the FDA and approved between 2000 and 2011, the authors found that  only 11 applications (about 1 percent) referenced a backup facility. This  becomes problematic when production in a given facility must stop for any  reason as manufacturers cannot immediately move production of a drug  to another facility. To do so, they must first obtain approval from FDA,  which can further delay production.", "Specifically, in a review of  A related constraint cited in the literature is that some generic sterile  injectable drugs need to be manufactured on lines or in facilities  dedicated solely to those drugs. One study noted that certain sterile  injectable products, such as anti-infective and oncology drugs, require  lines, and sometimes whole facilities, which are limited to the production  of such drugs. For example, some anti-infective drugs, such as  penicillin, are highly sensitizing and can trigger serious allergic reactions  at very low levels and as a result, may be limited to specific  manufacturing lines. Further, another study noted that a supply disruption  on a dedicated line can result in shortages of multiple products of a  similar type, such as oncology drugs, because other manufacturers are  not able to step in due to limited capacity on their own lines.example, shortages of oncology drugs in 2011 were linked to just three  dedicated oncology lines that were operated by two manufacturers.", "A final capacity-related constraint cited in the literature (9 of 20 studies),  was how the widespread use of \u201cjust-in-time\u201d inventory practices can  increase the vulnerability of the supply chain to shortages. One of these  studies said that most manufacturers only produce enough of a drug to  satisfy current demand, so there is little, if any excess inventory, while  another study asserts that when a manufacturer has to stop production, a  supply disruption can result because of \u201cjust-in-time\u201d inventory. One  manufacturer representative said that any manufacturer typically has only  a limited amount of inventory available. This representative said that  manufacturers typically have about 2 to 3 months of inventory on hand,  wholesale distributors usually have about 1 month, and providers only  have a few weeks of inventory. Consequently, if an issue arises, a  shortage can quickly result.", "The majority of manufacturer representatives we interviewed generally  concurred with our finding from the literature that a supply disruption, for  whatever reason, affecting one manufacturer can quickly lead to market- wide shortages because other manufacturers often cannot increase  production enough to meet demand. For example, one manufacturer  representative said that it had recently encountered capacity constraints  when two other manufacturers experienced supply disruptions and one  manufacturer exited the market. The representative from the  manufacturer that remained said that the company did not have the  capacity to ramp up production to meet the demand for all of the drugs at  risk of shortage and thus had to prioritize which drugs to produce, based  on market need and the severity of the shortages. Further complicating a  situation like this, representatives of two manufacturers said that even if  the remaining companies are able to increase their production of a drug  whose supply has been disrupted, it can take time\u2014as much as   3 months\u2014to increase production, particularly for sterile injectables due  to the complexity of manufacturing these products."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Drug Shortages May Stem From Underlying Causes", "paragraphs": ["We identified multiple potential underlying causes of drug shortages in the  literature.

Two of the studies suggested that low profit  margins in the generic market may affect manufacturers\u2019 decisions to  invest in their facilities.expect all generic drugs to be of equivalent quality and may be unable to   Another of the six studies said that purchasers  discern differences in the quality of drugs, particularly sterile injectables.  As a consequence, purchasers of sterile injectables focus on price when  choosing among seemingly identical generic manufacturers at the  expense of any potential differences in quality and the ability to reliably  meet customer demand. According to this study, a manufacturer that  strives to exceed minimum manufacturing standards is not rewarded with  a willingness among buyers to pay more for the manufacturer\u2019s products.  Therefore, using economic theory as a rationale, the authors suggested  that this reduces the incentive for the manufacturer to sufficiently invest in  maintenance or quality improvements at its manufacturing  establishments. The study suggests that the lack of reward for quality is  an underlying cause that may have led to manufacturers\u2019 minimizing  investment in establishments, which has ultimately resulted in many of  the recent quality problems at generic sterile injectable manufacturing  establishments.", "Five of the six drug manufacturer representatives that responded to this  claim reported that manufacturers continue to invest in upgrading existing  establishments and building new ones.

For example, one of the four  studies asserted that GPOs reduce profits in the generic drug market,  where margins are already low. This study states that because of these  low manufacturer profit margins, when production problems arise,  manufacturers may stop producing certain products in lieu of making  investments in improvements at their establishments. Another of the  four studies theorized that when generic drug manufacturers fail to win  GPO contracts, manufacturers will either exit or decide not to enter the  market for those drugs, contributing to the immediate cause of  constrained manufacturing capacity.", "All of the representatives of the three GPOs that we contacted disagreed  with the claim that GPOs are a cause of shortages. They emphasized that  they have an incentive to avoid drug shortages and ensure that the drug  manufacturers with which GPOs contact can meet GPOs\u2019 members\u2019  needs. Further, they said that while price is an important consideration in  determining the manufacturers with whom they contract, the ability of  manufacturers to ensure an adequate supply of products is critical.  According to one GPO representative, generic drug manufacturers are  generally profitable, which the GPO representative said demonstrates  that manufacturers are not being driven out of the market.

While the second representative  said that GPOs contribute to the pressure to lower prices, the  representative also noted that every participant in the supply chain  contributes to the price competition. A third manufacturer representative  noted that, because manufacturers have already made investments in  production that they are unwilling to abandon, failing to obtain a GPO  contract does not cause them to exit the market for a given drug. Further,  representatives from the second and third manufacturers also told us that,  in the event that a major manufacturer does not obtain a GPO contract,  the manufacturer may send its sales force to hospitals directly and offer a  price that is lower than the GPO contract price.

Based on our analysis of FDA data from January 2011 through  June 2013, FDA was able to prevent 89 potential shortages in 2011, 154  potential shortages in 2012, and 50 potential shortages through June  2013. This is more than the 35 potential shortages we found that FDA  prevented in 2010 and the 50 prevented through June 2011. FDA officials  told us that although they relied on many of the same steps to prevent  and resolve shortages prior to the enactment of FDASIA, FDASIA\u2019s  requirement that manufacturers notify FDA in advance of a potential  shortage allowed FDA to employ those steps sooner. FDA officials said  the notification requirement has helped the agency become more  proactive and successful in its efforts. FDA officials noted there has been  a sizeable increase in notifications with a six-fold increase after issuance  of the drug shortages Executive Order in October 2011, a subsequent  doubling of that rate after the enactment of FDASIA in July 2012, and a  return to the Post-Executive Order notification rate in 2013.", "FDA has expedited a number of agency actions to prevent or resolve  shortages, in accordance with relevant FDASIA provisions. For example,  FDA may expedite the review of ANDAs, or supplements to NDAs and  ANDAs, to help bring an alternative drug to market or authorize an  additional API supplier or manufacturing site. FDA officials said the  agency has also expedited inspections to facilitate improvements at  manufacturing establishments. Expediting inspections that are required  before an ANDA or supplement is approved also facilitates the availability  of a needed drug. Manufacturer representatives we spoke with noted that  in some cases expedited reviews or inspections have happened quickly  and have helped prevent shortages. However, others told us that some  application reviews or inspections have taken a long time, limiting the  manufacturers\u2019 ability to help prevent or resolve a shortage. For example,  one manufacturer representative said waiting for FDA\u2019s approval of ANDA  supplements related to new raw material suppliers has been a key  hindrance to the manufacturer\u2019s ability to respond to drug shortages.", "In addition, FDA routinely contacts manufacturers regarding their ability to  increase production in response to a potential or actual drug shortage.  Although a number of manufacturer representatives said that ramping up  production takes time and may not always be possible, given production  capacity constraints, FDA has reported some successes. For example,  when FDA determined that an impending product discontinuation might  result in a shortage of a drug that treats shingles and chickenpox, it  encouraged another manufacturer to increase production, thus avoiding a  shortage. Similarly, when quality problems were identified in a drug used  to treat eye infections in patients with acquired immune deficiency  syndrome, FDA reached out to another manufacturer that was able to  increase production to avert a potential shortage. Manufacturer  representatives said manufacturers will generally increase production, if  possible, when FDA advises them of a shortage. FDA reported to us that,  from January 1, 2011, to June 30, 2013, its encouragement to  manufacturers to increase production helped prevent or resolve 41  shortages.", "FDA officials said that in appropriate cases, the agency may attempt to  use its regulatory discretion to keep products from going into short supply  or from making an active shortage worse. FDA may use its discretion in  deciding whether to take a certain action. FDASIA requires FDA to  consider whether an enforcement action or issuance of a warning letter could reasonably cause or exacerbate a shortage of a life-saving drug.If FDA reaches such a determination, the agency must evaluate the risks  associated with the impact of such a shortage upon patients and the risks  associated with the violation before taking action, unless there is an  imminent risk of serious health consequences or death. FDA officials said  that they had used their regulatory discretion prior to the enactment of  FDASIA and were continuing to do so, through communication across  various FDA offices and with manufacturers. Officials noted that they try  to balance the risk to patients when making their decisions. That is, they  consider the risk of allowing the continued distribution of the product\u2014 despite the problems related to the possible enforcement action or  warning letter\u2014against the public health risks of the product not being  available. FDA officials said they also continue to use their regulatory  discretion to temporarily allow the importation of \u201cunapproved drugs\u201d into  the United States to help prevent or resolve shortages of FDA-approved  drugs that are critical to patients, in rare cases where the shortages  cannot be resolved by manufacturers willing and able to supply the FDA- approved drugs in the immediate future. We previously reported that  FDA had allowed for the importation of seven unapproved drugs from  January 2011 through September 2011. FDA officials told us that, through  June 30, 2013, they have subsequently allowed for the importation of nine  additional unapproved drugs. For example, when the manufacturer of a  drug used to treat patients who require total parenteral nutrition lost the  use of a manufacturing site, FDA allowed importation of a comparable  version of the drug not approved by FDA to prevent a potential shortage  from occurring.", "Several stakeholders commented that FDA\u2019s efforts to allow the  importation of unapproved drugs to address a shortage have improved,  which has helped to resolve some critical shortages. However, some  stakeholders noted that certain shortages could not be resolved quickly  because it took a long time for FDA to respond to providers\u2019 requests to  allow importation. For example, some stakeholders noted that delays in  the importation of total parenteral nutrition products created significant  challenges for treating patients who depend upon them. To help speed up  the process of temporary importation, FDA officials said that since  January 2012 they have proactively identified foreign manufacturers that  have expressed a willingness to import their drugs to help with a  shortage. Officials said this has allowed them to reach out to companies  more quickly and has already helped the agency address one shortage.", "FDA has also reported using its regulatory discretion in other ways. For  example, the manufacturer of a drug that may slow the progress of the  human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency  syndrome lost its component supplier and was forced to find a new one.  However, this new supplier was experiencing a quality problem. FDA  used its regulatory discretion to allow the manufacturer to use the new  component supplier while quality problems were being addressed after it  determined those issues posed no significant risks to public health. In  another instance, FDA used its regulatory discretion to allow the  continued marketing of a drug, despite a manufacturing deviation, after  determining the benefits of having the drug available outweighed the risk  associated with the manufacturing error."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA Is Working to Further Improve Its Response to Drug Shortages", "paragraphs": ["FDA is taking steps to further enhance its ability to respond to shortages.  Some of the agency\u2019s actions are required by FDASIA, some are in  response to recommendations we made in 2011, and others were  initiated by the agency.

FDA officials said the  Drug Shortages Task Force has helped FDA revise internal policies and  procedures, track the development of the proposed regulations for  implementing the manufacturer notification requirements, and generally  coordinate across the agency on issues related to drug shortages.", "As required by FDASIA, FDA officials also noted that they have continued to work with  DEA on shortages related to controlled substances. describes how providers and others can report a potential drug shortage.

FDA  officials told us that, upon receiving notification of a potential drug  shortage, the agency works to verify whether a shortage exists through  contacting the drug\u2019s manufacturer to determine supply levels and  comparing that to industry sales data on historical demand for the  product. Once FDA determines that the amount of the drug\u2014or  pharmaceutical equivalents\u2014appears to be insufficient to meet demand,  the agency posts information about the shortage on its drug shortages  website. Though FDA takes steps to respond to all shortages about which  the agency is informed, officials said the agency places the highest  priority on responding to shortages of drugs that it considers medically  necessary. Nevertheless, officials said that FDA\u2019s website includes all  verified shortages, regardless of whether the drug is determined to be  medically necessary. However, FDA officials noted that the agency  may not be notified of all potential shortages, because FDASIA only  requires manufacturers to report disruptions in the production of drugs  that are life supporting, life sustaining, or used to treat debilitating health  issues. Though health care professionals can also notify FDA about  potential shortages, FDA officials told us that the agency is less likely to  be notified about shortages of drugs for which there are easy substitutes  or little patient impact.", "In July 2012, as required by FDASIA, FDA began classifying the reasons  for shortages using standardized terminology specified in the law and  posting this information on its website along with information on estimated  shortage duration. Also, though not required by FDASIA, in July 2013  FDA added information on the therapeutic categories of drugs in shortage  to its drug shortages website. This change allows users, for example, to  view all oncology shortages in one place, rather than having to review the  entire list of drugs in shortage and identify individual drugs used in  oncology themselves. FDA plans to improve the functionality of the  website further by allowing users to sort shortages by other types of  information as well. A number of stakeholders noted that the  improvements to FDA\u2019s drug shortage website help them keep informed  about drug shortages. However, some expressed disappointment with the  passive nature of the website as stakeholders must proactively visit the  website as opposed to receiving automated alerts. A number of  stakeholders noted that notifications of shortages by therapeutic class  would be particularly helpful for communicating the potential for a  shortage to targeted groups earlier. FDA officials said that they plan to  add active alerts by therapeutic category to the website.", "Although FDA continues to refine the information on its website, it is  nonetheless dependent on what manufacturers report to the agency: the  reported reasons for a shortage and the estimated length of the shortage.  The information FDA receives from manufacturers and other sources may  be incomplete and may change over time. As a result, the information on  the website may not always be current and accurate. Stakeholders noted  that the reasons given for the shortages are often categorized as \u201cother\u201d  which can make it difficult to understand why a drug is in shortage. FDA  officials said they use the category \u201cother\u201d when none of the classifying  terminology required by FDASIA directly applies, although FDA officials  said they try to include available details to help explain the cause of the  shortage. In addition, FDA may not be able to publicly post all of the  information the agency receives from manufacturers because some of the  information provided to FDA is proprietary. Although some stakeholders  reported that information on the duration of a shortage is one of the most  useful pieces of information that can be provided, others noted that the  estimated shortage resolution dates on FDA\u2019s website are not always  reliable. Two stakeholders said that the estimated duration for a shortage  is often listed as \u201cunavailable\u201d or \u201cto be determined,\u201d which is not  particularly helpful. Stakeholders noted that such inaccuracies may limit  their ability to plan ahead. For example, a representative of one provider  group noted that in order to plan for the multiple rounds of a patient\u2019s  chemotherapy regimen, the provider would need to be sure that there will  be a sufficient supply of the drug for the second round of chemotherapy  before starting the first. Manufacturer representatives said the complexity  of a manufacturing disruption often makes it difficult to provide FDA  accurate estimates of the time it will take to resolve the disruption.", "FDA has also taken steps to respond to the recommendations we made  in our 2011 report. In response to our recommendation that FDA develop  an information system that would allow drug shortage data to be tracked  in a systematic manner\u2014to be consistent with the internal control  standards for the federal government\u2014the agency developed a drug  shortage database that is used on a daily basis to track shortages,  document the actions FDA takes to prevent and resolve shortages, and  monitor the workload of DSS personnel. All FDA offices can access the  database; however, the officials we spoke with said they request  information from DSS instead of accessing the database directly. In  September 2013, FDA informed us that it is now planning to transition  from its existing database to an information system with additional  capabilities and functionality. For example, FDA officials said they are  planning to automate some of the data fields by extracting information  from other sources that provide NDCs, market share, and other relevant  product information. This may reduce the likelihood of manual entry errors  and speed up the entry of some shortage information. The officials said  the establishment of an information system could also help facilitate  analysis related to drug shortages. However, they were unable to provide  us with a description of the types of analyses they would conduct.", "FDA has also taken steps to respond to our recommendation related to  the resources allocated to the drug shortage program. FDA has since  increased the number of DSS personnel from 4 in 2011 to 11 in 2013 and  officials said this has improved FDA\u2019s ability to respond to drug shortages  in a number of ways. First, it allowed FDA to assign each manufacturer  experiencing a shortage a specific contact person, which FDA officials  said has allowed the agency and the manufacturers to develop better  working relationships and has improved information sharing.  Representatives from one manufacturer we spoke with agreed that this  effort has improved their relationship with FDA. In addition, a number of  stakeholders, including other manufacturers\u2019 representatives, noted it is  now easier to contact DSS officials and that discussions have become  more regular. Second, FDA officials said having additional staff has  allowed them to respond more quickly to manufacturer notifications and to  identify possible approaches to preventing or resolving a shortage. Some  stakeholders also noted that FDA reached out to them for additional  information on specific drug shortages or the availability of certain drugs.  Third, officials said it has allowed DSS to play a bigger role in revising  drug shortage policies and procedures.", "FDA also improved the staffing resources available for responding to drug  shortages by assigning drug shortage coordinators in each of its 20  district offices.

Though FDA officials said the  agency has not made this change in the agency-wide strategic plan,  FDA\u2019s drug shortages strategic plan includes two goals related to  maintaining drug availability, each with a number of tasks for achieving  the goal. The first goal\u2014to improve and streamline FDA\u2019s current  mitigation activities once the agency is notified of a supply disruption or  shortage\u2014includes four tasks: streamline internal FDA processes;  improve data and response tracking; clarify roles and responsibilities of  manufacturers; and enhance public communication about drug shortages.  The second goal\u2014to develop prevention strategies to address the  underlying causes of production disruptions to prevent drug shortages\u2014 contains three tasks: develop methods to incentivize and prioritize  manufacturing quality; use regulatory science to identify early warning  signals of shortages; and increase knowledge to develop new strategies  to address shortages.

FDA\u2019s drug shortages strategic plan states  that the agency will explore using risk-based approaches to identify early  warning signs of problems that could lead to production disruptions.  However, FDA currently uses data on an ad hoc basis to respond to  specific shortages as opposed to using the data to identify trends or  patterns that may help it predict and possibly prevent shortages.  According to FDA officials, other than producing the annual report  required by FDASIA, the agency has not established regular schedules  for generating reports in the database and is not currently using the  database to conduct regular trend analyses.

This additional information has improved the  agency\u2019s ability to act more quickly when it learns of a potential shortage.  Yet, the number of shortages remains high, despite the fact that FDA has  taken steps to prevent and mitigate shortages, such as expediting  application reviews and inspections, exercising enforcement discretion in  appropriate cases, and helping manufacturers respond to quality  problems. Many shortages are prolonged, with some spanning multiple  years. As a result, patients and providers continue to struggle as essential  and life-saving medications\u2014such as anti-infective, nutritive, and  cardiovascular drugs\u2014remain in short supply. These shortages  complicate patient care and may lead to adverse outcomes with serious  consequences.", "Although there are potential underlying causes of drug shortages, FDA  has made important strides in responding to some immediate causes.  However, some of the causes identified in our literature review and  conversations with manufacturers are beyond the agency\u2019s authority, as it  does not have control over private companies\u2019 business decisions. For  example, FDA is unable to require manufacturers to start producing or  continue producing drugs, or to build redundant manufacturing capacity,  regardless of the severity of a shortage. Nonetheless, FDA can take steps  to maximize the agency\u2019s ability to use the information at its disposal to  address drug shortages. We continue to believe in the importance of our  prior recommendation that FDA should develop an information system  that would facilitate the agency\u2019s response to shortages. FDA took the  first step in implementing this recommendation by creating a database on  drug shortages. However, a key component of any system is assuring the  reliability of the data. Our current work shows that the agency lacks  adequate policies and procedures governing the use of its database, as  well as sufficient checks to ensure the data\u2019s reliability\u2014in both cases,  the failure to do so is inconsistent with internal controls for the federal  government. These shortcomings could hinder FDA\u2019s efforts to  understand the causes of shortages as well as undermine its efforts to  prevent them from occurring. Additionally, FDA\u2019s ability to manage risk- based decisions, including when to use regulatory discretion, and  proactively help prevent and resolve shortages may be hindered by its  lack of routine analysis of the data it collects. FDA may be missing an  opportunity to identify causes of shortages, risks for shortages, and  patterns in events which may be early indicators of shortages for certain  types of manufacturers, drugs, or therapeutic classes. Though FDA has  taken important steps to better prevent and address shortages, the large  number of potential shortages itself suggests a market still at risk of  continuing supply disruptions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To enhance its oversight of drug shortages, particularly as the agency  fine-tunes the manner in which it gathers data on shortages and  transitions from its database to a more robust system, we recommend  that the Commissioner of FDA take the following two actions: develop policies and procedures for the use of the existing drug  shortages database (and, ultimately, the new drug shortages  information system) to ensure staff enter information into the database  in a consistent manner and to ensure the accuracy of the information  in the database; and  conduct periodic analyses using the existing drug shortages database  (and, eventually, the new drug shortages information system) to  routinely and systematically assess drug shortage information, and  use this information proactively to identify risk factors for potential  drug shortages early, thereby potentially helping FDA to recognize  trends, clarify causes, and resolve problems before drugs go into  short supply."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency and Third- Party Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report for comment to HHS, the Department of  Justice, and the Federal Trade Commission.

HHS agreed with  our recommendations to enhance its oversight by developing policies and  procedures for its drug shortages database and by conducting periodic  analyses of these data to identify drug shortage risk factors. Regarding  our first recommendation, HHS said it agrees that policies and  procedures for data entry are important to help assure the timely,  accurate, and consistent inputting of data into its drug shortage database.  Regarding our second recommendation, HHS agreed that it could make  better use of its drug shortage data to identify trends, clarify causes of  shortages, and resolve problems before drugs go into short supply.  However, HHS noted that there are many factors that can trigger or  exacerbate a shortage and that it lacks some relevant data, such as  detailed information on manufacturing capability, to create a  comprehensive forecasting system for drug shortages. We acknowledge  that the agency\u2019s access to certain information is limited, but believe that  routine analysis of available data could nonetheless reveal some early  indicators of shortages.", "Although HHS agreed with our recommendations, it took issue with our  use of UUDIS data concerning the persistence of recent shortages. HHS  said that these data may overstate the number of shortages that persist  because UUDIS considers a shortage to be ongoing unless all NDCs for  a given product are available, even if some manufacturers that currently  produce the drug have increased production enough to meet all demand.  We recognize that there are differences in the way UUDIS and FDA  define, and therefore count, shortages. Our report notes that FDA  considers a shortage to be resolved when the total supply of the drug and  any pharmaceutical equivalents is sufficient to meet demand in the  market overall. UUDIS defines shortages more broadly, focusing on  supply issues that affect how pharmacies prepare and dispense a product  or that influence patient care when prescribers must choose an  alternative therapy because of supply issues. According to a UUDIS  official, tracking all NDCs for all manufacturers is important for providers  because using substituting one package size for another may create a  safety issue. To enhance clarity, we have provided additional detail in our  report to describe UUDIS\u2019s methods for defining and tracking shortages.", "Moreover, it is important to note that we used UUDIS data because FDA  was unable to provide data on shortages that would allow for an analysis  of trends. As we have previously reported, until FDA established a  database containing shortage information in 2011, the agency did not  systematically maintain data on shortages. In the absence of FDA data,  the data from UUDIS was the only data that we could identify that would  allow for a meaningful analysis of drug shortages over time.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of the Department  of Health and Human Services, the Attorney General, the Chairman of the  Federal Trade Commission, appropriate congressional committees, as  well as other interested parties.

For example, when the anesthetic  propofol was in shortage, FDA did not object to the temporary importation  of an unapproved version of the drug, but limited distribution to the  manufacturer of the drug. However, in January 2010 FDA initiated two  investigations related to complaints that the imported drug was being  distributed by wholesale distributors, rather than the manufacturer.

DOJ officials noted that the solicitations listed in the quarterly  reports sometimes indicate that a drug is being sold for a higher-than- normal price; however, selling drugs at elevated prices alone is not illegal.  Such sales may be illegal, for example, if the drugs are bought and sold  through diversion from the legal distribution system.

However, they were unable to find any evidence that widespread  hoarding was occurring. Instead, they found cases where a single  wholesale distributor acting alone would buy a few vials of a shortage  drug and then sell it at a higher price\u2014a practice that is not illegal.", "In addition, in response to the Executive Order, federal agencies have  worked together in an attempt to respond to gray market activities.

FDA officials  also noted that gray markets do not cause shortages, but are a symptom  of such shortages. To the extent that FDA and other stakeholders  address drug shortages, opportunities for gray markets to develop will  become more limited.

FTC staff told us that they do not believe additional FTC  authority in relation to the pharmaceutical gray market is necessary. They  stated that the FTC\u2019s existing enforcement authority would be adequate  to take action in relation to the inflated pricing of a shortage drug if such  pricing was a consequence of anticompetitive conduct.

Are there incentives these Agencies can provide, separately or in partnership  with FDA, to prevent shortages? 78 Fed. Reg. 9928 (Feb. 12, 2013). manufacturer and association representatives and to FDA for comment.  We obtained comments from three leading national associations  representing drug manufacturers, both brand and generic, and five  generic sterile injectable manufacturers. For one incentive related to  exempting certain products from Medicaid rebates and 340B discounts,  we also obtained comments from relevant stakeholder groups whose  members would be affected by this exemption."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Regulatory Incentives", "paragraphs": ["Expedited and streamlined reviews: Most of the comments submitted  by manufacturers in response to FDA\u2019s request for comment proposed  expediting or streamlining FDA review of regulatory submissions.  Submissions that could be expedited included application supplements  related to the approval of redundant manufacturing sites or new drug  applications (NDA) or abbreviated new drug applications (ANDA) from  manufacturers with a record of quality manufacturing and an adequate  risk management plan to prevent shortages.June 30, 2013, there were more than 900 manufacturing supplements to  NDAs, more than 5,700 manufacturing and chemistry supplements to  ANDAs, and more than 2,700 ANDAs pending review. Therefore,  proponents of expediting FDA review of regulatory submissions\u2014 including applications and supplements\u2014note that increasing the speed  of such reviews could provide an incentive to manufacturers to establish  redundant manufacturing capacity to which production could be shifted in  the event of manufacturing problems at a primary production facility,  thereby avoiding a shortage. Further, by rewarding manufacturers with a  history of quality manufacturing, expediting reviews could provide an   According to FDA, as of  incentive to ensure quality-related production problems\u2014and ensuing  shortages\u2014do not occur in the first place.", "While representatives of the stakeholders we interviewed were generally  supportive of this potential incentive, they also identified some limitations.  One stakeholder cautioned that the resource-intensive nature of building  in redundancy means it is a long-term solution, the implementation of  which could hinder efforts to address current shortages. Another  stakeholder noted that maintaining redundant manufacturing capacity is  expensive and that expedited review alone may not provide enough of an  incentive to establish such capacity. FDA officials noted that expediting  reviews of regulatory submissions is a tool the agency already uses to  address shortages. However, FDA officials cautioned that expanding the  pool of submissions eligible for expedited review, without regard to the  risk of shortage, could slow down review of all submissions and make  expediting reviews meaningless. Representatives from one stakeholder  echoed this concern, noting that, though faster than standard review  times, in their experience there is already a backlog for review of  supplements that have been expedited to address current shortages.  Representatives from this stakeholder noted that without additional FDA  resources devoted to the review of applications and supplements, making  additional regulatory submissions eligible for expedited review would be  problematic. FDA officials also noted that, although redundancy can help  prevent a shortage if production stops, many shortages are the result of  production disruptions driven by failures in manufacturing quality systems.  Therefore, FDA officials told us that it is more important to prioritize  incentives to improve manufacturing quality systems over those that  expand capacity. To that end, as part of its drug shortages strategic plan  goal to develop long-term prevention strategies in order to prevent  shortages, FDA states that it will continue to expedite reviews to mitigate  shortages, including the review of submissions for facility upgrades to  improve quality.", "Flexibility in meeting regulatory requirements: A few manufacturers  proposed that FDA could allow for flexibility in meeting regulatory  requirements for manufacturers with a strong history of compliance with  current good manufacturing practice regulations or robust risk  management plans to prevent shortages. For example, they suggest that  FDA could reduce the level of agency review for such change  notifications as manufacturing site transfers, if the manufacturer had a  history of production without quality issues. When proposing such  incentives, supporters commented that, as it could allow manufacturers to  implement manufacturing changes more quickly, reducing the level of  agency review could provide an incentive for quality production.  Incentivizing quality production could thus reduce the likelihood of a  quality-related supply disruption and shortage. One stakeholder generally  supported this approach, as long as all manufacturers were still held to  the same standards and any change in requirements was accompanied  by FDA guidance on the new approach. FDA officials told us that the  agency has issued guidance documents to help identify types of changes  after an application is approved that represent a lower risk. They added  that the agency is currently exploring new approaches to the review of  application products.", "To ensure that drugs are produced in conformance with federal statutes and regulations,  including good manufacturing practice regulations, FDA may inspect the establishments  where drugs are manufactured. We previously reported that FDA inspected domestic drug  manufacturing establishments about once every 2.5 years and generally inspected foreign  manufacturing establishments much less frequently. In part, this difference in frequency of  inspection was due to the fact that, at the time, FDA was required to inspect every 2 years  those domestic establishments that manufacture drugs in the United States, but there was  no comparable requirement for inspecting foreign establishments. GAO, Drug Safety: FDA  Has Conducted More Foreign Inspections and Begun to Improve Its Information on  Foreign Establishments, but More Progress is Needed, GAO-10-961 (Washington, D.C.:  Sept. 30, 2010). respond to issues raised by the FDA investigator conducting the  inspection and in terms of production disruptions caused by the  inspection itself. As it could reduce costs and disruptions for the  manufacturer, if carefully designed so that manufacturers would still be  inspected with some frequency, increasing the interval between  inspections may provide an additional incentive for compliance with good  manufacturing practices, which could reduce the likelihood of  manufacturing quality issues and resultant shortages. One stakeholder  commented that decreasing inspection frequency could be an effective  incentive in the long term, but at present, frequent inspections set a high  bar for manufacturers in this industry. FDA officials noted that the agency  already considers compliance history as a major factor when determining  the frequency of inspection of a manufacturing site. Further, in response  to new Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act  (FDASIA) authority, the agency is in the process of establishing a risk- based inspection schedule for all establishments. FDA officials told us  that they are considering incorporating additional factors, such as process  performance metrics and shortage performance, into their selection  model.", "Transparency regarding compliance status of manufacturing sites:  In documents submitted in response to FDA\u2019s request for comment, a few  manufacturers proposed increasing the transparency of manufacturing  establishment compliance status such as by assigning site scores or an  FDA stamp of approval, which could help those engaged in drug  purchasing and drug pricing negotiations\u2014including providers, group  purchasing organizations, insurers, and consumers\u2014make informed  purchasing and pricing decisions. Proponents of this approach suggest  that FDA\u2019s provision of such quality metrics could make additional  information publicly available for consideration in making purchasing and  pricing decisions, thereby giving manufacturers an additional incentive for  the highest quality production and making quality-related supply  disruptions less likely to occur.", "Representatives from the stakeholders we spoke with were generally  skeptical of this approach. One noted that providers and group  purchasing organizations\u2014which are the primary decision makers for  sterile injectable purchases, where shortages have recently been  concentrated\u2014assume that quality is built in to any FDA-approved drug  and may not be able to readily interpret quality metrics. Representatives  from one stakeholder told us that FDA has spent extensive time and effort  educating prescribers and the public that there is one quality standard for  all FDA-approved drugs and that, from this stakeholder\u2019s perspective,  further differentiating quality with ratings would diminish confidence in the  nation\u2019s drug supply and lead to confusion and mistrust. Representatives  from another stakeholder expressed skepticism that the market would  respond to such information by allowing for higher prices. Likewise,  representatives from multiple stakeholders noted that information about  FDA inspections of manufacturing establishments and warning letters are  already available online and are presumably already used when making  purchasing and pricing decisions.", "FDA officials confirmed that they currently provide information on the  compliance status of manufacturing sites on the agency\u2019s website and  added that they are looking for new ways to provide transparency in this  area. They cautioned that there are significant questions and issues  regarding how to provide more transparent compliance information to the  public, such as the fact that FDA cannot disclose either confidential  commercial information or trade secret information. Nevertheless, as part  of its drug shortages strategic plan goal to develop long-term strategies in  order to prevent shortages, FDA states that it is examining the broader  use of quality metrics to assist in the evaluation of manufacturing quality.  However, the plan also notes that although FDA can make quality  information available to the public, including inspection outcomes, recalls,  and shortages, buyers ultimately decide whether they will use these data  when making purchasing decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Incentives", "paragraphs": ["Guaranteed purchase: A few manufacturers proposed that the federal  government guarantee the purchase of a given volume of certain drugs.  This would allow manufacturers to ensure capacity for a given production  volume regardless of whether there is sufficient market demand.  Representatives from one stakeholder that supported this proposal told  us that such an incentive might bring more predictability to both the  volume of product made and product margins. In turn, this guarantee  could create some predictability in a manufacturer\u2019s ability to invest in  their facilities, resulting in continued high quality and compliant  production. One stakeholder noted that such an incentive may be useful  in terms of ensuring the availability of future capacity, but at present  would not be an effective tool to address shortages as there is simply no  excess capacity available even if the government could guarantee  purchase volume. FDA officials noted that establishing such a program  would be challenging. For example, identifying a list of drugs eligible for  guaranteed purchase would be difficult, because it is hard to predict  which drugs are vulnerable to shortage in advance and the particular  drugs at risk of shortage may change rapidly.", "Reduction in fees: Both recently-introduced federal legislation and some  manufacturers proposed reducing manufacturer fees to help alleviate or  prevent drug shortages. As introduced in the 112th Congress, H.R. 6611  proposed exempting certain drugs from the annual branded prescription  drug fee established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in  order to provide an incentive for brand-name drug manufacturers to enter  the market to produce a drug in short supply. Proponents of this  approach state that a reduction in the annual branded prescription drug  fee could induce brand-name companies to re-enter the market. One  stakeholder also noted that brand-name manufacturers may have more  idle capacity than generic manufacturers, so encouraging them to re- enter a market could be effective in addressing shortages.", "A few manufacturers proposed a reduction in or waiver of various user  fees if the manufacturer demonstrates that they have built redundant  capacity into their manufacturing plan.reductions noted that building redundancy into a manufacturing plan is  resource intensive and that a fee reduction to help offset these costs  could incentivize manufacturers to build redundancy which could help  prevent supply disruptions. At the same time, one stakeholder that  supported this approach noted that, though user fees add up, reducing  such fees would not make a large enough economic difference to impact  a manufacturer\u2019s decision to enter or exit a market. FDA officials first  noted that any changes to the user fee structure would have to be  negotiated with industry and then enacted by Congress. They stated that,  although the agency is open to using user fees as a way to prevent  shortages and encourage manufacturers to help address a shortage that  does arise, there are some uncertainties about doing this. For example,  definitions of redundancy are unclear and mechanisms ensuring  redundant capacity is not repurposed would need to be developed and  enforced. Finally, FDA officials also cautioned that reducing or waiving  fees for certain manufacturers could increase fees on other  manufacturers. This is because the total amount of user fees FDA  collects is fixed in statute and the annual fees assessed against individual  manufacturers are determined by dividing the fixed statutory amount by  the forecasted number of fee-paying entities. As a result, elimination of, or  a reduction in, fees for some parties would effectively transfer these costs  to the remaining fee-paying entities.", "Tax incentives: In order to offset the costs of such investment, some  manufacturers proposed tax credits targeted to manufacturers that invest  in redundant manufacturing capacity. Multiple stakeholders noted that,  given the significant costs associated with new manufacturing  establishments, such an incentive would only be effective for  manufacturers that already operated such establishments.  Representatives from one stakeholder noted that the time, resources, and  approvals to create a new manufacturing site are likely to take more than  3 years with associated costs totaling tens of millions of dollars.  Therefore, tax credits are a strong incentive for companies to re-invest in  existing infrastructure, not necessarily to create new infrastructure. FDA  officials told us that modernizing existing facilities to prevent quality and  safety issues that lead to shortages can go a long way to prevent  shortages even in a system with little redundancy. They noted that such  incentives would need to encourage manufacturers to purchase new  equipment, renovate facilities, and implement new manufacturing  processes and technologies.", "Changes in drug pricing or reimbursement: As introduced in the 112th  Congress, H.R. 6611 proposed changing the reimbursement rate or  pricing system for generic sterile injectable products for which there are  three or fewer active manufacturers. Such changes are intended to  prevent shortages by providing an incentive to manufacturers to continue  production in a concentrated market. Specifically, the bill proposed  changing the calculation of the Medicare reimbursement rate for generic  sterile injectable products for which there are three or fewer active  manufacturers from average sales price plus 6 percent to wholesale  acquisition cost. It would also exempt such products from Medicaid  rebates and 340B discounts.", "The premise of the Medicare reimbursement change proposal is that  basing reimbursement on wholesale acquisition cost will enable  manufacturers to adjust their prices to meet supply and demand, which  some claim the current reimbursement structure prevents.manufacturers to more readily adjust their prices and achieve a profit, this  proposal aims to provide an incentive for manufacturers to remain in the  market, thereby preventing further erosion of manufacturing capacity,  which could make the generic sterile injectable market even more  vulnerable to shortages. Proponents note that this incentive could  positively affect manufacturer profit and influence a manufacturer\u2019s  decision about participating in the market for a particular drug. One  stakeholder cautioned that, in their opinion, using reimbursement as an  incentive increases the risk of fraud and abuse.", "The premise of the Medicaid rebate and 340B discount exemptions  proposal is that such rebates exert additional downward pressure on  already extremely low prices, thereby limiting manufacturers\u2019 ability to  sustain production and upgrade facilities. Removing such rebates and  discounts would provide additional revenue to manufacturers, thereby  potentially providing them an incentive to remain in the market and  maintain manufacturing capacity or to re-enter the market. Proponents  state that this incentive may help influence manufacturer margins, thereby  providing revenue to invest in production capacity to ensure demand is  met. However, some stakeholders caution that these exemptions would  increase costs to patients and the government (including increasing drug  costs and administrative costs to the government for tracking such an  exemption). Representatives from one stakeholder group we interviewed  noted that, according to its inquiries, the majority of generic sterile  injectable drugs are manufactured by three or fewer manufacturers, in  which case nearly all such drugs would be subject to this exemption,  whether the drug had ever been in shortage or not. Further, stakeholders  noted that generic sterile injectable drugs are often administered in  hospital inpatient departments and are therefore not subject to Medicaid  rebates, which only apply to outpatient drugs. One stakeholder stated that  for the few drugs in this group that are subject to Medicaid rebates, the  cost of these drugs is already low, which would result in a minimal  financial impact of such an exemption. Finally, one stakeholder stated  that 340B discount exemptions would have a minimal influence on drug  shortages."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Geri Redican-Bigott, Assistant  Director; Katherine L.
