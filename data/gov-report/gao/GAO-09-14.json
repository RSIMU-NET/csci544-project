Under guidance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), competitive sourcing has been implemented at various executive branch agencies over the years. As required under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 and directed by House Report 110-231, this report examines the use of competitive sourcing at the Department of Labor (DOL). Specifically, GAO examined the comprehensiveness and reliability of DOL's performance and cost assessments in accordance with OMB and DOL guidance as well as the impact of competitive sourcing on certain DOL workers. To address these issues, GAO reviewed relevant statutes, guidance, reports and personnel actions; and interviewed OMB and DOL officials and 60 DOL staff, grouped by role, in four locations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOL first began conducting public-private competitions as part of its competitive sourcing program in fiscal year 2004, and since that time, it has set up performance and cost reporting systems to monitor progress in meeting the goals of competitive sourcing--that is, to obtain high-quality services at a reasonable cost and to achieve outcomes that represent the best deal for the taxpayer. For the most part, we found that DOL's policies and procedures were followed in conducting competitive sourcing activities; however, a number of weaknesses inhibit DOL's ability to reliably and comprehensively assess whether competitive sourcing achieves the outcomes promised. DOL lacks a departmentwide process for tracking and addressing deficiencies and recommendations for improvements that are identified in postcompetition accountability reviews. Though consistent with OMB guidance, DOL excluded a number of substantial costs in its reports to Congress--such as the costs for precompetition planning, certain transition costs and staff time, and postcompetition review activities--thereby understating the full costs of this contracting approach. DOL's savings reports are not reliable: a sample of three reports contained inaccuracies, and others used projections when actual numbers were available, which sometimes resulted in overstated savings. Because of these and other weaknesses, DOL is hindered in its ability to determine if services are being provided more efficiently as a result of competitive sourcing. Moreover, though not a representative sample of DOL personnel, in GAO's interviews with 60 employees involved with five competitions (including employees who assisted with competition activities, as well as employees whose positions were affected by the competitions), most said that they were dissatisfied with how the competitive sourcing process was implemented and that it had a negative impact on morale. Overall, DOL's competitions have resulted in few job losses or salary reductions. Among the 314 workers who experienced a personnel action, 263 were reassigned to new positions with the same title and pay or were promoted. In addition, of the 16 workers who were demoted, 14 were able to retain their same grade or pay. At the same time, certain groups have been impacted more than others. For example, though small in numbers, all 22 of those who were either demoted or laid off were African-American, while 10 of the 15 workers who were promoted were Caucasian. OMB recently issued new guidance that directs agencies to use a variety of tools to manage their commercial activities, including--but not limited to-- competitive sourcing. However, unless agencies are required to comprehensively track all the costs associated with competitive sourcing, it will be difficult to assess which tool may provide the best outcome in terms of efficiency in the management of commercial activities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since 1955, the federal government has encouraged competition between  federal and private sector organizations to provide specific services\u2014an  initiative referred to as \u201ccompetitive sourcing.\u201d Since 2001, competitive  sourcing has been one of the key elements of the President\u2019s Management  Agenda, implemented under guidance from the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) in Circular No. A-76. Over the years, GAO has reported on a  number of issues related to competitive sourcing at various executive  branch agencies, including the extent to which there are plans and  guidance to help agencies implement the competitive sourcing program  effectively and whether savings are likely to be achieved.", "The Department of Labor (DOL) began conducting public-private  competitions in fiscal year 2004. From fiscal years 2004 through 2007,  DOL held 28 competitions involving 1,029 full-time equivalent (FTE)  government positions designated as commercial, such as training  specialists, information technology specialists, and maintenance  mechanics. DOL planned to compete nearly 700 additional FTEs during  fiscal years 2008 and 2009; however, these plans have been put on hold  pursuant to federal law. Given that DOL employees have won all but three  of the competitions DOL has held, Congress is interested in determining  whether competitive sourcing has achieved increased efficiency or cost  savings at DOL. In addition, since competitive sourcing may also result in  government employees being reassigned or losing their jobs, Congress  expressed concern over DOL\u2019s implementation of this initiative and its  implications for the federal workforce.", "As required under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 and as  directed by the House Committee on Appropriations, this report examines  the use of competitive sourcing at DOL. The House Committee on  Appropriations directed that we review the extent to which DOL has  established a reliable and comprehensive system to track costs, savings,  and the quality of work performed by contractors, as well as DOL\u2019s  adherence to the principles adopted in 2002 by the Commercial Activities  Panel chaired by the Comptroller General. In response, as agreed with  your staffs, this report addresses the following:  1.  The extent to which DOL established a reliable and comprehensive  system to assess the quality of work performed as a result of  competitive sourcing. 2.  The comprehensiveness and reliability of DOL\u2019s assessments of the  savings and costs associated with competitive sourcing.  3.

We examined relevant  statutes, regulations, and OMB guidance on competitive sourcing, DOL  internal policies and guidance on competitive sourcing, competition  announcements, annual reports to Congress, GAO reports, and related  documents. We interviewed DOL officials, OMB officials, representatives  from the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), two  private sector companies, and the president of a leading national private  sector trade association representing over 300 companies. To assess the  quality of work performed as a result of competitive sourcing, we  examined all 18 of DOL\u2019s initial postcompetition accountability reviews  (PCAR) conducted as of July 2008 and evaluated the structure and content  of these reviews according to DOL and OMB policy. To assess DOL\u2019s  savings and cost reports, we interviewed the agency officials responsible  for preparing these reports and reviewed the process they used to compile  them. To assess the accuracy of the reports, we reviewed the documents  from all 18 initial PCARs and conducted more detailed analyses of the  calculations for a simple random sample of three reports for competitions  with initial PCARs completed between 2006 and 2007 and interviewed  agency officials knowledgeable about these reports. Due to this limited  sample size, no inferences can be made about the accuracy of savings and  cost reports across all of DOL\u2019s competitions. To identify the implications  of competitive sourcing for certain DOL worker populations, we analyzed  DOL\u2019s demographic data on overall departmentwide personnel and  compared it with the demographic data for all DOL employees who  experienced a personnel action as a result of competitions conducted  during fiscal years 2004 through 2007. We also obtained a range of  employees\u2019 perspectives on the competitive sourcing process by  conducting group interviews with 60 DOL managers and employees who  either assisted with competition activities or whose positions were  affected by five competitions in four locations throughout the United  States. We assessed the reliability of the savings, cost, and demographic  data by reviewing information about the systems that produced the data  and interviewing agency officials knowledgeable about these systems. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our  report.

For example, OMB directs  agencies to exclude the costs of precompetition planning and agency staff  time spent on competition activities, as these activities can help the  agency identify and correct performance gaps and improve efficiency and  should be taking place whether or not the agency is conducting any  competitions. Additionally, OMB officials explained that transition costs  associated with competitions should be excluded because such costs also  occur with other management processes, such as new program re- engineering and separation payments provided to employees who are  displaced by a downsizing. Similarly, they explained that the costs  associated with conducting PCARs should be excluded because these  reviews help organizations identify and correct performance gaps in their  work groups and should be considered as part of normal business  operations.

Since 1990, we have reported that improvements in the  completeness and accuracy of savings reports of competitive sourcing  could help present a more comprehensive picture of program costs and  benefits and help determine the most cost-effective use of resources. For  example, in our reviews of the competitive sourcing programs at DOD and  USDA\u2019s Forest Service, we recommended that these agencies improve the  way they account for and report costs associated with their competitive  sourcing programs.", "In this review, we found similar issues with the comprehensiveness of  DOL\u2019s savings reports. Specifically, DOL reported a total of $15.7 million in  savings and $4.3 million in competition costs for all of its completed  competitions for fiscal years 2004 through 2007. While DOL reported these  savings in conformance with OMB guidance, we found that the excluded  costs attributable to competitive sourcing over this period were  substantial, and\u2014importantly\u2014it is not clear that these costs would be  incurred when using a commercial management tool other than  competitive sourcing.", "For example, consistent with OMB guidance, DOL excluded costs  attributable to the time in-house staff spent on assisting with competition  activities (staff not dedicated to central oversight of DOL\u2019s competitive  sourcing program). While these staff are already paid by the government,  their time spent away from regular work duties represents a cost that is  attributable to the competition process. We were not able to obtain  specific estimates on the number of hours that such staff members spent  on competition activities, since DOL does not require its offices to record  this information. However, employees in one office who were at the GS-12  level or higher estimated that they worked a total of 2,263 hours on one  competition. Including these staff costs would have doubled the costs  reported by DOL for this competition. Employee responses in our  interviews suggest that the amount of time employee staff spent assisting  on competitions varied greatly, with some staff members spending little, if  any, time on competition activities and others who reported spending one- quarter to one-half of their total working time over the course of a year.", "According to OMB\u2019s guidance, agencies should also exclude costs incurred  during the preliminary planning phase of a competition, such as the use of  contractors, as well as other costs that are directly related to the conduct  of the competition (see table 2). DOL employed private sector consultants  to conduct precompetition planning, including feasibility studies before  the competition phase, and to conduct PCARs following the competition.  DOL also employed private sector consultants for other activities related  to competitive sourcing, such as to conduct business and industry  analyses to determine the likelihood of generating private sector offers  and to review the government positions open for bidding to determine if  they had been appropriately designated during the FAIR Act inventory  process.", "In addition, OMB guidance does not require agencies to include many of  the transition costs directly associated with generating savings from  competitive sourcing activities, such as the costs of voluntary separation  payments and system re-engineering costs. For example, according to  DOL data, in calendar year 2006, 14 employees were provided voluntary  incentive payments due to competitive sourcing that totaled $350,000.  Including these costs would have increased total completed competition  costs by 32 percent for the year.

For example, in the first competition, won by a private  sector service provider, DOL reported $2.7 million in savings from fiscal  year 2005 through fiscal year 2007. This savings figure did not include  contract administration costs that are directed to be included according to  OMB guidance. By excluding these costs, DOL overstated its savings by  about $185,000 per year, or 25 percent. In the second competition, DOL  used an incorrect cost value that excluded some employee wage costs  when calculating savings. This error inflated the reported savings by  almost $169,000, or 22 percent, for fiscal year 2006. In the third  competition, though the inaccuracy was less significant, DOL reported a  full year\u2019s worth of savings for fiscal year 2006, even though the new  provider was not phased in until 7 months into the new fiscal year.

Projections also  exclude \u201cretained pay,\u201d which is pay to employees who receive grade  demotions but keep their original pay due to worker protections. By using  projections, these costs are excluded from competition savings reports but  would be included if actual costs were used. For example, in one  competition won by the in-house agency (MEO), 8 of the 9.3 full time  employees in the MEO received retained pay after the competition. In  total, a DOL review noted that retained pay for these employees caused  the actual personnel costs to be 45 percent higher than the original  estimated costs for the MEO.

This reduced the  designated FTEs for this competition from 32 to 24.

However, the final  savings figure\u2014the difference between the original government provider  and the winning private sector service provider\u2014was calculated using the  baseline cost of the original 32 FTE service provider. A senior DOL official  that we spoke with stated that the original baseline was used because the  private sector service provider was doing the same level of work that the  government service provider had been doing before. However, as noted in  the PCAR, actual workload data was not available for this competition.  Because of this, it cannot be known for certain if the same level of work  was being performed. Using the baseline of 32 FTEs, rather than 24 FTEs,  increased reported savings by almost $2.7 million over the 5-year  performance period.", "Vacancies within agency workgroups also increased reported savings,  though it is unclear if these savings should be attributed to competitive  sourcing efforts. For example, in five competitions, the in-house  government bid won the competition by maintaining its original \u201cas-is\u201d  work group organization, and no anticipated future savings were reported  because, according to DOL officials, the staff structure did not change.  However, in two of the competitions, savings were later reported. In one  of these competitions, employee retirements and a decrease in  organization workload resulted in vacancies that caused staff wages to be  46 percent lower than those originally projected, and DOL reported  savings of $64,000 for fiscal year 2005 and $86,000 for fiscal year 2006. In  the second competition, savings of $26,000 were recorded for 1 year, partly  due to a vacant position. In addition to staffing vacancies after the  competition, vacancies that occur before a competition can inflate  reported savings, as the baseline used to calculate savings is determined  by the government service provider\u2019s budgeted staffing levels for the year  of the planned competition. For example, the same competition discussed  previously that reported $3.3 million in savings because of a re-engineered  process that decreased workload and required staffing hours, did not  change its actual staffing levels at the time of the competition due to pre- existing, budgeted vacancies. Thus, the savings figures based on full  staffing levels were inflated.", "In three separate PCARs, as well as in our interviews with DOL employees,  DOL staff were identified as inappropriately contributing to the work  assigned to the winning bids, and in some cases, this resulted in  overestimating the savings achieved by the competitions. In one case, the  bid was won by a private sector contractor, yet the independent reviewer  determined that a DOL employee was performing some of the work, noting  that \u201ca government employee is assisting a [private sector service  provider] employee for up to1-2 hours per day and could total up to 500  hours on an annual basis. The service provider is being supplemented with  the government workforce at this time.\u201d DOL officials stated that the  government employee was no longer assisting the private sector service  provider and that a workload study was being conducted to help address  this problem. Additionally, in two cases, staff who were not part of the  MEO were found to be contributing to the work assigned to the MEO. For  example, in one case, the PCAR indicated that non-MEO workers were  found contributing to work within the MEO and that DOL had not included  these costs.

DOL issued a guidebook describing how the process  worked, and management officials said they made every effort to find a job for  all those affected by a competition. Employees were offered reassignments,  voluntary early retirement options, separation incentives, and other services for  career transition.
