To help increase fighter pilot numbers, the military services are taking actions, including increasing the amounts of financial incentives to retain pilots.", "The military services have not recently reevaluated squadron requirements to reflect increased fighter pilot workload and the emergence of unmanned aerial systems (UAS). According to service guidance, squadron requirements are to be reviewed on a 2-year schedule and to be updated as conditions change (in June 2017 the Navy revised its guidance to extend its schedule from 2 years to 5 years). However, service officials acknowledged that they have not updated all squadron requirements within the last 2 years. These officials stated that the requirements have not been reevaluated because existing conditions do not warrant the change. However, fighter pilots and squadron leaders interviewed at locations GAO visited consistently stated that the typical workload has significantly increased in recent years due to, among other things, changes in fighter aircraft tactics and technology and reductions to administrative support in squadrons. Further, the military services have not assessed the effect of increased reliance on UAS on fighter pilot requirements. The Air Force's vision for UAS notes that systems will work in tandem with cockpit-operated aircraft and that autonomous technologies will potentially lead to personnel efficiencies.

For example, Navy officials  told us they are developing staffing software to manage assignments  and make the process more transparent and flexible. The Navy is also  testing a new performance evaluation system to more accurately  evaluate sailor performance. In addition, the Navy has adjusted the  existing aviation bonus program by increasing the maximum bonus  amount for fighter pilots from $25,000 to $30,000 per year for fiscal  year 2018. To increase the number of available fighter aircraft, the  Navy has also established a Rhino Readiness Recovery team\u2014 referring to the Navy\u2019s term for the F/A-18 E-F Super Hornet aircraft\u2014 to identify and address readiness challenges in that community. Navy  officials told us they believe their approaches are sufficient to address  any potential future Navy fighter pilot gaps.", "In November 2017, the Marine Corps reinstated the aviation bonus  program last offered by the Marine Corps in fiscal year 2011.

However, the Marine  Corps is not in the process of developing any non-monetary initiatives  to address pilot retention. Rather, the Marine Corps is addressing  aircraft readiness challenges\u2014an issue consistently raised by fighter  pilots in our discussion groups\u2014by establishing four lines of effort to  increase the number of available fighter aircraft for fighter squadrons.  Marine Corps officials told us that they have begun implementing  multiple initiatives for those lines of effort. For example, one initiative  is focused on improving availability of aircraft spare parts by  increasing their funding and modernizing the spare parts supply chain.

However, Air Force officials told us that metrics that inform  squadron requirements (i.e., crew ratios, the targeted ratio of pilots to  aircraft) have not been increased because the Air Force is instead  prioritizing the effort to recapitalize its fleet of fighter aircraft. Separately  from reevaluating squadron requirements, Air Force officials told us that  they have implemented changes to address workload concerns cited by  fighter pilots\u2014such as adding contractor staff in squadrons to provide  administrative support, as part of initiatives to address fighter pilot  shortages they have identified. According to Air Force officials, the Air  Force is currently reassessing non-operational requirements for fighter  pilots (i.e., non-flying positions at headquarters organizations).

Marine Corps officials told us that  they have not updated squadron requirements because (1) Marine Corps  fighter pilot authorizations and staffing levels are below squadron  requirements, so any increase to squadron requirements would require a  significant increase to fighter pilot authorizations, and (2) the Marine  Corps has faced challenges obtaining technical assistance to conduct  workload assessments in fighter squadrons. The Navy Manpower  Analysis Center conducts workload reviews of squadrons, based on  specific events such as changes to the amount of time needed for  maintaining the specific type of aircraft.

The Chief of  Naval Operations announced in 2017 that the future of the Navy includes  UAS systems as an integral part of the future fleet and must be  purchased in large numbers to expand naval presence in key areas.

Further, a document outlining the Air Force\u2019s vision for  UAS for fiscal years 2009 through 2047 notes that systems will work in  tandem with cockpit-operated aircraft, for example to attack air-defense  systems, and that autonomous technologies will potentially allow one pilot  to direct multiple aircraft, leading to personnel efficiencies.", "Although the impact of UAS on the fighter pilot workforce appears to be  significant, the Air Force, the Navy, and the Marine Corps have not  accounted for the planned increased use of UAS to complete missions  similar to those carried out by fighter aircraft, and the potential impact of  these changes on fighter pilot requirements. Specifically, Air Force and  Navy officials told us that their military services have not conducted an  assessment of the impact of future UAS operations on fighter pilot  requirements. While the UAS platforms that are expected to overlap  with fighter aircraft missions will not be fielded until the mid-2020s, the  length of time required to develop an experienced fighter pilot compels  the military services to begin incorporating these planned changes to  fighter pilot requirements promptly.

Nevertheless, the Air Force, the Navy, and the Marine Corps,  are reporting fewer fighter pilots than authorizations, and they project that  these gaps will continue through at least fiscal year 2023. Without re- evaluating fighter pilot requirements, it will be difficult for the military  services to accurately determine the number of fighter pilots needed to  complete missions and help ensure success in combat.

In February 2017, the Air Force effort was expanded to  include all rated personnel and renamed the Aircrew Crisis Task Force.  According to Air Force officials, the task force has focused on the  following areas to improve fighter pilot retention: work/life balance, quality  of service, and monetary compensation. In August 2017 the Aircrew  Crisis Task Force held a Dedicated Aircrew Retention Team Summit that  included organizing discussion groups with pilots to obtain information on  retention challenges. According to Air Force officials, in September 2017,  the task force presented 25 of the 44 recommendations developed at the  summit to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force and as of November 2017 the  Chief of Staff had decided to implement 2 of them immediately and  conduct additional analysis on the other 23. The recommendations being  analyzed include reducing the length and number of deployments for  fighter pilots and converting some non-flying fighter pilot positions to UAS  pilot positions.
