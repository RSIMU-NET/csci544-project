Billions of dollars in cost growth occur as programs transition from development to production, and unit-cost increases are common after production begins. Several factors contribute to these problems including inattention to manufacturing during planning and design, poor supplier management, and a deficit in manufacturing knowledge among the acquisition workforce. Essentially, programs did not identify and resolve manufacturing risks early in development, but carried risks into production where they emerged as significant problems. MRLs have been proposed as new criteria for improving the way DOD identifies and manages manufacturing risks and readiness. Introduced to the defense community in 2005, MRLs were developed from an extensive body of manufacturing knowledge that includes defense, industry, and academic sources. An analysis of DOD's technical reviews that assesses how programs are progressing show that MRLs address many gaps in core manufacturing-related areas, particularly during the early acquisition phases. Several Army and Air Force centers that piloted MRLs report these metrics contributed to substantial cost benefits on a variety of technologies and major defense acquisition programs. To develop and manufacture products, the commercial firms we visited use a disciplined, gated process that emphasizes manufacturing criteria early in development. The practices they employ focus on gathering sufficient knowledge about the producibility of their products to lower risks, and include stringent manufacturing readiness criteria to measure whether the product is sufficiently mature to move forward in development. These criteria are similar to DOD's proposed MRLs in that commercial firms (1) assess producibility at each gate using clearly defined manufacturing criteria to gain knowledge about manufacturing early, (2) demonstrate manufacturing processes in a production-relevant environment, and (3) emphasize relationships with critical suppliers. However, a key difference is that commercial firms, prior to starting production, require their manufacturing processes to be in control--that is, critical processes are repeatable, sustainable, and consistently producing parts within the quality standards. DOD's proposed MRL criteria do not require that processes be in control until later. Acceptance of MRLs has grown among some industry and DOD components. Yet, DOD has been slow to adopt a policy that would require MRLs across DOD. Concerns raised by the military services have centered on when and how the MRL assessments would be used. While a joint DOD and industry group has sought to address concerns and disseminate information on benefits, a consensus has not been reached. If adopted, DOD will need to address gaps in workforce knowledge, given the decrease in the number of staff in the production and manufacturing career fields."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) has a well-documented history of  taking much longer and spending much more than originally planned to  develop and acquire its weapons systems.

In 2004, the Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology  Panel sponsored a joint defense and industry working group to design and  develop MRLs for programs across DOD. In May 2005, MRLs were first  introduced to the defense community in DOD\u2019s Technology Readiness  Assessment Deskbook for science and technology and acquisition  managers to consider.", "As new manufacturing readiness criteria, MRLs are a measurement scale  designed to provide a common metric and vocabulary for assessing  manufacturing maturity and risk. MRL assessments identify the risks and  manufacturing readiness of a particular technology, manufacturing  process, weapon system, subsystem, or element of a legacy program at key  milestones throughout the acquisition life cycle. There are 10 basic MRLs  designed to be roughly congruent with comparable levels of technology  readiness levels for ease of use and understanding. Table 1 shows the  MRLs and basic definitions (see appendix II for the detailed MRL  definitions).", "The working group also developed a set of elements called \u201cthreads\u201d to  provide acquisition managers and those conducting assessments an  understanding of the manufacturing risk areas (see table 2). For these  threads, desired progress is defined for each MRL, to provide an  understanding of risks as readiness levels increase from one MRL to the  next. Conceptually, these threads are manufacturing elements that are  essential to programs as they plan, prepare for, and manage the activities  necessary to develop a product. For example, the materials thread requires  an assessment of potential supplier capability by MRL 3 and an assessment  of critical first-tier suppliers by MRL 7. Likewise, the manufacturing  personnel thread calls for identifying new manufacturing skills by MRL 3  and identifying manufacturing workforce requirements for the pilot line by  MRL 7.", "As shown, each basic thread (risk area) has a description and general  requirements for assessing risks for each thread.

GAO\u2019s work has drawn on lessons learned and best  practices to recommend ways for DOD to improve the way it develops and  manufactures its weapon systems. Examples from our reports include the  following:  In 1996, GAO reported the practices that world-class commercial  organizations had adopted to more efficiently produce quality  products, to improve DOD\u2019s quality assurance program. DOD was  spending $1.5 billion extra per year on military-unique quality  assurance requirements for major acquisitions and billions more on  cost and schedule overruns to correct problems. GAO concluded that  repeated unstable designs, poor process controls, and poor transition  to production caused the manufacturing quality problems. While DOD  had taken some actions, its culture was cited as the biggest reason for  slow adoption and unimplemented recommendations.", "In 1998, GAO reported on best commercial practices to offer ways to  improve the process DOD uses to manage suppliers engaged in  developing and producing major weapon systems. In assessing  defense contractors and two case studies of munitions programs, the  report concluded that suppliers were critical in the amount of  technological innovation they contribute to the final product.", "In 2002, GAO reported on how best practices could offer  improvements to the way DOD develops new weapon systems,  primarily the design and manufacturing aspects of the acquisition  process. DOD\u2019s record showed a history of taking longer and  spending more than planned to develop and acquire weapon system which reduced its buying power. The report identified and  recommended best practices for capturing and using design and  manufacturing knowledge early and new development processes that s,  included high-level decision points and knowledge-based exit criter before key decisions on production are made. Essentially, one of the  high-level decision points has become what GAO commonly refers to  as Knowledge Point 3\u2014the point when a program has demonstrated  the manufacturing processes are mature. The report also  recommended a best practice that includes a standard called the  Process Capability Index (Cpk), a process performance measurement  that quantifies how closely a product is running to its specification  limits. The index indicates how well the processes statistical  performance meets its control limit requirement.", "In 2008, GAO reported on how DOD and its defense contractors can  improve the quality of major weapon systems. We reported that if  DOD continued to employ the same acquisition practices as it has in  the past, the cost of designing and developing its systems could  continue to exceed estimates by billions of dollars. Quality problems  were identified as the cause for cost overruns, schedule delays, and  reduced weapon-system availability. Like DOD prime contractors,  leading commercial firms rely on many practices related to systems  engineering, manufacturing, and supplier quality, but they were more  disciplined, and had institutionalized processes to ensure quality.", "Since 2003, GAO has issued a series of annual assessment reports on  selected weapons programs, increasing from 77 to 96 programs  reviewed. At $296 billion, the cumulative cost growth for DOD  programs reported in 2009 was found to be higher than it had been five  years earlier, and the overall performance of weapon system programs  was still poor.

Capturing critical manufacturing knowledge during the  planning and design phases before entering production helps to ensure  that a weapon system will work as intended and can be manufactured  efficiently to meet cost, schedule, and quality targets.

It also recognizes the value in assessing manufacturing risks during  science and technology research on technologies planned to be incorporated into  acquisition programs.  Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5000.02, Operation of  the Defense Acquisition System, dated 8 December 2008 reflects an increased focus on  manufacturing throughout the acquisition lifecycle for programs of all acquisition  categories.  Specifically, it establishes a framework to continually assess and mitigate  manufacturing risks during the Analysis of Alternatives, 2366b certifications to Congress,  Preliminary and Critical Design Reviews; and acquisition milestones.", "The Department\u2019s new manufacturing readiness criteria will form the basis for assessing  pertinent science and technology efforts, and acquisition programs throughout the  acquisition lifecycle on programs of all acquisition categories.   These criteria will be a  tool to identify relevant manufacturing risks which require mitigation.  These  manufacturing readiness criteria are expected to be tailored for programs and will be  included in the Department\u2019s criteria for systems engineering technical reviews; the  Department\u2019s templates for Preliminary Design Review/Critical Design Review reports;  and acquisition phase exit criteria.  These manufacturing readiness criteria will also be  assessed as part of the Program Support Reviews which the Department conducts on  Major Defense Acquisition Programs.  These reviews evaluate manufacturing as part of  an overall integrated program assessment.  These manufacturing readiness criteria and  products will be made available to government and industry.  Their use by the Services  on lower ACAT programs will also be encouraged.  The Navy\u2019s Gate Review process  currently assesses manufacturing risks but is being updated with the new manufacturing  readiness criteria.", "DoD Response to GAO-10-439 Recommendations  RECOMMENDATION 2:  The GAO recommends that the Secretary of Defense direct  the Office of the Director, Defense Research and Engineering to examine strengthening  the MRL criteria related to the process capability and control of critical components  and/or interfaces prior to the Milestone C low rate initial production decision.", "DOD RESPONSE:  Concur.  Department of Defense Instruction 5000.02 directs that  programs at Milestone C have no significant manufacturing risks;  that manufacturing  processes have been effectively demonstrated in a pilot line environment; and  manufacturing processes are under control (if Milestone C is full-rate production).  While  the Department notes that all manufacturing processes do not warrant the same level of  process capability and control, appropriate levels of control are certainly warranted on a  case by case basis.", "The Department will examine strengthening the manufacturing readiness criteria related  to process capability and control of critical components and/or interfaces prior to the  Milestone C low rate initial production decision.  However, program offices and  contractors should continue to have the latitude to jointly agree on the targets and specific  process control demonstrations  required on the pilot production line during the  Engineering and Manufacturing Development to ensure success.", "RECOMMENDATION 3:  The GAO recommends that the Secretary of Defense direct  the Office of the Director, Defense Research and Engineering to assess the need for  analytical models and tools to support MRL assessments.", "DOD RESPONSE:  Concur.

The USD  (AT&L) Director of Human Capital has launched a review of the PQM career field  design to identify the skills, knowledge and training required at each level of career  progression in order to develop training courses and evaluate progression of anticipated  DoD planned new hires.
