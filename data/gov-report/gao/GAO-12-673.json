OGAC leads the PEPFAR effort by providing funding and guidance to implementing agencies, primarily CDC and USAID. Responding to legislative mandates, GAO (1) identified PEPFAR evaluation activities and examined the extent to which evaluation findings, conclusions, and recommendations were supported and (2) examined the extent to which PEPFAR policies and procedures adhere to established general evaluation principles.

However, GAO found that the findings, conclusions, and recommendations were not fully supported in many PEPFAR evaluations. Agency officials provided nearly 500 evaluations addressing activities ongoing in fiscal years 2008 through 2010 in all program areas relating to HIV/AIDS treatment, prevention, and care. GAO\u0092s assessment of a selected sample of seven OGAC-managed evaluations found that they generally adhered to common evaluation standards, as did most of a selected sample of 15 evaluations managed by CDC and USAID headquarters. Based on this assessment, GAO determined that these evaluations generally contained fully supported findings, conclusions, and recommendations. However, based on a similar assessment of a randomly selected sample taken from 436 evaluations provided by PEPFAR country and regional teams, GAO estimated that 41 percent contained fully supported findings, conclusions, and recommendations, while 44 percent contained partial support and 15 percent were not supported.", "State, OGAC, CDC, and USAID have established detailed evaluation policies, as recommended by the American Evaluation Association (AEA). However, PEPFAR does not fully adhere to AEA principles relating to evaluation planning, independence and qualifications of evaluators, and public dissemination of evaluation results. Specifically, OGAC does not require country and regional teams to include evaluation plans in their annual operational plans, limiting its ability to ensure that evaluation resources are appropriately targeted. Further, although OGAC, CDC, and USAID evaluation policies and procedures provide some guidance on how to ensure evaluator independence and qualifications, they do not require documentation of these issues. GAO found that most PEPFAR program evaluations did not fully address whether evaluators had conflicts of interest and some did not include detailed information on the identity and makeup of evaluation teams.

OGAC provided 18 PHEs that CDC  and USAID had completed as of November 2011 under an OGAC- managed approval, implementation review, and reporting process.  The completed PHEs addressed the following program areas:  prevention of mother-to-child transmission, testing and counseling,  adult care and support, adult treatment, sexual prevention, and  pediatric care and support. In addition, OGAC indicated that 82  other PHEs had been initiated as of November 2011. According to  OGAC, PHEs are intended to assess the effectiveness and impact of  PEPFAR programs; compare evidence-based program models in  complex health, social, and economic contexts; and address  operational questions related to program implementation within  existing and developing health systems infrastructures. OGAC  guidance states that these evaluations focus on strategies to increase  program efficiency and impact to guide program development and  inform the public, using rigorous quantitative or qualitative methods  that permit broad generalization. For all PHEs, OGAC requires  PEPFAR country and regional teams to submit evaluation concepts or  protocols for approval by an interagency subcommittee and requires  periodic progress and closeout reports.  \uf0b7  CDC and USAID headquarters-managed evaluations. CDC  headquarters officials provided 20 evaluations in the following  program areas: blood safety, injection safety, adult treatment,  pediatric treatment, and strategic information.

We consulted with OGAC and CDC and USAID headquarters officials  and decided to use implementing mechanism as a proxy for a  program activity. We determined that using implementing  mechanisms was the only viable unit of analysis to estimate the  percentage of PEPFAR programs with evaluations because (1) OGAC  officials maintained updated data on implementing mechanisms and  (2) PEPFAR officials regularly used and understood data on  implementing mechanisms. However, in some of these cases, if the  broader program was evaluated, not all implementing mechanisms  under the larger program were necessarily evaluated. We also  recognized that evaluations may not be appropriate for all  implementing mechanisms (such as those that provide funding for  staffing costs). To the extent possible, we eliminated these  implementing mechanisms from our analysis.  2.  We obtained lists of program activities for fiscal years 2008 through  2010 from OGAC for each country and region. We then analyzed  program activities by country (or region) and agency; the lists included  identification numbers, names, and partner names for each of the  program activities. Each survey tool then contained a list of program  activities relevant to the country or regional team.  3.  Based on GAO and OGAC guidance, we developed the following  working definition of evaluation: Evaluations are systematic studies to  assess how well a program is working. Evaluations are often  conducted by experts external to the program, either inside or outside  the agency. Types of evaluations include process, outcome, impact,  or cost-benefit analysis.  4.  We developed a survey tool for ongoing and completed evaluations of  PEPFAR programs. We consulted with OGAC and CDC and USAID  headquarters officials about the survey tool and made revisions as  appropriate. For example, based on input from CDC and USAID  headquarters officials, we determined that some PEPFAR evaluations  could address several implementing mechanisms. In addition, in some  of these cases, if a broader program (e.g., national treatment  program) was evaluated, not all implementing mechanisms under the  broader program were necessarily evaluated. In response, we  included questions in our survey prompting PEPFAR officials to  indicate whether an implementing mechanism has been evaluated as  part of a broader evaluation of several implementing mechanisms.  5.  We tested the survey tool with officials in two PEPFAR countries\u2014 Angola and Ethiopia\u2014and finalized the survey tool based on  discussions with these officials.  6.  We sent the final survey tool to PEPFAR country contacts (PEPFAR  coordinators and CDC and USAID officials) identified by OGAC and  CDC and USAID headquarters. The survey tool instructed CDC and  USAID country or regional team officials to provide \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d  responses to the following questions for each implementing  mechanism in the country\u2019s (or region\u2019s) agency-specific lists:  Is this one of your agency\u2019s fiscal year 2008-2010 country or regional  operational plan program activities?  \uf0b7  Has at least one evaluation specific to this implementing mechanism  been completed?", "Is at least one evaluation specific to this implementing mechanism  ongoing?  \uf0b7  Has at least one evaluation covering, but broader than, this  implementing mechanism been completed?", "Is at least one evaluation covering, but broader than, this  implementing mechanism ongoing?", "We also prompted the country or regional officials to provide additional  information for each implementing mechanism, such as explanations for  program activities that do not belong to the agency and identification of  duplicate program activities. Officials were instructed to either e-mail the  completed surveys to GAO or upload them to a website regularly used by  OGAC and country and regional teams for submitting and sharing  planning and reporting documents.", "In some cases, we met with country or regional team officials via  telephone, or corresponded via e-mail, to clarify the purpose of the  survey, the questions themselves, and the evaluation document request  as well as to correct anomalies and ask follow-up questions. One GAO  analyst also attended the May 2011 PEPFAR implementing agency  annual meeting in Johannesburg, South Africa, to provide information  about the survey and evaluation document request to PEPFAR country  and regional team officials also attending the annual meeting. We  received responses from all 31 PEPFAR countries and 3 regions with  fiscal year 2010 operational plans.", "Using a similar survey tool, we also conducted surveys of CDC and  USAID headquarters officials regarding program activities managed by  agency headquarters and listed in PEPFAR headquarters operational  plans for 2008 through 2010."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Survey Responses", "paragraphs": ["To analyze country and regional teams\u2019 survey responses, we made the  following assumptions regarding the survey responses:  If officials did not provide a response to the question \u201cIs this one of  your agency\u2019s fiscal year 2008-2010 country or regional operational  plans program activities?\u201d we included that implementing mechanism  in the analysis.

To determine which documents met  our definition of evaluation, we reviewed each of these documents and  categorized them as meeting the definition of evaluation or not, following  a set of decision rules. For example, we included data quality  assessments, costing studies that compared costs and explained cost  differences, and analyses of surveillance data pre- and postintervention.  We excluded surveillance studies that simply reported the results of a  surveillance activity (but did not link it to a specific program or  intervention); needs assessments, baseline studies, and situation  analyses; trip and site visit reports; and pre- and postevent (e.g.,  workshop) questionnaires or surveys.

Our PEPFAR evaluation  assessment tool was based on an assessment tool used for a prior GAO  report, which we updated using guidance on evaluation from USAID,  CDC, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  (OECD), and GAO. We piloted the assessment tool with three PEPFAR  program evaluation documents provided by CDC and USAID  headquarters officials and revised the evaluation assessment as  appropriate.

It typically assesses  program activities\u2019 conformance to statutory or regulatory  requirements, program design, and professional standards or  customer expectations.  \uf0b7  Outcome evaluation.

This is a form of outcome evaluation that assesses  the net effect of a program by comparing program outcomes with an  estimate of what would have happened in the absence of the  program.
