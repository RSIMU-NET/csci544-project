The organization has consistently overestimated its income and underestimated its expenses. Its budgets have recorded as income nearly $1 million in unpaid assessments owed by 30 member states. The budgets have also overestimated reimbursement payments for inspections conducted in member states with chemical weapons-related facilities. As of June, 2002, these states owed the organization more than $2 million. Furthermore, the budgets for 2000 through 2002 underestimated personnel expenses. The organization's inaccurate income and spending estimates contributed to a $2.8 million deficit in 2000 and a potential deficit of $5.2 million in 2002. Weak budgeting practices and budget deficits have affected the organization's ability to perform inspection activities as mandated by the Chemical Weapons Convention. The organization had to reduce the number of inspections it conducted in 2001 and plans to reduce the number it conducts in 2002. Although the organization and the State Department have taken some steps to address the budget problems, the organization has not developed a comprehensive plan to overcome its inherent weaknesses. Unless the organization improves its planning, budget shortfalls will continue to affect its ability to conduct inspections."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Chemical Weapons Convention, which entered into force in April 1997,  bans the development, production, acquisition, and use of chemical  weapons by member states and requires the elimination of those states\u2019  existing chemical weapons stocks.

The Executive Council,  consisting of 41 representatives from regionally distributed member states,  meets in sessions throughout the year to supervise the Secretariat\u2019s  activities. The Secretariat, headed by the Director-General, manages the  organization\u2019s daily operations, including implementing the inspection  measures of the convention and preparing the organization\u2019s annual  budgets and reports. About 60 percent of the Secretariat\u2019s authorized staff  level of 507 employees engages in the inspection-related activities  mandated under Articles IV, V, and VI of the convention. Specifically, to  verify compliance with Article IV, the Secretariat inspects declared  chemical weapons stocks and destruction facilities. To verify compliance  with Article V, it inspects and monitors the destruction and conversion of  chemical weapons production facilities. Under Article VI of the convention,  the Secretariat inspects commercial production facilities. As of July 2002,  the organization had conducted 1,210 inspections at the 5,066 declared  chemical weapons sites and facilities that fall under the convention\u2019s  purview.", "The Secretariat supports member states in their efforts to implement the  convention. It also encourages international cooperation and assistance  among the member states as mandated by Articles X and XI of the  convention.

The Secretariat also encourages economic and  technological developments in the field of chemistry by encouraging trade  and exchange of information among the member states.", "The organization\u2019s budget for calendar year 2002 is about $54 million.  Funding for OPCW operations comes primarily from the 147 member  states\u2019 annual contributions, which are based on the United Nations scale  of assessments. The other large source of funding is reimbursement  payments for inspections conducted under Articles IV and V of the  convention. As required by the convention, members states with chemical  weapons related\u2013facilities must reimburse the organization for its  inspection costs related to the destruction of chemical weapons (Article  IV) and the destruction of chemical weapons production facilities (Article  V). The State Department reports annually to Congress on U.S.  contributions to international organizations, including the OPCW.", "In early 2002, the United States and other member states to the convention  raised concerns that the organization was not fulfilling its mandate because  of a number of management weaknesses. According to the United States,  such weaknesses included mismanagement by the organization\u2019s then  Director-General, as well as his advocacy of inappropriate roles for the  organization\u2014such as attempting to interfere with United Nations  weapons inspections in Iraq.

Frequently, the  organization does not receive payments until several years after issuing the  invoices. According to State Department officials, the United States and  Russia have not made payments, in many cases, until several years after  receiving OPCW invoices, because both governments experienced  difficulties in identifying a funding source and obtaining appropriations.  These officials added that both governments are working to improve their  reimbursement records during 2002. As of June 2002, those states  possessing chemical weapons\u2013related facilities, including the United  States, owed OPCW more than $2 million in reimbursable inspection  expenses from the previous 2 years.

According to State  Department and OPCW officials, the Secretariat relies on states\u2019  destruction plans to calculate the number of inspections the organization  may conduct during the year. Chemical weapons possessor states cannot  always accurately predict when their destruction facilities will become  operational and what problems may arise once they do. Any change to the  schedule of a destruction facility\u2019s operations can affect the timing of  OPCW inspections and thus affect the organization\u2019s reimbursement  estimates.

We agree that monitoring activities at chemical weapons\u2013destruction  facilities account for most of OPCW\u2019s workload, and that to project this  workload, the organization has depended on plans submitted by  chemical weapons\u2013possessor states. Our report states that since 1997,  most OPCW inspection activities have taken place at chemical weapons  facilities. Our report also states that the Secretariat relies on possessor  states\u2019 destruction plans to calculate the number of inspections the  organization may conduct during the year. Chemical weapons\u2013  possessor states cannot accurately predict when their destruction  facilities will become operational and what problems may arise when  they do. However, in response to the State Department\u2019s comments, we  have included additional information in the report to clarify this point.  2. We identified the key reasons why OPCW underestimated staff costs  for calendar years 2000\u20132002, and included this information in the  report.   For example, our report states that as the result of a staff  reclassification and upgrade undertaken in 1999 and mandatory United  Nations salary increases, the Secretariat\u2019s personnel costs increased,  affecting the 2000, 2001, and 2002 budgets.  3. We agree that the OPCW encounters the same difficulties as other  international organizations with regard to the late payment of annual  dues, and that the United States and Russia have experienced  difficulties in paying their Articles IV and V inspection bills. We  included this additional information in the report.  4. We agree that the OPCW has lacked adequate liquidity to deal with its  cash shortages, and this has resulted in a curtailment of inspection  activity. We have made no change to the report, however, because this  is its major theme. We reported that weak budgeting practices and  budget deficits have affected the organization\u2019s ability to perform its  primary inspection and international cooperation activities, as outlined  in the Chemical Weapons Convention. 5. As explained in our report, the OPCW spent against budgeted income  based on inflated estimates of inspection activity. This budget shortfall  resulted in reduced inspections and international cooperation  activities. We do not believe that a change in our report is needed. 6. Our report clearly states that since 1997, most OPCW inspection  activities have taken place at chemical weapons facilities. Because of  its budget problems, the OPCW conducted only 57 percent of the  chemical industry inspections planned for 2001. As of June 2002, it had  conducted only 36 percent of these inspections planned for 2002. We do  not believe that a change in our report is needed. 7. We disagree that the State Department made every reasonable effort to  accommodate our requests for information and access to OPCW staff.  We were not allowed to hold meetings with representatives from  several key OPCW offices. The State Department failed to notify us of  any impending scheduling difficulties prior to our trip to The Hague in  May 2002. On our arrival, the Department made no effort to facilitate  meetings with the following offices: the Special Projects Division, the  Office of Internal Oversight, the Office of the Legal Advisor, the  Administration Division, the Verification Division, the Inspection  Division, the International Cooperation and Assistance Division, and  the Advisory Body on Administrative and Financial Matters.  8. This comment confirms that we were able to meet with only a few  select OPCW staff. It is unclear how the State Department concluded  that we were unable to identify specific questions to which answers  were not provided. Prior to our departure for The Hague in May 2002,  we provided State Department officials in Washington and at the U.S.  Delegation to the OPCW with five pages of detailed questions that we  planned to raise with OPCW officials. Many of these questions remain  unanswered. We also provided the State Department with a detailed set  of questions we planned to raise with representatives from other  member states.  9. We have updated our report to provide the most recent information on  OPCW initiatives currently under way. However, the State Department\u2019s  mosaic of measures does not represent an overall strategy or plan for  improving the organization\u2019s budgeting weaknesses. At best, it  represents only the first steps in addressing systemic weaknesses in the  OPCW\u2019s budgeting process.  10. We believe that our recommendation for an annual reporting  requirement to Congress is appropriate. Such reporting will help  establish a baseline for judging OPCW progress in achieving needed  reforms. In addition, this requirement will not impose an undue administrative burden on the Department, since it already provides  various reports to Congress on international organizations, including  the OPCW."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Beth Hoffman Le\u00f3n, Richard K.
