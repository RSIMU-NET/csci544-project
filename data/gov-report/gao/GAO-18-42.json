However, prior IT expenditures have produced failed projects. Recognizing the severity of issues, in December 2014 Congress enacted IT acquisition reform legislation (referred to as the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act, or FITARA). Among other things, OMB's FITARA implementation guidance requires covered agencies' chief acquisition officers to identify IT contracts for the CIOs to review and approve.", "GAO's objectives were to determine the extent to which (1) federal agencies identify IT contracts and how much is invested in them, and (2) federal agency CIOs are reviewing and approving IT acquisitions. To do so, GAO reviewed data on IT contracts from fiscal year 2016 at 22 agencies and compared agency actions to law and OMB guidance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Most of the 22 selected agencies did not identify all of their information technology (IT) contracts. The selected agencies identified 78,249 IT-related contracts, to which they obligated $14.7 billion in fiscal year 2016. However, GAO identified 31,493 additional contracts with $4.5 billion obligated, raising the total amount obligated to IT contracts in fiscal year 2016 to at least $19.2 billion (see figure).The percentage of additional IT contract obligations GAO identified varied among the selected agencies. For example, the Department of State did not identify 1 percent of its IT contract obligations. Conversely, 8 agencies did not identify over 40 percent of their IT-related contract obligations.", "Many of the selected agencies that did not identify these IT acquisitions did not follow Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) guidance. Specifically, 14 of the 22 agencies did not involve the acquisition office in their process to identify IT acquisitions for Chief Information Officer (CIO) review, as required by OMB. In addition, 7 agencies did not establish guidance to aid officials in recognizing IT. Until agencies involve the acquisitions office in their IT identification processes and establish supporting guidance, they cannot ensure that they will identify all IT acquisitions. Without proper identification of IT acquisitions, agencies and CIOs cannot effectively provide oversight of these acquisitions.", "In addition to not identifying all IT contracts, 14 of the 22 selected agencies did not fully satisfy OMB's requirement that the CIO review and approve IT acquisition plans or strategies. Further, only 11 of 96 randomly selected IT contracts at 10 agencies that GAO evaluated were CIO-reviewed and approved as required by OMB's guidance. The 85 IT contracts not reviewed had a total possible value of approximately $23.8 billion. Until agencies ensure that CIOs review and approve IT acquisitions, CIOs will continue to have limited visibility and input into their agencies' planned IT expenditures and will not be able to use the increased authority that FITARA's contract approval provision is intended to provide. Further, agencies will likely miss an opportunity to strengthen CIOs' authority and the oversight of IT acquisitions. As a result, agencies may award IT contracts that are duplicative, wasteful, or poorly conceived."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making 39 recommendations, including that agencies ensure that acquisition offices are involved in identifying IT and issue related guidance; and to ensure IT acquisitions are reviewed according to OMB guidance. OMB and 20 agencies generally agreed with or did not comment on the recommendations. One agency agreed with one recommendation, but disagreed with another. GAO believes this recommendation is warranted. One agency disagreed with two recommendations.

FITARA holds promise for improving agencies\u2019  acquisitions of IT and enabling Congress to monitor agencies\u2019 progress,  as well as for holding agencies accountable for reducing duplication and  achieving cost savings. In addition, with the enactment of FITARA, the  federal government has an opportunity to strengthen the authority of chief  information officers (CIO) to provide needed direction and oversight of  agencies\u2019 IT acquisitions, among other areas.", "We recently testified that, while agencies have made progress in  implementing the law, its further implementation is critical to improving IT  management. We have also noted that continued congressional  oversight of agencies\u2019 implementation of FITARA is essential to help  ensure that these efforts succeed.", "Among other things, FITARA requires CIOs of major civilian agencies to  review and approve IT contracts. With this in mind, you asked us to  review whether CIOs are approving IT contracts as required by this law.  Our objectives were to determine the extent to which (1) federal agencies  identify IT contracts and how much is invested in them, and (2) federal  agency CIOs are reviewing and approving IT acquisitions.", "Our review included the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and 22  of the 24 agencies covered by the Chief Financial Officers Act. We did  not include the Department of Defense because it is excluded from the  provision in FITARA requiring CIO approval of IT contracts. We also did  not include the Department of Homeland Security because we recently  issued a report on the department\u2019s implementation of FITARA.", "To determine the extent to which federal agencies identify IT contracts  and how much is invested in them, we requested that each of the 22  agencies provide us a list of their IT contract obligations for fiscal year  2016. Separately, we identified IT-related contracts from each of these  agencies using fiscal year 2016 data reported on USAspending.gov. We then compared these resulting lists of IT-related contracts to the agency- provided lists of contracts to determine which contracts the agencies had  not identified. We also reviewed other agency documentation, such as IT  acquisition policies and processes, as well as acquisition plans and  strategies. In addition, we interviewed the agencies\u2019 acquisition officials  and officials from the Office of the CIO to determine their processes for  identifying IT contracts.", "To determine the extent to which federal agency CIOs are reviewing and  approving IT acquisitions, we randomly selected 10 contracts at 10  agencies (100 total contracts) to review in depth. For each of the 100  selected contracts, we asked the associated agency to confirm that the  contract was IT-related and requested evidence of the CIO\u2019s or CIO  designee\u2019s review and approval. We compared the resulting  documentation to FITARA and OMB guidance to determine whether the  IT acquisitions had been appropriately reviewed and approved.", "We also reviewed agency documentation on IT acquisition processes and  procedures and compared it to the requirements in FITARA and OMB  guidance.

As a result, the Coast  Guard currently has a manual, paper-based health records  management process;  the tri-agency National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental  Satellite System, which was halted in February 2010 by the White  House\u2019s Office of Science and Technology Policy after the program  spent 16 years and almost $5 billion;  the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 (VA) Scheduling Replacement  Project, which was terminated in September 2009 after spending an  estimated $127 million over 9 years;  the Farm Service Agency\u2019s Modernize and Innovate the Delivery of  Agricultural Systems program, which was halted in July 2014 after  spending $423 million to modernize IT systems over 10 years; and  the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Healthcare.gov  website and its supporting systems, which were to facilitate the  establishment of a health insurance marketplace by January 2014, but  which encountered significant cost increases, schedule slips, and  delayed functionality.", "These failed or troubled projects often suffered from a lack of disciplined  and effective management, such as project planning, requirements  definition, and program oversight and governance. In many instances,  agencies had not consistently applied best practices that are critical to  successfully acquiring IT investments.", "To help address these ongoing challenges, in February 2015, we added  improving the management of IT acquisitions and operations to our list of  high-risk areas for the federal government. This area highlighted several  critical IT initiatives in need of additional congressional oversight,  including (1) reviews of troubled projects; (2) efforts to increase the use of  incremental development; (3) efforts to provide transparency relative to  the cost, schedule, and risk levels for major IT investments; (4) reviews  of agencies\u2019 operational investments; (5) data center consolidation; and  (6) efforts to streamline agencies\u2019 portfolios of IT investments. We noted  that implementation of these initiatives had been inconsistent and more  work remained to demonstrate progress in achieving IT acquisitions and  operations outcomes.", "In our February 2015 high-risk report, we also identified actions that OMB  and federal agencies needed to take to make progress in this area. These  included implementing FITARA and at least 80 percent of our  recommendations related to the management of IT acquisitions and  operations within 4 years. Specifically, between fiscal years 2010 and  2015, we made 803 recommendations to OMB and federal agencies to  address shortcomings in IT acquisitions and operations, including many  to improve the implementation of the previously mentioned six critical IT  initiatives and other government-wide, cross-cutting efforts.", "In February 2017, we issued an update to our high-risk series and  reported that, while progress had been made in improving the  management of IT acquisitions and operations, significant work still  remained to be completed. For example, as of May 2017, OMB and  federal agencies had fully implemented 380 (or about 47 percent) of the  803 recommendations. Nevertheless, in fiscal year 2016, we made 202  new recommendations, thus further reinforcing the need for OMB and  agencies to address the shortcomings in IT acquisitions and operations.

A detailed acquisition plan must address all of  the technical, business, management, and other significant  considerations that will control the acquisition. It should include, among  other things, a statement of need, cost, a plan of action, and milestones.

For example, officials from  OPM and NSF stated that their agencies only identified new IT contracts  and did not include contract modifications in their identified IT obligations,  making their submissions much smaller. NSF also noted that it only  identified IT contracts over $150,000.

While the 22  selected agencies reported $14.7 billion in IT obligations, 21 agencies did  not identify $4.5 billion as IT. Further, because the selected agencies did  not always identify their IT acquisitions, it is likely that agencies have  additional unidentified IT spending. Among other reasons, this shortfall  existed because many agencies did not ensure that their acquisition  offices were involved in the identification process, or provide clear  guidance for ensuring that IT was properly identified. Without proper  identification of IT acquisitions, agencies and CIOs cannot effectively  provide oversight of them.", "In addition, many of the selected agencies covered by FITARA did not  ensure the appropriate CIO review and approval of IT acquisitions that  were identified. The CIOs\u2019 review and approval presents an opportunity  for CIOs to increase visibility into agency IT and recognize opportunities  for improvement. However, the review and approval processes at 14 of  the selected agencies were not in full compliance with OMB  requirements, and only 11 of 96 randomly selected IT acquisitions were  appropriately reviewed and approved by the CIO. As a result, agencies  awarded IT contracts with a total possible value of $23.8 billion without  the required CIO review and approval. Consequently, CIOs had limited  visibility and insight into their agencies\u2019 IT, thereby increasing the risk of  entering into contracts that were duplicative, wasteful, or poorly  conceived."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making a total of 39 recommendations to federal agencies.", "We are making the following 3 recommendations to USDA:", "The Secretary of Agriculture should ensure that the office of the CAO  is involved in the process to identify IT acquisitions.

One other agency (Commerce) did not provide  comments on the report.", "The agencies\u2019 comments that we received, and our evaluations of them,  are summarized as follows:  In comments provided via e-mail on December 8, 2017, an OMB GAO  liaison did not agree or disagree with our findings. The official stated  that improved coordination and collaboration between CIOs, CAOs,  and senior procurement executives is critical, but represents a  significant cultural shift for most agencies. The official added that  OMB\u2019s Office of Federal Procurement Policy and Office of the Federal  CIO are working closely with agency CAOs and CIOs through the CIO  Council and CAO Council to discuss practices that agencies have  found helpful in achieving this cultural change.", "In comments provided via e-mail on November 18, 2017, a Senior  Advisor from USDA\u2019s Office of the CIO stated that the department  concurred with the findings in our report and had no additional  comments.", "In written comments, Education concurred with one of our  recommendations, which called for the department to ensure that the  office of the CAO is involved in the process to identify IT acquisitions.  However, Education did not concur with a second recommendation to  ensure that IT acquisition plans or strategies are reviewed and  approved according to OMB\u2019s guidance. The department stated that  the CIO reviews and approves IT acquisition strategies and plans as  part of his review and approval of IT investments. Specifically, the  department stated that its Departmental Directive OCIO: 3-108,  \u201cInformation Technology Investment Management\u201d establishes a  process for Office of the CIO review of IT acquisitions. Further, the  department stated that its Statement of Work Review Process adds  increased rigor to the CIO\u2019s review and approval by requiring all  acquisitions with IT elements to be submitted for Office of the CIO  review. Finally, the department stated that the Federal Student Aid  Investment Review Board charter documents the agency CIO as a  voting member. The department added the CIO is required to vote on  Federal Student Aid IT investments greater than $10 million. For  Federal Student Aid investments less than $10 million, the CIO is  provided the same level of insight as any other Investment Review  Board member, but has delegated the required vote to the Federal  Student Aid CIO.", "The IT Investment Management Directive, together with the  department\u2019s associated Lifecycle Management Framework  (referenced in the directive), indicates that the office of the CIO is to  review IT acquisition plans. However, the department\u2019s Statement of  Work Review Process does not require the review and approval of  acquisition plans. Instead, the process states that the office of the CIO  may review IT acquisition plans or strategies as one of several  possible documents, including statements of work or cost estimates.", "We also reviewed the Federal Student Aid Investment Review Board  charter and updated our report to reflect the department CIO\u2019s  involvement on the Federal Student Aid\u2019s Investment Review Board.  Based on this collective information, we updated our assessment of  Education\u2019s IT acquisition policy to reflect that the department had  partially met OMB\u2019s requirements. Nevertheless, the CIO\u2019s review of  the department\u2019s acquisition plans and strategies should be required,  rather than optional. Thus, we believe that our recommendation to  ensure that IT acquisition plans or strategies are reviewed and  approved according to OMB\u2019s guidance is still warranted. Education\u2019s  comments are reprinted in appendix VI.", "In written comments, Energy concurred with our two  recommendations directed to the department and stated that it has  activities underway to revise the department\u2019s acquisition policy.", "Energy added that it planned to address the recommendations by  December 31, 2017.

Labor detailed actions recently taken to implement each of the  recommendations and submitted documentation to support its  assertions. For example, the department submitted its Acquisition  Plan Preparation Guide and related acquisition plan templates to  show that it had issued guidance on identifying IT and required the  CIO review and approval of IT acquisition plans. Implementation of  these steps should help ensure appropriate oversight of IT  acquisitions. Labor\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix X.", "In written comments, State agreed with both of our recommendations.  In particular, regarding our recommendation to ensure that the office  of the CAO is involved in the process to identify IT acquisitions, the  department stated that senior State officials, including the CAO and  CIO, will develop a plan to ensure that the CAO monitors acquisition  activities and ensures acquisition decisions are consistent with all  applicable laws, such as FITARA.", "Further, regarding the recommendation to ensure that the  department\u2019s IT acquisition plans or strategies are reviewed and  approved according to OMB\u2019s guidance, State referenced its capital  planning and investment control guide that describes how a group  under the direction of the CIO reviews acquisition strategies during  the IT portfolio selection process. However, while the guide states that  the CIO is to approve the finalized IT portfolio, the guide does not  state that the CIO is to review the individual acquisition strategy  documents.

Specifically, regarding the recommendation to  ensure that the office of the CAO is involved in the process to identify  IT acquisitions, the department stated that it had addressed this  concern by implementing an updated version of the Acquisition and  Management of VA IT Resources directive in November 2017. In its  discussion of this directive, the department stated that the CIO, in  conjunction with the CAO, collaborates on all IT actions to ensure  FITARA compliance.", "While the directive clarifies the scope of VA\u2019s IT resources subject to  the oversight authority of the CIO, the directive does not indicate that  the office of the CAO is also involved in this process. It will be  important for VA to consider this recommendation as it continues to  implement FITARA requirements.", "Further, regarding the recommendation to ensure that IT acquisition  plans or strategies are reviewed and approved according to OMB\u2019s  guidance, the department stated that its Office of Strategic Sourcing is  currently developing processes and procedures necessary to  implement FITARA accountability and responsibilities for IT  acquisitions. The department also stated that the new acquisition  review process is scheduled to be implemented in the second quarter  of fiscal year 2018. VA\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix XII.", "In written comments, EPA stated it did not take exception to the  report\u2019s findings, conclusions, and recommendations. Regarding the  recommendation to ensure that the office of the CAO is involved in the  process to identify IT acquisitions, the agency stated that the policy  which implements interim guidance from the CIO to comply with  FITARA requirements is being updated. The agency added that future  policy revisions are to include the requirement that the CAO or a  designee will address this recommendation. EPA\u2019s comments are  reprinted in appendix XIII.", "In comments provided via e-mail on November 17, 2017, a program  analyst in GSA\u2019s GAO/Office of Inspector General Audit Management  Division stated that the agency concurred with the report and had no  additional comments.", "In written comments, NASA concurred with the three  recommendations to the agency and stated that it believes it has  already addressed them. Specifically, regarding the recommendation  to ensure that the Office of the CAO is involved in the process to  identify IT acquisitions, NASA asserted that its CAO is already  adequately involved. However, NASA did not provide evidence that it  fulfills this requirement. For instance, none of the processes  mentioned in NASA\u2019s comments support the assertion that the  acquisition office is involved in the identification of individual  acquisitions as IT. Further, the discussion of a form used to identify IT  acquisitions (NASA Form 1707) confirmed our original conclusion that  the officials identifying IT acquisitions are not in the acquisition office.", "In addition, NASA concurred with our recommendation to issue  specific guidance to ensure IT-related acquisitions are properly  identified, and stated that the agency currently has several policies  that provide such guidance. However, the policies named by the  agency (NASA Policy Directive 1000.5B, NASA Interim Directive  1000.110, NASA FAR Supplement 1804.7301, and NASA FAR  Supplement 1807.71) do not contain guidance on how the identifying  officials should determine whether an acquisition is IT-related. For  example, our review of NASA Form 1707 (required by NASA FAR  Supplement 1804.7301) showed that, while this form has instructions  on how to fill out its IT section, it does not contain guidance on how to  properly identify an acquisition as IT-related. In addition, NASA did not  provide an official policy on the role of the Center Functional Review  Team in the identification process.", "Further, NASA concurred with our recommendation to ensure that its  IT acquisition plans or strategies are reviewed and approved  according to OMB guidance and stated that, on September 27, 2017,  the CIO had issued a memo delegating the authority to review and  approve all IT acquisitions to the Center CIOs. However, as previously  mentioned, these delegations of authority need to be approved by  OMB, and NASA\u2019s delegation of IT acquisition authority had not been  approved by OMB, as required. In addition, NASA has not  demonstrated that the CIO\u2019s review and approval is occurring, as  none of the 9 acquisitions we randomly selected were reviewed and  approved by the CIO. NASA also stated that the CIO and Assistant  Administrator for Procurement review acquisition plans as part of their  participation in Acquisition Strategy Meetings. However, as we  mention in the report, not all IT contracts have acquisition strategy  meetings. NASA\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix XIV.", "In written comments, NRC did not concur with our recommendations  and stated that our draft report did not accurately reflect the agency\u2019s  process for reviewing and approving IT acquisitions. With regard to  our recommendation to ensure that the office of the senior  procurement officer is involved in the process to identify IT  acquisitions, the agency provided technical comments which stated  that acquisition office officials review acquisitions to ensure that IT is  properly identified. However, the agency did not provide supporting  documentary evidence to support this assertion. Lacking evidence  from the agency that would enable us to verify the implementation of  the process described in its comments, we maintain that our  recommendation is warranted.", "In addition, our draft of this report included a recommendation for  NRC to ensure that IT acquisition plans or strategies are reviewed  and approved according to OMB\u2019s guidance. NRC disagreed with this  recommendation and stated in its technical comments that the agency  does not require the development of acquisition plans for acquisitions  under $1 million. Thus, the NRC CIO does not review acquisition  plans under that threshold. The agency also stated that it has a  process for approving contract actions under the $1 million threshold.", "According to OMB guidance, in the absence of acquisition plans or  strategies, CIOs may approve the corresponding contract actions.", "Since NRC has a process for approving contract actions under the $1  million threshold, we revised the report to reflect that NRC has  processes in place for the review and approval of acquisition plans in  a manner consistent with OMB guidance and removed the associated  recommendation. NRC\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix XV and  its technical comments have been incorporated in the report, as  appropriate.", "In comments provided via e-mail on November 21, 2017, an NSF  liaison stated that the agency had no comments.", "In written comments, OPM concurred with our recommendation and  stated that the agency will review and update its policies and  processes as needed, so that they are aligned with OMB\u2019s guidance.  OPM\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix XVI.", "In written comments, SBA agreed with our recommendation to ensure  that the office of the CAO is involved in the process to identify IT  acquisitions. SBA noted that it is not required to have a CAO, but  agreed with having its acquisition workforce involved in IT  acquisitions. Based on the agency\u2019s comments, we modified the  associated recommendation to refer to the agency\u2019s senior  procurement executive rather than the CAO. SBA stated that it has  already begun to implement the recommendation for fiscal year 2018.  SBA\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix XVII.", "In written comments, SSA agreed with the three recommendations  that we had directed to the agency, stated that it had taken steps to  address the recommendations, and submitted supporting  documentation. In particular, SSA agreed with the recommendation to  ensure that the office of the CAO is involved in the process to identify  IT acquisitions and, in response, provided documentation that is to  detail the involvement of its Chief Financial Officer (who is the  agency\u2019s senior procurement executive) in identifying and approving  IT acquisitions. Implementation of these steps should help ensure  appropriate oversight of IT acquisitions.", "Regarding our recommendation to issue specific guidance to ensure  IT-related acquisitions are properly identified, SSA agreed with the  recommendation and stated that, according to its IT Acquisition  Approval Policy, the Chief Financial Officer notifies the CIO of IT  acquisitions by submitting acquisition plans to the CIO for approval.  However, while SSA\u2019s policy does support this method of CIO  notification, it does not provide guidance to assist in identifying IT.", "Further, SSA agreed with our recommendation to ensure that IT  acquisition plans or strategies are reviewed and approved according  to OMB\u2019s guidance and provided its September 2017 policy for  acquisition plan approval. After reviewing this policy and SSA\u2019s 2017  capital planning and investment control process, we updated our  report to show that SSA\u2019s processes satisfy OMB\u2019s requirements.  While SSA has made progress in implementing OMB\u2019s FITARA  requirements, the agency needs to demonstrate that the CIO\u2019s review  and approval are occurring, as 3 of the 10 acquisitions we randomly  selected were not reviewed and approved as required by OMB\u2019s  guidance. It will be important for SSA to consider this  recommendation as it continues to implement FITARA requirements.   SSA\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix XVIII. The agency also  provided technical comments, which we have incorporated in the  report as appropriate.", "In written comments, USAID agreed with our recommendation and  stated that the CIO and CAO are working together to (1) ensure all IT- related acquisition plans and strategies are reviewed and approved by  the CIO and (2) further communicate this requirement to the  acquisition planning stakeholders.

We did not include the Department of Defense  because it is excluded from the relevant provision in the Federal  Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) requiring CIO  approval of IT contracts. Further, we did not include the Department of  Homeland Security because we recently issued a report that reviewed the  department\u2019s implementation of FITARA, including the CIO\u2019s approval of  IT contracts. For specific information on the CIOs\u2019 review of individual IT  contracts, we focused on 10 agencies covered by FITARA that obligated  the most money to IT contracts in fiscal year 2016 (except the  Departments of Defense and Homeland Security).", "To determine the extent to which federal agencies identify IT contracts  and how much is invested in them, we requested that each of the 22  selected agencies submit a list of their IT contract obligations for fiscal  year 2016. We also requested the associated contract identification  number, obligation amount, and product and service code.", "In order to determine if the agencies gave us a full accounting of their IT  obligations, we used the Category Management Leadership Council\u2019s  categorizations of federal government spending by product and service  codes. In particular, we used the Council\u2019s list of 79 IT-related codes,  which is listed in appendix II, to identify fiscal year 2016 IT-related  contract obligations on USAspending.gov. For each funding agency, we  downloaded all contracts associated with the IT-related codes, such as  purchase orders, blanket purchase agreements, and government-wide  acquisition contracts. By comparing the resulting list of IT-related  contracts on USAspending.gov data to those provided by the agencies,  we were able to determine which IT-related contract obligations the  agencies had not identified. In doing so, we gave the agency credit for  identifying the entire IT contract if an agency identified any portion of the  contract (e.g., a contract modification). Consequently, the total of  obligations that agencies did not identify is likely higher than the totals we  were able to report.", "To assess the reliability of the USAspending.gov data, we reviewed  publicly available documentation related to the database, such as the  USAspending.gov data dictionary. We also reviewed the results of our  previous reports on USAspending.gov that had identified deficiencies in  the accuracy and reliability of the reported data. For both the  USAspending.gov and agency-supplied contract data, we tested the  datasets to look for duplicate records and missing data in key fields. We  also interviewed agency officials to corroborate the data. We found the  contract data from USAspending.gov, while sometimes incomplete, were  sufficient for our purpose of identifying IT contracts and demonstrating the  amount of obligations toward IT contracts. In addition, we found the  contract data provided by the agencies to be sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our reporting objectives. We used these data as evidence to  support our findings, conclusions, and recommendations.", "We also compared the product and service codes in the lists of IT  contracts provided by the agencies to the list of IT product and service  codes developed by the Category Management Leadership Council.  From this comparison, we determined which agency-submitted  obligations were associated with IT-related product and service codes  and which obligations were associated with non-IT codes.", "To determine the cause for any discrepancies between the agency- provided list of obligations and those found on USAspending.gov, we  asked each agency to describe and provide evidence of the Chief  Acquisition Officer\u2019s (CAO) involvement in the process for identifying IT  acquisitions for CIO review. We also collected both testimonial evidence  and documentation that described the identification process for potential  IT acquisitions. We analyzed these data from each agency to determine the involvement of the CAO and officials within the CAO\u2019s acquisition  office. We also determined the involvement of officials positioned outside  of the acquisition office, such as officials from the office requesting the IT  acquisition or from the Office of the CIO. As a result, we were able to  establish which officials were responsible for identifying acquisitions for IT  review at each agency. We also reviewed the submitted evidence to  determine whether the agencies provided guidance that clearly described  or defined IT to the identifying officials.", "To determine the extent to which federal agency CIOs are reviewing and  approving IT acquisitions, we first compiled a composite list of IT-related  contracts from fiscal year 2016 for each of the 10 selected agencies by  combining:  contracts associated with IT-related product and service codes from  USAspending.gov,  contracts associated with IT vendors from USAspending.gov,  contracts linked with major IT investments as listed on OMB\u2019s IT  Dashboard, and  contracts provided by agencies in response to our earlier request for a  list of IT contracts.", "We then randomly selected 10 IT contracts from each of the 10 agencies  on which to perform additional analysis (100 total contracts). For each of  the 100 selected contracts, we asked the associated agency to confirm  that the contract was, in fact, IT-related and requested evidence of CIO or  CIO designee review and approval of the contract\u2019s associated  acquisition. We compared the resulting documentation to FITARA and  OMB guidance to determine the extent to which the IT acquisitions had  been reviewed and approved. In order to receive full credit, agencies had  to provide evidence that the CIO had reviewed and approved the  acquisition plans or strategies for those IT acquisitions associated with  major IT investments. For IT acquisitions associated with non-major IT  investments, agencies had to provide evidence that the CIO, or a  designee that reports directly to the CIO, reviewed and approved the  acquisition plan or strategy. If agencies could not associate the IT  acquisition with a particular IT investment, we looked for evidence that the  CIO reviewed and approved the acquisition plan or strategy, since  FITARA does not state that the review and approval of these IT  acquisitions can be delegated.", "To determine whether agencies had processes in place to ensure the  review and approval of IT acquisitions, we reviewed agency  documentation on IT acquisition processes and procedures and  compared it to the requirements in FITARA and OMB guidance. We  also interviewed agency officials to clarify their respective processes and  policies. In order to receive full credit, agencies had to provide evidence  that they had a process in place that required the agency CIO to review  and approve IT acquisition plans or strategies with the exception of those  associated with non-major IT investments. Agencies received partial or no  credit if their processes had one or more of the following shortfalls: approval was not documented, delegated IT acquisition review and approval without OMB approval of did not provide the CIOs or their delegates oversight of all IT  involved the review of other documentation instead of the required  acquisition plans or strategies, or did not provide department CIO oversight over IT acquisitions at the  component level.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2016 to January 2018 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
