The Higher Education Opportunity Act required GAO to form a study group to examine options and implications in simplifying the financial aid process. The study group focused on (1) identifying ways to shorten the FAFSA and make it less burdensome to complete, (2) identifying changes to the statutory need analysis formula that would reduce the amount of financial information required by the FAFSA without causing significant redistribution of federal and state student aid, and (3) determining how any changes to the FAFSA and the statutory need analysis formula could be implemented.

Many participants proposed that relevant federal income tax data be directly transferred to the appropriate answer fields on each applicant's online FAFSA, an approach that the Department of Education (Education) plans to pilot for some applicants in January 2010. Such a change could decrease the amount and complexity of some of the financial questions on the application. In addition, many participants proposed changes to the design and contents of the form to clarify and streamline the application. Education has recently taken steps to shorten and reorganize the online form and has plans for further improvements. Participants said changing the federal formula to reduce required financial information would ease applicants' burden, but such a shift would likely result in some change in the distribution of aid. Many study group participants supported changing the need analysis formula to rely solely on a family's income and number of tax exemptions to determine aid eligibility. These changes would greatly reduce the number of complicated financial questions on the FAFSA. However, reducing the amount of financial information collected could change the distribution of federal, state, and institutional aid, prompting some concern about this approach. Education's recent legislative proposal to limit the formula to financial information available through tax forms would eliminate 26 financial questions, including those on assets. Participants said technology and public outreach efforts could improve the federal student aid application process, but successful implementation of changes hinges on the ability of federal and state agencies to address several challenges. While it is feasible to electronically transfer tax data directly from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to the FAFSA by using income data one year older than what is currently required, participants expressed some concern about the potential implications of such a change. Specifically, using older tax data might result in increased aid eligibility for some applicants whose data may not reflect their current economic needs. In addition, it may be more difficult for applicants who do not file taxes to provide sufficient documentation of their income from two years earlier. Education and the IRS have begun developing a plan to allow some applicants to electronically access their tax data when they apply for aid online. However, because taxpayers can submit their data as late as April 15, these data will not be available in time to accommodate most aid applicants. Many participants also called for linking state aid Web sites to the online federal application to mitigate the potential effects of federal formula changes on state aid. Education plans to offer this option to states in January 2010. In addition, participants said that efforts to simplify the application process should be accompanied by a public outreach strategy aimed at increasing knowledge of the availability of federal student aid. Education plans to undertake a public outreach campaign beginning in fall 2009."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Federal student aid is intended to play an integral part in fulfilling the  promise of greater academic access and success for less affluent students.  In fiscal year 2008, the Department of Education (Education) delivered  about $96 billion in federal student aid through grant, work-study, and loan  assistance to almost 11 million postsecondary students and their families.  Additionally, the College Board estimates that states and postsecondary  institutions provided approximately $37 billion in grant aid to students in  the 2007 to 2008 academic year. Completion of the Free Application for  Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the first step in securing federal financial  assistance, such as need-based grants and loans, for postsecondary  education. Federal aid is currently awarded based on a formula specified  in the Higher Education Act (HEA), as amended, that takes into account  such factors as income, assets, and tax expenses that students and their  families report. Many state and postsecondary institutions rely on the  information provided in the FAFSA and the federal statutory need analysis  formula to calculate their own aid awards. However, many experts, both  within and outside of government, have expressed concern about the  length and complexity of the FAFSA and the formula used to determine  aid eligibility, including the possibility that the application process itself  may discourage some students from applying. Education estimates that  nearly eight million college students never apply for federal aid, and  further contends that most of these students would be eligible for some  type of assistance if they applied. In addition, another study estimates that  of the students who did not apply for federal aid in the 2007 to 2008  academic year, 2.3 million would have qualified for Pell Grants, which are  targeted at low-income students. Although the potential impact of FAFSA  simplification on the number of applicants is unknown, many experts  presume that it would increase the number of applicants for federal  student aid. Despite a general consensus on the need to simplify and  streamline the student aid application process, there are varying views on  how best to achieve this aim.", "The Higher Education Opportunity Act required GAO to form a study  group to examine options and implications for simplifying the financial aid  process.

The panel, held on May 7, 2009, was composed of 20 experts from  the Departments of Education and Treasury, the Internal Revenue Service  (IRS), the Office of Management and Budget, the Congressional Budget  Office, postsecondary institutions, state executive offices of higher  education, and other experts, as required by the Higher Education  Opportunity Act. We selected these participants to represent a range of  views on the issues. See appendix I for the panel agenda and appendix II  for a list of participants. To gain a better understanding of issues related to  FAFSA simplification, we conducted interviews with officials from the  Departments of Education and Treasury and the Congressional Budget  Office. As part of the study group, we also interviewed representatives  from four higher education professional associations, seven state aid  agencies, and financial aid administrators from eight 2-year and 4-year  postsecondary institutions, including public, private not-for-profit, and  private for-profit institutions. In addition, we reviewed relevant federal  laws and regulations.

A student\u2019s need for financial aid is calculated using a  formula that subtracts a student\u2019s expected family contribution (EFC)  from the student\u2019s cost of attendance (COA). The EFC represents the  applicant\u2019s household financial resources that are considered available to  help pay for postsecondary education expenses and is calculated by  reducing the financial resources reported by applicants by certain  expenses and allowances, including state and other tax allowances.", "The factors used to calculate the EFC differ based on whether students are  classified as financially dependent on their parents or are independent.  For dependent students, the EFC is based on such factors as the student\u2019s  and parents\u2019 income and assets, as well as family size and whether the  family has other children enrolled in college. For independent students,  the EFC is based on such factors as the student\u2019s and, if married, spouse\u2019s  income and assets and whether the student has any dependents other than  a spouse, as well as the number of family members enrolled in college.", "The COA at a postsecondary institution includes tuition, fees, books, and  living expenses. If the COA is greater than the EFC, the difference between  the two represents the student\u2019s financial need. For example, if a  postsecondary institution has a COA of $10,000 and a student has an EFC  of $4,000, the student is eligible for up to $6,000 of federal need-based aid.

Education requires student aid  applicants to complete the FAFSA to collect students\u2019 data for the federal  need analysis formula. Although the primary purpose of the FAFSA is to  help Education distribute federal student aid, the form also accommodates  the needs of state and institutional aid programs that rely on the FAFSA  data for their own eligibility calculations. Prior to the creation of the  FAFSA, separate application forms were required to apply for various  types of federal, state, and institutional aid. As required by law, in 1992,  Education streamlined the student aid application process by  consolidating many of these forms into a unified FAFSA. Since then,  Education has undertaken periodic efforts to modify the form\u2019s design and  instructions and reduce data elements required of applicants. In addition,  several amendments to the HEA have also modified the FAFSA by adding,  for example, some new questions to the application.", "The 2009 to 2010 FAFSA consists of more than 100 questions that collect  information ranging from basic contact information to the current value of  assets. While less than half of the questions ask for financial information,  many of these questions require applicants and the parents of dependent  applicants to search for information located on tax returns as well as  bank, business, and investment records.", "While both online and paper versions of the FAFSA are available,  Education recommends that applicants file online to take advantage of  features that are not available on the paper form, such as skip-logic, which  allows applicants to skip questions that do not pertain to them. For  example, independent students are not asked for their parents\u2019 financial  information. The online FAFSA can also detect many errors prior to  applicants\u2019 submission and allow the applicant to make corrections. If  such errors are made on the paper form, they may take weeks to resolve,  delaying financial aid eligibility notification from Education. According to  Education, 98 percent of FAFSA applications are submitted online.  Education\u2019s student aid application processing cycle covers an 18-month  period. For example, applicants seeking federal aid for the 2009 to 2010  award year can submit a FAFSA from January 1, 2009, through June 30,  2010; however, most states and institutional aid programs have earlier  FAFSA deadlines.", "After Education processes an applicant\u2019s FAFSA, a report is sent to the  applicant or made available online.

Beginning in January 2010,  Education plans to improve instructions for the online FAFSA by  customizing the directions for each question based on information the  applicant has already provided. For example, if applicants enter their  marital status as single, the directions for each question will only provide  information pertinent to single FAFSA applicants.", "Tone. A few participants raised concerns about the tone of some  questions on the FAFSA\u2014saying they conveyed the wrong message to  applicants\u2014with one participant likening the application to a \u201cbeware of  dog\u201d sign instead of a welcome mat. For example, two participants  recommended rewording a question that asks if applicants will attend  college full-time or part-time, saying the question erroneously gives  applicants the impression that they must commit to one of these options in  order to apply for aid. However, this question is not used to determine  federal aid eligibility, and students do not have to make this decision until  they decide to enroll in college. Education has recently announced plans  to make changes to the online FAFSA that are designed to encourage  applicants to complete the application process. For example, in January  2010, Education plans to begin providing status indicators throughout the  application that will inform students of their progress in completing the  FAFSA.", "Skip-logic design.

Many participants offered recommendations to streamline the  FAFSA\u2019s contents.  A few participants suggested it would be helpful to  know the extent to which each question is used in determining eligibility  for federal, state, and institutional aid, since the value of information  gained from particular questions may be outweighed by the potential loss  of applicants due to the form\u2019s length. In addition, a few participants  recommended significantly shortening the FAFSA by removing all  questions not used to determine federal eligibility or financial need. For  example, some states consider the highest level of education an  applicant\u2019s parents have completed in targeting aid. However, some  participants expressed concern that eliminating such questions from the  FAFSA may cause states and colleges to develop additional forms in order  to get the data they need, which could in turn increase the overall burden  on applicants.

However, another participant suggested that colleges could collect this  information on the acceptance form students submit after receiving letters  of admission.

Because the formula is specified by federal statute, any  modifications would require legislative change. In discussing the need for  a simpler formula, several participants noted both the sheer number of  questions required to compute aid eligibility and the relative difficulty of  answering the financial questions. For example, one participant stated that  applicants have a far easier time answering questions about their marital  status than they do complicated questions about their assets. In particular,  participants discussed the merits of relying solely on a family\u2019s income\u2014 as measured by adjusted gross income (AGI) on federal income tax  forms\u2014and the number of tax exemptions to determine aid eligibility.  Similar proposals have been suggested previously. Such a shift would  greatly reduce the number of financial questions asked on the FAFSA\u2014 from more than 45 items to only 2\u2014which several participants said could  decrease the burden applicants face in completing the form. Nevertheless,  a few state aid administrators we interviewed said they saw no need to  change the current formula, and one added that the online form\u2019s skip- logic keeps the formula from being too burdensome for most applicants.", "Several participants also noted that a simpler formula could increase  applicants\u2019 awareness of their potential financial aid eligibility, and  perhaps increase the probability that they will go to college. For example,  if eligibility were determined solely by AGI and number of tax exemptions,  Education could publish a reference table that would allow students to  estimate their aid eligibility far earlier in the aid application process and  plan accordingly. Supplying applicants with earlier, more precise  information on eligibility could ultimately render the EFC unnecessary,  replacing the estimate of an applicant\u2019s or family\u2019s contribution to the cost  of education with a direct calculation of federal aid eligibility. Several  participants said that providing this type of early information could lead to  an increase in the number of financial aid applications submitted and  could encourage prospective students to apply for aid earlier in the cycle.", "In addition, participants said that reducing the financial information  required by the formula could in turn simplify the verification process for  financial aid administrators and applicants. If fewer financial items were  included in the formula, financial aid administrators would have to collect  and verify less information, and students selected for verification would  similarly be relieved of the burden of providing large amounts of  documentation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reducing the Amount of Financial Information Collected Could Result in Redistribution of Federal and State Aid", "paragraphs": ["Many participants said that although it would make the application  process easier on prospective students, reducing the amount of financial  information collected would likely result in some change in the  distribution of federal, state, and institutional aid, and would create new  winners and losers among the pool of aid applicants. Participants differed  in their assessment of whether the benefit of simplifying the formula  outweighed the potential cost in how federal aid is distributed among  applicants. For example, several participants were concerned that  eliminating asset information from the federal formula could result in  some applicants with high-value assets, such as large bank accounts or  trust funds, receiving more need-based aid\u2014such as Pell Grants\u2014than  they would under the current system. By potentially increasing the pool of  applicants who qualify for need-based aid, eliminating assets could result  in a smaller award amount for each Pell Grant recipient, as the maximum  amount of the grant depends on program funding and can change each  year.", "Several other participants, however, asserted that simplifying the formula  would be beneficial to applicants\u2014particularly those with the greatest  need and those who do not currently apply\u2014and is therefore worth the  potential cost of a shift in who receives federal aid. One participant\u2019s  research suggests that redistribution at the federal level would be  relatively small if the formula included only AGI and number of tax  exemptions. Specifically, she said she has found that approximately 85 to  90 percent of the variation in how the Pell Grant is awarded can be  explained by those two factors.", "According to participants, formula changes could also affect the  distribution of state and institutional aid to varying degrees, as many states  and institutions use the eligibility determinations from the FAFSA to  allocate their awards. Consequently, some participants were concerned  that\u2014much like with federal aid\u2014the removal of asset data from the  formula could increase the overall pool of eligible award recipients, and in  turn reduce the size of state and institutional financial aid awards available  to the neediest applicants. Some participants asserted that, while a change  in the formula may not greatly affect Pell-eligible students, state and  institutional need-based aid reaches into middle income ranges where the  implications may be far greater. One of these participants added that when  her state modeled what would happen to its aid program if it eliminated  assets from the eligibility formula, it found that expenditures would  increase by 12 percent. Because her state, like many others, has a program  in which all eligible applicants are entitled to receive aid, she explained  that such a change would result in the state either having to cover  additional costs or providing less money to each eligible student. For a few  participants, concerns over how formula changes might affect state aid  extended to the way in which family size is calculated. These participants  said that the number of tax exemptions is a poor measure of the  household size of an applicant or applicant\u2019s family. For example, some  children or other family members may live with an applicant but not be  listed as dependents on tax forms. However, other participants countered  that household size is already difficult to measure accurately under the  current formula. Several participants recommended further analysis on  how and to what extent applicants for both federal and state aid would be  affected by possible changes to the federal formula.", "Many participants stressed that, as federal aid does not cover the entire  cost of education for most students, the information needs of states and  institutions must be addressed in any plan to simplify the federal formula.  Two participants, however, maintained that it was not reasonable to  expect a single application to serve the needs of both the federal aid  program and programs from all states and institutions.", "Education\u2019s recent proposal to limit the federal formula to financial  information available through federal income tax forms would eliminate  26 financial questions\u2014including those on assets\u2014while retaining up to 20  financial questions that could all be answered with federal income tax  data. Although such a formula would decrease the burden on applicants,  one participant noted that it would not be concise enough to allow for a  simple reference table that prospective students could use to estimate aid  eligibility, as it would if it were limited to AGI and tax exemptions.  Proposed legislation passed by the House of Representatives and under  consideration in the Senate would simplify the student need analysis  formula by setting an asset cap for some aid programs and eliminating  assets from the need analysis of students whose families do not equal or  exceed the cap."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Participants Said Technology and Public Outreach Are Central to Implementing Changes, but Several Challenges Must Be Addressed", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Using IRS Tax Data to Populate the Electronic Form Is Feasible, but Presents Challenges", "paragraphs": ["While many study group participants noted the potential benefits of using  IRS data to populate the online FAFSA, some raised questions about the  feasibility and limitations of this approach.

However, Education officials said that because the tax calendar permits  most tax filers to file their income taxes for the prior calendar year as late  as April 15, the IRS could not make tax data electronically available to  student aid applicants until July. Some participants said that besides not  giving students sufficient time to plan for college costs, completing the  FAFSA this late would cause many students who plan to enroll in the fall  to be ineligible for aid from states and colleges.", "Acknowledging these limitations, Education officials said making the  electronic transfer of IRS tax data to the FAFSA feasible for fall college  applicants would likely require the use of income data that would be one  year older than the information Education currently uses to determine  financial aid eligibility. For example, under this scenario, an online  applicant who completed the FAFSA in March 2009 with the intent of  beginning college in August 2009 would be required to use income tax data  from 2007. As of July 1, 2010, the Higher Education Opportunity Act  authorizes the Secretary of Education to allow such older data to be used  in calculating applicants\u2019 aid eligibility.", "However, some participants expressed concern that by using older data\u2014 often referred to as prior-prior year data\u2014there is an increased risk that  the data may no longer reflect an applicant\u2019s current economic need. For  example, a college applicant could have a higher or lower income than  they did two years prior to attending college. Currently, school financial  aid officials can use professional judgment to change an applicant\u2019s  eligibility for aid upon an applicant\u2019s request, if they determine that there  are special circumstances. For example, applicants may request  professional judgment if they think their financial aid award does not  match their current economic need. Participants said that while  professional judgment may be used to increase or decrease an applicant\u2019s  financial aid, it is unlikely that applicants with an improved economic  status will ask their colleges to use professional judgment to decrease  their student aid award. Therefore, some participants said they think that  this will lead to increases in the numbers of applicants eligible for federal  and state aid. However, one participant noted that although the  implementation of using prior-prior year tax data would likely cause an  initial increase in applicants qualifying for aid, the cost might level off in  subsequent years.", "In addition, some participants expressed concern about the possible  effects of using prior-prior year data on applicants who are not required to  file income taxes. According to Education, about 6 percent of dependent  applicants\u2019 parents and about 13 percent of independent applicants who  completed the FAFSA in the 2008 to 2009 academic year did not file taxes.  One participant said that although it may be challenging for tax-filing  applicants who submit paper forms to find tax forms from up to 2 years  earlier, it would likely be particularly difficult for applicants who do not  file taxes to provide information on their income from 2 years earlier. A  few participants also expressed concern that Education had not offered a  plan to simplify the FAFSA for applicants not required to file income  taxes. Education\u2019s recent proposals do not address how changes would  affect these applicants.", "Education plans to begin providing applicants who both complete the  FAFSA and enroll in college between January 1 and June 30, 2010, with the  option of electronically transferring IRS data into the online FAFSA.  Education officials said this pilot is feasible since spring 2010 applicants  are required to use income tax information from 2008, which the IRS can  make available electronically. Education officials stated that during the  spring 2010 online FAFSA sessions, a question on the screen will ask if  applicants would like to electronically retrieve their IRS tax data\u2014or their  parents\u2019 data if they are dependents\u2014to answer financial questions. If the  applicants agree, they will be taken to an IRS Web site to confirm their  identity and obtain tax information that they can electronically transfer  into the appropriate FAFSA fields with a single push of a button. After  piloting this electronic transfer of tax data with spring applicants,  Education plans to make it available to all students who apply online for  aid between July and December 2010. Some study group participants said  Education\u2019s plan to pilot the electronic transfer of IRS tax data to the  FAFSA is a good initial step. Eventually, should Education elect to use its  new statutory authority to allow the use of prior-prior year data, the option  of electronically transferring IRS data into the online FAFSA could be  made available to all applicants year-round. One participant said that  additional piloting will be needed if Education ultimately decides to base  student aid eligibility on prior-prior year tax data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Technology and Public Outreach Could Help Streamline Applications and Increase Awareness of Federal and State Aid", "paragraphs": ["Many participants noted ways in which other technology could facilitate  additional improvements to the application process. One such possibility  would be in better linking the electronic applications for federal and state  aid. In 2001, Education began piloting a link between the online FAFSA  and New York\u2019s online state aid application. Currently, New York  residents who submit the online FAFSA are immediately provided a link to  the New York state aid Web site. Once New York applicants register and  receive a personal identification number from the state student aid office,  they may begin the online application process for state aid. The New York  online application is automatically populated with FAFSA data that are  sent electronically from Education. Applicants are asked to verify that the  populated information is correct, and may be asked for additional  information not collected by the FAFSA, such as their spouse\u2019s social  security number. Many participants said linking the FAFSA to other state  application sites could prevent the possible negative effects on state aid  programs of changing the federal need analysis formula by allowing states  to ask additional questions that are not available on the FAFSA. One  participant further noted that providing states with this option could make  it feasible for Education to eliminate all FAFSA questions not needed to  determine federal student aid eligibility without affecting the needs of  states. However, a few participants expressed concern that such a change  could lead to states adding a large number of additional questions on their  applications, jeopardizing Education\u2019s efforts to streamline the overall  application process for students. Other participants said that the cost of  setting up state online applications could create a barrier that would  prevent some states from linking to the FAFSA. Beginning in January 2010,  Education plans to offer this type of connection to all states, but the costs  to states\u2014and whether Education will provide financial assistance to  states to facilitate this change\u2014are not yet known.", "In addition to technological improvements, participants suggested that  efforts to simplify the application should be accompanied by a strategy to  increase public outreach efforts. For example, one study group participant  suggested that Education should reach out to students from middle school  through high school to help raise awareness about the affordability of  college and the process of applying for financial aid. Some participants  also suggested that Education provide monthly updates to states and  colleges by zip code about how many students have completed the FAFSA.  They said that this could help officials better target certain geographical  areas with low FAFSA completion rates to raise awareness about student  aid eligibility. Other participants suggested that Education send parents  with children in middle school through high school annual estimates of  their child\u2019s current eligibility for student aid. Education has announced its  intent to launch public outreach efforts that are designed to inform high  school students about the availability of federal aid for college beginning  in fall 2009."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["In creating an application process to distribute student aid, the federal  government has had to consider multiple competing demands to promote  college access and affordability: developing a formula precise enough to  ensure that resources reach the target population, collecting enough  information to assist states and institutions in administering their own aid  programs, and making the application process easy to use and transparent  for applicants. This last issue has proven particularly challenging, and the  complexity of the application form and underlying formula has become a  pain point for students and their families. The prospect that the  application itself may discourage students from applying for aid\u2014and  perhaps to college\u2014is especially troubling in light of current economic  conditions, as postsecondary access and affordability become more  challenging for some students. Our study group participants proposed  various options for mitigating some of the complexity in the application  process, and Education has proceeded with the early phases of its new  plan for simplification, which includes a public outreach component.  While most of these changes will result in streamlining the application  process and will not affect eligibility for federal, state, and institutional  aid, some\u2014 as is often true of policy and process changes\u2014come with  trade-offs. In particular, any changes to the formula used to compute  eligibility may result in new winners and losers among aid applicants.  Because the formula is complicated and no means of calculating  eligibility\u2014including the current method\u2014is a perfect prediction of  financial need, the effects of potential modifications on the pool of eligible  applicants must be weighed against the goals of federal student aid. The  issue to be considered is whether the benefit of simplifying the formula  outweighs the potential loss in the precision of how aid is targeted, and  depends not only on how great the overall change in the distribution of  federal aid is, but on how much various types of applicants gain or lose."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Education,  Department of Treasury, and the Internal Revenue Service for review and  comment.
