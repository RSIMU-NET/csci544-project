For example, in December 2012 GAO found that nationwide, in fiscal year 1997, states spent about 23 percent of TANF funds on services other than cash assistance, such as child welfare or child care. In contrast, states spent more than 66 percent of TANF funds for these purposes in fiscal year 2013, according to the most recent available data from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).", "TANF's accountability framework has limitations in both the approach used for measuring work participation and the information that is available on trends in services other than cash assistance. One program performance measure, the work participation rate, measures the extent to which states engage work-eligible TANF cash assistance recipients in work activities as defined by federal law. In May 2010, GAO found that states often relied on several options allowed in law, including credits for caseload reductions, to reduce the percentage of families they needed to engage in work to meet their work participation rate requirements. Thus, GAO concluded that the rate's usefulness as an indicator of TANF performance is limited. There are also no reporting requirements mandating performance information specifically on families receiving services other than cash assistance. To fully assess how funds are being used, GAO suggested Congress should consider ways to improve performance information when TANF is being reauthorized. In response to GAO's 2012 recommendation that HHS develop a detailed plan to revise reporting categories for TANF expenditures to provide a more complete picture on the use of TANF funds, HHS has taken steps such as revising its reporting form and accounting methodology for expenditure data. HHS has also cited a statutory provision as preventing it from reporting an improper payment estimate for the TANF program, but says it will seek statutory modifications to allow for such an estimate when the program is reauthorized.", "Incentives are often lacking for state and local TANF agencies to adopt and test promising approaches for moving cash assistance recipients from welfare to work, according to a November 2014 GAO report. State use of federal TANF funds for services that are not necessarily related to welfare-to-work activities may compete with funding for developing promising approaches for TANF cash assistance clients. Also, the federal work participation rate requirements may discourage states from pursuing approaches that incorporate longer-term education and training or treatment services, or from engaging hard-to-employ individuals in work activities as states can meet their work participation rate requirements by using the law's other options. In addition, little incentive exists for states to evaluate their TANF programs, and states are not required to do so, although these evaluations can provide useful information on program effectiveness. GAO recommended that HHS, in consultation with Congress, identify potential changes to address the lack of incentives to adopt and test promising approaches and submit a legislative proposal outlining those changes. HHS agreed with the recommendation but has not yet suggested program changes."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In its prior work, GAO recommended that HHS take steps to improve TANF expenditure reporting and identify potential changes to address the lack of incentives in the TANF program.

As you know, in 1996 the federal government made sweeping  changes to federal welfare policy by replacing the previous cash  assistance program with the TANF block grant to states. The Personal  Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996  (PRWORA), which created TANF, ended the Aid to Families with  Dependent Children (AFDC) program that had entitled eligible low-income  families to monthly cash assistance. Instead, TANF provides $16.5 billion  per year in fixed federal funding to states to operate their own welfare  programs within federal guidelines. This funding can help cover the costs  of cash benefits, administrative expenses, and services primarily targeted  to needy families; the amount does not vary according to the number of  cash assistance recipients. States are also required to maintain a  specified level of their own past welfare spending to receive all of their  TANF funds. In fiscal year 2013, states spent a total of $31.6 billion in  federal TANF and related state funds on cash assistance and other  services for low-income families, according to the most recent available  data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

As the number of families receiving cash  assistance declined, states shifted their TANF priorities to other forms of  aid, or non-cash services, which can include any other services meeting  TANF purposes. We found that states spent significant amounts of TANF  funds on services such as child welfare or child care.

Generally, states are held accountable for ensuring that at  least 50 percent of all families receiving TANF cash assistance and  considered work-eligible participate in one or more of 12 specified work  activities for an average of 30 hours per week. Our work has shown that  over the years, states have engaged about one third of families receiving  TANF cash assistance in federally-defined work activities nationwide.For example, according to HHS data, in fiscal year 2011\u2014the most recent  year for which data are available\u2014states engaged 29.5 percent of work- eligible cash assistance families nationwide in work activities.", "GAO-10-525.", "1.  decreases in the number of families receiving TANF cash assistance,  2.  state spending on TANF-related services beyond what is required,3.  state policies that allow working families to continue receiving TANF  4.  state policies that provide nonworking families cash assistance  outside of the TANF program.", "Beyond families\u2019 participation in the 12 work activities, the factor that  states have commonly relied on to help them meet their required work  participation rates is the caseload reduction credit. Specifically,  decreases in the numbers of families receiving TANF cash assistance  over a specified time period are accounted for in each state\u2019s caseload  reduction credit, which then essentially lowers the states\u2019 required work  participation rate from 50 percent. For example, if a state\u2019s caseload  decreases by 20 percent during the relevant time period, the state  receives a caseload reduction credit equal to 20 percentage points, which  results in the state work participation rate requirement being adjusted  from 50 to 30 percent. While state caseload declines have generally been  smaller after a 2006 law changed the base year for the comparison from  fiscal year 1995 to fiscal year 2005, many states are still able to use  caseload declines to help them lower their required work participation  rates. In fiscal year 2011, the most recent year for which data are  available, 49 of 50 states received a caseload reduction credit, including  22 that reduced their state\u2019s work participation rate requirement to 0  percent, according to HHS data.", "In addition, states\u2019 spending of their own funds on TANF-related services  has also been a factor in some states\u2019 credits. As stated previously,  states are required to spend a certain amount of their funds every year\u2014 their maintenance of effort (MOE) funds\u2014in order to receive all of their  federal TANF block grants. However, if states spend in excess of the  required amount (\u201cexcess MOE\u201d), they are allowed to functionally  increase their caseload reduction credits. We reported in May 2012 that  MOE, including expenditures by third parties, is playing an expanded role  in TANF programs due, in part, to some states\u2019 reliance on excess MOE  to help meet their work participation rates. We also noted that if states\u2019  MOE claims do not actually reflect maintaining or increasing service  levels, low-income families and children may not be getting the  assistance they need and federal funds may not be used in the most  efficient manner.", "In addition to the caseload reduction credits and excess MOE discussed  above, we also reported in May 2010 that some states have made  changes to their TANF programs that may affect which families are  counted in their work participation rates, such as providing assistance to  non-working families outside of the TANF program, as providing TANF  assistance to such families would lower states\u2019 work participation rates.  Given these various factors, we noted that the work participation rate  does not allow for clear comparisons across state TANF programs or  comparisons of individual state programs over time.

TANF allows  states to spend funds on a wide range of programs and services that  are not necessarily related to welfare-to-work activities as long as  these services support one of TANF\u2019s four statutory purposes.  Our  December 2012 report found that states spent significant amounts of  TANF funds on services such as child welfare or child care, and we  noted that state use of federal TANF funds for these and other  services can create tensions and trade-offs in state funding  decisions.additional resources needed for implementing more costly promising  approaches for TANF cash assistance clients may compete with other  allowable uses of TANF funds. Officials we interviewed for that report  whose three programs exclusively used TANF funds to implement  elements of promising approaches said that their programs had been  continuously funded for many years and that it would be difficult to  find funding for the programs were they beginning at that time.", "In our November 2014 report, we found that any", "The federal work participation rate requirements do not necessarily  serve as an incentive for states to implement certain promising  approaches, according to our interviews and prior work. Work  participation rate requirements can play an important role in  encouraging states to move TANF recipients into work. However, our  November 2014 review indicated some ways that current policies may  be discouraging states from engaging some TANF recipients with  complex needs and from providing an appropriate mix of activities.  Some experts and HHS officials we interviewed suggested that limits  on the amount of time that certain job readiness and training activities  may be counted toward a state\u2019s work participation rate may  discourage states from pursuing approaches that involve longer-term  treatment or education. In addition, our November 2014 report  included factors discussed above, such as the caseload reduction  credit, that have allowed states to reduce the percentage of families  they needed to engage in work to meet their work participation rate  requirements. We found that states may have less incentive to use  promising approaches to engage hard-to-employ individuals in work  activities as they can meet their work participation rate requirements  without them.", "Additionally, we reported in November 2014 that state and local TANF  agencies have little incentive to test the effectiveness of new  approaches. impact evaluations of their TANF programs, although these evaluations  can provide useful information on program effectiveness. We have  previously found that although HHS has a strong tradition of leading and  supporting rigorous welfare research, there are fewer incentives for states  to evaluate their programs under TANF than existed under the previous  welfare program with its evaluation and funding provisions. Indeed,  although HHS maintains an active research agenda, TANF agency  participation in some recent and ongoing HHS evaluations has been  limited. An HHS official we interviewed reported that engaging TANF  programs in evaluations of promising approaches is difficult because of  the administrative burden on the state or locality. Officials added that  HHS has no authority to require state agency participation in research  and evaluation and no dedicated funding to provide states or localities  incentives to participate.
