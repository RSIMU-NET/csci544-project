These weaknesses continue despite DOD requesting over $13 billion in fiscal year 2005--about $6 billion less than in fiscal year 2004--to operate, maintain, and modernize its existing duplicative business systems. The difference is more a reclassification of systems rather than an actual spending reduction. Some of the reclassifications appeared reasonable and others were questionable due to inconsistent information. At the same time, DOD reported an increase in the number of business systems to 4,150 as of February 2005--an increase of about 1,900 systems since April 2003. The duplicative and stovepiped nature of DOD's systems environment is illustrated by the numerous systems in the same business area. For example, DOD reported that it has over 2,000 logistics systems--an increase of approximately 255 percent since April 2003. DOD still does not have an effective departmentwide management structure for controlling business systems investments. Furthermore, DOD is not in compliance with the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003, which requires the DOD Comptroller to determine that system improvements with obligations exceeding $1 million meet the criteria specified in the act. Based on limited information provided by DOD, system improvements totaling about $243 million of obligations over $1 million were not reviewed by the DOD Comptroller in fiscal year 2004. Cumulatively, based upon DOD's reported data, system improvements totaling about $651 million of obligations over $1 million were not reviewed by the DOD Comptroller before obligations were made since passage of the 2003 act. The 2005 defense authorization act directed that DOD put in place a management structure to improve the control and accountability over business systems investments by placing more responsibility with the domains. At the same time, each military service has its own investment review process. Absent an integrated management structure that clearly defines the relationship of the domains and the military services, DOD will be at risk that the parochialism contributing to the current problems will continue."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) continues to confront pervasive  decades-old financial management and business system problems.

For fiscal  year 2005, the department received appropriations of about $417 billion.   Execution of DOD\u2019s operations spans a wide range of defense  organizations, including the military services and their respective major  commands and functional activities, numerous large defense agencies and  field activities, and various combatant and joint operational commands  that are responsible for military operations for specific geographic regions  or theaters of operation.  To support DOD\u2019s operations, the department  performs an assortment of interrelated and interdependent business  processes, including logistics management, procurement, health care  management, and financial management.", "Transformation of DOD\u2019s business systems and operations is critical to the  department providing Congress and DOD management with accurate and  timely information for use in the decision-making process.

As the Comptroller General  testified in November 2004, DOD\u2019s financial management deficiencies,  taken together, continue to represent the single largest obstacle to  achieving an unqualified opinion on the U.S. government\u2019s consolidated  financial statements. To date, none of the military services has passed the  test of an independent financial audit because of pervasive weaknesses in  internal controls and processes and fundamentally flawed business  systems.", "In identifying improved financial performance as one of its five  governmentwide initiatives, the President\u2019s Management Agenda  recognized that obtaining a clean (unqualified) financial audit opinion is a  basic prescription for any well-managed organization.  At the same time, it  recognized that without sound internal controls and accurate and timely  financial and performance information, it is not possible to accomplish the  President\u2019s agenda and secure the best performance and highest measure  of accountability for the American people. The Joint Financial Management  Improvement Program (JFMIP) Principals have defined certain measures,  in addition to receiving an unqualified financial statement audit opinion, for  achieving financial management success. These additional measures  include (1) being able to routinely provide timely, accurate, and useful  financial and performance information; (2) having no material internal  control weaknesses or material noncompliance with laws and regulations;  and (3) meeting the requirements of the Federal Financial Management  Improvement Act of 1996 (FFMIA).  DOD does not meet any of these  conditions. In September 2004, the DOD Comptroller identified 11 major  deficiencies that would affect the department\u2019s ability to prepare accurate  and reliable financial statements for fiscal year 2004.  Subsequently, the  DOD Inspector General issued a disclaimer of opinion on DOD\u2019s fiscal year  2004 financial statements, citing material weaknesses in internal controls  and noncompliance with FFMIA requirements.  Pervasive weaknesses in  DOD\u2019s financial management and related business processes and systems  have (1) resulted in a lack of reliable information needed to make sound  decisions and report on the status of DOD activities, including  accountability of assets, through financial and other reports to Congress  and DOD decision makers; (2) hindered its operational efficiency;  (3) adversely affected mission performance; and (4) left the department  vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse, as the following examples illustrate.", "Mobilized Army National Guard soldiers have experienced significant  problems getting accurate, timely, and consistent reimbursement for  out-of-pocket travel expenses.  These weaknesses were more glaring in  light of the sustained increase in mobilizations for Army National Guard  soldiers over the last 3 years.  Our case study units experienced a broad  range of travel reimbursement problems, including disputed amounts  for meals that remained unpaid at the end of our review and vouchers  that were submitted five or more times before being paid.  One of the  primary causes for these problems is rooted in the paper-intensive  process used by DOD to reimburse Army National Guard soldiers for  their travel expenses.", "Manual processes and nonintegrated pay and personnel systems affect  the Army\u2019s ability to generate timely active duty medical extension  orders and ensure that soldiers are paid correctly.  The current  stovepiped, nonintegrated systems are labor-intensive and require  extensive error-prone manual entry and reentry.   The inadequate  control resulted in some soldiers being removed from active duty status  in the automated systems that control pay and access to benefits,  including medical care.  In addition, because these soldiers no longer  had valid active duty orders, they did not have access to the commissary  and post exchange\u2014which allows soldiers and their families to  purchase groceries and other goods at a discount.  In one case we  reviewed, during a 12-month period, while attempting to obtain care for  injuries sustained from a helicopter crash in Afghanistan, one Special  Forces soldier fell out of active duty status four times.  During the times  he was not recorded in the system as being on active duty, he was not  paid and he and his family experienced delays in receiving medical  treatment.  In all, he missed payments for 10 pay periods\u2014totaling  $11,924.", "The processes and automated systems relied on to provide active duty  payments to mobilized Army Reserve soldiers are so error-prone,  cumbersome, and complex that neither DOD nor, more importantly, the  Army Reserve soldiers themselves could be reasonably assured of  timely and accurate payments. Specifically, at eight Army Reserve units  that we reviewed, 332 of 348 soldiers (95 percent) experienced at least  one problem with the active duty pay and allowances they were entitled  to receive. Many of the soldiers experienced multiple pay problems  associated with their active duty mobilizations. Some of the pay  problems soldiers experienced often lingered unresolved for  considerable lengths of time, some for over a year.  Of the $375,000 in  active duty pay and allowance problems identified in our case studies,  the majority were overpayments. We referred one individual for criminal  investigation because he did not mobilize with his unit, but he  erroneously received over $36,000 in active duty pay and did not report  this overpayment.

One of the key elements we have reported as necessary to  successfully execute the transformation is establishing and implementing a  business enterprise architecture (BEA).  In this regard, the department has  undertaken a daunting challenge to modernize its existing business  systems environment through the development, maintenance, and  implementation of the BEA, or modernization blueprint. As previously  noted, the department has designated six domain owners to be responsible  for implementing the BEA. The importance of developing, maintaining, and  implementing an enterprise architecture is a basic tenet of both  organizational transformation and IT management. Managed properly, an  enterprise architecture can clarify and help optimize the interdependencies  and relationships among an organization\u2019s business operations and the  underlying IT infrastructure and applications that support these  operations. Employed in concert with other important management  controls, such as portfolio-based capital planning and investment control  practices, architectures can greatly increase the chances that  organizations\u2019 operational and IT environments will be configured to  optimize mission performance. Our experience with federal agencies has  shown that investing in IT without defining these investments in the  context of an architecture often results in systems that are duplicative, not  well integrated, and unnecessarily costly to maintain and interface.", "A key element of an enterprise architecture is the development and  implementation of a transition plan.  According to relevant guidance and  best practices, the transition plan should provide a road map for moving  from the \u201cAs Is\u201d to the \u201cTo Be\u201d environment. An important step in the  development of a well-defined transition plan is an analysis that compares  the \u201cAs Is\u201d and \u201cTo Be\u201d architectures to identify differences. Options are  explored and decisions are made regarding which legacy systems to retain,  modify, or retire, and which new systems either to introduce on a  temporary basis or to pursue as strategic solutions.  Accordingly, transition  plans identify legacy, migration, and new systems, and sequence them to  show, for example, the phasing out and termination of systems and  capabilities and the timing of the introduction of new systems and  capabilities. Furthermore, they do so in light of resource constraints, such  as budget, people, acquisition/development process maturity, and  associated time frames.", "To improve DOD\u2019s control and accountability over business systems  investments, Congress included provisions in the Ronald W.

Of the $28.7 billion, our analysis showed that  about $13.3 billion was for business applications and related infrastructure.   Of the $13.3 billion, our analysis of the budget request disclosed that about  $8.4 billion was for infrastructure and related costs.  Business applications  include activities that support the business functions of the department,  such as personnel, health, travel, acquisition, finance and accounting, and  logistics.

Our comparison of the  fiscal years 2004 and 2005 budget requests disclosed that DOD reclassified  56 systems in the fiscal year 2005 budget request from business systems to  national security systems.

These two systems account for over  $2.6 billion of the $6 billion.", "However, our analysis of the 56 systems that were reclassified as national  security systems also identified instances for which the reclassification  was questionable.  For example, Base Level Communication  Infrastructure\u2014initiative number 254\u2014for several DOD entities was  shown as a national security system in the fiscal year 2005 budget request.   Our review of the fiscal year 2005 budget found that within the Air Force  there were numerous other initiatives entitled Base Level Communication  Infrastructure that were classified as business systems, not national  security systems.  The nomenclature describing these different initiatives  was the same.  Therefore, it was difficult to ascertain why certain initiatives  were classified as national security systems while others, with the same  name, were classified as business systems.  The following are examples of  the inconsistencies in the department\u2019s classification of systems.", "The Joint Total Asset Visibility System had been classified as a business  system since at least fiscal year 1999 and was identified as a business  system in the department\u2019s original list of 2,274 business systems in  April 2003 and is still being reported as a business system in the  department\u2019s systems inventory.  We found nothing in our review of the  fiscal year 2005 budget request that warranted a change in classification.", "The Transportation Coordinators\u2019 Automated Information for  Movements System II was identified as a business system in the  department\u2019s original inventory of business systems in April 2003 and  has been shown as a business system in the budget request since 1999.   Furthermore, BMMP currently reports it as one of the department\u2019s  business systems.  Yet it was reclassified as a national security system in  the fiscal year 2005 budget request even though its functionality had not  changed.

However, the section of the act relating to the DOD  Comptroller review does not apply to national security systems.  In our  May 2004 report, we noted that the Army reported that it obligated  almost $22 million for modernization of the system in fiscal year 2003  without its having been subject to review by the DOD Comptroller for  consistency with DOD\u2019s BEA.", "The Army\u2019s Global Combat Support System was reclassified as a  national security system in the fiscal year 2005 budget, even though it is  still being reported as a business system in the department\u2019s current  inventory.

DOD broadly defined a system as  a set of information resources organized for the collection, storage,  processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, disposition, display,  or transmission of information.  DOD\u2019s definition also clarifies what should  not be reported as a system.  For example, it excludes such things as  commercial office automation packages, information assurance initiatives,  and architecture initiatives.  Additionally, DOD\u2019s definition is aimed at  identifying all systems that would obligate $1 million or more for  modernization in any year of the department\u2019s 5-year defense plan.", "While DOD did not develop a specific definition of a business system, the  fiscal year 2005 defense authorization act subsequently provided a  definition.

The act states that such systems are to include financial  systems, mixed systems, financial data feeder systems, and IT and  information assurance infrastructure.  It is incumbent upon the department  to ensure that the definition specified in the act is used consistently  throughout the department and becomes the basis for entering information  into the DITPR.

We reported in May 2004 that the logistics domain had validated about  1,900 business systems but had not yet entered most of them into the  BMMP systems inventory.  Logistics domain officials informed us that they  completed that process and this increase was the result.  According to the  logistics domain officials, in making this determination, they considered an  initiative as a business system if it (1) is used by at least 50 people, (2) costs  at least $50,000 annually to operate, and (3) runs on a network.

We also reported in June 2004 that the fiscal year 2005 IT  budget request did not provide sufficient information to identify or justify  the specific current services and modernizations for 97 of the 113 systems.   Because, as noted in table 1, the funding is distributed to and controlled by  the military services and DOD components, the domains have minimal  influence over system funding.  As a result, DOD continues to fund the  modernization of systems that it intends to totally or partially replace.  As  discussed later, the new requirements and authorities included in the fiscal  year 2005 defense authorization act are aimed at ensuring that the domains  have a vital decision-making role in the control and accountability of the  investments being made in the department\u2019s business systems.", "While DOD has reported that its inventory of business systems has  increased by about 1,900, the department continues to struggle with  developing a comprehensive inventory.

There was also general agreement among the domains and  BMMP officials that systems owners were responsible for initiating the  $1 million review process. In essence, compliance was achieved via the  \u201chonor system,\u201d which relied on systems owners coming forward and  requesting approval.  However, the approach did not work.  During fiscal  year 2004, the number of systems reviewed was small when compared to  the potential number of systems that appeared to meet the obligation  threshold identified in the fiscal year 2004 budget request.

As we have previously reported,  the department has not demonstrated the ability to achieve these goals.   Given that the domains have been designated as being responsible for  reviewing and approving business systems investments, each of the  domains\u2019 investment review boards needs to provide effective management  oversight of each system project\u2019s performance and progress toward  predefined cost and schedule expectations as well as each project\u2019s  anticipated benefits and risk exposure.  Further, each investment review  board should also employ early warning systems that enable it to take  corrective action at the first sign of cost, schedule, or performance  slippages. Effective project oversight requires having regular reviews of the  project\u2019s performance against stated expectations and ensuring that  corrective actions for each underperforming project are documented,  agreed to, implemented, and tracked until the desired outcome is achieved.  We have previously recommended that until DOD assesses its current  systems, investment should be limited to   deployment of systems that have already been fully tested and involve  no additional development or acquisition cost;   stay-in-business maintenance needed to keep existing systems   management controls needed to effectively invest in modernized   new systems or existing system changes that are congressionally  directed or are relatively small, cost-effective, and low risk and can be  delivered in a relatively short time frame.", "DOD also has not acted upon this recommendation and continues to invest  billions of dollars without effective oversight and control.

To transform its culture, an effective performance management  system can be a strategic tool to drive internal changes and achieve desired  results by using specific key practices to create a clear link between  individual performance and organizational success.

At this  point, it is uncertain how they will be integrated with the roles and  responsibilities that are to be exercised by the domains.  Given the size and  complexity of the business systems and related operations transformation  endeavor, it is critical that the military services and domains are fully  integrated into one cohesive business system investment management  strategy.  However, it is not clear what specific role the military services  will play.  If the military services\u2019 efforts are simply viewed as one more  level of review, that would be counterproductive to the overall  transformation goals and objectives.  Absent guidance that clearly  articulates the relationship and the related roles and responsibilities of the  domains and military services, each will continue to have stovepiped  approaches to business systems investment management that result in  more duplicative efforts.

We also reviewed and  analyzed the DOD budget request for fiscal year 2004 to identify the  business systems investments that could be subject to the requirements of  the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003,  which requires the DOD Comptroller to review all financial system  improvements with obligations exceeding $1 million and determine  whether each improvement is in accordance with criteria specified in the  act.  To assess DOD\u2019s compliance with the act, we obtained and reviewed  obligational data on modernizations in excess of $1 million for business  systems for fiscal year 2004.  We compared the obligational data provided  by the military services and defense agencies with information obtained  from BMMP officials to determine if the modernizations were reviewed by  the DOD Comptroller as stipulated in the fiscal year 2003 act. We did not  review the accuracy and reliability of the obligational data reported by  DOD.  Given the department\u2019s previously reported problems related to  financial management, we have no assurance that the data provided were  complete, but the obligational data reported by DOD are the only data  available that can be used for determining the specific amount of  modernization funding spent on each business system.", "To augment our document reviews and analyses, we interviewed officials  from various DOD organizations, including the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense (Comptroller); the DOD CIO; and the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics).  We  conducted our work from August 2004 through February 2005 in  accordance with U.S. generally accepted government auditing standards.", "We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Secretary of  Defense or his designee.
