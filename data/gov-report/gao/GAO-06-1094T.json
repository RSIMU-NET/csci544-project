The deteriorating conditions threaten the progress of U.S. and international efforts to assist Iraq in the political and economic areas. In July 2006, the State Department reported that the recent upturn in violence has hindered efforts to engage with Iraqi partners and noted that a certain level of security was a prerequisite to accomplishing the political and economic conditions necessary for U.S. withdrawal. Moreover, the Sunni insurgency and Shi'a militias have contributed to growing sectarian strife that has resulted in increased numbers of Iraqi civilian deaths and displaced individuals. DOD uses three factors to measure progress in developing capable Iraqi security forces and transferring security responsibilities to the Iraqi government: (1) the number of trained and equipped forces, (2) the number of Iraqi army units and provincial governments that have assumed responsibility for security in specific geographic areas, and (3) the capabilities of operational units, as reported in unit-level and aggregate Transition Readiness Assessments (TRA). Although the State Department reported that the number of trained and equipped Iraqi security forces has increased, these numbers do not address their capabilities. As of August 2006, 115 Iraqi army units had assumed the lead for counterinsurgency operations in specific areas, and one province had assumed control for security. Unit-level TRA reports provide insight into the Iraqi army units' training, equipment, and logistical capabilities. GAO is working with DOD to obtain the unit-level TRA reports.

To support these goals,  the United States initially led, and later assisted, Iraq\u2019s political transition  from a dictatorship to a democratically elected government.

Over time, multinational force commanders assumed  responsibility in their areas for recruiting and training some Iraqi defense  and police forces. In October 2003, the multinational force outlined a  multistep plan for transferring security missions to Iraqi security forces.  The plan had the objective of gradually decreasing the number of coalition  forces in conjunction with neutralizing Iraq\u2019s insurgency and developing  Iraqi forces capable of securing their country.", "Citing the growing capability of Iraqi security forces, coalition forces in  Iraq began to shift responsibilities to Iraqi security forces in February 2004,  earlier than planned. According to the President, senior DOD officials, and  multinational force commanders, Iraqi forces were unprepared to assume  security responsibilities and responded poorly to a series of anti-coalition  attacks in April 2004. In western and central Iraq, insurgents attacked the  multinational force in Fallujah, Baghdad, Ar Ramadi, Samarra, and Tikrit,  while a radical Shi\u2019a militia, the Mahdi Army, launched operations to  dislodge multinational forces and occupy cities from Baghdad to Basra in  the south. Although some Iraqi forces fought alongside coalition forces,  other units abandoned their posts and responsibilities and, in some cases,  assisted the insurgency. MNF-I identified a number of problems that  contributed to the collapse of Iraqi security forces, including problems in  training and equipping them.", "In May 2004, the President issued a National Security Presidential  Directive, which stated that, after the transition of power to the Iraqi  government, DOD would be responsible for U.S. activities relating to  security and military operations. The Presidential directive established that  the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) would direct all U.S. government  efforts to organize, equip, and train Iraqi security forces. In the summer of  2004, MNF-I developed and began implementing a comprehensive  campaign plan, which elaborated and refined the original strategy for  transferring security responsibilities to Iraqi forces. In April 2006, MNF-I  revised the campaign plan and, in conjunction with the U.S. Embassy in  Baghdad, issued a new Joint Campaign Plan that contains the goal of  transitioning security responsibility from MNF-I to the Iraqi security forces  and government. Further details on the campaign plan are classified. In  late August 2006, the MNF-I Commanding General said that the United  States is helping Iraq build a force to deal with its current security threats  of international terrorism and insurgency. He noted, however, that the Iraqi  government is developing a long-term security plan to shape the type of  armed forces that the country will need 5 to 10 years from now."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Trends in Security Conditions", "paragraphs": ["Since June 2003, overall security conditions in Iraq have deteriorated and  grown more complex, as evidenced by increased numbers of attacks and  more recent Sunni/Shi\u2019a sectarian strife after the February 2006 bombing of  the Golden Mosque in Samarra.

Since 2003, enemy- initiated attacks have increased around major religious or political events,  including Ramadan and elections. Attack levels also follow a seasonal  pattern, increasing through the spring and summer and decreasing in the  fall and winter months. Overall, attacks increased by 23 percent from 2004  to 2005. After declining in the fall of 2005, the number of attacks rose to the  highest level ever in July 2006.  Total attacks reported from January 2006  through July 2006 were about 57 percent higher than the total reported  during the same period in 2005. These data show significant increases in  attacks against coalition forces, who remain the primary targets, as well as  civilians and Iraqi security forces. According to a June 2006 UN report, an  increasingly complex armed opposition continues to be capable of  maintaining a consistently high level of violent activity across Iraq.  Baghdad, Ninewa, Salahuddin, Anbar, and Diyala have been experiencing  the worst of the violence. Other areas, particularly Basra and Kirkuk, have  witnessed increased tension and a growing number of violent incidents. In August 2006, DOD reported that breaking the cycle of  violence is the most pressing immediate goal of coalition and Iraqi  operations.", "The security situation has deteriorated even as Iraq has made progress in  meeting key political milestones and in developing its security forces. Since  the CPA transferred power to the Iraqi interim government in June 2004,  Iraq has held an election for a transitional government in January 2005, a  referendum on the constitution in October 2005, and an election for a  Council of Representatives in December 2005 that led to the formation of a  new government in May 2006 (see fig. 2). However, according to the  Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the December 2005  elections appeared to heighten sectarian tensions and polarize sectarian  divides. According to a U.S. Institute of Peace report, the focus on ethnic  and sectarian identity has sharpened as a result of Iraq\u2019s political process,  while nationalism and a sense of Iraqi identity have weakened.", "Moreover, according to the Director of National Intelligence\u2019s February  2006 report, Iraqi security forces are experiencing difficulty in managing  ethnic and sectarian divisions among their units and personnel. In addition,  the DIA Director reported that many elements of the Iraqi security forces  are loyal to sectarian and party interests. According to DOD\u2019s August 2006  report, sectarian lines among Iraqi security forces are drawn along  geographic lines, with Sunni, Shi\u2019a, or Kurdish soldiers mostly serving in  units located in geographic areas familiar to their group. Moreover,  according to the report, commanders at the battalion level tend to  command only soldiers of their own sectarian or regional background.", "On August 7, 2006, MNF-I and Iraqi security forces began phase II of  Operation Together Forward. The operation is an effort to reduce the level  of murders, kidnappings, assassinations, terrorism, and sectarian violence  in Baghdad and to reinforce the Iraqi government\u2019s control of the city. On  August 30, 2006, the MNF-I Commanding General said that he was pleased  with the operation\u2019s progress, but that there was a long way to go in  bringing security to the neighborhoods of Baghdad.

State  noted that a baseline of security was a prerequisite for moving forward on  these fronts, which are essential to achieving the right conditions for  withdrawing U.S. forces. For example, Iraqi government efforts to foster  reconciliation have become more difficult with the increase in sectarian  divisions and violence during the spring and summer of 2006. According to  DOD\u2019s August 2006 report, security issues\u2014such as the attempted  kidnapping of a deputy minister and threats to personnel who work with  embassy teams\u2014have made some ministers reluctant to have U.S.  personnel visit them. The report also noted that the security situation in  some provinces has hampered interaction between U.S.-led Provincial  Reconstruction Teams and provincial leaders. Moreover, the UN reported  that the lack of security has hampered reconstruction efforts. The UN  reported that the diplomatic community remains under serious threat as  embassy staff have been abducted and killed and facilities attacked. The  UN noted that improved security is central to the normal ability of  international agencies to provide assistance to the government and people  of Iraq.", "As we reported in July 2006, the poor security conditions have also  hindered U.S. and Iraqi government efforts to revitalize Iraq\u2019s economy and  restore essential services in the oil and electricity sectors.

This figure is below the Iraqi  Oil Ministry\u2019s goal of 2.5 million barrels of oil per day and the pre-war level  of 2.6 million barrels per day. Over the same time period, electricity  availability averaged 5.9 hours per day in Baghdad and 10.7 hours  nationwide. Electricity output for the week was about 9 percent above the  same period in 2005. U.S. officials report that major oil pipelines continue  to be sabotaged, shutting down oil exports and resulting in lost revenues.  Current U.S. assistance is focused on strengthening the Strategic  Infrastructure Battalions, which are Ministry of Defense forces that protect  oil fields and pipelines. Major electrical transmission lines have also been  repeatedly sabotaged, cutting power to parts of the country. Security  conditions in Iraq have, in part, led to project delays and increased costs for  security services.

The party was founded in Iran  during the Iran-Iraq war and retains strong ties to Iran. According to  DOD, the Badr Organization received financial and material support  from Iran, and individuals from Badr have been implicated in death  squads. The Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq is one of  the two largest Shi\u2019a parties in parliament.

In many cases, according to DOD,  militias provide protection for people and religious sites, sometimes  operating in conjunction with the Iraqi police in areas where the Iraqi  police are perceived to provide inadequate support. According to a May  2006 DOD report, Shi\u2019a militias seek to place members into army and  police units as a way to serve their interests. This is particularly evident in  the Shi\u2019a dominated south where militia members have hindered the  implementation of law enforcement. Militia leaders also influence the  political process through intimidation and hope to gain influence with the  Iraqi people through politically based social welfare programs.

Iran also  has contributed to the increasing lethality and effectiveness of anticoalition  attacks by enabling Shi\u2019a militants to build improvised explosive devices  with explosively formed projectiles, similar to those developed by  Lebanese Hezbollah. Iranian support for Shi\u2019a militias reinforces Sunni  fears of Iranian domination, further elevating sectarian violence.", "According to the August 2006 DOD report, Sunni Arabs do not have  formally organized militias. Instead, they rely on neighborhood watches,  Sunni insurgents, and increasingly, al-Qaeda in Iraq. The rise of sectarian  attacks is driving some Sunni and Shi\u2019a civilians in Baghdad and in  ethnically mixed provinces to support militias.
