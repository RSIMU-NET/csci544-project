Based on mining of limited fiscal year 2001 and 2002 data provided by the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps, GAO identified about 27,000 transactions totaling more than $8 million in which DOD potentially reimbursed travelers for airline tickets paid for by DOD--not the travelers. Requesting reimbursement for items that the traveler knowingly did not pay for may be a crime that could result in imprisonment or a monetary fine, or both. GAO's subsequent tests of a nonrepresentative selection of 124 individuals who submitted 204 of these 27,000 transactions confirmed that DOD improperly paid 91 individuals almost $98,000 for 123 airline tickets DOD purchased with centrally billed accounts. Only 4 travelers voluntarily reimbursed DOD prior to GAO initiating the audit, even though typically, more than a year had passed since the improper payments. Several travelers submitted multiple claims for airline tickets they did not purchase, which could indicate intent to defraud the government. In 2003, the Air Force Audit Agency reported that this same problem existed at the Air Force and estimated that, if not corrected, this problem will cost the Air Force more than $6 million over 6 years.

GAO also determined that key internal controls did not provide DOD reasonable assurance that (1) airline tickets purchased and paid for with the centrally billed accounts were based on valid travel orders and (2) centrally billed account numbers were adequately protected against unauthorized use. To demonstrate weaknesses in DOD's system of internal controls, GAO submitted a fictitious travel order to a commercial travel office to obtain an airline ticket from Washington, D.C., to Atlanta, Ga. DOD issued GAO the airline ticket, established an obligation, and paid for the ticket without detecting the fictitious nature of the request. GAO also found instances where a lack of physical safeguards resulted in the centrally billed account numbers being stolen and used for personal gain. One DOD traveler stole a centrally billed account number to purchase over 70 airline tickets totaling more than $60,000, which he sold at a discounted rate to coworkers and their family members for personal travel. Because DOD disputed those fraudulent charges, DOD did not pay for those tickets. However, not all DOD units dispute unauthorized charges. As a result, DOD is vulnerable to paying for fraudulent charges on compromised centrally billed accounts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This report is the last in our series of reports on the Department of  Defense\u2019s (DOD) management of its various credit card programs.  In fiscal  years 2002 and 2003, we issued a series of testimonies and reports  addressing problems that the Army, Navy, and Air Force had in managing  individually billed travel card accounts.  These testimonies and reports  showed high delinquency rates and significant potential fraud and abuse  related to DOD\u2019s travel card program.  Due to these concerns, you asked us  to audit controls over the other major form of payment used by DOD for travel expenses\u2014centrally billed accounts.  In response to your request, we  first reported in October 2003 that internal control weaknesses over DOD\u2019s  centrally billed accounts have led to millions of dollars of improper  premium class travel and increased costs to taxpayers.  In our second  report on control weaknesses over the centrally billed accounts, issued in  March 2004, we further identified millions of dollars in airline tickets DOD  purchased that were unused and not refunded.  These two reports provided  examples of why DOD financial management is on our list of high-risk  areas, areas that are highly vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse.", "In light of these internal control problems, you asked us to perform  additional work on controls over the centrally billed accounts.   Specifically, you asked us to determine for fiscal years 2001 and 2002  whether (1) DOD improperly reimbursed travelers for the cost of airline  tickets paid using centrally billed accounts, (2) internal controls were  effective to prevent the commercial travel office (CTO) from issuing  unauthorized airline tickets on the basis of invalid travel orders, and   (3) other control weaknesses led to compromised and fraudulently used  centrally billed accounts.", "To achieve these objectives, we compared airline ticket purchases reported  by the Bank of America\u2014DOD\u2019s credit card bank\u2014to limited data provided  by the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps on travel vouchers that were filed  during fiscal years 2001 and 2002.  The purpose of the comparison was to  identify instances where voucher data indicated that DOD made improper  payments to travelers for airline tickets that DOD\u2014not the traveler\u2014had  purchased using DOD\u2019s centrally billed accounts.  We used only Army,  Navy, and Marine Corps travel voucher data because the Air Force voucher  data was not structured in a way that enabled us to analyze the type of  expenses claimed on a travel voucher.  After identifying a pool of about  27,000 improper payments, we tested a nonrepresentative selection of 124  Army, Navy, and Marine Corps travelers who submitted 204 travel vouchers  during fiscal years 2001 and 2002.", "We also evaluated the effectiveness of controls over airline ticket issuance  at one Air Force, one Army, one Marine Corps, one Navy, and one Defense  Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) location.  We selected these units  because they were among the largest dollar volume locations for airline  tickets purchased with centrally billed accounts during fiscal years 2001  and 2002.  For these units, we tested a statistical sample of airline tickets to  evaluate whether the design and implementation of internal control  procedures were effective in preventing airline tickets from being issued,  and paid for, on the basis of invalid travel orders\u2014that is, travel orders that  were not signed by the properly designated authorizing official.  Our  statistical sample test results can be projected as a whole to the five  locations at which we selected airline tickets to review.  They cannot be  projected to each location separately, to the individual service, or to DOD  as a whole.  To illustrate the vulnerability of the weaknesses in internal  controls over airline ticket issuance, we prepared a fictitious travel order  and submitted it to a CTO to test whether we could obtain an airline ticket  and whether DOD would create an obligation and pay for the ticket.  We  also performed data mining to determine whether DOD\u2019s centrally billed  accounts were compromised and used fraudulently for personal gain.   However, our work was not designed to identify, and we cannot determine,  the extent of potentially fraudulent and abusive activity.  Appendix I  provides further details on our scope and methodology.", "We requested comments from the Secretary of Defense or his designee on a  draft of this report.  We reprinted those comments in appendix II.  We  conducted our audit work from June 2003 through May 2004 in accordance  with U.S. generally accepted government auditing standards.

The travel card program includes both the  individually billed accounts\u2014accounts held and paid by the individual  cardholders\u2014and the centrally billed accounts.  In general, individual  cardholders use the individually billed accounts to charge  nontransportation travel-related expenses, while most DOD services and  units used the centrally billed accounts to purchase transportation  services, such as airline and train tickets, and to pay expenses incurred for  group travel.", "During fiscal years 2001 and 2002, DOD travelers charged more than  $7.1 billion in expenses to the travel card program, with about $2.8 billion  related to the use of the centrally billed accounts.  Unlike the actual credit  cards issued to individuals and some unit credit cards, there are no actual  credit cards for the centrally billed accounts used to purchase  transportation services.  Instead, Bank of America issues account numbers  to the government travel office (GTO) for use by the CTO\u2014under contract  with each DOD service or service location to provide travel services to  military and other DOD personnel\u2014to enable transportation charges on  these accounts.", "Responsibility for making travel arrangements and paying the expenses  associated with travel is shared between the DOD local components,  contractors, and DFAS\u2014the DOD component responsible for making  nearly all of DOD\u2019s payments.  The local travel-authorizing official or the  resource manager at the DOD component is responsible for determining  the necessity of travel, issuing the travel order, certifying the availability of  funds, and recording an obligation against a unit\u2019s appropriation.  The CTO  makes airline reservations, issues airline tickets and charges the centrally  billed account upon receipt of a signed travel order, and performs  reconciliation between tickets it issued and tickets charged on the Bank of  America invoice.  The CTO is responsible, in the reconciliation process, for  identifying each charge as being associated with a specific travel order.   Within each DOD component, the GTO is generally responsible for  reviewing the CTO\u2019s reconciliation, making the appropriate changes,  certifying or authorizing the Bank of America\u2019s invoice for payment, and  filing disputes with Bank of America for charges that the CTO did not  record as having issued.  After the CTO and GTO perform their monthly  reconciliation, the charges are sent to DFAS for payment.  Figure 1 shows  the design of the processes used to issue an airline ticket on a centrally  billed account and reimburse travelers for travel expenses, and explains  the roles of different offices in providing reasonable assurance that airline  tickets charged to these cards are appropriate and meet a valid government  need.", "Prior to paying the Bank of America invoice, DFAS is responsible for  verifying fund availability for each airline ticket presented on the invoice.   This process, known as prevalidation, involves DFAS checking each airline  charge against the services\u2019 accounting systems to determine that the travel  had been approved, and an obligation had been recorded, before approving  the corresponding charge for payment.  If an obligation exists for the travel  order but the amount is not adequate to cover the charge, DFAS is allowed  to increase the obligation up to $2,500 to pay for the ticket charge if DFAS  is in possession of a valid obligating document.  If an obligation has not  been recorded in the services\u2019 accounting systems, but a valid obligation  document exists, DFAS can also create an automatic obligation up to  $2,500 to pay for the ticket charge.  If an obligation needs to be created or  increased by more than $2,500, DFAS is required to notify the unit and  allow the unit 10 calendar days to record the obligation before DFAS is  allowed to create the obligation on the unit\u2019s behalf.", "At the conclusion of travel, the traveler is responsible for preparing his or  her DD Form 1351-2, a travel voucher form, within 5 working days after  completion of travel to claim reimbursement for official travel.  Travelers  are to enter all reimbursable expenses on their travel vouchers, and attach  all receipts for lodging expenses and for all other expenses over $75.  Even  if someone else prepares the voucher, the traveler is responsible for the  truth and accuracy of the information.  According to DOD\u2019s Financial  Management Regulation, when the travelers sign the form (and this  signature authority must never be delegated), they attest that the  statements are true and complete, and that they are aware of their liability  for filing a false claim.  The travel voucher the traveler signs contains a  bolded penalty statement that provides, \u201cthere are severe criminal and civil  penalties for knowingly submitting a false, fictitious, or fraudulent claim  (U.S. Code, Title 18, Sections 287 and 1001 and Title 31, Section 3729).\u201d", "The authorizing or approving officials review the travel claim for  appropriateness, then forward the travel claim to the voucher-processing  unit, which might be located at the unit or at DFAS.

The  weaknesses included inadequate travel voucher review, lack of  reconciliation between centrally billed account charges\u2014and payments for  those charges\u2014and travel claims, and differences in policies as to when an  airline ticket should be charged to an individually billed account as  opposed to a centrally billed account.

Because the travelers had not purchased most of the airline tickets we  tested, the travelers should not have requested reimbursements, nor should  DOD have paid the travelers for the cost of those tickets.  Requesting  reimbursement for items that the traveler did not pay for may violate the  False Claims Act and be punishable by imprisonment or a monetary fine, or  both.", "From the 27,000 potential improper travel claims, we tested a  nonrepresentative selection of 124 travelers to whom DOD made 204 travel  claim reimbursements that may have contained improper payments.  As  will be discussed further, the tests we performed on the nonrepresentative  selection of 124 travelers confirmed that DOD improperly paid 91 travelers  for 123 airline tickets.  As will be discussed in detail later, the 123 improper  payments included 109 payments that were made to 77 travelers who were  paid for airline tickets they did not purchase, and 14 payments in which  DOD purchased two airline tickets for the same travel.  Thirteen of the 77  travelers we identified submitted multiple travel vouchers requesting  reimbursements for the cost of airline tickets that they did not purchase,  which might indicate intent to defraud the government.  The remaining  improper payments were also potentially fraudulent if the traveler  intentionally filed false claims or kept the improper payments after they  realized that the payment was improper.  The other 64 travelers received  improper reimbursement for a single ticket.  One traveler admitted to us  that he knew DOD had improperly reimbursed him for two airline tickets  that DOD purchased for his travel in April 2002 and June 2002, but did not  notify DOD because he was waiting for DOD to request him to refund the  improper payments.  Most travelers we interviewed told us that they were  not aware that the government had paid them hundreds, and sometimes  thousands, of dollars for expenses that they claimed but did not incur.  In  many instances, the airline ticket receipt or invoice used to support the  travelers\u2019 claims contained the 16-digit centrally billed account number,  indicating that the airline tickets were paid for using the centrally billed  accounts.  Table 1 shows eight illustrative examples of the 77 travelers who  we identified in this review as submitting improper and potentially  fraudulent travel claims.", "The 8 travelers identified in table 1 did not notify DFAS after they had  received improper payments, and only 4 of the 77 travelers that we  determined had received improper payments voluntarily refunded the  improper payments.  The following provides detailed information on three  of the cases identified in table 1.", "Traveler number 1 was a GS-15 who submitted travel vouchers claiming  reimbursements for 13 tickets totaling almost $10,000 between August  2001 and May 2002.  The traveler told us that he did not notice that he  was paid for expenses he did not incur, even though in one instance,  DFAS overpaid the traveler more than $3,500 for one round-trip ticket  from Washington, D.C., to Singapore.  The traveler explained he did not  notice the improper payments because he typically maintained a high  balance in his bank account, and his wife paid all the bills.  In November  2003, after we requested information from the Navy related to the  traveler, the Navy Office of Medical Inspector General started an  investigation.  The Inspector General concluded that the traveler  violated DOD travel regulations in wrongfully claiming air  transportation expenses.  The investigation found that the traveler was  liable for seven improper reimbursements totaling about $7,300.  The  Navy Audit Service has expanded its review of the traveler for the  additional improper payments that we identified.  We referred this case  to DOD\u2019s Office of the Inspector General so that it can take any action it  deems appropriate, including referral of the matter to the relevant U.S.  Attorney for further consideration.", "Traveler number 2 is a GS-13 acquisition specialist who, between April  2001 and July 2003, submitted 12 claims totaling $6,800 for airline tickets  that were charged to the centrally billed accounts; that is, airline tickets  he did not purchase.  DFAS denied payments on five claims that were  submitted for travel in fiscal years 2001 and early fiscal year 2002, and  notified the traveler in writing that payment was denied because he did  not personally incur the airfare expense.  However, the traveler  submitted seven additional vouchers in late fiscal year 2002 and in fiscal  year 2003 requesting payments for airline tickets he did not purchase.   Although one more voucher was denied, overall, the traveler received  six improper payments totaling more than $3,600.  Despite being  repeatedly informed that his airfare was not a reimbursable expense, the  traveler indicated that the $3,600 in improper payments were honest  mistakes, and he believed that these tickets were charged to his  individually billed account, and should be claimed on the vouchers.", "In addition, the traveler took other questionable actions related to his  travel.  These actions included renting luxury vehicles, such as a  Lincoln Navigator and Mercedes Benz, while on official travel\u2014without  specific authorization to rent a luxury vehicle\u2014and using his  individually billed account to obtain government-rate tickets for his  family members, as the examples illustrate.", "The traveler scribbled his own name as the approving official for the  voucher to disguise the fact that he was approving his own voucher.   DOD policy requires that each travel voucher be reviewed for  accuracy and approved by the supervisor.  The signature of the  approving official certifies that the vouchers are accurate, and that  the expenses are to be paid.", "While on official travel the traveler rented luxury vehicles without  special authorization documenting the need for why he needed a  luxury vehicle.  For example, while on travel for 2 days in Atlanta in  July 2003, the traveler rented a Lincoln Navigator for more than $300.", "In August 2003, the traveler used his individually billed account\u2014a  government credit card\u2014to purchase government-rate tickets for  two family members to travel from Richmond, Va., to Frankfurt,  Germany, while the traveler was on official government travel for 9  days at that location.  By using the government credit card, the  traveler was able to obtain unrestricted coach class tickets for $546  per person, compared to an unrestricted coach class fare available to  the public of more than $2,800 per person. On that 9-day trip, the  government paid more than $1,000 for his rental car.  Further review  of the supporting documentation submitted with his travel voucher  indicated that the traveler rented a luxury class car\u2014Mercedes  Benz\u2014for use while at his travel destination.", "Although the traveler informed us that he was aware the individually  billed credit card assigned him was reserved for official government  use only, he used the card on several occasions to make purchases at  gas stations and restaurants when he was not on travel status and to  charge a recurring monthly rental fee of $30 for a musical instrument.", "As a result of our audit, in July and September 2003, the traveler  received collection vouchers demanding the traveler reimburse DOD  more than $2,100 for the overpayments on three vouchers.  As of  November 2003, DFAS had started collection payroll deductions to  collect the $2,100 in improper payments.  However, because DFAS did  not audit all the vouchers of this traveler, DFAS did not know that this  traveler had requested other improper and potentially fraudulent  claims.  Because of the potential fraud, we have also referred this case  to the DOD Office of the Inspector General.", "Traveler number 6 was a GS-15 who in February 2002 submitted a travel  voucher requesting reimbursement for an airline ticket that DOD, and  not the traveler, purchased using the centrally billed account.  The ticket  was an international ticket costing more than $3,700 for travel from  Huntsville, Ala., to Tel Aviv, Israel.  The traveler asserted that he did not  notice the more than $3,700 overpayment in his bank account until he  received a collection notice from DFAS in September 2003.  The traveler  stated that he assumed all his airline tickets were purchased with his  individually billed account.  We found that the policy at the duty station  where the traveler was assigned required that all airline tickets  purchased for travel within the continental United States be purchased  using the individually billed accounts, while international travel was  paid for using the centrally billed account.  We found that this policy  may have contributed to at least three other improper payments for  airfare related to international travel at this duty station.

Significant limitations related to DOD travel and transportation data files  prevented us from accurately estimating the total number and dollar value  of the improper payments DOD made for airfare paid with a centrally billed  account.  It is likely that these false claims are millions of dollars annually.   The Army, Navy, and Marine Corps provided us with files totaling about  $4.5 billion that contained their fiscal year 2001 and 2002 travel voucher  information, representing about half of the voucher payments DOD would  have made during this 2-year period.  These files identified the dates of  travel and type of travel expenses that were incurred and contained  separate fields for the traveler\u2019s per diem expenses and transportation  expenses.  By comparing the Bank of America centrally billed account files  containing the ticket price, passenger names, and travel dates, to the travel  voucher files, we were able to data mine for instances where DOD  purchased an airline ticket with the centrally billed accounts and the  traveler may have been improperly reimbursed for the cost of the airline  tickets.  Our analyses of the Army\u2019s, Navy\u2019s, and Marine Corps\u2019 fiscal years  2001 and 2002 travel and transportation expenses identified about 27,000  travel claims containing airline tickets valued at more than $8 million  during that 2-year period that were potentially improper.  Similarly, the Air  Force Audit Agency had reported that if not corrected, improper payments  would cost the Air Force $6.5 million over 6 years.", "To determine whether DOD improperly paid travelers for the airline tickets  purchased with centrally billed accounts, we tested a nonrepresentative  selection of 124 travelers who submitted 204 travel claims that may have  contained improper payments totaling about $154,000.  The 124 travelers  were chosen based primarily on the amount and frequency of the potential  improper payments.  We tested a nonrepresentative selection of travelers  because we could not obtain assurance that the data files provided by the  Army, Navy, and Marine Corps were complete and reliable.  Further, the Air  Force travel voucher data did not contain detailed information to enable us  to perform improper payment analysis.  Due to these data limitations, we  were unable to test a statistically valid sample of improper payments.   Consequently, we could not project the magnitude of the improper  payments.", "As shown in table 2, our tests, which consisted of comparing what the  travelers claimed on the travel vouchers to charges made to the centrally  billed accounts, confirmed that DOD made improper payments to 91  travelers for 123 travel claims containing airline tickets totaling almost  $98,000.  The 123 improper payments included 109 payments totaling  almost $85,000 that were made to 77 travelers who were paid for airline  tickets they did not purchase, and 14 payments totaling about $13,000 to 14  travelers in which DOD paid the traveler and the airline for two airline  tickets purchased for the same travel.  These instances could occur if, for  example, the airline did not have a record that the ticket was issued on the  centrally billed account when the traveler arrived at the airport, resulting in  the traveler having to purchase another ticket.  Emergency circumstances,  such as weather problems, have also resulted in travelers purchasing  another airline ticket even when a ticket was already purchased on the  centrally billed account.  Because DOD purchased two tickets for the same  travel, the centrally billed ticket was typically unused and not refunded.   The remaining 32 travelers did not submit improper or potentially  fraudulent claims.", "Our testing also determined that 15 of the 77 travelers had refunded DOD  almost $15,000 for 17 improper payments prior to our audit.  Only four  travelers notified DFAS\u2014and made restitution\u2014on the improper payments  prior to our audit even though typically more than a year had passed since  the improper payment.  Eleven other travelers made restitution after DFAS  detected the overpayments based on postpayment audits DFAS  performed\u2014that is, audits it conducted after payments had been made.  In  addition, on the basis of findings from our audit, DOD collected almost  $43,000 from 46 travelers for 63 additional improper airfare payments.  As  shown in table 2, DOD is in the process of recovering 43 improper  payments totaling more than $40,000 that we identified.  We referred the  27,000 potentially improper payments to DOD for further review.", "Further evidence exists that DOD improperly reimbursed travelers for the  cost of a substantial number of airline tickets purchased with centrally  billed accounts in the portion of DOD\u2019s travel and transportation expenses  that we did not analyze, either because the data were not provided, or the  data were not in the format to allow analysis.  For example, the Air Force  did not provide data in a format that would help us identify instances in  which the Air Force reimbursed travelers for the cost of an airline ticket  purchased with a centrally billed account.  Our work indicated that the Air  Force did not have a uniform policy as to whether a ticket should be  charged to the centrally billed accounts as opposed to the individually  billed accounts.  This could create confusion and expose the Air Force to  an even higher risk than the other services, which provided us with usable  voucher data of improper payments.  While the other military services  typically use the centrally billed accounts to purchase airline tickets, Air  Force officials told us that the Air Force uses both types of accounts to  purchase airline tickets.  Further, work performed by the Air Force Audit  Agency in 2003 on a sample of travel vouchers filed at 40 Air Force  locations found that the Air Force inappropriately reimbursed travelers for  142 airline tickets totaling almost $82,000 that were purchased with the  centrally billed accounts.  The Air Force Audit Agency projected that, \u201cThis  condition, if not corrected, will result in the Air Force inappropriately  reimbursing individuals at least $6.5 million\u201d over the next 6 years.

However, we determined that many  approving officials did not conduct adequate reviews of the travel vouchers  and the supporting documentation before authorizing the vouchers for  payment.  Many of the airline receipts submitted as supporting  documentation for improper claims clearly showed that the airline ticket  was purchased using the centrally billed accounts.  In these instances, if the  approving officials had conducted careful review of the travel vouchers and  supporting documentation, the official would have noted that the traveler  was not entitled to the travel reimbursement.  Further, the reviewing  officials should have been knowledgeable about local and component  policy that called for the use of centrally billed accounts to purchase the  airline tickets that were claimed as a reimbursable expense on the  vouchers.", "In addition, DOD travel and transportation systems do not contain edit  checks (system controls) to help detect false claims and prevent improper  payments when the first line of defense\u2014the approving official\u2019s review of  the travel voucher\u2014does not detect the false claims.  Specifically, DOD\u2019s  current travel order, ticket issuance, and travel voucher systems are not  integrated, and DOD has not implemented other control procedures to  compare key data in the different systems to help detect false claims  overlooked in the travel voucher review process.  Further, DFAS officials  informed us that post audit reviews, which are designed to detect  erroneous voucher payments, were not conducted by all of the disbursing  centers for the payments being audited.  Thus, DOD has not established, or  effectively implemented, compensating controls to detect improper  payments in instances where the approving officials fail to detect false  claims made on a travel voucher.  If DOD had designed such a system, DOD  would be able to detect instances where the traveler submitted a claim for  an airline ticket purchased using a centrally billed account.  These  weaknesses in the design of internal controls prevented DOD from  detecting claims for reimbursement that travelers should not have claimed.", "The failure of DOD systems to detect and prevent improper payments is  exacerbated by the fact that the primary performance measure DOD uses  to monitor the effectiveness of the centrally billed account program is  whether DFAS pays the Bank of America invoices within 30 days of their  receipt.  According to DOD officials, DOD has not established a  performance measure to monitor the accuracy of payments.  For example,  DOD does not have a measure to determine whether centrally billed  account payments\u2014and the related payments for airline tickets claimed on  the travel vouchers\u2014are accurate.", "DOD officials informed us that the Defense Travel System (DTS), which is  currently under development, will include a capability to routinely match  travel vouchers to tickets issued through the centrally billed accounts.

Requiring  airline tickets purchased with centrally billed accounts to be issued based  on valid travel orders is the first step in preventing DOD from purchasing  airline tickets that are not for official government business.  However, the  CTOs at the locations we visited informed us that DOD had not provided  them with a list of approving officials, or these officials\u2019 signature cards, to  aid in determining the validity of the travel orders.

Additionally, we estimate that we did not have reasonable  assurance that 3 percent of airline ticket transactions were not properly  issued because DOD could not provide us a copy of the travel order  authorizing the travel.

As mentioned, DOD did not design control  procedures to validate travel order authenticity before issuing tickets on  the centrally billed accounts.  The fact that our tests at these locations  could not confirm that tickets charged to the centrally billed accounts were  supported by travel orders signed by individuals with delegated authority  to do so further buttressed our concern that the lack of internal controls  might expose DOD to increased risk of fraud and abuse.", "At least two options exist for DOD to determine that an authorized  individual signed the travel order before issuing a ticket using the centrally  billed accounts.  One method involves using an electronic travel  authorization system to restrict travel approval to individuals who are  authorized to do so, and prevent travel orders from being approved by  individuals who are not.  DOD has told us that the Defense Travel System,  now under development, has these controls; however, as previously  discussed, the system will not be fully operational until fiscal year 2006.  In  the interim, some DOD locations we visited had implemented electronic  travel authorization systems to generate travel orders.  However, they did  not always have security controls in place to provide assurance that access  to these systems was restricted to individuals who had delegation of  authority to approve travel orders.  For example, a system administrator of  one of the systems used by the Marine Corps Reserves to issue travel  orders informed us that he sometimes gave approval authority to  individuals who requested access through phone calls or e-mail.  Without a  rigorous process for determining that only individuals who have the proper  delegation of authority receive access, the organization did not have  assurance that only authorized individuals have access to travel  authorization capability.", "Another method of validating the authenticity of a travel order would be to  provide the CTOs copies of, or access to, the delegation of authority to  approve travel orders.  The CTO could use this list to verify that the  approving official had the authority to authorize the travel.  Some CTO  officials informed us that it would not be practical to validate every travel  order prior to issuing the airline tickets because of the number of tickets  they issue every day.

However, we estimated that the five locations  we tested statistically did not have effective compensating controls to  obtain reasonable assurance that the tickets paid for with a centrally billed  account were for authorized travel.", "To provide reasonable assurance that DOD only pays for expenses that  have been properly authorized, the Department of Defense appropriations  act for fiscal year 1995 required DOD to develop a plan to match  disbursements to corresponding obligations before making payments.   Matching payments with corresponding obligations provides assurance  that funds are spent in accordance with the purposes and limitations set by  Congress, and that fraudulent disbursements or erroneous payments are  detected prior to payments.  The process of determining whether an  obligation exists prior to payments is referred to as prevalidation.  DFAS  prevalidates airline tickets charged to centrally billed accounts by verifying  that an obligation for the travel order that authorized the airline tickets on  the Bank of America\u2019s invoice had been created in a DOD component\u2019s  accounting system.  By verifying that an obligation exists before making  payment, the prevalidation process identifies instances where obligations  have not been established.  DOD officials overseeing the centrally billed  credit card program informed us that they rely on prevalidation to be a  compensating control because, as mentioned previously, the CTOs do not  validate the travel order before charging a ticket to the centrally billed  account.  If implemented properly, prevalidation would provide DOD  reasonable assurance that each airline ticket charged to the centrally billed  accounts was authorized by a valid travel order.  An effective way of  implementing prevalidation is for DOD to determine, prior to paying the  Bank of America invoice, whether transactions that fail prevalidation fail  because of a clerical or other error, or whether the travel order was not  valid.", "However, the method in which DOD implemented prevalidation decreased  its effectiveness in identifying unauthorized and potentially fraudulent  airline tickets and preventing payments for these tickets.  Specifically, DOD  did not require that research be conducted on airline ticket transactions  that failed prevalidation.  Although some DOD units, such as a number of  Navy units, require that DFAS return all airline ticket transactions that  failed the prevalidation test to the units that created the travel order so that  an obligation can be recorded, this is not a DOD-wide practice.  DOD\u2019s  Financial Management Regulation allows DFAS to record a new  obligation, or increase an existing obligation, up to $2,500 for transactions  that failed prevalidation if DFAS possesses a valid obligating document.   The Financial Management Regulation defines a valid obligating  document to include a travel order.  However, as discussed previously, the  CTOs do not determine the validity of these travel orders, and our testing  demonstrated that in about 82 percent of sampled airline ticket  transactions there was not evidence available indicating that the approving  official had the authority to authorize the travel.  Thus, if a traveler  provides the CTO a travel order, DFAS does not perform additional work to  determine the validity of the travel order.  Consequently, DFAS does not  have reasonable assurance that the obligation it created based on the travel  order the CTO provided was approved by someone who has the authority  to authorize the travel.", "Being aware of this flaw in the design of the prevalidation process, we  tested a statistical sample of 96 airline tickets issued at the five locations to  determine whether, in the absence of well-designed controls, an obligation  existed at the time of prevalidation to confirm that the travel order was a  valid order.  On the basis of the results of our statistical sampling, we  estimate that there is not reasonable assurance in about 48 percent of the  airline ticket transactions that an obligation existed at the five locations  prior to when the airline tickets were prevalidated for payment.", "As shown in table 4, we estimate that in 30 percent of airline ticket  transactions, the five locations\u2014primarily the Army and Air Force\u2014were  not able to provide evidence supporting when the obligations were  recorded.  Additionally, in an estimated 18 percent of airline ticket  transactions, while the date of the recording of the obligation was  provided, the obligation was established after the Bank of America invoice  was prevalidated.  In our statistical sample, we repeatedly requested the  military services to provide this evidence over a 6-month period.

Examples of how to validate  the authenticity of travel orders include the following:  An electronic travel authorization process that limits approval of  travel orders to designated officials.

Our assessment covered the following:   whether DOD improperly reimbursed travelers for the cost of airline  tickets paid using centrally billed accounts,   whether internal controls were effective to prevent the CTO from  issuing unauthorized airline tickets on the basis of invalid travel orders,  and   whether other control weaknesses led to the centrally billed accounts  being compromised and fraudulently used."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Determine Whether DOD Improperly Reimbursed Travelers for Tickets DOD Purchased Using the Centrally Billed Accounts", "paragraphs": ["To determine whether DOD improperly reimbursed travelers for airline  tickets that DOD\u2014not the travelers\u2014paid for using the centrally billed  accounts, we reviewed prior audit reports from DOD\u2019s Office of Inspector  General and DOD\u2019s various audit agencies and interviewed DFAS officials.   We also obtained from Bank of America databases of fiscal years 2001 and  2002 airline ticket transactions charged to DOD\u2019s centrally billed travel  card accounts.  The databases contained transaction-specific information,  including ticket fare, ticket number, name of passenger, date and  destination of travel, and number of travel segments in each ticket.  We also  requested that the services provide us with databases containing travel  voucher data in sufficient detail, broken down by the type of expense, such  as per diem, transportation expense, and other miscellaneous expense.   To  identify the pool of potential improper payments we compared the  transportation expense data obtained from the services\u2019 voucher data to  the Bank of America\u2019s data on airline tickets purchased using the centrally  billed accounts to identify instances where  DOD might have made  improper reimbursements to the travelers for airline tickets they did not  purchase.  Then to confirm whether the payments were improper we tested  a nonrepresentative selection of 124 travelers from the Army, Marine  Corps, and Navy who submitted 204 travel vouchers.  The 124 travelers  were selected primarily based on the amount of the potential improper  payments and the frequency with which the travelers submitted potential  improper payments.", "We were not able to select a statistical sample of potential duplicate  payments because of the limitations in the data DOD provided us.  These  limitations also prevented us from identifying all potential improper  payments or to estimate their magnitude.  Specifically, although the Army,  Navy, and Marine Corps provided us with travel voucher data, weaknesses  in DOD\u2019s financial management systems mean that these services cannot  provide assurance that the travel voucher data they provided us contain  complete data on fiscal years 2001 and 2002 vouchers.  Further, we were  not able to obtain assurance that the services accurately coded all airfare  payments claimed on the travel vouchers as transportation expenses and  not as other miscellaneous expenses.  Finally, the Air Force did not provide  us with data in the format we requested.  Consequently, we were unable to  analyze Air Force data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Evaluate Effectiveness of Internal Controls Over Airline Ticket Issuance", "paragraphs": ["To assess whether internal controls were effective to prevent the CTO from  issuing unauthorized airline tickets on the basis of invalid travel orders, we  obtained an understanding of the travel process by reviewing DOD\u2019s  financial and travel regulations.  We visited two Army units, three Navy  units, three Air Force units, and two Marine Corps units to confirm our  understanding of the travel process.  We also interviewed DOD officials at  the GTOs and representatives of the CTOs to obtain an understanding of  the process used to issue tickets, perform reconciliation between Bank of  America invoices and CTO\u2019s records, file disputes, and make payments to  Bank of America for the centrally billed account invoices.", "We tested a statistical sample of 96 airline ticket transactions to determine  whether (1) the CTO issued airline tickets only on the basis of valid travel  orders and (2) DOD paid for airline tickets on the basis of valid travel  orders.  The population from which we selected our airline ticket  transactions for testing was the set of airline ticket transactions charged to  the centrally billed accounts at five locations during fiscal years 2001 and  2002.  The five locations comprise one Air Force, one Army, one Marine  Corps, one Navy, and one DFAS location.  The locations were selected  based on the number and amount of airline tickets charged to the centrally  billed account activities.  Because our objective was to test controls over  airline ticket purchases, we excluded credits and miscellaneous debits  (such as fees) from the population of airline ticket transactions.", "For each transaction sampled, we requested that DOD provide us with the  travel order, travel voucher, travel itinerary, delegation of authority to  approve travel order, obligation document, reconciliation package, and  other related supporting documentation.  Based on the information DOD  provided, we assessed whether the travel order was signed by the properly  designated official before an airline ticket was issued on the travel order,  and whether an obligation was created for the airline ticket in the services\u2019  accounting system before the Bank of America invoice was prevalidated.   For those transactions for which DOD was unable to provide us with  supporting documentation to demonstrate that the travel order was  approved by a properly designated authorizing official, or that an obligation  existed, we considered the transaction to have failed the proper issuance  or proper payment test, respectively.  The results of the samples of these  control attributes can be projected to the population of airline ticket  transactions at these five locations, but not to individual services or  locations, or to DOD as a whole.", "With this statistically valid probability sample, each transaction in the  population had a nonzero probability of being included, and that  probability could be computed for any transaction. Each sample element  was subsequently weighted in the analysis to account statistically for all the  airline ticket transactions in the population, including those that were not  selected. Because we followed a probability procedure based on random  selections, our sample was only one of a large number of samples that we  might have drawn.  Since each sample could have provided different  estimates, we express our confidence in the precision of our particular  sample's estimates as 95 percent confidence intervals (e.g., plus or minus 7  percentage points).  These are intervals that would contain the actual  population value for 95 percent of the samples we could have drawn.  As a  result, we are 95 percent confident that each of the confidence intervals in  this report will include the true values in the study population.  All  percentage estimates from the sample of airline transactions charged to the  centrally billed accounts have sampling errors (confidence interval widths)  of plus or minus 10 percentage points or less.  Table 6 summarizes the  results of our testing.", "Because of the potential impact of a weak internal control process, we  conducted additional investigative work to determine the significance of  those control weaknesses.  Specifically, we designed a test to determine if  someone who did not work for DOD could obtain an airline ticket from a  CTO using on a fictitious travel order and without entering a DOD facility.   We also wanted to test whether DOD would authorize payment for an  airline ticket requested in this manner.  To perform this test, we completed  a DOD travel order using fictitious names for the traveler and approving  official.  We then called a DOD CTO from a telephone not associated with a  government facility requesting a round trip airline ticket from Washington,  D.C., to Atlanta, Ga., and faxed the CTO the travel order we generated.   Several days before our scheduled travel the CTO notified us that the ticket  had been issued.  On the day of the scheduled flight, we went to the airline\u2019s  ticket counter at the airport to pick up a boarding pass.  We then obtained  and reviewed the CTO\u2019s reconciliation for the Bank of America invoice  containing the ticket and DFAS payment records to determine whether an  obligation was recorded.
