GAO found that, from 2001 through 2016, FDA issued letters asking sponsors to provide such information for a majority of the more than 62,000 medical device submissions that it reviewed. Sponsors may formally disagree with the request on the grounds that it is not the least burdensome method needed for FDA to review the submission. For example, sponsors appealed FDA decisions internally to agency management 63 times from 2013 through 2016, and of these, FDA identified 33 such appeals in which the sponsor raised an issue related to least burdensome requirements. FDA agreed or partially agreed with the sponsors in 11 of these appeals. Medical device industry representatives noted that these appeals may not fully represent the number of such disagreements, because applicants are generally concerned that an appeal would damage their relationship with FDA and potentially negatively affect future device applications.", "FDA provided staff training that was specifically dedicated to addressing the least burdensome requirements from 1997 through 1999. Since 1999, FDA has not offered a course dedicated to the least burdensome requirements, but has incorporated related concepts into other training programs, such as in a training mandatory for most new reviewers. In response to the 21st Century Cures Act, enacted in 2016, FDA is providing new least burdensome training to all relevant employees, and said that 80 percent had received the training as of October 2, 2017. Although FDA did not specifically evaluate the effectiveness of past training on least burdensome requirements, it is implementing an evaluation of all device-related training, including the new least burdensome training. It also plans to complete a required audit of training on least burdensome requirements by June 2018.", "FDA has not specifically evaluated implementation of the least burdensome requirements. However, in response to broader evaluations, such as an independent assessment of its medical device review process, the agency is in the early stages of developing processes that may improve its requests for additional information. For example, FDA plans to conduct an audit of letters requesting additional information. FDA is developing the audit's methodology and expects it will assess whether the agency's process was followed. However, due to their early stage, the extent to which these efforts will allow FDA to assess implementation of the least burdensome requirements is unclear. In 2002, FDA stated that it planned to periodically assess the implementation of the least burdensome principles, and federal internal control standards identify the importance of performance metrics for such assessments. However, the agency has yet to develop performance metrics to do so. Until such measures are developed and used, FDA will not be able to evaluate whether it effectively and consistently applies a least burdensome approach in its medical device reviews."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making one recommendation that FDA develop and use performance metrics to evaluate the implementation of the least burdensome requirements.

Making this determination represents a substantial investment of time and  resources for both FDA and the device sponsor, generally the  manufacturer. For example, in 2014, FDA reviewed about 4,100  submissions from sponsors seeking to market their medical devices, and  each review ranged from an average of 125 days for lower-risk devices to  an average of 330 days for higher-risk devices. In making its  assessment, FDA relies on the sponsor to provide supporting data at the  time of its initial premarket submission and may thereafter request  additional data in the course of the review to obtain sufficient evidence  supporting the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. However,  any request for additional information has the potential to impose undue  burden on the sponsor and delay the review of the device, and sponsors  may opt to formally disagree with the necessity of the requested  information.", "Given the resource investment involved in getting a medical device to  market, as well as the public health need, efforts have been made to  streamline the decision-making process without compromising scientific  integrity or FDA\u2019s ability to protect the public health.

For certain  types of premarket submissions, federal law requires FDA to utilize the  \u201cleast burdensome\u201d means possible in certain elements of the review  processes of medical devices. FDA has laid out broad principles in  guidance interpreting how those statutory provisions apply throughout its  reviews.

Under this process, the medical device sponsor must submit an  application that includes\u2014among other things\u2014full reports of  investigations, typically including clinical data, providing reasonable  assurance that the new device is safe and effective. The PMA  process is the most stringent type of premarket review. A successful  application results in FDA\u2019s approval to market the device. From 2001  through 2016, medical device sponsors submitted 651 PMA  applications, and FDA approved for marketing 506 of those  submissions.

Under this process, the medical device sponsor must notify FDA at  least 90 days before it intends to market a new device and  demonstrate to FDA that the new device is substantially equivalent to  a predicate device, and therefore does not require a PMA. For most  510(k) notifications, clinical data are not required and substantial  equivalence will normally be determined based on comparative  descriptions of intended device uses and technological  characteristics, and may include performance data. A successful  510(k) submission results in FDA\u2019s clearance to market the device.  From 2001 through 2016, medical device sponsors submitted 61,439  premarket notifications and FDA cleared 51,028 devices for market.  (See fig. 2.)", "During premarket review under both the PMA and 510(k) processes, FDA  and the medical device sponsor may engage in an interactive process. To  start, there may be a pre-submission meeting between FDA and the  sponsor, during which the parties discuss the upcoming review and try to  resolve potential obstacles for approval or clearance. Then, FDA receives  the premarket submission, makes a determination to accept or not accept  the submission, and assigns a reviewer. In making its assessment  whether to approve, or clear, a submission, FDA relies on the sponsor to  provide supporting data as part of the submission. However, the agency  can request additional information in the course of the review in order to  make a determination of reasonable assurance of safety and  effectiveness, or of substantial equivalence. This additional information  can be obtained through informal interactions, such as a phone call or  email. Alternatively, for more significant issues, FDA may make a more  formal request for additional information, known as a deficiency letter in  the case of a PMA application and additional information (AI) letter for a  510(k) notification. FDA will issue such requests if the submission lacks  significant information necessary for FDA to complete its review, and the  agency will request the sponsor amend the submission to provide the  necessary information regarding the device.", "If a sponsor disagrees with an FDA regulatory decision concerning a  medical device submission, including a CDRH employee\u2019s decision to  request additional information or a significant decision regarding approval  or clearance of a medical device, it can take multiple actions.

FDA officials  explained that while they had customer reaction evaluations for trainings  for at least 24 years, they started evaluating training participant learning  with the Reviewer Certification Program starting in 2010.", "FDA is in the process of implementing a training evaluation model, which  includes various levels of evaluation, from assessing participant response  to the training to evaluating its impact on the agency. As of 2017, FDA  reported it was evaluating training programs to determine participant  learning and preparing to evaluate whether that learning changed  participant behavior. Officials told us they anticipate beginning to conduct  evaluations that assess agency impact in fiscal year 2018, and they plan  to have the model completely implemented for all trainings by fiscal year  2020. FDA currently evaluates its Reviewer Certification Program to  determine participant learning, and though the least burdensome  requirements are not specifically addressed in the Reviewer Certification  Program evaluation materials FDA provided to us, they did include  questions on topics related to least burdensome requirements.", "In addition to its current training evaluation plan, FDA is also required by  the 21st Century Cures Act to conduct an audit of the training and its  effectiveness in implementing the least burdensome requirements.  Specifically, the training audit is to be conducted by the ombudsman  responsible for premarket reviews, identified by FDA as the CDRH  Ombudsman. According to a draft plan, FDA plans to conduct training  evaluations, a process review of 510(k) and PMA documentation to  assess reviewer compliance with FDA procedures, and seek feedback  from industry on its experience with the premarket review process and  how the least burdensome requirements are applied. Officials indicated  that criteria are still under development and that they hoped to have them  further developed in the first quarter of 2018, with the authorizing  legislation requiring completion of the audit by June 2018, 18 months  after enactment of the law."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FDA is Taking Steps that May Improve Its Requests for Additional Information Overall, but Has Not Fully Evaluated Its Implementation of the Least Burdensome Requirements", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FDA Is Implementing Processes to Improve the Consistency and Clarity of Its Requests for Additional Information during Medical Device Reviews", "paragraphs": ["Some stakeholders and others have raised concerns about the  consistency and clarity of FDA\u2019s requests for additional information during  medical device reviews. For the past 17 years, FDA has required  reviewers to only request information that is necessary to make a PMA  determination of \u201creasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness\u201d or a  510(k) determination of \u201csubstantial equivalence\u201d in their review of a  submission. Representatives of one of the organizations representing  the medical device industry noted the high percentages of medical device  submissions that involve a letter, and some of their member companies  have said that FDA reviewers may request additional information as a  result of intellectual curiosity rather than a \u201cneed to know.\u201d In addition, the  independent assessment\u2019s 2014 report, funded by FDA as part of  MDUFA III, found inconsistent decision-making among FDA review staff  throughout various stages of the review process, including additional  information requests. While the 2014 report did not address least  burdensome requirements explicitly, it examined related processes. For  example, according to the report, there was inconsistent decision-making  among FDA review staff throughout various stages of the review process,  including a lack of clarity regarding FDA reviewer thresholds for triggering  deficiency letters. The report recommended that FDA develop criteria and  establish mechanisms to improve consistency in decision-making  throughout the review process.", "To address problems identified during the independent assessment, FDA  is implementing several initiatives to improve center processes. FDA  officials told us that, in anticipation of MDUFA IV, they recognized a need  for a dedicated quality management infrastructure. In 2014, FDA  established a Quality Management Unit to improve center processes,  which they said would include those related to the least burdensome  requirements. The unit completed a framework that outlined its vision and  mission and established organizational objectives, such as developing a  document control system, providing training, and conducting quality  assessments, audits, and management reviews.", "In addition, FDA officials told us that starting in October 2017, FDA  planned to fulfill its MDUFA IV commitments to improve the clarity and  consistency of its deficiency letters and AI letters after releasing updated  guidance.", "In September 2017, FDA published guidance reflecting the  commitments under MDUFA IV that all deficiency letters and AI letters  include a statement indicating the specific basis for any cited  deficiencies. According to FDA officials, this new approach will help  ensure that the letters more consistently ground requests for  information in the specific reason that FDA is requesting the  information from the sponsor. For example, FDA may cite a law, final  rule, or specific scientific issue as the basis for its request, rather than  providing a more general statement of the request\u2019s relevance.  According to industry representatives, in the past, FDA reviewers  have, at times, asked for additional information without including  justification, and may have requested additional information as a  result of intellectual curiosity rather than a \u201cneed to know.\u201d The  representatives stated that this new policy may better ensure the  reviewers apply the least burdensome approach to their review.", "The updated guidance also explains that all deficiency letters and AI  letters will undergo supervisory review prior to issuance to ensure that  the information requested is relevant to a marketing authorization  decision, all four elements of the deficiency are included, deficiencies  are prioritized from most to least significant, and each deficiency is  appropriate to include in light of the totality of all deficiencies. Officials  told us that while supervisory concurrence was previously needed,  under the new guidance, supervisors are now expected to review for  certain criteria. For example, in the past, supervisors may have  considered whether four-part harmony was addressed in each  deficiency letter, but under the updated guidance this is now an  expected practice. Officials said this will increase the extent to which  deficiency letters are consistently constructed.", "In the MDUFA IV commitment letter, FDA agreed to base all  deficiency letters and AI letters on a complete review of the  submission and include all deficiencies. Therefore, FDA officials told  us that any deficiencies identified following that letter would generally  be limited to issues raised as a result of new information. For  example, if FDA asked for information on bio-compatibility testing,  FDA will first review that information, and based on that review may  ask for new information. In that instance, the information responding  to the initial deficiency is new information. FDA officials said that past  letters should also have included all deficiencies, but this may have  been done inconsistently.", "To further standardize its process for reviewing medical device  submissions and developing requests for additional information, FDA is  developing and implementing smart templates. FDA officials told us that  these templates guide device reviewers through a standardized process  for each submission. For example, they help reviewers identify the types  of information necessary and include prewritten deficiency letters that  have been approved by internal experts. FDA has had a smart template  in place for the 510(k) process since 2013, according to FDA reports.  FDA indicated that the template is already required for certain offices and  divisions within CDRH, and plans for full adoption in the future. FDA  officials told us that the agency also developed templates for de novo  premarket submissions, which are currently available for voluntary use  and will likely be mandatory in fiscal year 2018. Officials told us they  plan to hire a person to develop a template to guide PMA reviews, which  will likely take most of 2018. They told us the use of the smart template  for PMAS will likely become mandatory for use by all reviewers in 2019.  In addition to improving the consistency of deficiency letters, FDA officials  said the information generated from the templates could be used to track  deficiencies and requests for additional information, as well as provide  information on the number and type of deficiencies in the letters. FDA  officials told us that the plans for database and back-end analytical  capabilities using information from the smart templates were less certain  and dependent on available resources, and they pointed out that the  information technology infrastructure can present unforeseen challenges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA Has Not Developed Metrics to Evaluate Implementation of the Least Burdensome Requirements, and While a New Audit Process Could Aid Oversight, Its Scope Is Still Unclear", "paragraphs": ["FDA has not established performance metrics that would allow it to  evaluate its implementation of the least burdensome provisions. FDA  officials told us that the agency does not track concerns related to the  least burdensome requirements, such as by examining dispute data to  identify those that may be related. According to FDA\u2019s 2002 guidance, the  agency was in the process of developing tools to be used by both agency  staff and its stakeholders to periodically assess the implementation of the  least burdensome requirements. The FDA guidance identified a need  for additional tools to accurately assess the agency\u2019s incorporation of the  least burdensome principles into its various regulatory activities and to  assess the impact of the least burdensome approach on expediting the  development of new medical technologies. Agency officials told us FDA  had not developed these tools, but was now in the process of making  other tools available. For example, they cited the development of the  smart templates that will guide reviewers as they evaluate medical device  submissions and generate deficiency letters. Officials noted that, given  the scientific nature of the inquiry, and because least burdensome is a  general principle, developing a metric specific to the least burdensome  requirements is a challenge. While this can be a challenge, FDA officials  have noted that they are attempting to identify surrogate measures that  can provide an indication that the reviewer considered the least  burdensome requirements when making a request. According to federal  standards for internal control, performance metrics are important for  management to have relevant, reliable, and timely information available  for management decision\u2013making and external reporting purposes.  Without such a metric, FDA may be asking medical device sponsors to  provide information unnecessarily or in less efficient ways that are not in  compliance with the requirement to use the least burdensome approach  to medical device reviews.", "FDA is in the process of developing an audit program that could provide it  with information on its implementation of the least burdensome  requirements. FDA has committed to conducting annual quality audits,  which will be led by CDRH\u2019s Quality Management Unit. Accordingly, FDA  plans to identify, with industry input, areas to audit at least once per year.  Initially, the agency has agreed to complete an audit of deficiency letters  and pre-submissions by the end of fiscal year 2020. As of August 2017,  FDA was still planning the deficiency letters audit, and developing its  methodology and identifying audit outcomes. FDA officials told us the  agency plans to finalize a deficiency letters audit plan by the spring of  2018 and begin data collection by early summer of 2018. Officials  explained that the audit will focus on processes\u2014for example, the audit  will not examine the scientific content of deficiency letters but will instead  focus on whether CDRH has followed existing policies and procedures  surrounding deficiency letters. In addition, the Quality Management Unit  was still in the process of hiring most of its staff. As of August 2017, FDA  officials told us the unit had 6 staff reporting to an Associate Director, and  CDRH plans to gradually hire 20 more staff by 2020, starting once  MDUFA IV funds are available beginning in October 2017.", "In addition to these more specific efforts, FDA also plans to continue its  overall evaluation of the medical device review process. The 2016  independent assessment resulting from MDUFA III broadly evaluated  FDA\u2019s device review process, and although it mentioned least  burdensome requirements only briefly, it addressed a number of related  elements, including the quality of the review process and staff training.  Under MDUFA IV, FDA committed to another independent assessment in  two phases: (1) an evaluation of FDA\u2019s implementation of the corrective  action plan FDA developed in response to the MDUFA III assessment  and (2) an evaluation of FDA\u2019s premarket device review program to  identify efficiencies that should be realized as a result of the process  improvements and investments under MDUFA III and IV, among other  things. As with the prior assessment, the new assessment will likely  examine processes related to the least burdensome requirements, though  the extent to which it will address the requirements is not yet known.

Assuring that the agency uses the least burdensome method  to complete its review helps to ensure it is able to make decisions about  medical device approval in a timely way. While FDA implemented  guidance and training related to the least burdensome requirements  following the passage of FDAMA in 1997, it has taken few steps to  develop performance metrics to evaluate the extent to which reviewers  are using a least burdensome approach when reviewing medical device  submissions. Recently, FDA implemented several changes that have the  potential to improve its oversight of the least burdensome requirements  and the clarity with which reviewers communicate the need for additional  information. While planned audits of FDA\u2019s medical device review  process have the potential to provide the agency with evaluation tools  through which to assess performance, these audits are still early in their  development and the extent to which they will allow FDA to assess  implementation of the least burdensome requirements is unclear.
