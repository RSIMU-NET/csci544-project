The Veterans Health Care Budget Reform and Transparency Act of 2009 requires GAO to assess whether the funding requested for VA health care in the President's budget requests submitted to Congress in 2011, 2012, and 2013 is consistent with VA's estimates of the resources needed to provide health care services. In anticipation of these future studies, GAO was asked to obtain information on how VA prepares its health care budget estimate. In this report, GAO describes (1) how VA develops its health care budget estimate, and (2) how VA's health care budget estimate is used in the President's budget request to Congress. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed VA documents on the methods, data, and assumptions used to develop VA's health care budget estimate that informed the President's budget request for fiscal year 2011 and request for advance appropriations for fiscal year 2012. GAO also interviewed VA officials responsible for developing this estimate and staff from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which is responsible for overseeing the development and implementation of the federal budget."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["VA uses what is known as the Enrollee Health Care Projection Model (EHCPM) to develop most of its health care budget estimate and uses other methods for the remainder. Specifically, VA used the EHCPM to estimate the resources needed to meet expected demand for 61 health care services that accounted for 83 percent of VA's health care budget estimate for fiscal year 2011 and similarly for fiscal year 2012. The EHCPM's estimates for these services are based on three basic components: projected enrollment in VA health care, projected use of VA's health care services, and projected costs of providing these services. To make these projections, the EHCPM uses data on the use and cost of these services that reflect data from VA, Medicare, and private health insurers. The EHCPM makes a number of complex adjustments to the data to account for characteristics of VA health care and the veterans who access VA's health care services. For example, these adjustments take into account veterans' age, gender, geographic location, and reliance on VA health care services compared with other sources, such as health care services paid for by Medicare or private health insurers. VA uses other methods to develop nearly all of the remaining portion of its budget estimate for long-term care and other services, as well as initiatives proposed by the Secretary of VA or the President. Long-term care and other services accounted for 16 percent and initiatives accounted for 1 percent of VA's health care budget estimate for fiscal year 2011 and similarly for fiscal year 2012. VA's health care budget estimate is reviewed at successively higher levels. Within the agency, the Secretary of VA reviews the health care budget estimate in the context of departmentwide priorities, including trade-offs between health care and other services. The budget estimate is presented in different ways, including the appropriations accounts structure used by Congress for decision making. OMB considers VA's budget submission in light of presidential priorities and needs governmentwide. VA can appeal decisions before OMB finalizes the President's budget request to Congress. VA and OMB provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) operates one of the largest health  care delivery systems in the nation, serving 5.7 million patients and  spending $43.3 billion in fiscal year 2009. The amount VA spends on its  health care services is driven by several factors, including the number of  eligible veterans who choose to seek care and the types and the cost of the  services they receive. VA provides a range of services for eligible  veterans. Many of these services\u2014including primary care, inpatient and  outpatient surgery, prosthetics, mental health services, and prescription  drugs\u2014are part of a uniform medical benefits package VA provides to all  veterans enrolled in VA health care. Other services, such as nursing home  care, are not part of the medical benefits package and are required to be  made available for a more limited veteran population specified in law,  although VA also makes these services available to other veterans on a  discretionary basis.", "The amount of funding VA receives for health care is determined by  Congress in the annual appropriations process, during which funds are  also provided for a wide range of other national programs, such as those  serving defense, education, and transportation. Prior to this process, VA  must annually develop a budget estimate of the resources needed for its  health care services, including costs for the administration and operation  of VA facilities. Developing a budget estimate is the first step in a complex,  multistep budget formulation process, which culminates in the President\u2019s  annual budget request to Congress.", "As we have previously reported, VA\u2019s formulation of its health care budget  estimate is by its very nature challenging, as it is based on assumptions  and imperfect information used to project the likely quantity and cost of  the health care services VA expects to provide. VA, similar to other  agencies, generally begins work on the budget for a fiscal year that begins  18 months later, meaning that the budget is prepared with uncertainty not  only about program needs, but also about future economic conditions,  presidential policies, and congressional actions. In addition, our prior  work has highlighted some of the challenges VA has faced formulating its  budget estimate, including obtaining sufficient data, making accurate  calculations, and making realistic assumptions. For example, in 2006, we  reported that VA underestimated the cost of serving veterans returning  from military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq due in part to insufficient  data about these veterans, which led to requests for additional funding for  fiscal years 2005 and 2006. In 2009, we reported that VA\u2019s long-term care  estimate for fiscal year 2009 was based on assumptions and projections  that appeared unrealistic.", "Congress passed the Veterans Health Care Budget Reform and  Transparency Act of 2009, which provided that VA\u2019s annual  appropriations for health care include advance appropriations that  become available 1 fiscal year after the fiscal year for which the  appropriations act was enacted. The 2009 law also requires that we assess  whether the amount of VA health care funding in the President\u2019s budget  request to Congress is consistent with VA\u2019s estimate of the resources  needed to provide health care services. The law requires that we report on  our analysis within 120 days after the President\u2019s budget requests are  submitted in 2011, 2012, and 2013.", "In anticipation of the reports we are required to provide, you expressed  interest in obtaining information on how VA\u2019s health care budget estimate  is prepared.

We also interviewed officials  from VA\u2019s Office of Mental Health Services and the Pharmacy Benefits  Management Services office to understand the subject-matter expertise  these program offices provide in developing VA\u2019s health care budget  estimate. These program offices were selected because the requested  funding levels for these services comprised a substantial proportion of the  President\u2019s budget request for VA health care for fiscal years 2007 through  2010. We used the information obtained from VA\u2019s documents and through  interviews with VA officials to describe how VA develops its health care  budget estimate and to determine the proportion of this estimate that is  developed using each of VA\u2019s methods. To assess the reliability of the data  on the proportion of VA\u2019s budget estimate that is determined using each  method, we obtained and checked the consistency of VA documents that  detail the various estimates and verified the information contained in the  documents with VA officials. We also verified that VA correctly calculated  budget estimates that represented more than 90 percent of VA\u2019s total  health care budget estimate for fiscal year 2011 and for fiscal year 2012.", "We verified VA\u2019s calculations using components VA said it used to  compute the estimates.

The order of priority for the categories is generally based on  service-connected disability, income, or other special status such as  having been a prisoner of war. If sufficient resources are not available to  provide care that is timely and acceptable in quality, VA must restrict  enrollment consistent with its priority categories. VA also provides  enhanced priority status for veterans with combat experience\u2014including  those who participated in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan,  Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn in Iraq\u2014for up to   5 years from their date of discharge or release from active-duty service.", "Veterans who enroll in VA health care may choose not to access VA\u2019s  health care services in any given year. This is in part because many  veterans have other options, such as Medicare, Medicaid, or private  health insurance, to access and pay for health care services. Enrollees  choose whether to access services through VA or other providers based on  factors such as their proximity to VA providers. Additionally, downturns in  economic conditions may reduce veterans\u2019 access to sources of private  insurance, such as employer-sponsored insurance, and influence enrollees\u2019  choice to access VA health care.", "Estimating the resources required to provide health care services to  veterans and developing VA\u2019s budget request is a collaborative process  involving several offices within VA, mainly at VA headquarters.

These services accounted for 83 percent of VA\u2019s health care budget  estimate for fiscal 2011. VA used the EHCPM to estimate the resources  needed for fiscal year 2011 for 61 health care services, which VA grouped  into seven service types (see app. I for a list of the 61 health care services  that were grouped into the seven service types). Outpatient services  accounted for almost half of the resources VA estimated using the EHCPM  for fiscal year 2011.

VA officials said this total cost  reflects direct patient costs as well as costs associated with management,  administration, and maintenance of facilities.

(See fig. 2.) Each component is subject to a number of complex  adjustments to account for the characteristics of VA health care and the  veterans who access VA\u2019s health care services. The EHCPM makes these  projections 3 or 4 years into the future for budget purposes based on data  from the most recent fiscal year. For example, in 2009, VA used data from  fiscal year 2008 to develop its health care budget estimate for the fiscal  year 2011 request, including the advance appropriations request for fiscal  year 2012.", "To project the expected number of veterans who will be enrolled in VA  health care, the EHCPM relies on a combination of VA and other federal  data to identify current enrollees and to estimate how many eligible,  nonenrolled veterans will choose to enroll. The EHCPM uses VA data to  identify the number of current enrollees in VA health care and to calculate  historical enrollment rates by various characteristics, including age,  gender, priority level, and geographic location. In addition, the EHCPM  uses data developed by VA that combine federal census data on veterans  and Department of Defense data on service members separated from  active duty since the last decennial census to identify the number of  eligible veterans not currently enrolled in VA health care. The data  developed by VA also incorporate Department of Defense estimates of  how many service members will separate from active duty each year into  the future. The EHCPM uses these data to estimate how many eligible  veterans will choose to enroll in VA health care by applying VA\u2019s historical  enrollment rates to this population.", "To project the utilization or the quantity of VA\u2019s health care services  veterans will use and the unit costs of VA\u2019s health care services, VA groups  these services into two major categories in the EHCPM: (1) those services  that VA provides in a manner comparable to other providers, whose  services are paid for by Medicare and private health insurers; and (2) those  services that are unique to or are provided in a different manner by VA.  For example, VA provides services, such as emergency room visits and  physician office visits, in a manner comparable to other providers. In  contrast, VA provides rehabilitation services to homeless veterans and  certain types of prosthetic services that VA officials said are not generally  offered by other providers.", "For health care services that VA provides in a manner comparable to other  providers, the EHCPM uses utilization and unit-cost data developed by  VA\u2019s actuarial consultant that reflect data from Medicare and private  health insurers in addition to data from VA\u2019s own experience. VA used  these data for 33 of the 61 health care services whose estimates were  developed by the EHCPM for fiscal year 2011. (See app. I for the data  sources used to generate utilization and unit-cost projections for each of  the 61 health care services for fiscal year 2011.) Data from Medicare and  private health insurers allow the EHCPM to better account for the impact  of a number of factors\u2014such as age, gender, geographic location, and  benefit structure\u2014that may affect utilization and unit-cost projections  because these data represent more than 60 million individuals, compared  with the 8.5 million veterans expected to be enrolled in VA health care in  fiscal year 2011. Additionally, VA officials said that using data from  Medicare and private health insurers allows the EHCPM to account for  enrollees\u2019 utilization of health care services outside of VA health care.", "For health care services that are unique to or are provided in a different  manner by VA, the EHCPM uses utilization and unit-cost data from VA\u2019s  own experience. VA used these data for 28 of the 61 health care services  whose estimates were developed by the EHCPM for fiscal year 2011. While  VA data can be used to reasonably estimate the likely demand for these  specific services, VA officials said these data do not allow the EHCPM to  account for as many factors that may affect utilization and unit-cost  projections. For example, VA uses national unit costs in most projections  of services that are unique to VA health care because it lacks sufficient  data to use in the EHCPM to account for geographic variations in the unit  cost of these services.", "To project utilization and unit costs using the EHCPM, VA makes a  number of complex adjustments to the utilization and unit-cost data to  account for the characteristics of VA health care and enrolled veterans.  For example, these adjustments take into account enrollees\u2019 age, gender,  priority level, and geographic location. VA also makes additional  adjustments to account for changes expected to occur over time. For  example, adjustments are made to utilization projections to account for  changes in health care practice patterns, such as greater use of magnetic  resonance imaging to diagnose a condition. Additionally, unit-cost  projections are adjusted to account for the effect of inflation on the costs  of labor and supplies.", "For services that VA provides in a manner comparable to other providers,  VA also adjusts data from Medicare and private health insurers in the  EHCPM to account for the extent to which enrolled veterans will choose  to access health care services through VA\u2014referred to as reliance on VA  health care\u2014or obtain these services through non-VA sources. VA uses  Medicare data for enrolled veterans to estimate the proportion of each  health care service that veterans age 65 and over access through Medicare  instead of VA. However, VA does not have a comprehensive data source to  estimate the proportion of each health care service that enrolled veterans  under age 65 access through non-VA sources, such as private insurers. To  estimate the proportion of each health care service that enrollees under 65  access through VA and non-VA sources, VA relies on an extrapolation from  its analysis of Medicare data and from data collected through periodic  telephone surveys of enrollees about their use of VA and non-VA health  care services. Additionally, VA adjusts data from Medicare and private  health insurers in the EHCPM to incorporate characteristics unique or  more common to VA health care and its enrollee population. For example,  VA does not require copayments for physician office visits for veterans  that meet certain eligibility criteria and VA\u2019s enrollee population is  predominantly male.", "Within VHA\u2019s Office of the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary for Health  for Policy and Planning, the Office of Enrollment and Forecasting has the  lead responsibility for developing the estimates from the EHCPM and  annually updates the assumptions that may affect utilization or unit-cost  projections.

Input  from the program offices is incorporated into the underlying assumptions  used in the EHCPM. For example, VA officials told us that the Office of  Enrollment and Forecasting collaborated with VA\u2019s pharmacy program  office to obtain information about what brand-name drugs are coming off  patent, for which lower-cost, generic alternatives may be available. The  Office of Enrollment and Forecasting incorporated this information into  assumptions used in the EHCPM to project utilization and unit costs for  VA\u2019s pharmacy services. Also, VA officials told us that the Office of Mental  Health Services provided information to the Office of Enrollment and  Forecasting on VA\u2019s increasing provision of mental health services in less  restrictive treatment facilities and outpatient settings, and this information  supported assumptions used in the EHCPM to project utilization of VA\u2019s  mental health services.", "VHA\u2019s Office of Enrollment and Forecasting annually briefs VA leadership,  including the VA Secretary and VHA Under Secretary, and OMB on  updates to the EHCPM and assumptions used in the EHCPM to generate  the estimates.

VA officials said that when making workload  projections, they consider the resources necessary to serve high-priority  veterans whom VA must serve. In addition, VA\u2019s overall policy goal for  nursing home workload is to keep nursing home workload consistent with  recent experience, as VA focuses on expanding noninstitutional care  services in order to provide long-term care in the least restrictive and most  clinically appropriate settings.

For some services, however, VA  experienced decreases in unit cost from fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year  2009. To develop fiscal year 2011 budget estimates for those services, VA  did not rely on its recent experience and instead chose to assume a unit- cost increase between 4.52 percent and 4.60 percent, depending on the  service.", "The remaining services for which VA developed estimates using methods  other than the EHCPM made up 3 percent of VA\u2019s health care budget  estimate for fiscal year 2011.

CHAMPVA functions similarly to traditional  health insurance\u2014most care within CHAMPVA is delivered using private- sector health care providers. Therefore, developing estimates of the  resources needed for CHAMPVA requires factoring in utilization patterns  and cost inflation that are generally outside of VA\u2019s control. Budget  estimates for CHAMPVA are developed using a formula that computes the  predicted number of users and costs per-member per-year. Since 2004,  VA\u2019 s Health Administration Center, which oversees administration of  CHAMPVA, has worked with VA\u2019s actuarial consultant to generate  projections of CHAMPVA users that incorporate changes related to the  population of disabled veterans and projections of expected increases and  decreases in the CHAMPVA-eligible population. More recently, the Health  Administration Center and VA\u2019s actuarial consultant added projections of  cost per-member per-year.

For example, VA estimated that one  proposed initiative to pay travel expenses for caregivers to support  veterans receiving certain VA health care services would cost $16 million  in fiscal year 2011. For a different proposed initiative, VA estimated  savings of $325,000 in fiscal year 2011 if VA were permitted to stop  reimbursing physicians and dentists for certain continuing education  expenses."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VA\u2019s Health Care Budget Estimate Informs the Decision- making Process for the President\u2019s Budget Request", "paragraphs": ["VA\u2019s health care budget estimate prepared by VHA is reviewed at  successively higher levels. Within the agency, the Secretary of VA reviews  the health care budget estimate in the context of departmentwide  priorities, including trade-offs between health care and other services.  OMB considers VA\u2019s budget submission in light of presidential priorities  and needs governmentwide. VA and OMB communicate these priorities by  providing guidance.", "One source of guidance for developing the budget request is the Secretary  of VA. VA officials told us that each April they issue departmental  guidance that may include funding targets and policy priorities. The  guidance communicates the Secretary\u2019s priorities and may identify the  specific VA services to be emphasized in that year\u2019s budget request. In  addition to preparing the estimate for existing health care services, VHA  may have to estimate the resources required to carry out a new initiative  identified in guidance from the Secretary. VA officials said that in some  years they may direct VHA to estimate the resources needed under  different levels of demand for services to reflect a changing internal or  external environment, such as legislative changes or economic conditions.", "Another source of guidance for developing the budget request is OMB,  which issues OMB Circular No. A-11. It includes guidance to agencies for  preparing budget submissions. According to OMB staff, additional  guidance from OMB gives more specific information on priorities or target  funding levels. OMB staff also stated that they maintain ongoing contact  with VA officials as the budget submission is formulated to provide  guidance and to keep apprised of VA budgetary concerns.", "The budget estimate for health care services is presented in different ways  for review and decision making. VA must present the budget estimate in  the appropriations accounts\u2019 structure used by Congress, but the budget  estimate is also shown by broad service categories, such as acute, mental  health, and institutional long-term care, and the Secretary\u2019s and  President\u2019s initiatives. For the purpose of presentation in the President\u2019s  Budget, agencies start from the most recently enacted appropriations,  even if the President proposes changes to the structure and purposes of  the appropriations accounts. Congress funds VA health care services in  three appropriations accounts. The three appropriations accounts for VA  health care services are:    Medical Services, which includes funds for health care services provided  to eligible veterans and beneficiaries in VA\u2019s medical centers, outpatient  clinic facilities, contract hospitals, state homes, and outpatient programs  on a fee basis;   Medical Support and Compliance, which includes funds for  management and administration of the VA health care system, including  financial management; and   Medical Facilities, which includes funds for the operation and  maintenance of the VA health care system\u2019s capital infrastructure, such as  costs associated with utilities, facility repair, laundry services, and  groundskeeping.", "Figure 4 shows the different structures in which the fiscal year 2011  budget estimate was presented for review and decision making.", "Because support and compliance (administrative) costs and facility costs  are not estimated separately by the EHCPM or other methods used by VA  to develop its resource estimates, VHA officials said they generally  distribute the total health care budget request among the three  appropriations accounts based on historical spending trends. Specifically,  VA uses the proportions of funding for health care services,  administration, and facility costs that were obligated in the last budget  year as a baseline and makes adjustments as appropriate. For example, if  VA is requesting a relative increase in maintenance efforts, VA would  increase the share of the budget requested for the Medical Facilities  account. Funding was requested for fiscal year 2011 for the three accounts  in the following proportions: Medical Services at 77 percent, Medical  Support and Compliance at 11 percent, and Medical Facilities at   12 percent.", "Officials from VA\u2019s Office of Budget said that they focus on changes from  the previous year and review whether the changes are consistent with past  trends, whether projected trends are consistent with their expectations,  and whether the changes are justified. Given that VA\u2019s Office of Budget  has already reviewed the underlying assumptions in the early stages of  developing the health care budget estimate, VA budget officials said that,  at this point, they ensure that the budget estimate is internally consistent,  the justifications are clear, and the amounts requested are reasonable. For  example, the Office of Budget verifies that the resources requested are  sufficient to cover the salaries for the number of employees included in  the request. The Office of Budget also verifies whether the estimates for  collections and new initiatives are sufficient.", "The Secretary of VA considers the health care budget estimate when  assessing resource requirements among competing interests within VA,  particularly in times of fiscal constraints. The departmentwide budget  submission includes resources for the administration of veterans\u2019  compensation and benefit programs as well as proposed investments for  improving the delivery of those benefits using information technology and  for construction projects at hospitals and other facilities. VA officials said  the Secretary most often makes trade-offs in areas such as new initiatives  and new construction. As an example, VA officials said that the Secretary  may want to dedicate more resources for mental health services to reduce  homelessness among veterans than the budget estimate initially provided.  As a result of these trade-offs, VA\u2019s budget request for health care could be  different from the resource estimates developed using the EHCPM and  other methods.", "VA\u2019s Office of Budget includes supporting materials accompanying VA\u2019s  budget request that are submitted to OMB. These supporting materials  include narrative statements of selected health care services, such as  mental health and homeless programs. VA also submits additional data to  justify VA\u2019s request for resources. For example, VA submits detailed  estimates from the EHCPM separately to OMB. According to VA officials,  these estimates are used to communicate to decision makers how the  estimated spending for services supports VA\u2019s mission to provide health  care services to veterans instead of listing all the details of health care  services in the budget submission.", "In September of each year, VA transmits its departmentwide budget  submission, including its budget estimate for health care, to OMB. OMB  staff stated that they initially review VA\u2019s assumptions, such as economic  assumptions pertaining to inflation, and review cost and utilization trends  used to develop the health care budget estimate. OMB staff also review the  policy priorities in VA\u2019s submission, which includes the funding request for  VA health care, to verify that the President\u2019s priorities are reflected. OMB  staff stated that they also talk with VHA officials to ensure that the  resources requested support the initiatives as described.", "Traditionally, OMB issues decisions, known as passback, to VA and other  agencies in late November on the funding and policy proposals to be  included in the President\u2019s budget request. OMB staff said that they  consider broader resource constraints and competing priorities of other  agencies when making decisions about the level of funding for VA\u2019s  services. VA may appeal the decision before OMB finalizes the President\u2019s  budget request. The OMB decision and appeals process can result in a  presidential budget request that is different from VA\u2019s budget submission  to OMB. The budget formulation process culminates with OMB preparing  the accompanying documents submitted to Congress in February.  Concurrently, VA prepares a congressional budget justification that  provides details supporting the policy and funding decisions for the  President\u2019s budget request to Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to VA and OMB for comment.
