The objective was to  determine the effectiveness of SEC\u2019s information security controls for  ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its key financial  systems and information. To do this, we identified and reviewed SEC  information systems control policies and procedures, conducted tests of  controls, and held interviews with key security representatives and  management officials concerning whether information security controls  were in place, adequately designed, and operating effectively.", "We evaluated controls based on our Federal Information System Controls  Audit Manual (FISCAM), which contains guidance for reviewing  information system controls that affect the confidentiality, integrity, and  availability of computerized information; National Institute of Standards  and Technology standards and special publications; SEC\u2019s plans,  policies, and standards; and the National Security Agency\u2019s 60 Minute  Network Security Guide. We assessed the effectiveness of both general  and application controls by performing information system controls walkthroughs surrounding the observing technical controls implemented on selected systems; initiation, authorization, processing, recording, and reporting of  financial data (via interviews, inquiries, observations, and  inspections);  reviewing systems security assessment and authorization documents;  reviewing SEC policies and procedures;  testing specific controls; and  scanning and manually assessing SEC systems including general  support systems and financial applications.", "We also evaluated the Statement on Standards for Attestation  Engagements report and performed testing on key information  technology controls on the following applications and systems: Delphi- Prism, FedInvest, and Federal Personnel and Payroll System/Quicktime.", "We selected which systems to evaluate based on a consideration of  financial systems and service providers integral to SEC\u2019s financial  statements.", "The evaluation and testing of SEC information system controls, including  the evaluation of the status of SEC\u2019s corrective actions during fiscal year  2013 to address open recommendations from our prior years\u2019 reports,  was performed jointly with the independent firm of Williams, Adley, &  Company-DC, LLP. We agreed on the scope of the audit work, monitored  the firm\u2019s progress, and reviewed the related audit documentation to  determine that the firm\u2019s findings were adequately supported.", "To determine the status of SEC\u2019s actions to correct or mitigate previously  reported information security weaknesses, we identified and reviewed its  information security policies, procedures, practices, and guidance. We  reviewed prior GAO reports to identify previously reported weaknesses  and examined the commission\u2019s corrective action plans to determine  which weaknesses it had reported were corrected. For those instances  where SEC reported that it had completed corrective actions, we  assessed the effectiveness of those actions by reviewing appropriate  documents, including SEC-documented corrective actions, and  interviewing the appropriate staffs, including system administrators.", "To assess the reliability of the data we analyzed, such as information  system control settings, security assessment and authorization  documents, and security policies and procedures, we corroborated them  by interviewing SEC officials, programmatic personnel, and system  administrators to determine whether the data obtained were consistent  with system configurations in place at the time of our review. Based on  this assessment, we determined the data were reliable for the purposes  of this report.", "We performed our work in accordance with U.S. generally accepted  government auditing standards.
