Specifically, NMB has developed a policy to prevent violations of ethics rules regarding outside employment and monitors compliance with that policy. NMB has not yet fully implemented the other six recommendations. For example, NMB has developed some strategies to reduce its arbitration case backlog, but lacks a plan with goals and time frames to complete that work. Similarly, NMB has completed an organizational climate assessment, but still must take additional actions to address employee concerns. By not fully implementing these and other recommendations, NMB remains at risk of not fulfilling its mission in several key areas, including information security and organizational climate.", "In this review, GAO found that, in addition to the six unimplemented recommendations, NMB lacks internal controls to effectively manage and oversee its appropriations and consistently follow its audit policies. NMB officials said the agency needed its full funding to address various agency priorities, such as hiring information technology specialists, but NMB did not use all of its funding for fiscal years 2016 through 2019, leaving a total of more than $4 million unobligated from those years; those funds are not available to NMB for new obligations. Officials said that hiring challenges and uncertainty concerning the agency's final appropriations made managing its budget resources difficult. NMB has a new process to monitor its budget resources, but has not documented that process. Without documenting that process, NMB may not be certain it uses its funding effectively to achieve its hiring and other goals. Additionally, NMB has not consistently followed its audit policy to address deficiencies identified in financial and other audits. For example, NMB did not create specific corrective action plans to address findings from financial or GAO audits. The NMB Board said it relied on senior managers to follow procedures, but the Board is ultimately responsible for ensuring that its managers implement the internal control system. Without a process to effectively oversee and evaluate its adherence to internal controls and its own audit policies, NMB may miss opportunities to achieve objectives, address audit deficiencies, and improve management oversight."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making four recommendations, including that NMB document its process for reviewing and monitoring the agency's annual appropriations to ensure effective use of funds, and establish a process for the Board to effectively monitor and evaluate NMB's adherence to audit policies.

In 2019, NMB  worked with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to conduct an  organizational climate assessment, during which it sent survey  questionnaires to all eligible NMB employees (95 percent of eligible  employees responded). The survey provided data on several dimensions  of NMB employee perceptions, such as ethics, resources, rewards, and  supervision. After reviewing the survey data collection and analysis  methods, we determined data from this survey were sufficiently reliable  for our purposes. In addition, NMB provided us its Arbitrator Workspace  System, which tracks the number of pending, open, and closed arbitration  cases at NMB by fiscal year, for 2016 through 2019. After reviewing the  methods NMB uses to collect and record this data, we determined that  data from this system were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "We interviewed NMB officials and NMB Board members to determine  what NMB has done to address each of our open recommendations  (objective 1), as well as to determine any additional management  challenges (objective 2).

The term \u201cnot fully implemented\u201d  ranged from recommendations where NMB had taken limited actions to  address the recommendation, to ones where NMB had made substantial  progress in addressing the recommendation. We interviewed external and  internal stakeholders, including industry groups, rail and air carriers,  unions, and agency ombudsmen to obtain their views on challenges the  agency faces. For railway carrier and union interviews, we selected  carriers and unions that represented a majority of cases in NMB\u2019s rail  arbitration case backlog. We also coordinated with an industry group that  represents railway carriers. For airline carrier interviews, we selected two  of the top four carriers with the largest number of enplaned passengers  per year, and also coordinated with an industry group that represents  airline carriers.

The RLA also offers grievance arbitration to help resolve  disagreements between carriers and unions over how to interpret and  apply provisions of existing collective bargaining agreements. NMB  does not directly provide arbitration services, but rather maintains a  list of registered arbitrators from which the parties can select someone  to review and decide their case.

We reported in 2018 that NMB\u2019s  rail grievance arbitration case backlog had more than tripled since 2011,  and that NMB did not have a specific plan and related processes to  address it. However, identifying and assessing the risks associated with  the backlog and developing a plan to effectively manage it are key to  implementing effective risk management.", "In our current review, we found that NMB has implemented several  initiatives to reduce the rail grievance arbitration case backlog, including  removing older cases, using lead cases\u2014cases that have the same  parties and similar fact patterns, allowing a decision from one case to  settle others\u2014and promoting an \u201cAmbassador Program\u201d to move cases  from grievance arbitration to grievance mediation. NMB officials credit  these strategies with reducing the backlog from a height of 8,550 cases at  the end of fiscal year 2017 by 4,852 cases\u2014about 57 percent\u2014to 3,698  cases as of the end of fiscal year 2019 (see table 2).  1.  Removing older cases. NMB officials said that NMB has removed  older arbitration cases that were filed, but had not yet been moved  forward to arbitration. Specifically, officials explained that, in late  summer 2018, NMB removed 400 cases from the backlog that were 3  years or older. NMB officials said that the agency subsequently  removed 1,025 cases that were 2 years or older. NMB officials told us  that parties may choose to re-file a removed case. NMB has not  received objections from unions and carriers regarding the removal of  older cases.  2.  Using lead cases: For lead cases, NMB and the parties agree that  the decision for one case will be used to settle other cases with similar  fact patterns. For example, officials said that a similar fact pattern  would be cases that had the same union and carrier and dealt with the  same underlying issue. In fiscal year 2017, NMB used the decisions  for nine lead cases to settle 4,240 additional claims. In fiscal year  2018, NMB used the decisions for four lead cases to settle 600  additional claims.  3.  Promoting the Ambassador Program. NMB\u2019s Ambassador Program  involves NMB reaching out to parties to encourage them to voluntarily  move cases from arbitration to grievance mediation. NMB has  assigned experienced mediators to carriers and unions as  \u201cambassadors.\u201d Unions that have disputes with a carrier can raise the  issue through the ambassador in hopes of avoiding the formal  arbitration process; in that way, the Ambassador Program may  proactively decrease the number of arbitration cases filed. NMB is  interested in using the Ambassador Program to resolve multiple  claims regarding the same issue, policy, or employment action. NMB  officials said in fiscal year 2018, NMB had seven cases in the  Ambassador Program and closed six cases. NMB officials said in  fiscal year 2019, NMB had four cases in the Ambassador Program;  none are closed to date. NMB officials said that the Ambassador  Program and the lead case program are related, in that many of the  cases moved through the Ambassador Program are lead cases. For  example, NMB reported that in fiscal year 2018, one grievance  mediation case was used to settle 300 claims. In fiscal year 2017,  NMB heard five cases in the Ambassador Program, and the decisions  on these cases were applied to 1,951 remaining claims to resolve  them.", "In addition, NMB officials told us a small number of railway carriers and  unions file the largest percentage of the grievance arbitration cases (see  fig. 2). In fiscal year 2019, four railway carriers represented 72 percent of  the backlog, and four railway unions represented 87 percent of the  backlog. The Office of Arbitration seeks to coordinate with the  organizations with the most arbitration cases to help them move toward  mediation or other techniques to decrease the arbitration backlog.", "Another method NMB reported using to reduce the backlog is to direct  otherwise unobligated funding at the end of the fiscal year to fund  arbitration cases, in addition to the amount of funds it had initially  budgeted for arbitration. Specifically, NMB officials said that the agency  allocated at least $1 million in additional funds in fiscal years 2017, 2018,  and 2019 for arbitration cases at the end of each fiscal year, which  allowed NMB to fund arbitration for approximately 4,200 more cases  overall, closing nearly all of those cases. Officials said that these  additional funds came from unfilled full-time equivalent staff position  salaries and contracts that NMB did not award. Officials said they do not  anticipate having similar amounts of funding available for arbitration in the  future, once NMB hires staff and awards the contracts.", "While NMB has implemented various strategies to reduce the rail  arbitration case backlog, it has not developed a plan to link the strategies  to specific goals or timeframes. GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in  the Federal Government state that management should define objectives  in specific and measurable terms. Further, federal agencies are required  to develop annual performance plans that measure performance to  reinforce the connection between long-term strategic goals and day-to- day activities of its managers and staff. NMB\u2019s 2018 Annual  Performance and Accountability Report does not link NMB\u2019s efforts to  reduce the backlog to specific and measurable objectives to assess their  effectiveness. By developing specific and measurable objectives to  reduce the overall backlog or any component thereof, NMB and Congress  would be able to more adequately assess NMB\u2019s progress in reducing the  backlog relative to its goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Organizational Climate Assessment", "paragraphs": ["GAO 2018 Recommendation: Complete and take actions on the organizational climate  assessment and survey results as a means to address employee concerns.", "Since our 2018 review, we found NMB has completed an organizational  climate assessment but has not taken actions to address the results of  that assessment. We reported in 2018 that surveyed NMB employees  expressed concerns about the organizational climate at NMB.

However, at the time of our 2018 report, NMB had not  conducted such an assessment. In addition, NMB officials said that they  did not take action in response to survey results, which had a 59 percent  response rate, because they believed the negative responses were  attributable to a few employees. GAO recommended that NMB conduct  an organizational climate assessment and develop actions to address the  results of that assessment.", "In our current review, we found that NMB conducted an organizational  climate assessment and has taken some actions to address the elements  identified in the assessment, but must take additional actions to address  employee concerns. NMB worked with OPM to conduct an organizational  climate assessment in April 2019. The assessment had a response rate  of 95 percent. Several NMB officials said the agency achieved a higher  response rate than prior surveys because the Board held an all staff  meeting to emphasize the importance of taking the assessment. In May  2019, NMB received the results of the organizational climate assessment  from OPM. NMB identified a lack of communication across departmental  staff as an issue. To address this, NMB directed regular interdepartmental  updates, where each quarter a department is given an opportunity to  present the activities within that department. NMB officials said that NMB  held its first interdepartmental update in October 2019, with the Office of  Legal Affairs presenting. The next interdepartmental update is scheduled  for February 2020. NMB has identified some additional potential actions  to address issues raised by the organizational climate assessment,  including directing NMB\u2019s CFO to rewrite the travel policy and to work  with OPM to identify recommended training for supervisors, among  others.

For example, the FTR  requires employees to rent the least expensive car available, but a former  NMB management official approved the use of a luxury rental car in some  cases. Our 2018 report found that without greater oversight of employee  travel expenses, NMB may be incurring unnecessary additional expenses  for employee travel.", "In our current review, we found that NMB has not revised its travel policy  to be consistent with the FTR. However, NMB\u2019s Office of Fiscal Services  plans to rewrite portions of the travel policy, including clarifying roles and  responsibilities of NMB employees and adding a Frequently Asked  Questions portion to the policy. NMB officials said the revised policy is  expected to be completed in 2020, and will be reviewed by the CFO in  consultation with the Office of Legal Affairs prior to its publication. It is  unclear the extent to which these changes will make NMB\u2019s travel policy  consistent with the FTR.", "In addition, NMB has taken steps to strengthen its internal controls  related to travel, including:  1.  Replacing the Chief of Staff role in travel policy. In August 2018,  NMB replaced references to the eliminated Chief of Staff position in its  travel policy to make the Board the decision making body for travel- related issues. This clarification strengthened internal controls  because no one individual is singularly responsible for approval.  2.  Updating NMB\u2019s travel charge card program. In 2019, NMB  transitioned to a new travel charge card program run by the General  Services Administration. Both NMB and the Department of Treasury\u2019s  Bureau of Fiscal Services, which provides accounting services to  NMB, routinely monitor the program, including monitoring each  employee\u2019s use of the travel card to ensure only appropriate official  government-related expenses are being charged to the card. The  CFO receives reports from this new program.  3.  Issuing an interim procedure. Separately, NMB has established an  interim procedure for disputed claims that sets timeframes for when  vouchers must be approved to avoid delays in returning vouchers to  travelers. The interim procedure requires travelers to cite the specific  regulatory authority to support their disputed claim. The NMB Board is  determining whether this procedure should be established officially in  the travel policy.", "While NMB has made these initial efforts to strengthen internal controls  related to travel, such as increasing oversight from the Board, NMB has  not revised its travel policy to be consistent with the FTR.

For example, in  our 2018 review, we found that, while NMB had its information security  policy documented in its April 2016 Information Program Plan, which  included risk assessment requirements, NMB had not developed agency- wide policies and procedures on the oversight of its third-party providers  that support the operations and assets of the agency, as required by  FISMA.", "In our current review, we found that, while NMB has created a policy to  conduct periodic risk assessments of cyber threats and vulnerabilities, the  agency did not provide risk assessment documentation of its enterprise  network for fiscal year 2019.

As a  step to further focus on information technology challenges, NMB  established the Office of Information Services and, as noted earlier, hired  a CIO.

For additional details on the  extent to which NMB is following key information security practices,  including NMB\u2019s recent engagement of contractors, see appendix II.", "In addition to the gaps in key information security practices discussed  above, we found in our current review that NMB has not fully  implemented federal requirements related to authorizing the cloud service  approved through FedRAMP that the agency uses. OMB defines an  authorization to operate as an official management decision where a  federal official or officials authorize the operation of information system(s)  and accept the risk to agency operations and assets, individuals, and  other organizations based on the implementation of security and privacy  controls. OMB requires agencies to use FedRAMP processes when  granting authorizations to operate for their use of cloud services. The  FedRAMP Program Management Office published guidance in 2017 to  describe the process by which agencies can reuse existing  authorizations. According to the FedRAMP guidance, agencies should  document the authorization of 1) the agency system supported by the  cloud service; and 2) the cloud service used by the agency. Additionally,  the agency should provide a copy of its authorization letter for the cloud  service to the FedRAMP Program Management Office so that the office  can verify the agency\u2019s use of the service and keep agencies informed of  any changes to a provider\u2019s authorization status. These steps ensure that  federal agencies have made a determination of whether the cloud service  provider\u2019s risk posture is acceptable for use at that agency.", "According to NMB, the agency is using a cloud service that was approved  through FedRAMP to support the agency\u2019s enterprise network. NMB had  documented the authorization of its enterprise network, but NMB had not  documented its authorization of the cloud service to demonstrate that it  had accepted the risk of using the service. In addition, NMB had not  provided the authorization letter for the cloud service to the FedRAMP  Program Management Office. NMB officials stated that the agency\u2019s  internal information security guidance did not include procedures to  address FedRAMP requirements because the officials were unaware of  those requirements.

NMB had about $4  million in unobligated appropriations in expired accounts in the U.S.  Treasury and unavailable to NMB for new obligations from fiscal years  2016 through 2019.

For example, from fiscal years  2016 through 2019, NMB had unobligated balances ranging between  approximately $600,000 to over $2 million. These are the remaining funds  from its appropriations received each year from fiscal year 2016 through  2019. In total, over 8 percent of NMB\u2019s appropriations for the last 4  fiscal years went unobligated.", "NMB officials noted that hiring challenges and uncertainty regarding the  agency\u2019s final appropriation as a result of continuing resolutions\u2014 legislation that continues to fund federal agencies until final agency  appropriations for a fiscal year are made\u2014kept the agency from  obligating funds during those fiscal years to achieve its goals. For  example, NMB officials said that the Board did not pursue certain planned  hiring, as well as other contract actions and travel, because of uncertainty  about the amount of final appropriations that would be available. GAO  has reported that continuing resolutions present challenges for federal  agencies, and that agencies may not have enough time to spend funding  on high-priority needs such as hiring.", "However, given the frequency of continuing resolutions, it is even more  important for NMB to develop an effective plan to use its appropriations to  accomplish agency goals. During our review, we found that NMB  struggled to plan effectively for contingencies such as funding under  continuing resolutions, although NMB\u2019s budget request and  appropriations were generally consistent for several years. Additionally,  NMB officials told us they lacked an effective process to reliably forecast  the amount of funding the agency would have remaining at the end of a  fiscal year, and we found NMB did not plan effectively to allow the agency  to obligate its fiscal year appropriations. NMB officials said the agency  waited until the end of the third quarter to assign unobligated funds to  other priorities in order to allow for the option of retaining temporary  services during periods of high demand. Although NMB was able to  reassign at least $1 million to arbitration work in each of the fourth  quarters in 2017, 2018, and 2019, there was insufficient time to use other  available funding in additional areas of need.", "The Board has taken steps to improve its budget execution process. In  particular, the Board has implemented new bi-weekly budget reviews with  the CFO meant to help NMB better forecast the agency\u2019s available funds,  including more reliably predicting the amount of unobligated funds and  how to use those funds to meet agency goals. However, these changes  have not been incorporated into a formal, written process to help NMB  manage its appropriations more effectively to achieve agency goals. One  goal under NMB\u2019s Strategic Plan is to provide timely, efficient, and  responsible stewardship of agency fiscal resources. Federal internal  control standards state that internal controls comprise the plans used to  fulfill the goals of the agency, and we have reported that maintaining  written policies and procedures can help ensure that adequate internal  controls are in place. Further, those standards state that management  should obtain reliable financial data on a timely basis to enable effective  monitoring. Until NMB establishes and documents an effective plan to  manage its appropriations, as well as timely, reliable financial data, it may  miss opportunities to achieve its objectives as efficiently and effectively as  possible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NMB Lacks Effective Internal Controls to Ensure that It Consistently Follows Its Audit Policy to Identify and Address Audit Deficiencies", "paragraphs": ["NMB lacks effective internal controls to ensure that it consistently  addresses deficiencies identified from financial and other audits. For  example, NMB did not follow its own requirements to create corrective  action plans to address findings of financial audits or GAO  recommendations. Under agency policy, those corrective action plans  should detail major steps for NMB to take, estimated completion dates,  and other related information. Although NMB provided its financial  auditors and GAO with general plans to address findings and  recommendations, those plans have not always included major steps or  estimated completion dates, and NMB has not always followed through  with the steps it agreed to take. For instance, NMB\u2019s financial auditor  noted a deficiency in NMB\u2019s internal controls related to financial reporting  in 2017, and noted a similar deficiency in 2018 because NMB still had not  addressed the problem sufficiently. Effective remediation of internal  control deficiencies, like those found by GAO and other audits, is  essential to achieving the objectives of the Federal Managers\u2019 Financial  Integrity Act, as amended (FMFIA). Unless NMB follows its own policy  and federal guidance on corrective action plans, it may not do what is  needed to address the risks associated with any deficiency.", "Likewise, NMB did not follow its policy to circulate draft financial audit  findings and provide a draft response to the Board. When NMB received  notice of a 2018 draft management letter from its independent financial  auditors, the letter was not circulated for over 5 months nor was the  Board provided with any draft response to the findings. Moreover,  although NMB\u2019s Board was notified of the letter\u2019s existence in November  2018, the Board did not ask for the letter prior to May 2019, and said  instead that they relied on the official in charge of the audit to follow  procedure. Federal internal control standards state that management  should obtain relevant data, including compliance data, in a timely  manner so that they can be used for monitoring, but NMB officials and the  Board did not obtain such information, putting the agency at risk for  missed opportunities to identify and address audit deficiencies.", "Additionally, NMB has not effectively monitored the sufficiency of its  internal controls as required under FMFIA. NMB has also not conducted  its planned fiscal year 2017 internal controls review of its Office of  Mediation or its fiscal year 2018 internal controls review of its Office of  Legal Affairs in order to complete its annual review and report under  FMFIA. Monitoring the effectiveness of internal controls provides the  basis for an agency\u2019s annual assessment and report of internal control, as  required by FMFIA. NMB officials said the agency had not completed  those reviews in a timely manner due to the timing of multiple audits  occurring at NMB. NMB recently scheduled those reviews for 2020.  Without monitoring its internal controls, NMB may not identify and be able  to address significant management problems that can impede the  agency\u2019s ability to achieve its goals.", "Although NMB has identified and taken steps to address some of these  audit and internal control deficiencies, it has not established an effective  process to consistently monitor adherence to its audit policy and federal  standards, evaluate the results, and remediate any deficiencies. For  example, NMB has revised its audit policy to assign responsibility for  audits and related follow-up to the CFO, who is tasked with helping NMB  develop appropriate corrective action plans. Additionally, the Board said it  addressed the issue of not circulating the audit management letter with  the responsible official and changed the protocols for circulating letters for  audit findings to include the Board in addition to the CFO. However, these  actions, by themselves, do not establish the monitoring activities required  by NMB\u2019s audit policy and federal internal control standards. Under  NMB\u2019s new audit policy, the Board has responsibility to provide top-level  oversight of NMB\u2019s management activities related to audit coordination  and follow-up; federal internal control standards require management to  establish and operate monitoring activities to monitor the internal control  system, evaluate the results, and remediate identified deficiencies on a  timely basis. Further, FMFIA requires regular evaluation of the  sufficiency of an agency\u2019s internal controls. The failure of NMB to conduct  the necessary reviews to support its annual assertion under FMFIA  hampers the agency\u2019s ability to identify risks in its internal controls and to  correct any associated material weaknesses, as well as deprives  Congress of information necessary to oversee the agency.

NMB has  decreased its backlog of rail arbitration cases, but it has no specific goals  against which to measure its progress toward reducing the backlog and  ensuring NMB and Congress can adequately assess NMB\u2019s resolution of  disputes. Likewise, while the Board\u2019s implementation of the climate  assessment illustrated that it recognizes the need to understand  employee concerns regarding communication across teams, agency  travel, and training for management, among other things, it has not fully  executed plans to address those concerns in order to benefit from that  assessment. Finally, while NMB has improved certain aspects of how it  implements its travel and telework policies, it has not sufficiently changed  the policies themselves to ensure that NMB policies are consistent with  the Federal Travel Regulation and the Telework Enhancement Act of  2010, respectively. Moreover, NMB established the Office of Information  Services and hired a new CIO to assist NMB in addressing information  security and privacy recommendations, but NMB still must change its  underlying information policies and procedures, including updating its  information privacy policy to reflect the current structure of NMB and  perform a review of its system security plans. Additionally, until NMB  complies with the recent FedRAMP requirements, its data may be at  greater risk in the event of a security incident.

While continuing resolutions can make it difficult for agencies to achieve  hiring and other goals, until NMB develops a written plan to document  NMB\u2019s process for reviewing and monitoring the agency\u2019s annual  appropriation to effectively manage its budgetary resources and  spending, NMB will likely continue to miss opportunities to accomplish its  goals. Similarly, until NMB establishes a specific process for the Board to  monitor and evaluate NMB\u2019s adherence to audit protocols, NMB will not  be well positioned to address audit recommendations from its financial  auditors and GAO, hindering efforts to improve its operations. While NMB  officials have told us that they did not have the resources for certain  changes that we recommended, such as information security and privacy  improvements, they had more resources than they actually used, as  evidenced by unused appropriations.
