The investigation disclosed illegal trading practices designed to enrich participants. In a September 1989 report to Congress, we concluded that most of the types of illegal practices disclosed could have been detected with improved audit trails\u2014the physical records of the price and time of each trade. We recommended that CFTC heighten audit trail standards by requiring a more accurate and comprehensive record of trades. Congress incorporated the then existing audit trail standards, as well as heightened standards, in the Futures Trading Practices Act (FTPA) of 1992 (P.L. 102-546). The FTPA required that, not later than 2 years after its enactment, CFTC report to Congress on the progress of U.S. futures exchanges in meeting the audit trail standards and include recommendations on the appropriateness of extending the October 28, 1995, deadline for meeting the standards or for modifying them. CFTC addressed two issues in its November 1994 report to Congress: (1) exchange compliance with the existing trade timing standards and (2) exchange progress toward complying with the heightened standards.CFTC did not recommend any extension of time or modification to the standards. The FTPA further required that we report our views on the issues CFTC addressed in its report. As agreed with your committees, our objectives were to report on the status of exchange compliance with the existing and heightened standards as well as CFTC actions to enforce the FTPA audit trail provisions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Futures contracts obligate the holder to buy or sell a specific amount or value of an underlying asset, reference rate, or index (called the underlying) at a specified price on a specified future date. This obligation can be met through delivery of the underlying or by cash settlement. Futures contracts are designed to manage the risk of changes in the value of underlying assets, rates, and indexes by allowing market users to economically replicate investments in them. By buying and selling futures, users can either assume or transfer the risk of price fluctuations. The futures markets also serve a price discovery function by establishing a price at which a buyer and seller will complete a transaction. These prices are often used in setting the terms of other contracts.", "Futures contracts are bought and sold at centralized auction markets called exchanges. In the United States, futures contracts are usually traded through a competitive system, called \u201copen-outcry,\u201d in which floor participants verbally make bids and offers to each other at centralized exchange locations, called \u201ctrading pits or rings.\u201d Two types of floor participants execute trades in these pits\u2014floor brokers and floor traders. Floor brokers execute trades for customers and may also execute trades for their personal or employer accounts. In contrast, floor traders execute trades only for their personal accounts.", "According to industry officials, U.S. futures markets are largely used by institutions rather than individual \u201cretail\u201d investors. These institutions include banks, insurance companies, mutual funds, corporate pension plans, large corporations, and various federal, state, and local governmental entities. Institutional users expect near instantaneous execution of their orders to secure targeted prices, especially when price movements in the futures markets become rapid. Delays in order execution can increase the risk of a user not obtaining a targeted price (\u201cprice slippage\u201d) and can thereby affect the success of the user\u2019s market strategy.", "The U.S. futures markets are self-regulated by the 11 active futures exchanges, with CFTC providing federal oversight. Weaknesses in controls over futures trading can provide dishonest floor participants with the opportunity to cheat customers and to conceal this cheating by manipulating the recorded price and time of trades. The FTPA requires that each exchange maintain and use controls to monitor trading in order to deter and detect such illegal activities. These controls must include audit trail systems that capture essential data on trade participants, terms, times, and sequencing.", "CFTC audit trail standards in effect prior to the enactment of the FTPA required that exchange audit trail systems (1) assign trade times accurate to within 1 minute of trade execution\u2014referred to as the 1-minute trade timing standard and (2) sequence trades for each floor broker and floor trader. All U.S. futures exchanges were required to comply with these standards. They were subsequently written into the FTPA along with the heightened standards, which required that audit trail data be continually provided to the exchange in an unalterable manner and that it be precise, complete, and independent. The FTPA made compliance with most of the heightened requirements subject to a CFTC determination on the practicability of implementation. Also, exchanges having a minimum average daily trading volume of less than 8,000 contracts in each of its contract markets could qualify for an exemption from the heightened standards if they could demonstrate substantial compliance with the act\u2019s audit trail standards and trade monitoring requirements.", "In November 1994, five exchanges were covered by the heightened standards because of their trading volume: (1) CBT; (2) CME; (3) the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange (CSCE); (4) the Commodity Exchange, Inc. (COMEX); and (5) the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). As of the quarter ended on September 30, 1995, a sixth exchange\u2014the New York Cotton Exchange (NYCE)\u2014exceeded the minimum volume criteria and became subject to these standards. Because it had just recently become subject to the standards, in October 1995, CFTC gave the exchange additional time to demonstrate good faith progress towards compliance with them. CFTC plans to test NYCE\u2019s audit trail system beginning in October 1996. As a result, this report does not discuss NYCE compliance with the heightened standards.", "Futures exchanges use one of four types of systems to meet audit trail standards\u2014manual, imputed timing, pit card timestamping, and computer trade matching. Five of the 11 active U.S. futures exchanges use manual systems to record trade times\u2014COMEX, the Kansas City Board of Trade, the Minneapolis Grain Exchange, NYCE, and the New York Futures Exchange. Under these systems, floor traders and brokers manually record the time of all trades in sequence on trading cards. Four active exchanges\u2014CBT, CME, CSCE, and the MidAmerica Commodity Exchange\u2014use imputed timing systems. These systems use computer-based algorithms to assign times to trades after they have occurred. They use information from audit trail documentation, including data recorded by floor traders and brokers and data generated independently of them. NYMEX is the only exchange using the pit card system. Under this system, the exchange assigns a time to each trade by timestamping a card that the seller is required to submit within 1 minute of trade execution. Finally, one active U.S. exchange, the Philadelphia Board of Trade, uses computers to match and execute trades.", "Electronic systems for meeting audit trail requirements are currently under development\u2014including an electronic hand-held trading terminal and electronic order routing systems. Although the FTPA does not mandate the use of any particular system to meet the heightened standards, Congress knew that three exchanges\u2014CBT, CME, and COMEX\u2014had voluntarily committed to developing electronic hand-held trading terminals when it considered the legislation. The exchanges expected that these electronic terminals would help meet the FTPA audit trail standards and also reduce costs by, among other things, reducing trading errors and administrative expenses. The FTPA legislative history indicates that Congress encouraged CFTC not to require fundamental changes to existing audit trail systems if doing so would cause disproportionate expense or might delay implementation of electronic systems. Under the FTPA, an exchange ultimately must demonstrate compliance with the act\u2019s audit trail standards to continue acting as a market in futures contracts. The act provides CFTC with the authority to issue a deficiency order should an exchange fail to comply with its audit trail standards. The act also sets forth conditions under which dual trading will be banned in high-volume markets. However, it allows CFTC to grant an exemption from the ban to an exchange that can show, among meeting other requirements, that it complies with the act\u2019s audit trail standards. All exchanges covered by the ban have filed petitions for an exemption, and these petitions are still pending. Because the ban on dual trading takes effect when CFTC acts to deny an exchange exemption petition, the ban has yet to take effect on any covered exchange."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To report on the status of exchange compliance with the existing and heightened standards and CFTC actions to enforce the FTPA audit trail provisions, we reviewed CFTC\u2019s (1) November 1994 report to Congress on audit trails; (2) June 1995 report on the results of exchange audit trail testing; (3) November 3, 1995, letters to four exchanges with agency conclusions related to their good faith efforts to comply with the FTPA; (4) August 1996 report on the status of exchange audit trail compliance and the results of further exchange audit trail testing; (5) other relevant CFTC studies and reports; and (6) the legislative history of the FTPA. We interviewed officials at CFTC headquarters in Washington, D.C., and at CFTC\u2019s Central Regional Office to discuss the FTPA audit trail standards and CFTC efforts to evaluate exchange compliance with them. We also interviewed CBT, CME, CSCE, and NYMEX officials to discuss their views on the standards and their efforts to comply with FTPA and CFTC requirements. We chose these four exchanges because CFTC selected them for initial audit trail testing. We also reviewed documents from these exchanges that described their audit trail systems and the results of exchange audit trail testing.", "We conducted our audit work between March 1995 and August 1996, primarily in Washington, D.C., and Chicago, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We obtained written comments on a draft of this report from CFTC, CBT, CME, and CSCE. These comments are discussed at the end of this letter and are reprinted in appendixes II through V. CFTC, CBT, CME, CSCE, and NYMEX provided additional technical comments on the draft report, which were incorporated as appropriate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CFTC Could Not Determine CBT or CME Compliance With the 1-Minute Trade Timing Standard", "paragraphs": ["CFTC could not determine whether CBT or CME\u2014the two largest futures exchanges\u2014complied with the 1-minute trade timing standard before issuing its November 1994 report to Congress or after subsequent testing of their audit trail systems. Before issuing its November 1994 report, CFTC required the exchanges to submit documentation of their audit trail systems\u2019 compliance with the FTPA audit trail standards. On the basis of this and other evidence, CFTC found that 7 of 11 exchanges were in compliance with the 1-minute trade timing and sequencing standards. CFTC concluded that the remaining four exchanges\u2014CBT, CME, CSCE, and NYMEX\u2014had not yet proven their audit trail systems met the standards. CFTC also required these exchanges to conduct two tests in 1994 to measure the capabilities of their audit trail systems. The first test addressed compliance with the 1-minute trade timing and sequencing standards and required that at least 90 percent of sampled trade execution times be consistent with the timing information and sequence recorded on supporting trade documents. CFTC conducted another round of comparable tests at CBT and CME in March 1996.", "CFTC reported in June 1995 that CBT and CME test one results were too imprecise to verify compliance with the 1-minute trade timing standard. These two exchanges use computer-based algorithms to impute or estimate trade execution times after the fact. The computer, based on timing information recorded on trade documentation, calculates a span of time, or timing window, during which a trade probably took place and then selects a likely execution time within that window. For exchanges with imputed timing systems, CFTC required, as part of the test, that the average length of the timing windows be 2 minutes or less to approximate the 1-minute trade timing standard. Although 90 percent of imputed trade times of sampled trades at CBT and CME were found to be accurate (i.e., consistent with the supporting documentation), the length of many timing windows was in excess of 2 minutes. At CBT, 41 percent of the accurate trade times had timing windows of 2 minutes or less. At CME, 72 percent of the accurate trade times had timing windows of 2 minutes or less. CFTC concluded that these results were too imprecise to verify compliance with the 1-minute trade timing standard and later, as discussed on page 12, recommended that CBT and CME implement numerous audit trail improvements. The March 1996 retests at CBT and CME showed that these numbers had improved to 69 percent and 80 percent, respectively, but were still short of the 90-percent precision level CFTC sought.", "Test one results at both CSCE and NYMEX exceeded the 90-percent accuracy requirement. Further, at CSCE, which also uses an imputed trade timing system, 91 percent of these accurately timed trades had timing windows of less than 2 minutes, thus meeting the accuracy requirement. At NYMEX, however, the sequence of trades determined by times stamped on pit cards by exchange employees was often different from the sequence recorded by traders and brokers on trading cards. NYMEX is addressing this problem with a new integrated trading/pit card.

As of October 28, 1995, when the standards took effect, the electronic trading terminals that exchanges had begun to develop that might bring some exchanges into compliance with them were not fully operational, and significant delays were envisioned. In the absence of the terminals, CFTC did not find any of the exchanges covered by the heightened standards to be in full compliance with them. Given this situation, the statute required that CFTC consider any circumstances that prevented compliance despite an exchange\u2019s good faith effort\u2014thus qualifying an exchange for a statutory safe harbor. COMEX received a de facto determination that it had made a good faith effort in November 1994, when CFTC determined its manual audit trail system did not require testing. In November 1995, based on exchange audit trail test results and implementation of recommended audit trail improvements, CFTC notified CSCE and NYMEX that they had qualified for a safe harbor but deferred a decision on CBT and CME until further testing. CFTC reported in August 1996 that, although the results of further testing showed considerable improvements, CBT and CME did not demonstrate compliance with the heightened standards. CFTC gave the exchanges until January 1, 1997, to make further improvements. In addition, CFTC has yet to address the practicability of certain of the audit trail provisions of the act, including the broker receipt timing requirement, but agency officials told us that CFTC plans to do so. It also plans to act on exchange petitions for exemption from the dual trading ban beginning in September 1996."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Heightened Standards Require Improved Audit Trails", "paragraphs": ["In addition to meeting the requirements of the existing 1-minute trade timing and sequencing standards, including capturing the essential data on the participants, terms, times, and sequencing of all trades, the heightened standards require that this information be continually provided to the exchange in an unalterable manner and that it be precise, complete, and independent. Continually providing data to an exchange could reduce the opportunity for floor brokers and traders to illegally alter the trading record. The requirement that the data be unalterable is to prevent floor brokers or traders from changing a trading record without detection.", "Also, while existing CFTC regulations required exchanges to sequence trades, the act requires exchange audit trail systems to be sufficiently precise to determine, to the extent practicable, the sequence of all trades by each floor trader and floor broker. Exact trade sequencing would help detect trading abuses, such as trading ahead of customer orders. In addition, the FTPA now requires the exchanges to obtain, to the extent practicable, more complete timing information for customer orders, including the time an order is received on the exchange floor, received by the floor broker for execution, and reported from the floor as executed. More complete times could also improve an exchange\u2019s ability to accurately sequence trades.", "Finally, the act requires that the execution time for each trade be recorded independently of the person making the trade or derived through automatic or other similarly reliable means. Independent or automatic trade recording could increase the reliability of the data collected by preventing the broker or trader from falsifying the record. The FTPA made compliance with this and most of its other audit trail requirements subject to a CFTC determination on the practicability of implementation. The FTPA authorized CFTC to defer the deadline for compliance with the heightened standards if it determined that circumstances beyond the control of an exchange prevented compliance, despite affirmative good faith efforts to comply. Also, the act required CFTC to exempt an exchange from the heightened standards if the average daily trading volume in each of its contract markets was less than 8,000 contracts and if it could demonstrate substantial compliance with the act\u2019s audit trail standards and trade monitoring requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Electronic Trading Terminals Were Not Fully Operational and Have Been Significantly Delayed", "paragraphs": ["Three of the exchanges covered by the heightened standards have worked on electronic trading terminals for recording and processing trades, but none of these terminals is fully operational. The terminals were intended to provide the exchanges with continual and unalterable audit trail data that would be more precise, complete, and independent. However, they are limited in their ability to create a \u201cperfect\u201d audit trail. For example, CFTC officials told us that data could be altered before being entered into the terminals. CME officials also indicated that, while the terminals can record the precise time that a floor trader or broker begins to record a trade, the floor trader or broker may be forced to delay entering trade information in order to execute other customer or personal trades. CFTC officials told us that, consistent with the FTPA, the agency has never taken the position that electronic trading terminals are the only way to meet the heightened standards. These officials also said that the agency will determine the extent to which the terminals satisfy the statutory standards based on the particulars of their individual design and operation.", "COMEX began developing a hand-held terminal in 1986 for recording and timing trades. NYMEX acquired the rights to this project when it merged with COMEX in 1994, making COMEX an operating division. NYMEX subsequently decided not to pursue the project because of developmental problems and because it believed that its manual audit trail system met the requirements of the FTPA. After the initial results of the CFTC/Department of Justice undercover investigation were announced, CBT and CME began a joint venture to automate trade recording and timing by developing a hand-held automated data input terminal, called AUDIT. According to CBT and CME, as of June 30, 1996, they had incurred expenditures of $14.2 million and $9.1 million, respectively, in external and internal costs to develop AUDIT. The exchanges initially told CFTC that AUDIT would be operational by the October 28, 1995, statutory deadline for implementing the FTPA heightened audit trail standards. However, CBT and CME informed CFTC before the issuance of its 1994 report that AUDIT would not be operational by October 1995. The exchanges have since indicated that further delays in implementation would occur and that the planned capability of AUDIT to handle customer trades would be delayed, perhaps significantly. CBT officials told us that they expect delays in implementing the customer trade processing capability of AUDIT because of the need to develop an order routing system for a new trading floor that is under construction. CME officials also told us that, although the exchange is continuing with its efforts to implement AUDIT, it is now considering the use of off-the-shelf technology for customer trade processing because of AUDIT software development problems.", "In addition to AUDIT, CBT and CME are developing other electronic systems that could enhance audit trails and contribute to compliance with the act\u2019s provisions. CBT and CME have jointly developed an automated trade order processing system, called TOPS Route. Both exchanges have also developed and continue to enhance universal broker work stations, called Electronic Clerk at CBT and CUBS at CME. CBT is also developing a booth work station called Computer Order Management, Entry, and Timing, or COMET. TOPS Route rapidly transmits orders from a firm\u2019s office to its booth on the trading floor and records the time that an order is received at the booth and the time it is filled. CUBS and Electronic Clerk organize orders received on the floor and provide the time that the broker receives an order, the time the order is filled, and the time the broker confirms the order fill to the firm\u2019s booth on the trading floor. COMET provides a mechanism for delivering and receiving order information and other messages into and out of the trading pit. According to CME, TOPS Route is expected to be implemented for most clearing firms, while the extent of CUBS implementation will depend on space constraints and the differing needs of brokers. In June 1996, CME began a 6-month pilot program in one of its markets under which TOPS Route and CUBS are integrated to form a continuous order routing system. CBT expects TOPS Route and COMET/Electronic Clerk to be substantially implemented when its new trading floor opens in February 1997.", "These automated order routing systems could enhance audit trails by meeting the FTPA requirements for recording the time an order reaches the exchange floor, the time the broker receives an order, and the time the order fill is recorded. According to CFTC officials, these systems should result in better timing data for orders by augmenting existing sequencing information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CFTC Gave CBT and CME Additional Time to Improve Their Audit Trails", "paragraphs": ["CFTC determined that CSCE and NYMEX had made good faith efforts to comply with the heightened standards, thus qualifying them for a statutory safe harbor. COMEX was in effect granted a safe harbor in November 1994 when it was not required to test its audit trail system. CFTC reported that COMEX had produced evidence that its manual system met the 1-minute trade timing standard. CFTC initially deferred a decision on whether CBT and CME had made a good faith effort to comply with the heightened standards until after a retest of their audit trail systems. After its March 1996 retests, CFTC gave the exchanges additional time to improve their audit trails without determining whether they had qualified for a safe harbor.", "To assess progress towards compliance with the heightened standards in the absence of electronic systems, in 1994, CFTC required four exchanges\u2014CBT, CME, CSCE, and NYMEX\u2014to perform a second test of trade sequencing capabilities, using more exacting criteria than were used for the first test. According to CFTC officials, these criteria were designed to approximate the precision or enhanced sequencing requirements of the heightened standards. As with the first test, CFTC required that 90 percent of sampled trades be accurately sequenced. The test results showed that only CSCE met the 90-percent accuracy requirement for all samples tested. CFTC recommended that NYMEX implement 9, CBT implement 17, and CME implement 18 additional improvements to their audit trail systems to increase timing precision and show progress towards compliance with the heightened standards. Although CSCE passed the test, CFTC recommended that CSCE implement six improvements to its audit trail system. At the same time it made these recommendations, CFTC urged the exchanges to continue efforts to implement electronic systems. (See app. I for a list of CFTC\u2019s recommendations.)", "According to CFTC, prompt implementation of the recommended audit trail improvements would demonstrate a good faith effort toward meeting the heightened standards. A finding of good faith would mean that an exchange had satisfied the statutory requirement for progress and, therefore, was entitled to a safe harbor. CFTC found that both CSCE and NYMEX had made good faith efforts to comply with the standards by the statutory deadline. CSCE agreed to implement all but one recommendation. However, CFTC concluded that this recommendation did not relate to trade timing accuracy and, therefore, was not material to a good faith finding. NYMEX agreed to implement all but one audit trail recommendation but offered CFTC an acceptable alternative. Both CBT and CME agreed to implement almost all of CFTC\u2019s audit trail recommendations or offered alternatives. CBT declined to implement two of CFTC\u2019s recommendations based on tests it conducted. CBT said these tests indicated that the recommendations disrupted trading, would increase trade processing costs, or would not improve audit trail accuracy. CBT also offered CFTC an acceptable alternative for one recommendation. CME declined to implement one recommendation but informed CFTC that it would continue to evaluate the recommendation. The exchange said it based its decision on tests it conducted that indicated the recommendation disrupted trading and would increase trade processing costs. CME also offered CFTC an acceptable alternative for one recommendation. (See app. I for details on the exchanges\u2019 responses to CFTC\u2019s recommendations.)", "The CFTC recommendation that both CBT and CME declined to implement, based on their tests, was the requirement that floor traders manually record the execution time for the first and either sixth or last trade on every trading card. As discussed on page 4, these two exchanges use computer-based algorithms to impute trade times after the fact, rather than requiring floor traders or brokers to record the times that personal or customer trades are executed. CBT reported that its own separate tests showed that adding manual times to trading cards disrupted trading, increased clearing firms\u2019 trade processing costs, and resulted in less accurate computer-imputed times because traders were unable to record accurate times during hectic trading. CME reported that traders involved in its separate test had indicated that recording these times disrupted trading. However, CME\u2019s tests did not show a reduction in audit trail accuracy. Nonetheless, the exchange expressed concern that this requirement would increase trade processing costs for clearing firms and could result in delays in execution of customer orders or degrade overall market efficiency.", "In November 3, 1995, correspondence, CFTC notified CSCE and NYMEX that they had qualified for the statutory safe harbor. Although CFTC did not indicate when the safe harbor would end, CFTC told the exchanges that it would retest them to evaluate whether the changes they made brought them into compliance with the FTPA audit trail standards. CFTC reported in August 1996 that it plans to assess CSCE and NYMEX audit trail improvements during rule enforcement reviews in 1997.", "CFTC also notified CBT and CME on November 3, 1995, that a decision on whether they qualified for the statutory safe harbor would be deferred until the results of another round of tests were obtained. CFTC tested these exchanges in March 1996 to evaluate the effect of the agreed-to improvements on their audit trails. The agency reported in August 1996 that the test results showed improvements in the precision of the exchanges\u2019 audit trails but that neither exchange met the heightened standards. CFTC did not determine that CBT and CME had demonstrated the good faith effort required to be granted a safe harbor under the act. Instead, CFTC gave each exchange until October 28, 1996, to report on how they intended to improve their audit trails and until January 1997 to implement the improvements.", "Implementation of all CFTC recommendations will not necessarily result in full compliance with the heightened standards. CFTC reported in June 1995 that the exchanges may need to implement additional improvements to their systems to achieve compliance. According to CFTC officials, full compliance with the heightened standards is an objective against which the exchanges must continually be tested as the quality of audit trail data also depends on other factors, such as the accuracy of data entry, the integrity of pricing data, and the handling of trade errors. Ultimately, all of the exchanges covered by the FTPA heightened standards must comply with them or be subject to CFTC disciplinary action unless, as discussed next, CFTC finds compliance with a standard impracticable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CFTC Has Not Fully Addressed the Practicability of All of the Act\u2019s Provisions", "paragraphs": ["Several exchanges have raised concerns about CFTC\u2019s obligations under the FTPA for determining the practicability of the heightened audit trail requirements, including the need to assess the cost of compliance as well as to address differences between the exchanges. As previously discussed, the act requires CFTC to address the practicability of most of the heightened standards and authorizes the agency to promulgate standards, in some cases by either rule or order. To date, CFTC has issued guidance on how orders \u201cflashed\u201d into a trading pit can satisfy the broker receipt timing requirement of the act, but has not addressed the practicability of capturing broker receipt times for nonflashed orders. According to CFTC, its June 1995 recommendations to the four exchanges represent guidance on how to demonstrate the good faith effort required by the FTPA in the absence of full compliance.", "In June 1996, the exchanges testified that the FTPA requirement to capture broker receipt time was not currently practicable. Separately, CBT and CSCE also expressed concern that due to differences in trading volume and in the way customer orders are routed, trades recorded, and execution times derived, audit trail features that are practicable at one exchange may be impracticable at another exchange without significantly disrupting trading. CBT told us that the act contemplates that CFTC\u2019s practicability determination would result from testing its proposed enhancements to audit trails and conducting cost-benefit analyses of them. Both CBT and CME said the act contemplates that CFTC would consider the cost of enhancements and the effectiveness of reasonable alternatives to proposed enhancements. CSCE was concerned that CFTC make its practicability determination on an exchange-by-exchange basis and that those determinations consider the financial capability of the exchange.", "CFTC officials told us that the agency intends to provide further guidance on the practicability of the broker receipt time requirement. They said that determining the practicability of this requirement is a dynamic process that will be affected by ongoing exchange initiatives to develop automated order routing systems. They also said that further dialogue with the exchanges and the floor broker community needs to occur before the agency can reach a conclusion on the practicability of capturing broker receipt times for nonflashed orders and that CFTC has scheduled an industry roundtable discussion for October 1996 where this topic will be addressed. CFTC also reported that it plans to address the practicability of further integrating customer and personal trades at CBT and CME.", "According to CFTC, the FTPA does not require it to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of audit trail enhancements. CFTC reported, however, that the cost of achieving a perfect audit trail may be prohibitive and that the costs of complying with the heightened standards must be taken into account. Further, the agency reported that the act does not specify the method of achieving compliance but rather sets forth a performance standard that can be satisfied by any means. CFTC has used testing to determine if exchange enhancements bring them into compliance with the act\u2019s audit trail standards. As part of this process, CFTC has let the exchanges decide whether to implement electronic systems or lower-cost manual measures to meet the standards. CFTC has also accepted certain lower-cost exchange alternatives for demonstrating a good faith effort to comply with the heightened audit trail standards. CFTC reported that the agency accounted for exchange differences during audit trail testing at the four exchanges.

The statute also requires that dual trading at an exchange be exempted from the ban if the exchange can show that it has an effective trade monitoring system that includes compliance with the act\u2019s audit trail standards. The FTPA included the ban to limit the opportunity for trading abuses to occur. It linked an exemption from the ban to compliance with the act\u2019s audit trail standards because an effective audit trail facilitates the detection of trading abuses and, therefore, acts as a deterrent to them.", "The dual trading ban was to take effect 30 days after the effective date of the dual trading regulations or whenever CFTC acted to deny an exchange\u2019s exemption petition. On July 28, 1993, CFTC issued the dual trading regulations, which required that a petition for exemption from the dual trading ban be supported by evidence that, among other things, at least 90 percent of the trade times assigned by an exchange audit trail meet the 1-minute trade timing standard.

According to the act and regulations, the suspension would remain in effect until the agency ruled on the petitions. The FTPA required CFTC to act on an exemption petition within 75 days of receipt, or as soon as practicable. The exchanges covered by the ban all filed petitions, but these petitions are still awaiting CFTC action. As a result, the exchanges are authorized to continue dual trading.

Also, the exchanges we reviewed have continued to make progress toward compliance with them. Nonetheless, we are concerned that the momentum toward achieving compliance could be lost now that the legislatively mandated deadline has passed without any covered exchange being found in full compliance. The audit trails of CBT and CME\u2014the two largest futures exchanges\u2014do not yet meet the heightened standards. CFTC also concluded that they were insufficiently precise to verify compliance with the 1-minute trade timing standard that predates the FTPA. In addition, implementation of electronic trading terminals that have the potential to bring these exchanges into compliance with the standards is uncertain. Also, it is not clear when the exchanges currently qualifying for the statutory safe harbor will achieve compliance with the heightened standards through continued good faith efforts. Further, CFTC has not yet fully addressed the practicability of all the act\u2019s requirements as part of its ongoing effort to enforce the heightened standards. Finally, the dual trading provisions of FTPA have not yet been fully implemented. Thus, it is particularly important that Congress be informed of exchange progress toward meeting the heightened audit trail standards and other requirements of the act as well as steps CFTC is taking to facilitate such progress. The FTPA reporting requirement achieved this result, but CFTC issued its report in 1994 and no further reporting requirements exist."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Chairperson, CFTC, inform Congress periodically on exchange progress towards compliance with the FTPA heightened audit trail standards and on implementation of the dual trading ban\u2014including any mitigating factors delaying compliance or implementation and the steps CFTC is taking to encourage continued progress.

CME indicated that, contrary to our report conclusions, the exchange is in substantial compliance with the FTPA audit trail requirements, either through direct compliance or because some requirements of the act are impracticable. First, CME infers that we made an assessment of its compliance with the act, reflecting a misunderstanding of our review objectives and resulting conclusions. Congress delegated responsibility for ensuring compliance with the act\u2019s audit trail provisions to CFTC. We were responsible for reporting on the status of compliance with the act, including CFTC actions to enforce exchange compliance with it. Second, as stated in our report, CFTC plans to work with the exchanges to address the practicability of the act\u2019s provisions related to broker receipt time and with CBT and CME to address the practicability of further integrating customer and personal trades.", "In addition to CME, the other three exchanges indicated varying degrees of disagreement with CFTC\u2019s conclusions that their audit trail systems were not yet in compliance with the act\u2019s requirements. CFTC reached its initial conclusions about compliance with the act based on testing of exchange audit trails and exchange implementation of its subsequent recommendations. CFTC has done additional testing and evaluation of CBT and CME audit trails and has reported that, although improvements were made, the test results did not show compliance with the heightened standards.", "CME commented that we and CFTC have focused exclusively on statistical measurement without reference to the underlying purpose of an audit trail\u2014deterring trade practice violations. We agree that the ultimate measure of the effectiveness of an audit trail is its ability to deter as well as detect such violations. However, the effectiveness of an audit trail in these areas can be difficult to verify. The use of statistical measures along with other relevant information, provides a baseline against which progress toward compliance with the audit trail standards can be measured. It also provides a basis, given the differing exchange audit trail systems, of comparing the progress of the exchanges to each other. The latter provides some assurance that the standards are consistently and, therefore, fairly applied.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Chairperson, CFTC, and other interested parties.

The following 11 recommendations were common to both exchanges: (1) Limit the number of trades recorded on each trading card to six. (2) Record and use manual execution times for at least the first and sixth trades on each trading card, and use more manual times in the lower volume markets. (3) Use one-sided trading cards to record personal buys and sells in sequence. (4) Use a new trading card with the change of each bracket period. (5) Use a special indicator to designate customer orders \u201cflashed\u201d into the trading pit. (6) Use seconds in the imputed timing system where available, including seconds from customer order ticket timestamps. (7) Add the time a customer trade is stamped as executed to the imputed timing system. (8) Promptly supply members with information on audit trail data inconsistencies and require corrections that reflect actual events. (9) Aggressively enforce audit trail data recordation and submission requirements, especially for spread trades, and ensure that timing data are entered correctly. (10) Aggressively enforce order ticket timestamping procedures for orders flashed into the trading pit. (11) Reprogram the imputed timing system to use all additional data obtained as a result of CFTC\u2019s recommendations when assigning execution times to trades.", "CFTC recommended that CBT implement the following additional improvements: (12) Complete efforts to capture real-time quotes in the time and sales register for trades executed during the opening of the trading  session.

CBT said that its own separate test results indicated that requiring manual execution times decreased the accuracy level of its imputed timing system because traders were unable to record accurate execution times during hectic trading. According to CBT, some traders commented that this requirement disrupted their trade recordation efficiency, and that due to being focused on executing trades, they frequently were unable to record execution times until several minutes after the actual time of execution. CBT clearing firms also indicated that this requirement would increase trade processing costs.", "CME declined to implement this recommendation but informed CFTC that it would continue to evaluate the recommendation. The exchange\u2019s separate tests indicated that the requirement impaired trading. According to CME, some higher-volume floor traders complained that they could not continue to trade at their accustomed pace while having to manually record execution times during busy periods in the market.

These tests indicated that this recommendation did not substantially improve audit trail accuracy. According to CBT, reporting this information to exchange price reporters also significantly reduced price reporting efficiency and disrupted trading.
