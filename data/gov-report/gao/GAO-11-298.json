While most security operations are left to private airport operators, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), provides guidance on threats and vulnerabilities. In 2004, TSA issued suggested security enhancements that airports could implement voluntarily. Unlike commercial airports, in most cases general aviation airports are not required to implement specific security measures. GAO was asked to perform onsite assessments at selected airports with general aviation operations to determine what physical security measures they have to prevent unauthorized access. With advance notice, GAO investigators overtly visited a nonrepresentative selection of 13 airports, based on TSA-determined risk factors. Three of the airports also serve commercial aviation and are therefore subject to TSA security regulations. Using TSA's voluntary recommendations and GAO investigators' security expertise, GAO determined whether certain security measures were in place. GAO also requested documentation of incidents of unauthorized access. Results of GAO's assessments cannot be projected to all general aviation airports and are not meant to imply that the airports failed to implement required security measures.."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The 13 airports GAO visited had multiple security measures in place to protect against unauthorized access, although the specific measures and potential vulnerabilities varied across the airports. The 3 airports also supporting commercial aviation had generally implemented all the security measures GAO assessed, whereas GAO identified potential vulnerabilities at most of the 10 general aviation airports that could allow unauthorized access to aircraft or airport grounds, facilities, or equipment. For example, 12 of the 13 airports had perimeter fencing or natural barriers as suggested by TSA; but at 6 of the airports fencing was partially bordered by bushes or trees or located next to a parking lot, which can obstruct surveillance or allow someone to scale or topple the fence. GAO found that none of the 10 general aviation airports had lighting along their perimeters. Perimeter lighting provides both a real and psychological deterrent, and allows security personnel to maintain visual assessment during darkness. However, officials at several airports stated that neighborhood street lights provided perimeter lighting, and all 13 airports had lighting around their hangars. The 10 general aviation airports' use of intrusion monitoring varied, with closed-circuit TV (CCTV) cameras and onsite law enforcement being more prevalent than an intrusion detection system, which can consist of multiple monitors including building alarms and CCTV. TSA guidance states that such systems can reduce or replace the need for physical security personnel to patrol an entire facility or perimeter. According to airport officials, several incidents of unauthorized access have occurred within approximately the past 10 years at three of the airports, though they were unable to provide documentation in all cases. Three incidents did not involve access to aircraft, but rather to airport grounds. In separate incidents, two airplanes were stolen or taken from one airport but later recovered. Airport officials informed GAO that they took corrective actions in response to these incidents as appropriate. DHS generally concurred with GAO's findings and indicated that TSA will work in partnership with the general aviation community to address vulnerabilities. DHS also noted that a lack of funding will be a challenge for most airports. GAO shared its findings with officials at the 13 airports it visited and incorporated their comments as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["General aviation encompasses all civil aviation except scheduled  passenger and cargo operations, excludes military flights, and accounts for  three-quarters of U.S. air traffic, operating among more than 19,000  airports. This air traffic ranges from small propeller planes flying from  private runways to large jets based at major airports. According to the  National Air Transportation Association, the general aviation industry  contributes about $150 billion a year to the U.S. economy and employs  more than 1.3 million people. Because of the size and diversity of the  general aviation industry, as well as the competing needs of commercial  aviation, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), the agency  responsible for civil aviation security in the United States, has left most  responsibility for security to airport operators, though it does provide  guidance on threats and vulnerabilities and imposes regulatory  requirements in some cases.", "The damage that can be caused by even small general aviation aircraft was  demonstrated by the February 2010 crash of a single-engine plane into an  Internal Revenue Service (IRS) building in Austin, Texas. Larger aircraft,  such as midsized and larger business jets, could cause catastrophic  damage to structures and pose a greater risk if they are located near major  metropolitan areas. Preventing unauthorized access to general aviation  airports and aircraft may help mitigate some security risks.", "In response to your interest in the security risks posed by unauthorized  individuals gaining access to airports with general aviation operations, we  performed on-site assessments at selected airports with general aviation  operations to determine what physical security measures they have to  prevent unauthorized access. To do so, we identified a nonrepresentative  selection of 13 airports that exhibit at least two of the following  characteristics that potentially affect an airport\u2019s security posture under  voluntary TSA guidelines: (1) airport is a public use airport, (2) airport  location is within 30 nautical miles of a mass population center of at least  1 million people, (3) based aircraft over 12,500 pounds are located at the  airport, (4) airport has at least one runway with a length of at least 5,000  feet, and (5) over 50,000 annual aircraft operations\u2014takeoffs and  landings\u2014occur at the airport. We selected airports from a variety of  geographic locations and that represented a range in the number of annual  aircraft operations. Our selection of airports also includes three airports  with both commercial and general aviation operations that operate under  TSA security requirements.", "With advance notice, we visited all 13 airports and assessed each airport\u2019s  security measures against TSA\u2019s voluntary security guidelines and other  criteria based on our expertise in performing security assessments and  industry guidance. In addition, we interviewed airport management and  other officials; obtained photographic evidence of security measures;  requested documentation related to any specific incidents of unauthorized  access at each airport; and attempted to obtain information on each  airport\u2019s procedures, if any, for screening passengers, their carry-on items,  and packages or cargo.", "We focused on physical security measures implemented by airports and  related to outer airport perimeter security and curbside-to-planeside  security. We did not test the effectiveness of the security, nor did we  assess measures not directly related to physical security, such as pilot  background checks or other intelligence-gathering activities. Although we  focused on measures implemented by airports and therefore under direct  control of airport management, we gave partial credit when individual  aircraft or facility operators, owners, or tenants were responsible for  implementing certain security measures.", "The results of our assessments are meant to illustrate the variation in  physical security conditions at the selected airports. Since TSA does not  require the implementation of security measures for airports with only  general aviation operations, our assessments are not meant to imply that  any of the 13 airports we visited have failed to implement required security  measures. Moreover, fixed-base operators at these 13 airports may have  security measures in place to prevent unauthorized access that we did not  observe during our visits. We generally did not attempt to interview  officials from individual operators and we did not examine individual state  laws, regulations, or other requirements applicable to general aviation  operations. We acknowledge that the specific security measures we  focused on are not the only security measures that could prevent  unauthorized access. The results of our assessments cannot be projected  to all airports with general aviation operations nationwide. We provided  officials from all 13 airports an opportunity to comment on our findings as  they related to their specific airports. We incorporated their technical  comments into our report as appropriate.", "We conducted work for this engagement from April 2010 to May 2011 in  accordance with standards prescribed by the Council of the Inspectors  General on Integrity and Efficiency. Additional information about our  scope and methodology is provided in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["General aviation encompasses all civil aviation except scheduled  passenger and cargo operations (i.e., commercial) and excludes military  operations. It includes air medical-ambulance operations, flight schools,  corporate aviation, and privately owned aircraft. Altogether, more than  200,000 aircraft\u2014from small aircraft with minimal payload capacities to  business jets and large jets typically used by commercial airlines, such as  the Boeing 747\u2014operate at more than 19,000 facilities, including heliports.  The sole common characteristic of general aviation operations is that  flights are on demand rather than routinely scheduled. General aviation  operations take place at more than 5,000 public use airports, almost all of  which serve general aviation exclusively. However, general aviation  operations may also take place alongside scheduled airline operations at  larger commercial airports.", "TSA, part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is the primary  agency responsible for civil aviation security, which includes general  aviation operations. TSA provides the general aviation community with  guidance on threats and vulnerabilities, and enforces regulatory  requirements for specific airports with general aviation operations.  However, because of competing needs for commercial aviation security  funding and the vastness and diversity of the general aviation network, the  bulk of the responsibility for assessing and enhancing security at the  general aviation airports falls on airport operators.", "In 2004, TSA issued voluntary Security Guidelines for General Aviation  Airports. These guidelines are intended to provide general aviation  airport owners, operators, and users with recommendations for security  concepts, technology, and enhancements. In addition, airport operators  are encouraged to perform a self-administered risk assessment of their  airports based on a measurement tool provided by TSA. TSA recommends  that general aviation airports use this tool to determine what security  enhancements may be most appropriate to make given the airport\u2019s  location, number of based aircraft, runway length, and number of annual  operations. Based on the results of these self-assessments, the operators  can decide whether to implement the appropriate countermeasures  suggested, such as fencing; perimeter controls; locks on aircraft, hangars,  or both; closed-circuit television (CCTV); lighting; access control systems;  and other security features.", "In addition to issuing suggested security guidelines, TSA has implemented  security requirements that are typically related to an airport\u2019s location and  size of aircraft. For example, pilots flying to and from general aviation  airports within Washington, D.C., airspace must follow security measures  including background checks and adherence to specific security  procedures. For general aviation flights to and from Ronald Reagan  Washington National Airport, TSA officials also inspect crew members and  passengers, including performing background checks, and their baggage.  In addition, TSA requires private charter services using aircraft that either  (1) have a maximum takeoff weight greater than 100,309 pounds (45,500  kilograms) or (2) have 61 or more passenger seats to implement a security  program that includes passenger screening through metal detection  devices, X-ray screening for carry-on and checked baggage, and hiring a  certified passenger and baggage screening workforce. Individual  operators are generally responsible for conducting these requirements  rather than airport officials.", "In addition, TSA encourages the general aviation community and the  public to be vigilant about general aviation security by suggesting specific  security awareness and measures for reporting suspicious activity and  securing aircraft and aircraft facilities. Examples include  aircraft with unusual modifications or activity;    pilots appearing to be under the control of others;    unfamiliar persons loitering around the field;   suspicious aircraft lease or rental requests;   anyone making threats; and    unusual, suspicious activities or circumstances.", "The TSA program also advises aircraft operators to (1) always keep their  aircraft locked, (2) refrain from leaving keys in unattended aircraft, (3) use  secondary locks or aircraft disablers, and (4) lock hangars when they are  unattended.", "The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007  requires TSA to develop a standardized threat and vulnerability  assessment program for general aviation airports and to implement a  program to perform such assessments on a risk-managed basis at general  aviation airports. From January through April 2010, TSA invited  approximately 3,000 general aviation airport operators to complete its  online General Aviation Airport Vulnerability Assessment Survey. The  survey was intended to highlight the security conditions and  vulnerabilities of the general aviation community. According to TSA, the  results of the survey were calculated to discover the general strengths and  weaknesses in the general aviation community, and to show an overall  picture of general aviation security measures at a national level and by  regions. In addition, TSA stated that the survey results may be used to  show a need to develop grants or other means of funding to improve  general aviation security measures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Security Measures and Potential Vulnerabilities Identified at Selected Airports", "paragraphs": ["The 13 airports we visited had multiple security measures in place to  protect against unauthorized access. The 3 airports that handle  commercial flights in addition to general aviation flights (airports 11, 12,  and 13 in figure 1) had implemented nearly all of the security measures we  assessed. These 3 airports are required to follow TSA regulations because  of their commercial flights. However, we identified potential  vulnerabilities at the 10 general aviation airports that could allow  unauthorized access to aircraft or airport grounds, facilities, or equipment.  These vulnerabilities include security measures discussed specifically in  TSA\u2019s 2004 Security Guidelines for General Aviation Airports, which  offered suggestions for general aviation airports to voluntarily enhance  their security.", "Security measures varied across the airports we visited, as well as by the  type of security measure. Of the 10 general aviation airports, nearly all had  in place or partially in place the following security measures: perimeter  fencing or natural barriers, lighting around hangars, aircraft and hangars  locked and secured, and CCTV cameras in areas related to unauthorized  access. None of the 10 general aviation airports had perimeter lighting in  place, and only 1 of the general aviation airports had an intrusion  detection system, as discussed below. Figure 1 shows the security  measures we observed during our on-site assessments at 13 selected  airports.", "In their technical comments, officials from some airports mentioned  security measures that were implemented after we conducted our  assessments or that we did not observe in place during our assessments;  as such, we were unable to verify that these security measures are in place  at the airports in question. For example, an official from airport 1  informed us that the airport has implemented sign-in and sign-out  procedures for tracking transient pilots. In addition, an official from  airport 9 stated that law enforcement officers provide training on aircraft  and hangar security to operators and tenants at the airport.", "Fencing. All but one airport had complete or partial perimeter fencing or  was protected in part by a natural barrier, such as a body of water. TSA\u2019s  guidelines suggest that fencing, natural barriers, or other physical barriers  can be used to deter and delay the access of unauthorized persons onto  sensitive areas of airports\u2014such as terminal areas, aircraft storage, and  maintenance areas\u2014and also designed to be a visual and psychological  deterrent as well as a physical barrier. One airport had no perimeter  fencing in place. While we did not seek to systematically test the  effectiveness of security measures in place at all the airports we visited, at  this airport our investigators were able to freely drive onto the runway and  bring their car next to a jet aircraft. They were not stopped or approached  by any airport security, management, or personnel or other individuals  while they approached and drove around near the aircraft. According to an  official from this airport, it is one of many open field airports located in  the United States. He added that pilot vigilance plays a key role in the  airport\u2019s security, as pilots are responsible for maintaining awareness of  suspicious individuals on airport grounds. Figures 2 and 3 show our  investigators driving their car onto the runway of this airport and  approaching the jet aircraft mentioned above.", "Although 12 of the 13 airports had full or partial perimeter fencing, or  other barriers in place, the fencing at 6 airports was partially bordered by  bushes or trees, partially obstructed from view, or located next to a  parking lot. TSA\u2019s suggested guidelines caution that such factors may limit  the effectiveness of perimeter fencing. For example, bushes or other  growth can obstruct surveillance of the surrounding areas, and a parking  lot may enable someone to use a vehicle to crash through the fence.  According to TSA\u2019s suggested security guidelines, such incidents have  occurred. Figures 4 and 5 show perimeter fencing located next to trees or  a parking lot.", "Lighting. All 13 airports we visited had lighting around their hangars, and  all but 3 airports had lighting at designated access points. Ten of the  airports we visited\u2014the 10 airports that handle general aviation but not  commercial aviation\u2014did not have lighting along their outer perimeters.  TSA\u2019s suggested guidelines note the effectiveness of lighting in deterring  and detecting individuals seeking unauthorized access to airports, but  caution that such lighting should not interfere with aircraft operations.  The three airports we visited that did have perimeter lighting in place  serve a combination of commercial and general aviation traffic. Perimeter  lighting provides both a real and psychological deterrent, and allows  security personnel to maintain visual-assessment capability during  darkness. At several airports we visited, airport managers or other officials  stated that streetlights in the neighborhoods surrounding their airports\u2014 lights that are not operated or controlled by airport management\u2014 provided lighting of the perimeter.", "Secured aircraft. All 13 airports we visited had measures at least  partially in place so that aircraft and hangars were locked and secured.  The 3 airports that serve a combination of commercial and general  aviation traffic all had these measures in place. At several general aviation  airports, we found that keeping aircraft (4 of 10), hangars (7 of 10), or both  locked and secured was the responsibility of individual aircraft or facility  operators, owners, or tenants rather than airport management. Two of the  airports we visited are located in New Jersey; at these airports, officials  informed us that state law requires all aircraft to be secured through the  use of two locks. TSA\u2019s suggested guidelines note that securing aircraft is  the most basic method of enhancing airport security, and that employing  multiple methods of securing aircraft makes it more difficult for  unauthorized individuals to gain access to aircraft.", "On-site security. While most of the airports we visited had on-site law  enforcement or other security\u2014such as private security guards\u2014in place,  several airports either had no on-site security at all or had on-site security  present only during certain times of day, usually in the late evening and  early morning. However, the three airports we visited that serve a  combination of commercial and general aviation traffic all had this  measure in place. Officials from several airports we visited stated that law  enforcement officers conduct regular patrols of their airports or respond  to emergencies within 3 to 5 minutes; however, these law enforcement  officers are not on-site at these airports at all times. The presence of on- site security helps to prevent or impede attempts of unauthorized access,  and could include inspection of vital perimeter and access points. TSA\u2019s  guidelines suggest that airports consider having local law enforcement  officers regularly or randomly patrol ramps and aircraft hangar areas,  potentially with increased patrols during periods of heightened security.", "Detecting intruders. Nearly all of the airports we visited\u201412 of 13\u2014had  CCTV cameras installed to monitor for unauthorized access; at 2 of these  12 airports, the CCTV cameras were monitored by individual operators. At  one airport, the CCTV cameras were aimed at the administration building  and other areas, but not at the perimeter or designated access points. Most  of the airports we visited (9 of 13) lacked an intrusion detection system,  which may consist of building alarms, CCTV monitoring, or both. TSA  guidance states that such systems can replace the need for physical  security personnel to patrol an entire facility or perimeter. For example, if  an intrusion is detected, the system administrator could notify police,  airport management, and other officials. The 3 airports that serve a  combination of commercial and general aviation traffic all had CCTV  cameras and intrusion detection systems in place. At the time of our visit,  an official from airport 4 stated that his airport would soon have an  intrusion detection system.", "Designated access point controls. Eleven of the 13 airports we visited  had controls in place or partially in place at designated access points. All 3  airports that serve commercial and general aviation flights had designated  access controls in place. TSA\u2019s suggested guidelines note that access point  controls should be able to differentiate between an authorized and an  unauthorized user, and may be the determining factor in the overall  effectiveness of perimeter security in the area of the access point. The  airport mentioned above without any perimeter fencing effectively has no  access point controls, aside from gates being closed overnight, as was  demonstrated when our investigators drove onto the runway  unchallenged. An official from this airport informed us that there are gates  at the main access points, which are shut when security personnel are on- site from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. Another airport had access gates, but they  open for all visitors through the use of motion detectors. According to an  official from this airport, the motion-controlled access gates allow for  individuals to access the airport while keeping wildlife out. At a third  airport, there were vehicle access controls that required a code to enter  the airport, but there were no pedestrian access controls to prevent  individuals from entering onto the ramp area of the airport. An official  from this airport told us that individual operators are primarily responsible  for controlling those access points. Effective access controls at dedicated  vehicle and pedestrian access points help to detect threats and to reduce  the possibility that unauthorized individuals will gain access to airports or  aircraft.", "Screening. Most of the airports we visited did not implement physical  screening of passengers and their baggage (8 of 13) or of packages and  cargo (11 of 13) on general aviation flights. However, officials at multiple  airports told us that pilots typically are familiar with their passengers and  may escort them to the aircraft. TSA\u2019s suggested guidelines related to  passengers on general aviation flights state that prior to boarding, the pilot  in command should ensure that the identity of all occupants is verified, all  occupants are aboard at the invitation of the owner or operator, and all  baggage and cargo is known to the occupants. Further, TSA notes that  passengers on general aviation flights are generally better known to  airport personnel and aircraft operators than most passengers on  commercial flights. Two of the 3 airports providing combined commercial  and general aviation services implement screening of passengers and their  baggage and of cargo and packages. At the third airport, although  passenger and baggage screening is conducted, airport officials stated that  because they do not perform significant handling of cargo and packages,  they do not screen these items."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Incidents of Unauthorized Access", "paragraphs": ["According to airport officials, several incidents of unauthorized access  have occurred within approximately the past 10 years at three of the  airports we visited. One airport provided documentation detailing two  incidents. According to a local police report supplied by airport  management and information provided by an airport official, in June 2002  an airline security guard observed a suspicious individual outside the  airport\u2019s perimeter, near a hangar being constructed. When airport  security personnel spotted the individual, he jumped over the perimeter  fence onto the airport grounds, and fled into a wooded area covering parts  of the perimeter. Local police were called but could not locate the  individual after an extensive search. In a 2004 incident, an intoxicated man  drove his car onto airport grounds and down a taxiway at high speeds  before airport authorities and law enforcement officials apprehended him.  While the airport had vehicle access controls, the driver circumvented the  controls by following closely behind an authorized vehicle that entered the  airport through a gate. Neither of these incidents involved unauthorized  individuals accessing aircraft. According to an official from this airport,  corrective measures were put in place after each incident. The 2002  incident assisted airport management in developing new security  procedures and policies, and the 2004 incident resulted in security training  related to vehicle access point controls, among other improvements.", "Officials from two other airports described incidents of unauthorized  access but did not provide documentation. One airport had two incidents  in which aircraft were stolen or removed from the airport without  approval: one aircraft was flown to another city in the same state by a teen  who knew the combination to the locked hangar in which the aircraft was  stored, and the second aircraft was recovered in Mexico. According to an  official from this airport, no corrective actions were taken in response to  the incident with the teen because he was well known to the aircraft  owner and had actually received the combination to the lock from the  aircraft owner. The airport also did not implement any corrective actions  in response to the incident in which a stolen aircraft was flown to Mexico.  However, the airport official stated that the absence of additional aircraft  thefts since this incident demonstrates the effectiveness of the airport\u2019s  existing security measures. At a second airport, unauthorized individuals  drove two Corvettes onto the taxiway after obtaining the security code for  the vehicle access gate. An official from this airport informed us that the  airport requested that local police conduct more frequent patrols in  response to this incident.", "Officials from 7 of the 13 airports indicated that there were no incidents of  unauthorized access at their airports within the past 10 years. We did not  receive information about incidents of unauthorized access from officials  at the 3 airports with both commercial and general aviation operations. We  did not pursue this inquiry because it was not our primary objective."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We met with TSA officials in January 2011 to brief them on the results of  our assessments. These officials generally agreed with our findings.  According to TSA officials, improvements in general aviation security as a  result of TSA\u2019s vulnerability assessment surveys will need to be narrowly  focused on security measures that can be implemented at a large number  of airports yet still prove effective, given the limited resources that may be  made available.", "In written comments on our report, DHS generally concurred with the  overall content and results of our report and indicated that TSA will work  in partnership with the general aviation community to support their efforts  to address the issues we identified. However, DHS noted TSA security  requirements that are not discussed in the Background section of our  report. Specifically, TSA requires certain operators of aircraft weighing  over 12,500 pounds maximum takeoff weight, based on the type of  operation, to adopt a security program and perform security measures,  such as checking passenger names against the No-Fly and Selectee Lists,  designating security coordinators, and having crewmembers undergo  security threat assessments. While our report focused on the physical  security measures in place at the specific airports we visited and was not  intended to include a comprehensive discussion of all TSA general  aviation security initiatives, we acknowledge that TSA has additional  security initiatives in place beyond those discussed in our report. DHS also  stated that TSA is in the process of issuing a rulemaking for additional  security requirements for large general aviation aircraft. According to  DHS, TSA expects the release of this rulemaking to further enhance  aviation security and codify many of the best practices already  implemented by the general aviation industry. In addition, DHS stated that  while most airports would readily implement the security measures  recommended by TSA, they are unable to put additional security measures  in place primarily because of a lack of funding. DHS comments are  reprinted in appendix III.", "As mentioned above, we provided officials from all 13 airports an  opportunity to comment on our findings as they related to their specific  airports. As appropriate, we incorporated their technical comments into  our report.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

For the purposes of this report, we  defined physical security as the combination of operational and security  equipment, personnel, and procedures used to prevent unauthorized  individuals from gaining access to aircraft or airport facilities and grounds.  We did not test the effectiveness of the security, nor did we assess  measures not directly related to physical security, such as pilot  background checks or other intelligence-gathering activities. Although we  focused on measures implemented by airports and therefore under direct  control of airport management, we gave partial credit when individual  aircraft or facility operators, owners, or tenants were responsible for  implementing certain security measures. At each airport we visited, we  interviewed airport management and other officials with knowledge of the  security measures. We conducted our on-site assessments with advance  notice to airport officials; we did not conduct any undercover testing on  this engagement. During our visits, we also obtained photographic  evidence of security measures; requested documentation related to any  specific incidents of unauthorized access at each airport; and attempted to  obtain information on each airport\u2019s procedures, if any, for screening  passengers, their carry-on items, and packages or cargo by requesting  documentation pertaining to their security procedures and measures.", "Since TSA does not require the implementation of security measures for  airports with only general aviation operations, our assessments are not  meant to imply that any of the general aviation airports we visited have  failed to implement required security measures.

This is why, in practice, layers of security should be  integrated in order to provide the strongest protection. Thus, a perimeter  fence should be combined with an intrusion detection system that would  alert security officials if the perimeter has been breached. A strong system  would then tie the intrusion detection alarm to the closed-circuit television  (CCTV) network, allowing security officers to immediately identify  intruders.", "Table 1 shows the security measures we focused on during our assessment  work."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, the following staff members made  significant contributions to this report: Gregory D.
