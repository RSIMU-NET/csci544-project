The Office of the Director of Foreign Assistance (State/F) was given responsibility for reforming foreign assistance by, among other things, consolidating State and USAID foreign assistance processes. GAO was asked to (1) examine State/F's key efforts to consolidate State and USAID foreign assistance processes and (2) identify any key challenges that affect State/F's reform of foreign assistance.

In addition, State/F has taken several steps to consolidate State and USAID planning and budgeting processes--for example, instituting common program definitions for the use of foreign assistance funds to collect, track, and report on data related to program funding and results. State/F also began developing annual operational plans, based on the common program definitions, to serve as annual expenditure plans, performance plans, and performance reports for State and USAID foreign assistance projects worldwide and to provide descriptive information about other U.S. government agencies' foreign assistance programs. Moreover, State/F initiated a pilot program for developing a 5-year country assistance strategy (CAS) intended to provide a comprehensive view of all U.S. foreign assistance activities in every country in which U.S. resources are targeted. Further, beginning with fiscal year 2008, State/F implemented a joint State-USAID foreign assistance budget process to bring needed coherence of program activities and accountability for resources. Finally, State/F established an integrated State-USAID workforce to direct the consolidation of State and USAID foreign assistance operations. Despite this progress, State/F faces challenges that could constrain its efforts to reform foreign assistance. For example, State/F lacks time frames for developing a comprehensive U.S. foreign assistance strategy--one of its assigned responsibilities--and fully implementing the 5-year CAS. As a result, State/F has limited capacity to demonstrate progress in these key reform efforts. State/F also lacks a clear, consistent strategy for communicating with USAID and State employees about its efforts, leading to confusion among staff and hindering management-staff relations; although State/F has devised an initial plan to address this challenge, it has not yet carried out this plan. In addition, State/F's operational plans do not adequately describe some of USAID's regional foreign assistance activities, and consequently senior management may lack a holistic overview of foreign assistance resources needed to make informed trade-offs among various priorities. Further, the goals and measures in State/F's country operational plans sometimes do not align with those of other agencies providing foreign assistance in the country, limiting State/F's assurance that all U.S. foreign assistance funds in the country are strategically tied to broader U.S. foreign policy goals in the country. Finally, both a 2008 State/F internal review and GAO found that State/F had not yet clearly defined the roles of some of its employees and organizational units and had not matched all employees' skills with their positions. State/F has taken initial steps in response to the internal report's findings, including defining the roles and responsibilities of various executive and managerial positions and organizational units, but has not yet done so for all State/F staff, and has not developed a long-term workforce management plan to address workforce planning challenges."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In January 2006, the Secretary of State announced a major transformation  in the U.S. government\u2019s procedures for directing and managing foreign  assistance programs.

For each objective, State/F developed a common configuration  of goals linked to implementing mechanisms. This program structure is the  foundation of the annual operational plan and the performance report as  well as the FACTS data system. (Fig. 2 shows an excerpt of the  configuration of goals for the governing justly and democratically program  objective.) State/F also developed standard definitions and sets of  indicators related to these goals.

State/F piloted the operational plan in 67 \u201cfast track\u201d operating units in  fiscal year 2007 and required all 190 operating units, including country  missions and regional and functional bureaus in State and USAID, to  complete an operational plan in fiscal year 2008.", "Using the standardized program structure, the operational plan reflects  funding information for individual State and USAID foreign assistance  projects (i.e., at the implementing mechanism level).

To obtain  this information, State and USAID staff must work with other agencies.  According to some USAID and State staff at field missions, the annual  operational plan process has improved transparency among the various  U.S. government agencies involved in U.S. foreign assistance activities in  the country.

The purpose of this two-part  structure was to more evenly distribute the workload for State and USAID  over time and to permit State and USAID project data to be provided later  in the fiscal year, after each operating unit receives its allocations and has  had the opportunity to plan their projects. According to State/F officials,  after fiscal year 2008, State/F discontinued the two-phased approach and  instead separated the operational plans from the performance plans and  reports. The operational plans serve as annual spending plans and discuss  planned activities and expected results from the current year  appropriation; annual performance plans and reports capture fiscal year  performance planning and performance reporting.", "State/F also made a number of changes to the information contained in the  operational plans, based on feedback from the after-action reviews. For  example, State/F eliminated the requirement for operating units to provide  narrative information at the subelement level and made this information  optional at the implementing mechanism level. It also eliminated  performance indicators at the implementing mechanism level. These  changes were in direct response to staff concerns that State/F was  collecting detailed information that was not being used in decision  making. Also, State/F now prepopulates certain data fields in the FACTS  database with prior-year information; staff must re-enter prior-year  information only if it has changed. According to USAID and State officials,  these changes have reduced the workload burden for staff working on the  operational plans, especially in field locations that experienced slow  connections with the FACTS database.

For example, a USAID official in  Jordan said that State/F repeatedly changed its guidance over a short  period of time; at times, the updated guidance contradicted, instead of  built on, previous guidance and staff were unsure which guidance to  follow. In addition, many staff told us that when seeking clarification on  the conflicting guidance, they had received either no response or an  untimely response from State/F.

First, although regional missions  complete operational plans, they do not clearly capture all of the foreign  assistance programs and services implemented by USAID\u2019s regional  offices. As a result, senior management may lack the holistic overview of  foreign assistance resources needed to make informed decisions about  trade-offs among various priorities. According to leading practices in  federal strategic planning, an agency\u2019s strategic goals and objectives  should cover its major functions and operations, and its annual  performance plan should cover each program activity set forth in its  budget. Like its country-specific, or bilateral, missions, USAID\u2019s regional  offices provide foreign assistance programs, although these programs tend  to operate across borders. Regional offices also implement and manage  programs in limited presence countries and provide technical assistance  and support to bilateral missions and programs. However, according to  regional officials with whom we met, it is difficult to categorize and  capture technical assistance in the operational plan. In addition, they  stated that because the operational plan has a bilateral mission focus and  distinguishes between programs in different sectors, it does not adequately  describe regional offices\u2019 programs and services in multiple sectors for  multiple limited presence countries. Senior leaders in State/F  acknowledged that the operational plan\u2019s bilateral mission focus is  problematic in this regard. In commenting on a draft of this report, State/F  stated that regional activities can be and are captured in operational plans,  noting that regional operating units produce operational plans. Based on  our work, we maintain that the operational plan structure does not  adequately capture regional activities.", "Second, State/F faces challenges in coordinating and collaborating with  officials in other U.S. government agencies to obtain funding and  performance information, at the program element level, about these  agencies\u2019 foreign assistance programs. Officials from these agencies told  us that State/F did not coordinate well with their agencies in planning for  programs that these agencies implement with State or USAID funding. For  example, DOD staff who implement Foreign Military Financing and  International Military Training and Education programs told us during our  site visits that State/F\u2019s goals and measures\u2014as reflected by the  standardized program structure in the operational plans\u2014did not always  align with the broader goals and measures articulated in DOD\u2019s own  planning documents and strategies for its own programs. Moreover,  officials from other U.S. government agencies implementing their own  foreign assistance programs told us of challenges they face in providing  information to State and USAID officials for inclusion in the operational  plan. As a result, State/F cannot be sure, through its operational plan  process, that governmentwide foreign assistance funds are strategically  tied to overarching policy goals. At some field missions, officials from the  Departments of Commerce, Energy, Health and Human Services, and the  Treasury told us that providing support for State/F processes, such as the  operational plan, creates an additional workload that is neither recognized  by their agencies nor a factor in their performance ratings. We have  previously reported that federal programs contributing to the same or  similar results should collaborate to ensure that goals are consistent and,  as appropriate, program efforts are mutually reinforcing. In addition, as a  key collaboration practice, agencies can reinforce individual  accountability for collaborative efforts through their performance  management systems.", "Third, although the standardized program structure is generally a useful  tool to categorize foreign assistance programs, its program structure  categories sometimes overlap and in some cases, its performance  indicators do not always adequately describe program achievements.  State/F guidance does not discuss how to categorize programs within the  standardized program structure, except to say that it is critical that funds  be identified by what is being done, rather than why it is being done.", "Standardized program structure categories are not mutually  exclusive. Staff from State and USAID told us that it is not always clear to  them how to categorize program activities, which could result in similar  programs\u2019 being coded differently. For example, a USAID official in the  East Africa Regional Office, describing a civilian program similar to  neighborhood watches, said that the subelement that best describes the  program falls under the \u201cStabilization Operations and Security Sector  Reform\u201d program area, which generally involves military programs. The  official ultimately sought legal counsel to determine whether it was  appropriate to code the program in this subelement or whether it should  be coded in a subelement under a civilian program area. State/F officials  told us that the standardized program structure was developed by  interagency experts in each of the program areas and that it would  continue to rely on individuals who know and understand the programs  and are best positioned to categorize them.", "Standard indicators do not always capture program performance.", "Staff from State and USAID told us that they sometimes cannot find  standardized performance indicators to describe State/F programs and  therefore choose \u201cthe next best thing.\u201d As a result, State/F cannot ensure  that its programs and projects are reported accurately and consistently.  For example, a State official in Ethiopia told us that he and USAID  officials whom he consulted were unable to find a performance indicator  that accurately described training provided to Ethiopian police units for  defusing bombs. Eventually, the State and USAID officials selected one  indicator from several that related generally to police training, even  though none accurately described the type of assistance being provided. In  commenting on a draft of this report, State/F officials told us they have  been working for the past year on a comprehensive review of the  standardized program structure in order to clarify and update program  definitions but that they would also review the standard indicators  These design weaknesses in the standardized program structure could  compromise accuracy and data reliability in the operational plans,  performance reports, FACTS, and FACTS Info, all of which are grounded  in the standardized program structure.", "Fourth, as State/F itself recognizes, its required standard indicators are  generally output oriented and therefore provide little information about  program impact. State/F chose to use output measures, in part, to  aggregate and report, at the agency level, quantitative information  common to foreign assistance programs across countries. USAID staff at  the six overseas missions we visited told us they saw this shift as a step  backward from the progress some USAID missions had made over the  years toward using more outcome-oriented measures to obtain  information on program impact. State and USAID officials in headquarters  and the field recognized the value of being able to aggregate information  across countries at the agency level but questioned the usefulness of the  output-oriented information collected with State/F\u2019s standard indicators.  For example, a USAID official in Haiti told us that the USAID mission and  its implementing partners have shifted their focus away from impact  measures toward measures that provide less information on actual  progress. In addition, USAID officials in Kenya expressed concerns that  the quality and availability of the qualitative information needed to manage  program activities had declined, reducing the mission\u2019s ability to measure,  and respond to inquiries about, program impact. State/F\u2019s guidance  encourages the use of custom indicators to establish targets and monitor  the progress and impacts of their projects but it does not describe how  State/F will use this information. Some State and USAID officials noted  that although information related to program impact is important for  managing programs and understanding the programs\u2019 effects, they were  not sure how, or if, State/F uses such information. These officials observed  that, in contrast, State/F\u2019s guidance says that the quantitative, output- oriented information collected with the standard indicators is used to  inform its resource requests and report to Congress and the American  people.", "Fifth, State/F\u2019s planning process excludes certain of State\u2019s and USAID\u2019s  operating and administrative expenses for foreign assistance programs,  constraining State/F\u2019s ability to ensure needed levels of administrative  support for their foreign assistance programs. Although State/F plans and  budgets for foreign assistance program funds, State\u2019s Resource  Management Bureau and USAID\u2019s Management Bureau plan and request  funds for operating and administrative expenses.

First, the CAS may not adequately replace USAID\u2019s country  strategies, as State/F initially planned. According to some USAID and State  officials in Washington, D.C., and in the countries we visited, the CAS is a  high-level document that includes overall objectives for the country but\u2014 unlike USAID\u2019s country strategies\u2014lacks substantive content and details  on how USAID is to achieve its objectives. For example, the CAS\u2019 content  is limited to high-level information on (1) the country program and the  overall U.S. strategic approach and priorities, (2) up to five priority goals,  and (3) resource assumptions. In contrast, the 2002-2006 USAID country  strategy for Peru, for example, includes, for each of Peru\u2019s seven  objectives, a detailed discussion of the objective, the development  challenge, performance measures, critical assumptions, commitment and  capacity of other development organizations, and sustainability issues.", "To address USAID missions\u2019 concerns, in October 2008 the DFA issued an  executive message that outlined three strategic planning options regarding  the development of interim country strategies. The message stated that a  USAID mission could (1) continue to use an existing country strategy; (2)  develop an interagency CAS; or (3) develop an updated, USAID-specific  country strategy if the existing strategy is no longer relevant and a CAS is  not likely to be in place in fiscal year 2009. According to this guidance,  these options would be available while the CAS is being piloted. As of  March 2009, State/F officials told us that it had not yet completed an  assessment of the CAS pilot.", "Second, State/F\u2019s suspension of the development of USAID country  strategies led to planning challenges at some USAID missions, particularly  during the first 2 years of State/F\u2019s existence. According to some USAID  officials, until October 2008\u2014when USAID issued guidance for developing  interim country strategies\u2014the absence of a long-term country strategy  hampered their ability to plan and manage project activities. For example,  in June 2008, USAID officials in Ethiopia told us that before their country  strategy had expired, USAID and the Ethiopian government routinely  agreed on program activities that USAID planned to carry out over the  next several years, pending availability of funds. However, absent a  current multiyear strategy, and because of the resulting uncertainty about  USAID\u2019s long-term goals and strategies for the country, USAID officials  were reluctant to reach preliminary agreements with various Ethiopian  government ministries. In Ukraine, USAID officials told us that in June  2006, State/F suspended the mission\u2019s efforts to update its 2003-2007  country strategy. As a result, the officials said, USAID\u2019s strategy for  Ukraine became outdated and did not reflect the current political,  economic, and developmental environment in Ukraine, which had changed  dramatically. They, too, were reluctant to execute agreements with the  Ukrainian government without a clear understanding of how these  projects link to a long-term strategy for the country. In contrast, USAID  officials in Haiti told us that State/F\u2019s suspending development of new  country strategies had not adversely affected them because a 3-year  country strategy for 2007-2009 had been approved and implemented in  August 2006. Although the guidance issued by USAID in September 2008 is  a step forward in addressing USAID missions\u2019 concerns, the development  of USAID country-specific strategic plans will remain an interim process  until the CAS is finalized and USAID country strategies are fully developed  and implemented."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State/F Faces Challenges in Its Consolidated Budget Processes", "paragraphs": ["We identified two key concerns with State/F\u2019s consolidated budget  processes. First, although State/F\u2019s consolidated budget process was in  part intended to bring needed coherence and accountability to  governmentwide foreign assistance programs, the process excludes  billions of dollars both within and outside State and USAID\u2019s jurisdiction.  For example, of the $36.6 billion appropriated to, or administered by, State  and USAID, only about half went through the new State-USAID  consolidated budget, planning, and reporting processes in fiscal year 2008.  Further, according to State/F guidance, State/F coordinates with, but does  not approve budget requests and resource allocations for, the Global  HIV/AIDS Initiative (GHAI) or the Millennium Challenge Corporation  (MCC); the appropriations act for fiscal year 2008 included $1.8 billion and  $1.6 billion, for GHAI and MCC, respectively. State/F\u2019s process also does  not include Pub. L. 480 Title II grants, for which almost $1.7 billion was  appropriated in fiscal year 2008.", "Second, State/F\u2019s budget process reforms may affect a mission\u2019s ability to  respond to unexpected events in a timely manner. Under State/F\u2019s  operational plan process, funds are allowed and committed at lower  levels\u2014the element and subelement levels respectively\u2014than they were  with previous processes. This change allows State/F to report a finer level  of detail regarding how funds are used. However, State and USAID  officials, both in headquarters and the field, expressed concern that this  change could have unintended impacts on a mission\u2019s ability to respond  effectively to changing conditions, possibly hampering its ability to  address time-critical issues such as riots or disasters. For example,  officials in State\u2019s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, describing their  efforts to identify funding for a new, multiyear administration initiative,  said that before State/F was created, the bureau was able to quickly and  easily reallocate funds to respond to unexpected events. Now, to address  such an event, the bureau must request and receive approval to reallocate  funds in the operational plan, because State/F requires all funds to be  committed in advance. The officials said that they have found this to be a  complex and lengthy process, requiring multiple levels of approval\u2014often  up to the DFA\u2014for a variety of funding changes. State/F has taken some  steps to reduce the burden of its reallocation process. For example, it  delegated authority to USAID mission directors to approve reallocation  requests in certain instances. In addition, State/F decreased the number of  reallocation requests that need to be approved by the DFA. In another  example, USAID officials in the field described their efforts to respond to  unexpected parliamentary elections in Ukraine while their operational  plan was under review by State/F. According to these officials, the mission  requested that State/F release some funds prior to approving the plan, so  that the mission could develop and implement programs related to the  Ukraine\u2019s upcoming elections. According to State/F\u2019s reprogramming  guidance for fiscal years 2007 and 2008, this request required the  signatures of 10 USAID and State officials (outside State/F) and 4 State/F  officials, including the DFA.

For example, the State/F internal management  review found that (1) State/F had not yet clearly defined the roles of some  of its employees and organizational units and (2) State/F had not ensured  that its employees have the skills and competencies needed to manage  foreign assistance programs. According to State/F officials, in an effort to  demonstrate an impact on U.S. foreign assistance programs, State/F  initially gave precedence to creating and deploying consolidated budget,  planning, and reporting processes rather than to examining the workforce  composition, defining roles and responsibilities, and ensuring needed  skills and competencies. Although it is important for leaders to be decisive  and deliver early successes, we have previously found that success in an  organizational transformation or merger is more likely when positions are  filled based on the competencies needed for the new organization.", "Roles and responsibilities. The October 2008 internal management  review noted that the roles of some State/F employees and organizational  units were not well defined or understood; that the responsibilities of  some offices overlapped; and that there was confusion about when, during  the planning and budgeting processes, certain employees should be  involved in various issues. Similarly, State and USAID officials in  Washington, D.C., and most of the six countries we visited told us that  State/F employees sometimes were unable to answer questions about  operational plan guidance, FACTS, and FACTS Info and were unsure  where in State/F to direct such questions so as to ensure timely, accurate  answers.", "Skills and competencies. State/F\u2019s internal management review noted  concerns about whether some State/F employee skills are well matched  with State/F\u2019s core functions. The review found that although State/F staff  had strong skills, they either were not placed in positions where they  could leverage these skills or their skills did not match the capabilities that  State/F required. During our work, some State and USAID officials in  Washington, D.C., and in the field echoed these concerns.", "Although State/F has taken some actions in response to its October 2008  internal review, it has not developed a long-term workforce management  plan for addressing these challenges. During our review, State/F officials  told us that they had initiated several corrective actions in response to  recommendations in the internal review, such as defining roles and  responsibilities for its various executive and managerial positions and its  organizational units; developing plans to ensure that the current  workforce is aligned to meet these needs; and improving training and  professional development offered to its employees. However, State/F has  not clearly defined roles and responsibilities for some of its employees. In  addition, State/F has not developed a long-term workforce management  plan to periodically reassess its workforce capacity to carry out assigned  responsibilities, such as supporting and managing the consolidated  budget, planning, and reporting processes for State and USAID foreign  assistance programs. Our previous work has shown that many aspects of  workforce planning and management require long-term strategies, to  ensure that the agency\u2019s human capital program capitalizes on its  workforce\u2019s strengths and addresses related challenges in a manner that is  clearly linked to achieving the agency\u2019s mission and goals.", "Further, although State/F has defined its core functions and is \u201ctranslating  them down to its various offices,\u201d State/F officials told us that these  definitions are considered an internal management tool and therefore have  not been, and will not be, shared with State and USAID employees outside  State/F. We have previously reported that having an effective and ongoing  internal and external communication strategy is essential to making  transformation happen; communicating with stakeholders should be a  top priority and is central to forming the partnerships that are needed to  develop and implement the organization\u2019s strategies. Moreover, we have  observed that such communication is especially crucial in public sector  organizational transformations, such as State and USAID\u2019s reform of  foreign assistance.

Moreover, State/F\u2019s actions to consolidate and reform State and USAID  planning and budgeting could help address program fragmentation;  strengthen accountability; and tighten the link among strategic objectives,  resource allocation, and program implementation. For example, by basing  its annual operational plans and 5-year CAS on its standardized program  structure, State/F is attempting to tie its planning and budgeting to  strategic foreign policy objectives. Further, the CAS process has the  potential to further transparency and enhance interagency coordination  and collaboration by including the activities of all U.S. agencies providing  foreign assistance in the country. If effectively implemented, the CAS  could also be a first step in creating a comprehensive governmentwide  strategy for U.S. foreign assistance.", "In other respects, State/F\u2019s initiatives are not well aligned with key  practices that we have previously found in successful transformations and  mergers.

We also obtained and analyzed various  State/F documents describing its reformed planning, budgeting, and  reporting processes, guidance for implementing these processes, and  examples of the documents produced by these processes (e.g., Operational  plans and Congressional Budget Justifications). We also obtained and  reviewed the fiscal years 2007 and 2008 \u201cafter-action reviews\u201d of the  State/F\u2019s planning and budgeting processes conducted by State/F, as well  as documents that describe changes to the processes based on these  reviews.", "We conducted more than 40 interviews with State and USAID officials in  Washington, D.C., involved in State/F\u2019s reforms, including officials in  various State/F offices and in various State and USAID regional and  functional bureaus. To gain an understanding of the field\u2019s involvement in  and perspectives on State/F\u2019s reforms, we also conducted site visits at U.S.  Embassies and USAID missions in six countries: Ethiopia, Haiti, Jordan,  Kenya, Peru, and Ukraine. We selected these locations on the basis of the  following factors:    Funding levels. Each country\u2019s program was among the top recipients of  U.S. funding in its geographic region.", "Regional responsibilities. USAID missions in three of the six countries\u2014 Kenya, Peru, and Ukraine\u2014are also responsible for managing regional  programs or programs in neighboring countries.", "Variety of foreign assistance activities. In all of the countries, a variety of  foreign assistance activities are provided by State and USAID as well as by  other federal agencies, including the Departments of Agriculture,  Commerce, Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services, and the  Treasury.", "At each embassy and mission, we met with officials involved in State/F\u2019s  planning and budgeting processes. While most of these officials were from  State and USAID, we also met with officials from other agencies that  implement programs on their behalf or that coordinate with them,  including the Departments of Agriculture and Defense.", "Finally, our review was informed by our past work. We reviewed our past  reports related to State and USAID, as well as reports on strategic  planning, performance budgeting, performance reporting, and interagency  collaboration and coordination. We also selected seven of the nine key  practices from our past work on organizational mergers and  transformations to review State and USAID efforts to establish State/F.  Our review did not include the practices of using the performance  management system to define responsibility and assure accountability for  change or building a world-class organization because of the evolving  nature of State/F\u2019s organization and workforce."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: U.S. Departments, Agencies, and Other Entities That Provide Foreign Assistance", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: State/F Information Systems", "paragraphs": ["To support State and USAID planning, budgeting, and reporting of foreign  assistance under these reforms, State/F developed two new data  information systems, the Foreign Assistance Coordination and Tracking  System (FACTS) and FACTS Info. FACTS, which State/F began to develop  in mid-2006, is a database used to collect foreign assistance planning and  reporting data, including plans for implementing current-year appropriated  budgets and performance planning and reporting data. FACTS Info, which  State/F created in 2007, is a system used to aggregate, analyze, and report  data on U.S. foreign assistance programs under the authority of the DFA.  Although State and USAID are the only U.S. agencies currently using both  systems, State/F expects the systems to eventually include data from other  agencies involved in foreign assistance, including, among others, the  Millennium Challenge Corporation and the Department of Treasury.", "In November 2008, in connection with our body of work addressing the  management of State/F and at your request, we reported on (1) the creation  and development of FACTS and FACTS Info and (2) whether State/F is  following best practices for configuration management\u2014the process of  establishing and maintaining control over changes made to a system\u2014and  risk management of FACTS and FACTS Info. In conducting this work, we  reviewed FACTS and FACTS Info system procurement, contract,  development, performance, and assessment documents from State and  USAID. We also reviewed State/F\u2019s configuration management and risk  management procedures for consistency with industry best practices.", "FACTS has been developed in two phases, known as FACTS I and FACTS  II. In conjunction with USAID, State/F developed FACTS I in December  2006 as a database to collect foreign assistance planning and reporting  data, including plans for implementing current-year appropriated budgets  and performance planning and reporting data for State, USAID, and the  more than 25 other U.S. departments and agencies involved in providing  foreign assistance. According to a State/F survey of over 100 State and  USAID users in 2007, as well as our interviews with State and USAID  officials in Washington, D.C., and the six countries we visited, FACTS I  was slow and unreliable during the first 2 years of the new foreign  assistance funding process. To remedy these problems, in February 2008,  State/F hired a contractor to develop FACTS II, which was deployed  worldwide in October 2008. State/F created FACTS Info to aggregate,  analyze, and report data on U.S. foreign assistance programs under the  authority of the DFA. During the initial pilot phase, which began in  September 2007, FACTS Info was accessible to a limited number of State  and USAID users. FACTS Info was expanded to include additional State/F  and USAID users when the pilot phase ended in February 2009.", "FACTS II and the ongoing pilot of FACTS Info have recently implemented  new configuration management processes, but both lack adequate risk  management procedures, such as formalized procedures to plan for  foreseeable risks. State/F has taken steps to address these challenges, such as  updating the project management plan and implementing change tracking  software to address certain weaknesses, particularly to both systems\u2019  configuration management. However, as of October 2008, State/F had not  fully implemented improvements to the systems\u2019 risk management; State  officials noted that they plan to complete these improvements by December  2008. Because both FACTS II and FACTS Info lack formal processes for risk  management, State/F cannot ensure that risks are identified, analyzed,  tracked, and mitigated, increasing the likelihood that potential problems  become actual problems. Moreover, State/F was unable to mitigate a key risk  that led to problems with the development of FACTS II. Without improved  risk management processes, risks may not be effectively managed.", "In our November 2008 report, we recommended that, to help ensure that  FACTS II and FACTS Info are implemented successfully and perform as  designed, the Secretary of State direct the DFA to better utilize best practices  for risk management procedures to both systems. In particular, we  recommended that the DFA (1) identify and develop a comprehensive list of  system development risks for FACTS II and FACTS Info; and (2) fully develop  risk mitigation plans for FACTS II and FACTS Info. State has taken some  actions in response to these recommendations. Specifically, State/F issued a  risk registry that includes 27 systems development risks for both FACTS II  and FACTS Info and how it had either already addressed or planned to  address the risks. Also, State/F developed a draft of a combined risk  management plan for both FACTS II and FACTS Info and, in February 2009, a  State/F official told us that they expected the plan to be approved by the end  of that month. However, as of April 2009, the plan had not yet been approved."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Foreign Assistance Framework", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Goal: To help build and sustain democratic, well-governed states that respond to the needs of their people, reduce widespread poverty and conduct themselves responsibly in the international system.", "paragraphs": ["Assist in  creating and/or  stabilizing a  legitimate and  democratic  government  and a  supportive  environment for  civil society and  media.", "Start or restart  the delivery of  critical social  services,  including health  and  educational  facilities, and  begin building  or rebuilding  institutional  capacity.", "Assist in the  construction or  reconstruction  of key internal  infrastructure  and market  mechanisms to  stabilize the  economy.", "Address  immediate  needs of  refugee,  displaced, and  other affected  groups.", "Stable  environment for  good  governance,  increased  availability of  essential social  services, and  initial progress  in creating  policies and  institutions on  which future  progress will  rest.", "Advance to  \u201cdeveloping  countries\u201d or  \u201ctransforming  countries\u201d  category.", "Support  policies and  programs that  accelerate and  strengthen  public  institutions and  the creation of  a more vibrant  local  government,  civil society and  media.", "Encourage  social policies  that deepen the  ability of  institutions to  establish  appropriate  roles for the  public and  private sector  in service  delivery.", "Encourage  economic  policies and  strengthen  institutional  capacity to  promote broad- based growth.", "Encourage  reduced need  for future HA  by introducing  prevention and  mitigation  strategies,  while  continuing to  address  emergency  needs.", "Continued  progress in  expanding and  deepening  democracy,  strengthening  public and  private  institutions, and  supporting  policies that  promote  economic  growth and  poverty  reduction.", "Advance to  \u201ctransforming  countries\u201d  category.", "Provide limited  resources and  technical  assistance to  reinforce  democratic  institutions.", "Provide  financial  resources and  limited  technical  assistance to  sustain  improved  livelihoods.", "Provide  financial  resources and  technical  assistance to  promote broad- based growth.", "Address  emergency  needs on a  short-term  basis, as  necessary.", "Government,  civil society,  and private  sector  institutions  capable of  sustaining  development  progress.", "Advance to  \u201csustaining  partnership\u201d  category or  graduate  from foreign  assistance.", "Address issues  of mutual  interest.", "Address issues  of mutual  interest.", "Create and  promote  sustained  partnerships on  trade and  investment.", "Address  emergency  needs on a  short-term  basis, as  necessary.", "Continued  partnership as  strategically  appropriate  where U.S.  support is  necessary to  maintain  progress and  peace.", "Continue  partnership  or graduate  from foreign  assistance.", "Foster effective  democracy and  responsible  sovereignty.
