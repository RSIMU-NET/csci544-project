Although GAO has not yet independently assessed the effectiveness of these efforts, TSA has taken actions to address legislative requirements to implement and test the program as well as address GAO's recommendations related to conducting additional systems testing, strengthening contractor oversight, and improving coordination with stakeholders. Specifically, TSA has issued a rule in January 2007 that sets forth the requirements for enrolling maritime workers in the TWIC program and issuing cards to these workers, and awarded a $70 million dollar contract to begin enrolling workers; reported conducting performance testing of the technologies that will be used to enroll workers in the TWIC program to ensure that they work effectively before implementation; begun planning a pilot program to test TWIC access control technologies at 5 maritime locations in accordance with the Security and Accountability for Every Port Act; begun enrolling workers and issuing TWIC cards at the port of Wilmington, Delaware on October 16, 2007, and plans to do so at 11 additional ports by November 2007; added additional staff with program and contract management expertise to help oversee the TWIC enrollment contract; and stated that they have taken actions to improve communication and coordination with maritime stakeholders. As TSA moves forward with TWIC, it and maritime industry stakeholders will be faced with addressing the following key challenges that can affect the programs' successful implementation. TSA and its contractor will need to transition from testing of the TWIC program to successful implementation of the program on a larger scale covering 770,000 workers at about 3,200 maritime facilities and 5,300 vessels. TSA and its contractor will need to educate workers on new TWIC requirements, ensure that enrollments begin in a timely manner, and efficiently process background checks, appeals, and waivers.

Ensuring that only  workers that do not pose a terrorist threat are allowed access to secure  areas of the nation\u2019s transportation facilities is a key measure in securing  the homeland. The TWIC program was created to help protect these  facilities from the threat of terrorism by issuing identification cards only to  workers who are not known to pose a terrorist threat, and allow these  workers unescorted access to secure areas of the transportation system.  To accomplish this objective, the TWIC program will include the collection  of personal and biometric information to validate workers\u2019 identities,  background checks on transportation workers to ensure they do not pose  a security threat, issuance of tamper-resistant biometric credentials that  cannot be counterfeited, verification of these credentials using biometric  access control systems before a worker is granted unescorted access to a  secure area, and revocation of credentials if disqualifying information is  discovered, or if a card is lost, damaged, or stolen. The TWIC program is  ultimately intended to support all modes of transportation, however, TSA,  in partnership with the Coast Guard, is focusing initial implementation in  the maritime sector.", "In December 2004, September 2006, and April 2007, we reported on the  status of the development and testing of the TWIC program. Our 2004  report identified challenges that TSA faced in developing regulations and a  comprehensive plan for managing the program, as well as several factors  that caused TSA to miss initial deadlines for issuing TWIC cards. In our  September 2006 report, we identified the challenges that TSA encountered  during TWIC program testing, and several problems related to contract  planning and oversight. In August 2006, TSA decided that the TWIC  program would be implemented in the maritime sector using two separate  rules. TSA issued the first rule in January 2007 which requires worker  enrollment and card issuance, and plans to issue a proposed rule on  access control technologies in 2008. Since September 2006, Congress  passed the Security and Accountability for Every (SAFE) Port Act of 2006,  which directed TSA, among other things, to implement the TWIC program  at the 10 highest risk ports by July 1, 2007. In January 2007, TSA awarded  a $70 million contract to begin enrolling workers and issuing TWIC cards  to workers at these 10 ports.", "My testimony today focuses on: (1) the progress TSA has made since  September 2006 in implementing the TWIC program and addressing GAO  recommendations, and (2) some of the remaining challenges that TSA and  the maritime industry must overcome to ensure the successful  implementation of the program. My comments are based primarily on our  September 2006 report on the TWIC program, which reflects work  conducted at TSA and the Coast Guard, as well as site visits to  transportation facilities that participated in testing the TWIC program. In  addition, in September and October 2007, we interviewed TSA officials  regarding the agency\u2019s efforts to implement the TWIC program and our  prior recommendations. We also interviewed officials at port facilities in  Wilmington, Delaware and Los Angeles, California, as well as Maritime  Exchange of the Delaware River and Bay officials, in October 2007 to  obtain their views on the TWIC program.

These systems and facilities are critical components of  the U.S. economy and are necessary for supplying goods throughout the  country and supporting international commerce. U.S. transportation  systems and facilities move over 30 million tons of freight and provide  approximately 1.1 billion passenger trips each day. The Ports of Los  Angeles and Long Beach estimate that they alone handle about 43 percent  of the nation\u2019s oceangoing cargo. The importance of these systems and  facilities also makes them attractive targets to terrorists. These systems  and facilities are vulnerable and difficult to secure given their size, easy  accessibility, large number of potential targets, and proximity to urban  areas. A terrorist attack on these systems and facilities could cause a  tremendous loss of life and disruption to our society. An attack would also  be costly. According to testimony by a Port of Los Angeles official, a 2002  labor dispute which led to a 10-day shutdown of West Coast port  operations cost the nation\u2019s economy an estimated $1.5 billion per day. A  terrorist attack at a port facility could have a similar or greater impact.", "One potential security threat stems from those individuals who work in  secure areas of the nation\u2019s transportation system, including seaports,  airports, railroad terminals, mass transit stations, and other transportation  facilities. It is estimated that about 6 million workers, including  longshoreman, mechanics, aviation and railroad employees, truck drivers,  and others access secure areas of the nation\u2019s estimated 4,000  transportation facilities each day while performing their jobs. Some of  these workers, such as truck drivers, regularly access secure areas at  multiple transportation facilities. Ensuring that only workers who are not  known to pose a terrorism security risk are allowed unescorted access to  secure areas is important in helping to prevent an attack. According to  TSA and transportation industry stakeholders, many individuals that work  in secure areas are currently not required to undergo a background check  or a stringent identification process in order to access secure areas. In  addition, without a standard credential that is recognized across modes of  transportation and facilities, many workers must obtain multiple  credentials to access each transportation facility they enter, which could  result in the inconvenience and cost of obtaining duplicate credentials."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "TWIC Program History", "paragraphs": ["In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the Aviation  and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) was enacted in November 2001.  Among other things, ATSA required TSA to work with airport operators to  strengthen access control points in secure areas and consider using  biometric access control systems to verify the identity of individuals who  seek to enter a secure airport area. In response to ATSA, TSA established  the TWIC program in December 2001 to mitigate the threat of terrorists  and other unauthorized persons from accessing secure areas of the entire  transportation network, by creating a common identification credential  that could be used by workers in all modes of transportation. In  November 2002, the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (MTSA)  was enacted and required the Secretary of Homeland Security to issue a  maritime worker identification card that uses biometrics, such as  fingerprints, to control access to secure areas of seaports and vessels,  among other things. In October 2006, the SAFE Port Act was enacted and  required, among other things, the issuance of regulations to begin  implementing the TWIC program and issuing TWIC cards to workers at the  10 highest-risk ports by July 1, 2007, conduct a pilot program to test TWIC  access control technologies in the maritime environment, issue regulations  requiring TWIC card readers based on the findings of the pilot, and  periodically report to Congress on the status of the program.", "The responsibility for securing the nation\u2019s transportation system and  facilities is shared by federal, state, and local governments, as well as the  private sector.

As  a result, TSA and the Coast Guard are working together to implement  TWIC in the maritime sector. Most seaports, airports, mass transit stations,  and other transportation systems and facilities in the United States are  owned and operated by state and local government authorities and private  companies.

In August 2005, TSA and the  testing contractor completed a report summarizing the results of the TWIC  testing. TSA also hired an independent contractor to assess the  performance of the TWIC testing contractor.

In  testing the TWIC program, TSA enrolled and issued TWIC cards to only  about 1,700 workers at 19 facilities, well short of its goal of 75,000.  According to TSA and the testing contractor, the lack of volunteers to  enroll in the TWIC program testing and technical difficulties in enrolling  workers, such as difficulty in obtaining workers\u2019 fingerprints to conduct  background checks, led to fewer enrollments than expected. TSA reports  that it used the testing experience to make improvements to the  enrollment and card issuance process and has taken steps to address the  challenges that we previously identified.

These  stakeholders expressed concerns related to the following issues:  Educating workers: TSA and its enrollment contractor will need to  identify all workers that are required to obtain a TWIC card, educate them  about how to enroll and receive a TWIC card, and ensure that they enroll  and receive a TWIC card by the deadlines to be established by TSA and the  Coast Guard. For example, while longshoremen who work at a port every  day may be aware of the new TWIC requirements, truck divers that deliver  to the port may be located in different states or countries, and may not be  aware of the requirements.", "Timely enrollments: Maritime stakeholders expressed concern about the  ability of the enrollment contactor to enroll workers at his port in a timely  manner. For example, at this port, the enrollment contactor has not yet  begun to lease space to install enrollment centers\u2014which at this port  could be a difficult and time-consuming task due to the shortage of space.  Stakeholders with whom we spoke also suggested that until TSA  establishes a deadline for when TWIC cards will be required at ports,  workers will likely procrastinate in enrolling, which could make it difficult  for the contractor to enroll large populations of workers in a timely  manner.", "Background checks: Some maritime organizations are concerned that  many of their workers will be disqualified from receiving a TWIC card by  the background check. These stakeholders emphasized the importance of  TSA establishing a process to ensure timely appeals and waivers processes  for the potentially large population of workers that do not pass the check.  According to TSA, the agency has already established processes for  conducting background checks, appeals, and waivers for other  background checks of transportation workers.

Few facilities that participated in TWIC testing used  biometric card readers that will be required to read the TWIC cards in the  future. As a result, TSA obtained limited information on the operational  effectiveness of biometric card readers, particularly when individuals use  these readers outdoors in the harsh maritime environment, where they can  be affected by dirt, salt, wind, and rain. In addition, TSA did not test the  use of biometric card readers on vessels, although they will be required on  vessels in the future. Also, industry stakeholders with whom we spoke  were concerned about the costs of implementing and operating TWIC  access control systems, linking card readers to their local access control  systems, obtaining information from TSA on workers who may pose a  threat to security, how biometric card readers would be implemented and  used on vessels, and how these vessels would obtain information on  workers that may post a threat. For example, in October 2007, we spoke  with maritime industry officials from the Port of Wilmington and the  Maritime Exchange of the Delaware River and Bay regarding the process  for obtaining information from TSA on workers that may pose a threat to  security. TSA plans to provide a secure Web site, whereby port officials  can log in and obtain the most recent list of workers enrolled in the TWIC  program that have been subsequently identified as a threat to security.  Maritime industry officials stated that it was not clear how often they will  have to access this Web site and whether the list provided by TSA could be  efficiently compared to workers with access to secure areas of the port  facility or vessel to ensure that none of these workers are granted access  to secure areas. Instead, port officials will have to manually compare the  list of workers to those at the port or provide the list to security guards to  check each worker as they enter secure areas of the port facility or  vessel\u2014a labor intensive and potentially costly process. Maritime officials  stated that TSA should clarify these requirements and develop a process to  allow port facilities and vessels to regularly update their access control  systems, in an automated fashion, with lists of workers that may pose a  threat in the second rule pertaining to TWIC access control technologies.", "Because of comments regarding TWIC access control technologies that  TSA received from maritime industry stakeholders on the TWIC proposed  rule, TSA decided to exclude all access control requirements from the  TWIC rule issued in January 2007. Instead, TSA plans to issue a second  proposed rule pertaining to access control requirements some time during  2008, which should allow more time for maritime stakeholders to  comment on the technology requirements and TSA to address these  comments.", "In September 2006, we reported that TSA and industry stakeholders will  need to consider the security benefits of the TWIC program and the impact  the program could have on maritime commerce. If implemented  effectively, the security benefits of the TWIC program in preventing a  terrorist attack could save lives and avoid a costly disruption in maritime  commerce. Alternatively, if key components of the TWIC program, such as  biometric card readers, do not work effectively, they could slow the daily  flow of commerce. For example, if workers or truck drivers have problems  with their fingerprint verifications on biometric card readers, they could  create long queues delaying other workers or trucks waiting in line to  enter secure areas. Such delays could be very costly in terms of time and  money to maritime facilities. Some stakeholders we spoke to also  expressed concern with applying TWIC access control requirements to  small facilities and vessels. For example, smaller vessels could have crews  of less than 10 persons, and checking TWIC cards each time a person  enters a secure area may not be necessary. TSA acknowledged the  potential impact that the TWIC program could have on the flow of  commerce, and stated that it plans to obtain additional public comments  on this issue from industry stakeholders in the second rulemaking on  access control technologies.", "In our September 2006 report, we recommended that TSA conduct  additional testing to ensure that TWIC access control technologies work  effectively and that the TWIC program balances the security benefits of  the program with the impact that it could have on the flow of maritime  commerce. As required by the SAFE Port act, TSA plans to conduct a pilot  program to test TWIC access control technologies in the maritime  environment. According to TSA, the pilot will test the performance of  biometric card readers at various maritime facilities and on vessels, as  well as the impact that these access control systems have on facilities and  vessel business operations. TSA plans to use the results of this pilot to  develop the requirements and procedures for implementing and using  TWIC access control technologies in the second rulemaking. The SAFE  Port Act requires TSA to issue a final rule containing the requirements for  installing and using TWIC access control technologies no later than two  years after the initiation of the pilot."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Preventing unauthorized persons from entering secure areas of the  nation\u2019s ports and other transportation facilities is a key component of  securing the homeland. The TWIC program was initiated in December  2001 to mitigate the threat of terrorists accessing secure areas. Since we  reported on this program in September 2006, TSA has made progress  towards implementing the program, including issuing a TWIC rule, taking  steps to implement requirements of the SAFE Port Act, awarding a  contract to enroll workers in the program, and beginning to enroll workers  in the TWIC program. TSA has also taken actions to address legislative  requirements to implement and test the program and our previous  recommendations to improve the TWIC program regarding conducting  additional testing, strengthening contractor oversight, and improving  communication and coordination with maritime stakeholders. While the  additional testing that TSA reports conducting and the actions it has taken  should help address the problems that we have previously identified, the  effectiveness of these efforts will not be clear until the program further  matures. In addition, TSA and its contractor must enroll about 770,000  persons at about 3,200 facilities in the TWIC program. As a result, it is  important that TSA and the enrollment contractor effectively  communicate and coordinate to help ensure that all individuals and  organizations affected by the TWIC program are aware of their  responsibilities. Finally, it will be critical that TSA ensures that the TWIC  access control technology pilot fully tests the TWIC program in an  operational maritime environment and the results be used to help ensure a  successful implementation of these technologies in the future.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.
