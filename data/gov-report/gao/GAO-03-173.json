GAO was asked to review (1) the general nature of the cyber threats faced by the financial services industry; (2) steps the financial services industry has taken to share information on and to address threats, vulnerabilities, and incidents; (3) the relationship between government and private sector efforts to protect the financial services industry's critical infrastructures; and (4) actions financial regulators have taken to address these cyber threats."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The types of cyber threats that the financial services industry faces are similar to those faced by other critical infrastructure sectors: attacks from individuals and groups with malicious intent, such as crime, terrorism, and foreign intelligence. However, the potential for monetary gains and economic disruptions may increase its attractiveness as a target. Financial services industry groups have taken steps and plan to take continuing action to address cyber threats and improve information sharing. First, industry representatives, under the sponsorship of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, collaboratively developed a sector strategy which discusses additional efforts necessary to identify, assess, and respond to sector-wide threats. However, the financial services sector has not developed detailed plans for implementing its strategy. Second, the private sector's Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center was formed to facilitate sharing of cyber-related information. Third, several other industry groups are taking steps to better coordinate industry efforts and to improve information security across the sector. Several federal entities play critical roles in partnering with the private sector to protect the financial services industry's critical infrastructures. For example, the Department of the Treasury is the sector liaison for coordinating public and private efforts and chairs the federal Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee, which coordinates regulatory efforts. As part of its efforts, Treasury has taken steps designed to establish better relationships and methods of communication between regulators, assess vulnerabilities, and improve communications within the financial services sector. In its role as sector liaison, Treasury has not undertaken a comprehensive assessment of the potential use of public policy tools by the federal government to encourage increased participation by the private sector. The table below shows the key public and private organizations involved in critical infrastructure protection. Federal regulators, such as the Federal Reserve System and the Securities and Exchange Commission, have taken several steps to address information security issues.

The  report recommended several measures to achieve a higher level of CIP,  including infrastructure protection through industry cooperation and  information sharing, a national organization structure, a revised program of  research and development, a broad program of awareness and education,  and reconsideration of laws related to infrastructure protection. The report  stated that a comprehensive effort would need to \u201cinclude a system of  surveillance, assessment, early warning, and response mechanisms to  mitigate the potential for cyberthreats.\u201d The financial services sector was  highlighted as one of several critical infrastructures that were vital to our  nation\u2019s economic security.", "In 1998, the President issued Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD 63),  which established CIP as a national goal and described a strategy for  cooperative efforts by government and the private sector to protect the  physical and cyber-based systems essential to the minimum operations of  the economy and the government. PDD 63 called for a range of actions  intended to improve federal agencies\u2019 security programs, improve the  nation\u2019s ability to detect and respond to serious computer-based and  physical attacks, and establish a partnership between the government and  the private sector. The directive called on the federal government to serve  as a model of how infrastructure assurance is best achieved and designated  lead agencies to work with private-sector and government organizations.", "To accomplish its goals, PDD 63 established and designated organizations  to provide central coordination and support, including  the Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office (CIAO), an interagency  office housed in the Department of Commerce, which was established  to develop a national plan for CIP on the basis of infrastructure plans  developed by the private sector and federal agencies;   the National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC), an organization  within the FBI, which was expanded to address national-level threat  assessment, warning, vulnerability, and law enforcement investigation  and response; and   the National Infrastructure Assurance Council, which was established to  enhance the partnership of the public and private sectors in protecting  our critical infrastructures.", "To ensure coverage of critical sectors, PDD 63 also identified eight private- sector infrastructures, including banking and finance, and five special  functions. For each of the infrastuctures and functions, the directive  designated lead federal agencies, known as sector liaisons, to work with  their counterparts in the private sector, known as sector coordinators. For  example, Treasury is responsible for working with the financial services  sector, and the Department of Energy is responsible for working with the  electrical power industry. Similarly, regarding special function areas, the  Department of Defense is responsible for national defense, and the  Department of State is responsible for foreign affairs.", "PDD 63 called for a range of actitivites intended to establish a partnership  between the public and private sectors to ensure the security of our  nation\u2019s critical infrastructures. The sector liaison and the sector  coordinator were to work with each other to address problems related to  CIP for their sector. In particular, PDD 63 stated that they were to  (1) develop and implement a vulnerability awareness and education  program and (2) contribute to a sectoral National Infrastructure Assurance  Plan by  assessing the vulnerabilities of the sector to cyber or physical attacks;  recommending a plan to eliminate significant vulnerabilities;  proposing a system for identifying and preventing major attacks; and   developing a plan for alerting, containing, and rebuffing an attack in  progress and then, in coordination with the Federal Emergency  Management Agency as appropriate, rapidly reconstituting minimum  essential capabilities in the aftermath of an attack.", "PDD 63 also stated that sector liaisons should identify and assess economic  incentives to encourage the desired sector behavior in CIP. Further, to  facilitate private-sector participation, it encouraged the voluntary creation  of information sharing and analysis centers (ISACs) that could serve as  mechanisms for gathering, analyzing, and appropriately sanitizing and  disseminating information to and from infrastructure sectors and the  federal government through NIPC.", "In response to PDD 63, a banking and finance sector coordinating  committee on CIP, chaired by a sector coordinator, was initiated by the  Secretary of the Treasury in October 1998.

The national plan provided a vision and a framework  for the federal government to prevent, detect, respond to, and protect the  nation\u2019s critical cyber-based infrastructure from attack and reduce existing  vulnerabilities by complementing and focusing existing federal computer  security and information technology requirements. Subsequent versions of  the plan were expected to (1) define the roles of industry and of state and  local governments working in partnership with the federal government to  protect physical and cyber-based infrastructures from deliberate attack and  (2) examine the international aspects of CIP.", "In October 2001, the President signed Executive Order 13231, establishing  the President\u2019s Critical Infrastructure Protection Board to coordinate  cyber-related federal efforts and programs associated with protecting our  nation\u2019s critical infrastructures.

The regulators oversee a mix of large,  medium, and small depository institutions, as shown in table 3. Banking  regulators also work together through the Federal Financial Institutions  Examinations Council (FFIEC), an interagency forum that Congress  created in 1979 to promote consistency in the examination and supervision  of depository institutions. For example, the Information Technology  Subcommittee of the FFIEC Task Force on Supervision supervises the  largest 18 to 20 technology service providers, and the regulators\u2019 regional  offices supervise smaller technology service providers.

The act allows for examinations to be  extended to 18 months for small (less than $250 million in assets), well- capitalized, well-managed institutions that meet certain criteria. The  primary objectives of such examinations of financial institutions, known as  safety-and-soundness examinations, are to (1) provide an objective  evaluation of the institution\u2019s safety and soundness, determine compliance  with applicable laws, rules, and regulations; and ensure that it maintains  capital commensurate with its risk; (2) appraise the quality and overall  effectiveness of management and their risk management systems; and  (3) identify, communicate, and follow up in all areas of the examination\u2019s  recommendations, especially in areas where corrective action is required  to strengthen the bank\u2019s performance and compliance with laws, rules, and  regulations.", "The financial institution safety-and-soundness examination assesses six  components of a financial institution\u2019s performance\u2014capital adequacy,  asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to market  risk.

CIAO works in part with the financial services sector  to educate the public and raise its awareness of and participation in CIP  efforts and to integrate infrastructure assurance objectives into both the  public and private sectors.", "Finally, as previously mentioned, the President\u2019s Special Advisor for  Cyberspace Security chairs the Critical Infrastructure Protection Board  and works closely with the federal government and the private sector to  coordinate protection of the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure information  systems, including those in the financial services industry. The Special  Advisor is also tasked with coordinating intergovernmental agency efforts  to secure information systems. Several officials from the financial services  sector told us that the Special Advisor has taken an active role in promoting  governmental partnership efforts, enjoys a strong relationship with the  financial services sector, and advocates initiatives sponsored by the private  sector, such as BITS\u2019s Product Certification Program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Regulators Have Taken Steps to Address Information Security Issues", "paragraphs": ["Federal regulators have taken several steps to address information security  issues. These steps include consideration of information security risks in  determining the scope of their examinations of financial institutions,  development of guidance for examining information security and for  protecting against cyber threats, and reviewing the practices of information  technology service providers.", "Regulators have historically played a role in the oversight of the financial  services sector. As part of that oversight, financial institution regulators  and SEC have generally considered information security risks in  determining the scope of their examinations. The purposes of such risk- based examinations vary and may not be specifically focused on critical  infrastructure protection. For example, safety and soundness examinations  of financial institutions include evaluating compliance with laws such as  section 501(b) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. SEC\u2019s examinations of  securities exchanges, clearing organizations, and certain electronic  communication networks are intended to determine whether they comply  with SEC\u2019s voluntary guidance, the Automation Review Policy program.  The program is focused on certain operational issues, including  information technology, of which information security is a part. SEC\u2019s  examinations of broker-dealers\u2019 information technology were initiated in  July 2001 as a result of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. These examinations  are targeted at the adequacy of safeguards against unauthorized disclosure  of customer information.", "In addition, the nature and scope of information security evaluations at  regulated entities varies. Regulators determine the scope of examinations  through risk analysis and the examiner\u2019s judgment. Consequently, because  information security is considered in relation to other areas in determining  the scope of the examination, it may receive only a limited review. Because  we did not review bank examinations as part of our scope on this review,  we were unable to independently determine how often and how  extensively regulatory agencies reviewed information security at the  entities they oversee.", "Nonetheless, through examinations, regulators obtain information about  the adequacy of information security at certain individual financial  institutions, which can be used to suggest improvements where  appropriate. The nature and extent of such information varies and,  according to a Treasury official, examinations are not integrated with the  federal government\u2019s CIP efforts. According to FFIEC officials,  examinations by the FFIEC agencies\u2014and their results\u2014are confidential  by law, and are therefore not shared between FFIEC member agencies or  with non-FFIEC member agencies. For example, according to the Federal  Reserve, information sharing is limited by banking laws, trade secret laws,  and the Federal Reserve\u2019s regulations. As discussed earlier in this report,  Treasury has not undertaken a comprehensive assessment of the potential  use of public policy tools, such as grants, tax incentives, and regulations  (including regulations related to examinations). However, the National  Strategy for Homeland Security reiterated the need to use all available  policy tools to raise the security of the nation\u2019s critical infrastructures.", "Other actions are being taken by regulators to address information security.  FFIEC is in the process of updating its Information Systems Examination  Handbook, which provides regulators with general guidance on  information systems and other areas of technology examinations, such as  business continuity, information security, electronic banking, vendor  management, payment systems, and audit. Also, as discussed earlier in this  report, FRS, OCC, and SEC (with the participation of the Federal Reserve  Bank of New York and the New York State Banking Department) issued a  draft white paper on August 30, 2002, that identified certain critical  financial markets and proposed sound practices for strengthening the  resilience of those markets. In addition, the regulators have issued over the  years numerous guidance documents regarding information security. For  example, in 2001, FFIEC agencies issued detailed enforceable guidelines to  carry out the requirements set forth in Section 501(b) of the Gramm-Leach- Bliley Act regarding the safeguarding of customer information by insured  depository institutions.", "We plan to discuss related actions taken by the regulators in response to  the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in further detail in another report  requested by this committee."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The computer interconnectivity used by the financial services sector for  customer services and operations poses significant information security  risks to computer systems and to the critical operations and infrastructures  they support.

The strategy identifies a framework for sector actions necessary  to identify, assess, and respond to sectorwide threats, including completing  a sectorwide vulnerability assessment. However, the financial services  industry has not developed detailed interim objectives; detailed tasks,  timeframes, or responsibilities for implementation; or processes for  measuring progress in implementing the sector\u2019s strategy.", "Federal entities have taken a number of steps to coordinate federal  government and private-sector efforts and to assist the financial services  sector in its CIP effort, but Treasury has not undertaken a comprehensive  assessment, as called for in federal CIP policy, of the potential use of public  policy tools to encourage increased sector participation. Consideration of  the need for public policy tools is important to encouraging private sector  participation in sector-related CIP efforts, including implementation of the  sector\u2019s strategy.
