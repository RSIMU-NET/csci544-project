GAO was asked, among other things, to identify federal agencies information technology (IT) initiatives to support our nation's readiness to deal with bioterrorism. Specifically, we compiled an inventory of such activities, determined the range of these coordination activities with other agencies, and identified the use of health care standards in these efforts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The six key federal agencies involved in bioterrorism preparedness and response identified about 70 planned and operational information systems in several IT categories associated with supporting a public health emergency. These encompass detection (systems that collect and identify potential biological agents from environmental samples), surveillance (systems that facilitate ongoing data collection, analysis, and interpretation of disease-related data), communications (systems that facilitate the secure and timely delivery of information to the relevant responders and decision makers), and supporting technologies (tools or systems that provide information for the other categories of systems). For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is currently implementing its Health Alert Network, an early warning and response system intended to provide federal, state, and local agencies with better communications during public health emergencies, and the Department of Defense is using its Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-based Epidemics to support early identification of infectious disease outbreaks in the military by comparing analyses of data collected daily with historical trends. The extent of coordination or interaction of these systems among agencies covered a wide range--from an absence of coordination, to awareness among the agencies with no formal coordination, to formal coordination, to joint development of initiatives. IT can more effectively facilitate emergency response if standards are developed and implemented that allow systems to be interoperable. The need for common, agreed-upon standards is widely acknowledged in the health community, and activities to strengthen and increase the use of applicable standards are ongoing. For example, CDC has defined a public health information architecture, which identifies data, communication, and security standards needed to ensure the interoperability of related systems. Despite these ongoing efforts to address IT standards, many issues remain to be worked out, including coordinating the various standards-setting initiatives and monitoring the implementation of standards for health care delivery and public health. An underlying challenge for establishing and implementing such standards is the lack of an overall strategy guiding IT development and initiatives. Without such a strategy to address the development and implementation of standards, agencies may not be well positioned to take advantage of IT that could facilitate better preparation for and response to public health emergencies--including bioterrorism."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The October 2001 anthrax attacks highlighted long-standing weaknesses in  the current public health infrastructure and prompted efforts to improve  our nation\u2019s preparedness for and response to public health emergencies,  including bioterrorism.

For example, on March  15, 2003, the World Health Organization issued an emergency travel  advisory due to an unknown form of pneumonia now known as Severe  Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Originating in China, it has infected  over 7,900 people and caused at least 662 deaths worldwide\u2014with 67  probable cases reported in the United States as of May 20, 2003. Further,  terrorist organizations, such as al Qaeda, may be capable of releasing life- threatening biological agents through covert or overt attacks.

Some biological agents\u2014such as  anthrax and plague\u2014produce symptoms that can easily be confused with  influenza or other, less virulent illnesses, leading to a delay in diagnosis or  identification. For example, the recent outbreak of the new infectious  disease, SARS, whose onset includes common symptoms such as high  fever, coughing, and difficulty in breathing, was not recognized until about  4 months after the first known case.", "Initial response to a public health emergency, including an act of  bioterrorism, is generally a local responsibility that could involve multiple  jurisdictions in a region, with states providing additional support when  needed. Since clinicians at the local level are most likely to be the first  ones to detect an incident, they and local public health officials are  expected to report incidents or symptoms of suspicious illness to the state  health department and other designated parties. States can provide  supporting personnel, financial resources, laboratory capacity, and other  assistance to local responders. Because of the many participants involved,  the identification and management of bioterrorism and other public health  emergencies call for effective communication and collaboration across all  levels of government and the private sector.

Every state has at least one public health laboratory to  support its disease surveillance activities and other public health  programs. State laboratories conduct testing for routine surveillance or as  part of special clinical or epidemiological studies. Independent  commercial and hospital laboratories may also share with public health  agencies information they have gathered through their private surveillance  efforts, such as studies of patterns of antibiotic resistance or of the spread  of diseases within a hospital.

According to CDC, once  fully implemented, these standards are to provide the ability to merge data  from laboratories with epidemiological data, in addition to providing the  ability to obtain information on cross-jurisdictional outbreaks.", "In August 1996, Congress also recognized the need for standards to  improve the Medicare and Medicaid programs in particular and the  efficiency and effectiveness of the health care system in general. It passed  the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA),  which calls for the industry to control the distribution and exchange of  health care data and begin to adopt electronic data exchange standards to  uniformly and securely exchange patient information. According to the  National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS), significant  progress has occurred on several HIPAA standards, however, the full  economic benefits of administrative simplification will be realized only  when all of the standards are in place.", "In July 2000, the NCVHS again reported on the need for standards, this  time highlighting the need for uniform standards for patient medical  record information. They found that major impediments to electronic  exchange of patient medical information were the limited interoperability  of health information systems; the limited comparability of data  exchanged among providers; and the need for better data quality,  accountability, and integrity. In November 2001, NCVHS issued another  report outlining a strategy, which includes developing and using standards.  According to NCVHS, the public health infrastructure could be  strengthened through more rapid identification and implementation of  existing standards and other new standards. The Institute of Medicine  (IOM) and others are also reporting on the lack of national standards for  the coding and classification of clinical and other health care data, and for  the secure transmission and sharing of such data.", "Complementary to the work of NEDSS on identifying standards for public  health systems, in 2001 the Office of Management and Budget created the  Consolidated Health Informatics (CHI) initiative as one of its e- government projects to facilitate the adoption of data standards, among  others, for health care systems within the federal government. The CHI  initiative is an interagency work group led by HHS and composed of  representatives from DOD, VA, and other agencies. Recognizing the need  for standards to be incorporated across federal health care systems, HHS,  DOD, and VA recently announced its first set of standards (e.g., HL7,  LOINC) for the electronic exchange of health information to be  implemented across the federal government. Once federal agencies adopt  the recommended standards, they are expected to include the standards in  their architectures and to build systems accordingly. This commitment is  to apply to all new systems acquisition and development projects. The CHI  initiative plans to announce additional standards for federal systems as the  working group agrees upon them, but does not have time frames  established for making these announcements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Standards Implementation Challenges Remain", "paragraphs": ["Despite progress in defining health care IT standards, several  implementation challenges\u2014such as coordination of the various initiatives  to achieve consensus on the use of standards, establishment of milestones,  and development of implementation mechanisms\u2014remain to be worked  out. Currently, there are no activities or mechanisms defined to ensure  coordination and consensus between these initiatives at the national level.  HHS officials agree that leadership and direction are still needed to  coordinate the various standards-setting initiatives and to ensure  consistent implementation of standards for health care delivery and public  health. Coordination of these initiatives is essential to ensure that the  completion of standards development is accelerated and that consensus is  obtained from all stakeholders. According to NCVHS, the process of  developing health care data standards involves many diverse entities, such  as individual and group practices, software developers, domain-specific  professional associations, and allied health services. This fragmentation  has slowed the dissemination and adoption of standards by making it  difficult to convene all of the relevant stakeholders and subject matter  experts in standards development meetings and to reach consensus within  a reasonable period of time.", "Another challenge is that not all of the federal government\u2019s standards- setting initiatives have milestones associated with efforts to define and  implement standards. For example, while the CHI initiative\u2014the primary  federal initiative to establish standards\u2014has announced such initial  standards and implementation requirements for health care information  exchange, it has not yet established milestones for future announcements.  Accordingly, it is not clear when these announcements will occur.", "Another challenge is that there is no mechanism to monitor the  implementation of standards throughout the health care industry. In  November 2001, NCVHS reported a need for a mechanism, such as  compliance testing, to ensure that health care standards are uniformly  adopted as part of a national strategy. NCVHS added that without an  implementation mechanism and leadership at the national level, problems  associated with systems\u2019 incompatibility and lack of interoperability will  persist throughout the different levels of government and the private  sector and, consequently, throughout the health care sector. Since that  time, however, no national monitoring mechanism has yet been  established.", "A major consequence of not implementing such standards is the  promulgation of piecemeal systems, which result in disparate systems that  cannot exchange data. This leads to information gaps, hindering the  prompt and accurate identification of emerging biological threats\u2014 consequently, timely detection of major public health threats is limited.  For example, according to CDC officials, one of the IT challenges  encountered by public health officials responding to the anthrax events of  October 2001 was the issue of exchanging data among the many  participants involved in the response\u2014clinical sites, local health  departments, emergency responders, state health departments, public  health laboratories, and federal agencies. During this event, participants  accumulated dissimilar data and principally exchanged it manually.", "An underlying challenge for establishing and implementing such standards  is that no overall strategy guides IT development and initiatives. With no  overall strategy that addresses the development and implementation of  standards and associated milestones, federal agencies cannot ensure their  systems\u2019 abilities to exchange data with other systems when needed and  cannot ensure effective preparation for and response to bioterrorism and  other public health emergencies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Emerging Information Technologies Could Enhance Agencies\u2019 Abilities to Prepare for and Respond to Public Health Emergencies", "paragraphs": ["Within the public health sector, the implementation of emerging  information technologies could help to strengthen agencies\u2019 technological  capabilities to support the nation\u2019s ability to prepare for and respond to  bioterrorism and other public health emergencies.

Examples of emerging information  technologies for use in public health applications include the following:    Geographic information system (GIS):  GIS is being used by  federal agencies to support disease and outbreak surveillance. CDC  uses GIS to track the spread of infection through a community, to  identify geographic areas of particular health concern, and to identify  susceptible populations. The resulting information can be used in  support of surveillance systems to help identify spatial clustering of  abnormal events as the data are collected. GIS was used in 2001 to map  data related to CDC\u2019s emergency response to the anthrax bioterrorism  event, and it was used in 2002 to aid the FBI\u2019s investigation of the  anthrax attack in Florida. FDA is currently using GIS technology in its  food safety system, eLEXNET.", "Web-based images for diagnosis: Several of CDC\u2019s systems use the  Internet to enhance reporting and communications capabilities. For  example, its DPDx system uses the Internet to strengthen the  capabilities of laboratories to diagnose parasitic diseases.

Therefore their implementation  may introduce a significant level of risk. For these reasons, the  introduction of an emerging information technology may be disruptive to  existing business processes.", "A third possible barrier is the lack of a clearly defined mechanism for  continuing research and development for emerging technologies once the  results are turned over to the public health sector. For example, according  to a CDC official, there is no mechanism to develop demonstration  projects to identify and prove the usefulness and applicability of emerging  technologies within the public health sector at the federal, state, and local  levels. At the time of our review, funds for two research and development  efforts that were initially identified as promising were discontinued  without consideration of the project\u2019s value to the public health  infrastructure.", "Lastly, we observed that activities related to the use of emerging  technologies are often the result of independent efforts for specific  purposes.

The surveillance network relies on the participation of  health care providers, laboratories, state and local health departments,  and other nontraditional data sources across the nation. Surveillance  systems monitor and track abnormal situations that require  epidemiological actions and that direct preventive measures by guiding  resource allocation and assessing interventions.

Passive surveillance  relies on physicians, laboratory and hospital staff, and others to take the  initiative in reporting data to health departments.

Fragmentation has developed in  surveillance systems in part because states and localities have not  developed uniform data collection procedures, storage, and transmission.  In February 1999, we reported on gaps in the nation\u2019s public health  surveillance network for important emerging infectious diseases; and we  recommended that CDC, in collaboration with state, local, and other  public health officials, reach consensus on the core capabilities needed at  each level of government, including IT capabilities. Another key factor  shaping the development of surveillance systems is that, historically,  investment in these systems has been targeted to specific programs (e.g.,  tuberculosis, sexually transmitted diseases, etc.), resulting in a patchwork  of surveillance efforts across the spectrum of infectious disease threats  and other programs.", "Most surveillance systems are identified by the type of data they collect;  there are eight categories of surveillance:  1.  Foodborne illness surveillance\u2014systems that collect, process, and  disseminate information on foodborne pathogens or illness. In  September 2001, we reported weaknesses in several of CDC\u2019s  surveillance systems for foodborne illness; we reported that these  systems had limited usefulness because there were gaps in the data  and because CDC did not release the data in a timely manner.  2.  Hospital-based surveillance\u2014systems that collect data on hospital- acquired infections for hospital infection control officers. Their  primary purpose is to track hospital acquired infections, not to identify  undiagnosed infections from the community. However, hospital-based  surveillance systems could play two roles in the early detection of  emerging infections: the identification of a cluster of recently admitted  patients, which might suggest a community-based outbreak, and the  identification of a cluster of cases within the hospital that may suggest  inpatients with an unrecognized communicable disease.  3.  Influenza surveillance\u2014systems that collect data on influenza-like  illness. These systems are relevant to bioterrorism surveillance  because many bioterrorism-related illnesses present with flu-like  symptoms. Influenza surveillance could also serve as a model because  these systems integrate clinical and laboratory data for the detection  of influenza outbreaks and are coordinated global efforts; they fulfill  needs similar to those of surveillance for bioterrorism.  4.  Laboratory and antimicrobial resistance surveillance\u2014systems  that facilitate the collection, analysis, and reporting of notifiable  pathogens and of antimicrobial resistance data that could potentially  facilitate the rapid detection of a biological agent. Laboratory  surveillance systems are an essential component of any system for the  detection of a covert bioterrorism event, both for the detection of  uncommon organisms (e.g., smallpox, anthrax, and Ebola) and  common organisms with unusual patterns of antimicrobial resistance.  5.  Network of clinical reports\u2014systems that collect and analyze  clinical reports from individual clinicians and sentinel networks. The  growth of such networks has generated a demand for information  systems capable of automating data collection, analysis, reporting, and  communication.  6.  Syndromal surveillance\u2014systems that collect data on the earliest  signs and symptoms caused by most biological agents. Therefore,  patients with these syndromes are the targets of syndromal  surveillance programs. These systems are still considered  experimental, and there is no widely accepted definition for any of  these syndromes. As a result, syndromal surveillance systems are  widely heterogeneous with respect to the syndromes under  surveillance and how each syndrome is defined.  7.  Zoonotic and animal disease surveillance\u2014systems that collect,  process, and disseminate information on zoonotic and animal diseases.  There are concerns that a bioterrorist attack could involve the  dissemination of a zoonotic illness among animal populations with the  intention of infecting humans or livestock and causing economic and  political/economic chaos. Early detection of such an event requires  effective rapid detection systems for use by farm workers, meat  inspectors, and veterinarians, with real-time reporting capabilities to  public health officials.  8.

The work may provide more specific and sensitive sensors, having very low or no false positives that can be used to  collect samples and provide data to information systems.  Future plans include the development of single receptors for multiple  bioagents or for a combination of biological and chemical agents.", "HL7 is an ANSI-accredited standards development organization that creates message  format standards. Version 2.3 provides a protocol that enables the flow of data between  systems. Version 3.0 is being developed through the use of a formalized methodology  involving the creation of a Reference Information Model to encompass the ability, not  only to move data, but to use data once it is moved.", "LOINC is a set of code standards that identifies clinical questions, variables, and reports.  It comprises a database of 15,000 variables with synonyms and cross-mappings; it  covers a wide range of laboratory and clinical subject areas. The formal structure has six  parts: component, property measured, time aspect, system, precision, and method.", "SNOMED is a nomenclature classification for indexing medical vocabulary, including  signs, symptoms, diagnoses, and procedures; it defines code standards in a variety of  clinical areas called coding axes. It can identify procedures and possible answers to  clinical questions that are coded through LOINC.", "The National Library of Medicine developed UMLS as a standard health vocabulary that  enables cross-referencing to other terminology and classification systems and includes a  metathesaurus, a semantic network, and an information sources map. Its purpose is to  help health professionals and researchers retrieve and integrate electronic biomedical  information from a variety of sources, irrespective of the variations in the way similar  concepts are expressed in different sources and classification systems.", "CIPHER\u2019s objective is to establish standards for the data used in surveillance, to allow  for a consistent definition and a consistent implementation across programs. The  following objectives have been defined for CIPHER: (1) establish consistent definitions  for information collected and used by surveillance systems; (2) define standards for how  questions are to be formatted and information is to be collected on surveillance case  report forms; (3) identify standards for the processing of data in electronic data entry  systems, including value/label displays, reference table look-ups, and a minimum level of  edit-checking; (4) identify storage standards; (5) provide guidance on electronic data  interchange; and (6) provide guidance on coding for the display of data in statistical  analyses and reports."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix XII: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XIII: Comments from the Department of Energy", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XIV: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "1.
