GAO identified eight key IT workforce planning practices in November 2016 that are critical to ensuring that agencies have the knowledge and skills to successfully acquire IT, such as analyzing the workforce to identify gaps in competencies and staffing. However, GAO reported that the five selected federal agencies it reviewed had not fully implemented these practices. For example, none of these agencies had fully assessed their competency and staffing needs regularly or established strategies and plans to address gaps in these areas. These weaknesses were due, in part, to agencies lacking comprehensive policies that required these practices. Accordingly, GAO made specific recommendations to the five agencies to address the practices that were not fully implemented. Four agencies agreed and one partially agreed with GAO's recommendations.", "IT Dashboard. To facilitate transparency into the government's acquisition of IT, OMB's IT Dashboard provides detailed information on major investments at federal agencies, including ratings from Chief Information Officers (CIO) that should reflect the level of risk facing an investment. GAO reported in June 2016 that 13 of the 15 agencies selected for in-depth review had not fully considered risks when rating their investments on the IT Dashboard. In particular, of the 95 investments reviewed, GAO's assessments of risks matched the CIO ratings 22 times, showed more risk 60 times, and showed less risk 13 times. Several factors contributed to these differences, such as CIO ratings not being updated frequently and using outdated risk data. GAO recommended that agencies improve the quality and frequency of their ratings. Most agencies agreed with GAO's recommendations.", "Incremental development. An additional reform initiated by OMB has emphasized the need for federal agencies to deliver investments in smaller parts, or increments, in order to reduce risk and deliver capabilities more quickly. Specifically, since 2012, OMB has required investments to deliver functionality every 6 months. In August 2016, GAO determined that, for fiscal year 2016, 22 agencies had reported on the IT Dashboard that 64 percent of their software development projects would deliver useable functionality every 6 months. However, GAO determined that only three of seven agencies selected for in-depth review had policies regarding the CIO certifying IT investments' adequate implementation of incremental development, as required by OMB. GAO recommended, among other things, that four agencies improve their policies for CIO certification of incremental development. Most of these agencies agreed with the recommendations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Between fiscal years 2010 and 2015, GAO made 803 recommendations to OMB and federal agencies to address shortcomings in IT acquisitions and operations.

As stated earlier, ensuring program staff  have the necessary knowledge and skills is a factor commonly identified  as critical to the success of major investments.

To better ensure  that the Dashboard ratings more accurately reflect risk, we recommended  that the 15 agencies take actions to improve the quality and frequency of  their CIO ratings.

Accordingly, we  recommended that OMB develop and issue clearer guidance on  incremental development and that the selected agencies update and  implement their associated policies. Four of the six agencies agreed with  our recommendations or had no comments; the remaining two agencies  partially agreed or disagreed with the recommendations.

Regarding the remaining 169  projects (or 36 percent) that were reported as not planning to deliver  functionality every 6 months, agencies provided a variety of explanations  for not achieving that goal. These included project complexity, the lack of  an established project release schedule, or that the project was not a  software development project.

Agency officials reported that  management and organizational challenges and project complexity and  uniqueness had impacted their ability to deliver incrementally. We  concluded that it was critical that agencies continue to improve their use  of incremental development to deliver functionality and reduce the risk  that these projects will not meet cost, schedule, and performance goals.", "In addition, while OMB had issued guidance requiring covered agency  CIOs to certify that each major IT investment\u2019s plan for the current year  adequately implements incremental development, only three agencies  (the Departments of Commerce, Homeland Security, and Transportation)  had defined processes and policies intended to ensure that the  department CIO certifies that major IT investments are adequately  implementing incremental development. Officials from three other  agencies (the Departments of Education, Health and Human Services,  and the Treasury) reported that they were in the process of updating their  existing incremental development policy to address certification, while the  Department of Defense\u2019s policies that address incremental development  did not include information on CIO certification. We concluded that until all  of the agencies we reviewed define processes and policies for the  certification of the adequate use of incremental development, they will not  be able to fully ensure adequate implementation of, or benefit from,  incremental development practices.", "Accordingly, we recommended that four agencies establish a policy and  process for the certification of major IT investments\u2019 adequate use of  incremental development. The Departments of Education and Health and  Human Services agreed with our recommendation, while the Department  of Defense disagreed and stated that its existing policies address the use  of incremental development. However, we noted that the department\u2019s  policies did not comply with OMB\u2019s guidance and that we continued to  believe our recommendation was appropriate. The Department of the  Treasury did not comment on the recommendation.", "In conclusion, with the enactment of FITARA, the federal government has  an opportunity to improve the transparency and management of IT  acquisitions, and to strengthen the authority of CIOs to provide needed  direction and oversight. In addition to implementing FITARA, applying key  IT workforce planning practices could improve the agencies\u2019 ability to  assess and address gaps in knowledge and skills that are critical to the  success of major acquisitions. Further, continuing to implement key OMB  initiatives can help to improve the acquisition of IT. For example,  conducting additional TechStat reviews can help focus management  attention on troubled projects and provide a mechanism to establish clear  action items to improve project performance or terminate the investment.  Additionally, improving the assessment of risks when agencies rate major  investments on the IT Dashboard would likely provide greater  transparency and oversight of the government\u2019s billions of dollars in IT  investments. Lastly, increasing the use of incremental development  approaches could improve the likelihood that major IT investments meet  cost, schedule, and performance goals.", "Chairmen Hurd and Meadows, Ranking Members Kelly and Connolly,  and Members of the Subcommittees, this completes my prepared  statement.
