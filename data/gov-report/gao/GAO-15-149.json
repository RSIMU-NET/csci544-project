Some DOD officials stated that they are concerned about foreign encroachment, which may provide an opportunity for persistent surveillance of DOD test and training activities. However, DOD has not prioritized its ranges or assessed such threats because, among other things, there is no clear guidance on how to conduct assessments of the risks and threats posed by foreign encroachment. Some DOD officials told GAO they have considered conducting such assessments, but DOD has not issued guidance directing the services to conduct these assessments. Officials from the Navy and the Air Force stated that given the unique nature of each range, it would be difficult to assess their criticality. However, Navy officials stated that they had expected to issue guidance for conducting risk assessments sometime in 2015. Without clear guidance from DOD for the services to follow in conducting a risk assessment, DOD may not be able to determine what, if any, negative impact foreign encroachment may be having on its test or training ranges.", "DOD has not obtained sufficient information on commercial activity being conducted near test and training ranges in the level of detail officials say they need\u2014such as if a U.S.-based entity is owned or controlled by a foreign entity\u2014to determine if specific transactions on federally owned or managed land in proximity to ranges pose a threat to the range. Such information is generally not collected by other agencies with responsibilities for these transactions because, in some cases, legal, regulatory, or resource challenges may prevent them from collecting information that is unrelated to their agencies' missions. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration collects information about proposed structures that are more than 200 feet in height to support the agency's mission of maintaining a safe and efficient aerospace system, but does not collect information on the ownership of the companies building the structures because it is beyond the scope of its mission. DOD has identified some potential sources of information, but it has not formally collaborated with other federal agencies on how to gather this information. Leading practices state that agencies can enhance and sustain collaboration by engaging in several practices, including addressing needs and leveraging resources and agreeing on roles and responsibilities.

As discussed above, utilizing a risk  management approach, which includes conducting a risk assessment,  allows an agency to more effectively prioritize its resources and enhance  its ability to respond to a threat. A DOD instruction governing its critical  infrastructure program states that determining the criticality of key assets  is a core element of conducting a risk assessment.provides a framework that could be used to manage critical infrastructure  across the department, it does not specifically mention risk assessment in  relation to foreign encroachment.

Therefore, this instruction  could be used by DOD as a model for how to deal with the issue of  foreign encroachment.", "Navy and Air Force officials said that the lack of an established  methodology or criteria, as well as the unique mission capabilities of each  range, make it difficult to determine the relative criticality of each range as  it relates to foreign encroachment, including which ranges would be the  most valuable collection points for foreign adversaries trying to gather  intelligence and which ranges house the most sensitive test and training  activities. In addition, the services do not have guidance on how to  conduct such an assessment because the issue of foreign encroachment  is new. However, DOD has resolved similar challenges in the past. For  instance, in an October 2009 review of DOD\u2019s management of electrical  disruptions, we found that DOD had not developed guidelines for  addressing the unique challenges related to conducting some  vulnerability assessments of electrical power assets. We recommended  that DOD develop explicit guidelines, based on existing Defense Critical  Infrastructure Program guidance, for assessing critical assets\u2019  vulnerabilities to long-term electrical power disruptions. with this recommendation and developed a tool for assessing critical  assets\u2019 vulnerabilities to power disruptions.

These officials further stated that, once  guidance is finalized, they intend to begin the assessment process.  Officials told us that they expect that, once this assessment process is  complete, it will be a critical component of any effort to prioritize ranges  by their importance. This, in turn, could support any Navy efforts to  address foreign encroachment by targeting counter-intelligence activities  on the most critical ranges.", "According to DOD, another core element of a risk assessment is to  determine vulnerabilities, or the weakness of an asset that could cause it  to suffer a loss. DOD and the services have raised concerns about the  level of vulnerability facing some of their test and training ranges with  regard to foreign encroachment. Specifically, Navy and Air Force  headquarters officials as well as officials from all four of the ranges in our  review told us that they had concerns about the number of investment- related projects by foreign entities occurring near their respective  ranges\u2014projects that they stated could pose potential security threats.  Those officials told us that they were particularly concerned that foreign  entities may have an increased ability to observe sensitive military testing  or training activities if they are able to establish a persistent presence  outside the services\u2019 test or training ranges. Further, officials at all four of  the ranges in our review expressed such concerns to varying degrees.  For example, officials from the Fallon Range Training Complex and the  Nevada Test and Training Range, both of which are used to provide  realistic air-to-ground combat training, told us that they have observed a  number of energy development and mining projects near both ranges that  may be owned or controlled by foreign entities. Officials at Eglin Air Force  Base, where the Air Force conducts land, air, and water test and training,  and at White Sands Missile Range, where the services evaluate new  weapon systems, also expressed concerns about the potential for foreign  entities to observe testing and training activities at their respective  ranges. DOD officials noted, however, that the services have not  conducted formal assessments to determine the extent to which these  vulnerabilities exist at their ranges.", "According to DOD\u2019s instruction, along with establishing the criticality and  vulnerability of assets, the third core element of a risk assessment is to  assess the threats and hazards. Counterintelligence officials from the  services\u2019 criminal investigation agencies said that they have conducted  some threat or risk assessments on specific locations or installations, as  well as investigated some individual instances of commercial activity.  However, they have not conducted threat assessments focused on  foreign encroachment across DOD\u2019s test and training ranges. Although  these counterintelligence officials have investigated some individual  instances of commercial activity, they have not conducted a systematic  assessment of this potential threat because in most of the cases that they  have investigated, they have not seen evidence that foreign  encroachment posed a threat to the range. Therefore, they were reluctant  to assign additional resources to this issue. DOD officials stated that  given the uncertainty surrounding this issue, a risk assessment would be  beneficial. However, DOD has not taken steps to initiate such a risk  assessment or established a time frame for doing so. Without guidance  from DOD for the services to follow in conducting a risk assessment that  establishes a time frame for completion, identifies critical ranges, and  then assesses vulnerabilities and threats to these ranges, DOD may not  be able to determine what, if any, negative impact foreign encroachment  may be having on its test or training ranges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Does Not Have Sufficient Information to Fully Identify Instances of Foreign Encroachment near Its Domestic Test and Training Ranges", "paragraphs": ["DOD does not have information that officials say they need, such as the  ownership of companies conducting business on federally managed land  near DOD\u2019s ranges, to determine if specific transactions on federally  owned or managed land pose a threat to ranges.

Range officials at all  four installations in this review stated that they need more specific  information to determine whether an individual transaction poses a threat  to their range. Further, DOD officials have identified some possible  sources or methods for obtaining this information but have not formally  collaborated with other federal agencies on how to gather this  information. Collaboration can be broadly defined as any joint activity that  is intended to produce more public value than could be produced when  organizations act alone. Leading practices state that agencies can  enhance and sustain collaborative efforts by engaging in several  practices that are necessary for a collaborative working relationship.  These practices include identifying and addressing needs by leveraging  resources; agreeing on roles and responsibilities; and establishing  compatible policies, procedures, and other means to operate across  agency boundaries.", "In order for DOD to determine if an entity engaging in investment  activities near one of its test or training ranges poses a potential risk for  foreign encroachment, DOD officials said that they would need additional  identifying information from governing federal agencies responsible for  issuing public land-use permits or leases. Such information could include,  for example, identification of any parent companies or whether a U.S.- based entity is owned or controlled by a foreign entity. Service  headquarters and range officials at all four ranges in our review said that  they generally have good informal working relationships with governing  federal agencies that allow them to find out some information about  transactions on federal land near the ranges and that federal agency  officials, including those from the Bureau of Land Management or the  Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, frequently contact them to  informally let them know of a proposed transaction near the range.", "Despite these relationships, DOD and range officials expressed concerns  that these governing agencies are not able to provide DOD with the  necessary information to identify potential encroachment. Officials from  the Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of Ocean Energy  Management, and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement  within the Department of the Interior and the Federal Aviation  Administration within the Department of Transportation told us that they  face legal, regulatory, or resource challenges that may prevent them from  collecting information that is unrelated to their respective missions,  leading to knowledge gaps that may be acceptable for approving leases  or permits on federal lands but could adversely affect DOD\u2019s ability to  identify potential security threats near the ranges.

As part of this process individual agencies are required to certify to  the Office of Management and Budget, among other things, that  proposed collections of information are necessary for the proper  performance of the functions of the agency. As a result, Department  of the Interior officials said that they generally limit the information  they collect to what is directly tied to the agencies\u2019 respective  missions of effective land or resource management. Officials from the  Bureau of Land Management said that the information that they are  permitted to collect on potential lease-holders or permit applicants is  prescribed by regulation based on a longstanding interpretation of  their authorizing statute. Further, Federal Aviation Administration  officials told us that while they have a process for collecting  information about proposed structures that are more than 200 feet in  height or are within certain distances of airports or runways, this  process is designed to support the agency\u2019s mission of maintaining a  safe and efficient aerospace system, not to collect the information that  DOD would need to help identify instances of foreign encroachment  on its ranges. Therefore, officials from these agencies expressed that  they believe they would need some type of change in either their  authorizing statutes or regulations to be able to collect this  information.", "Agency officials also raised resource challenges as an issue in  collecting additional information. Department of the Interior officials  expressed concerns that any changes to either their statutory  authorities or implementing regulations in order to collect additional  information may create additional costs to the Department of the  Interior as its bureaus conduct their respective missions. The officials  told us they recognize the challenges DOD faces in identifying  potential cases of foreign encroachment, but they also said their  agencies\u2019 respective missions have little to do with national security  issues and agency officials questioned whether, under current law,  their appropriations could properly be used to finance data collection  unrelated to their mission and for DOD\u2019s exclusive use. These officials  expressed concerns that changes to their authorities or additional  requirements imposed upon them may be burdensome, given their  limited available resources.", "DOD has had some success in obtaining information that could be used  to identify activities that could provide opportunities for foreign  encroachment, but has not discussed options for obtaining additional  information with other federal agencies. However, as discussed above,  DOD officials said that when they do find out that an entity proposing a  project near a range is foreign-owned, they generally obtain information  on an informal basis through developed interagency relationships and not  through any systematic process. For example, at some DOD installations,  officials work with Bureau of Land Management district and field office  managers to receive notifications on or discuss projects that may have an  impact on DOD activities or interests. At one location\u2014Naval Air Station  Fallon\u2014the Navy and the Bureau of Land Management have established  a military liaison position to provide further coordination on both Navy and  Bureau of Land Management interests due to the large number of energy  development and mining projects occurring near the Fallon Range  Training Complex. This military liaison position is funded by the Navy and  the duties of the liaison include coordinating with the Navy on use of  public lands and providing advice on highly technical and complex  programs. In addition, Bureau of Land Management and DOD installation  officials said that other DOD installations have good working relationships  with their local Bureau of Land Management offices to discuss issues of  importance to both agencies. Through these relationships, individual  ranges are often notified of potential transactions near the ranges, but  due to reasons stated above, range officials at the four installations in our  review stated that they still feel that they need additional information on  the transactions to be able to assess whether a transaction poses a threat  to the range. The Navy, through the Center for Naval Analysis, recently  conducted a study on this issue and identified additional sources of  information that DOD could possibly leverage, including the Bureau of  Economic Analysis within the Department of Commerce. Because this is  an emerging issue for DOD, DOD has not taken steps to fully identify all  potential sources of information or to reach out to other federal agencies  that may have this information to discuss options for obtaining it.

As potential opportunities for foreign encroachment have  presented themselves, some in DOD have become increasingly  concerned about the potential vulnerability and risk to its domestic air,  land, and sea test and training ranges from such encroachment.  However, DOD has not determined the likelihood of foreign  encroachment through persistent presence on federally owned or  managed lands in proximity to the test and training ranges, versus other  means that may give foreign adversaries the opportunity to observe new  weapon systems and operational tactics. Although the Navy has taken  steps to develop guidance on assessing the risk of foreign encroachment  to its ranges, as of December 2014, this guidance has not been issued.

We compared DOD\u2019s efforts to key elements of conducting a risk  assessment that we previously developed as well as criteria for identifying  and protecting critical infrastructure that DOD uses in managing its  Defense Critical Infrastructure Program. We also reviewed DOD  counterintelligence guidance and intelligence reporting on surveillance  threats to DOD activities and facilities. To understand DOD\u2019s concerns  related to the potential presence of foreign entities near its test and  training ranges, we interviewed appropriate officials from the Office of the  Secretary of Defense as well as the Departments of the Navy, Army, and  Air Force. We interviewed officials from DOD and the services\u2019  intelligence agencies, as well as the Defense Intelligence Agency and the  Federal Bureau of Investigation, to understand the extent to which any  foreign encroachment concerns raised are based on information provided  by the intelligence community. We also interviewed appropriate officials  from the entities that govern activities on federally managed land in order  to understand how and the extent to which DOD works with civilian  governing agencies to identify areas of potential foreign encroachment.,  i.e., the Bureau of Land Management and Bureau of Ocean Energy  Management (both within the Department of the Interior), which have  responsibility for approving and administering permits and leases for  projects on public lands, and the Federal Aviation Administration (within  the Department of Transportation), which is responsible for reviewing  potential obstructions to aviation safety. Finally, we interviewed officials  from the Department of the Treasury, which chairs the Committee on  Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).", "To determine the extent to which DOD has obtained information on  specific transactions near test and training ranges that it needs to  determine if these transactions pose a threat to the range, we interviewed  officials from OSD and the military service headquarters, as well as  military department intelligence agencies, the Defense Intelligence  Agency, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. We also interviewed  officials from selected federal agencies including the Bureau of Land  Management and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management within the  Department of the Interior, the Federal Aviation Administration within the  Department of Transportation, and the Department of the Treasury, who  all have a role overseeing transactions on federal land surrounding  DOD\u2019s ranges. We compared DOD\u2019s efforts in obtaining information to  leading practices on decision making and collaboration from our prior  work.", "For both objectives, we spoke with officials from selected DOD test and  training ranges: the Nevada Test and Training Range, Nevada (Air  Force); the Fallon Range Training Complex, Nevada (Navy); Eglin Air  Force Base, Florida (Air Force); and White Sands Missile Range, New  Mexico (Army). After discussions with DOD officials, we selected  locations (1) that included at least one range from each military  department, (2) where security encroachment from foreign countries on  federally owned land near test or training ranges has been raised as a  concern, and (3) where ranges were surrounded by federally controlled  land or ocean areas, thus requiring coordination with other federal  agencies. At the Nevada Test and Training Range and the Fallon Range  Training Complex we also interviewed officials from the Bureau of Land  Management and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as these agencies  have responsibilities for the approval of public-use leases and permits or  domestic counterintelligence efforts outside of both of these locations,  respectively. Because federally owned land is disproportionately located  in the western United States, the majority of our visits and discussions  were with ranges in that area. The information from these four ranges is  not generalizable to all of DOD\u2019s domestic ranges. We limited the scope  of this engagement to projects in which the federal government plays a  role in approving, evaluating, or permitting the project.", "In addressing our objectives, we contacted officials representing a wide  range of organizations (see table 1).", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2013 to December 2014  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States", "paragraphs": ["The only formal option in regard to transactions involving foreign  companies or entities that accounts for national security concerns is the  Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) process.  However, the CFIUS process is limited in two main ways. First, CFIUS  only reviews transactions that meet certain criteria. Specifically, the  CFIUS process reviews covered transactions, which include any merger,  acquisition, or takeover that results in foreign control of any person  engaged in interstate commerce in the United States. However, there  are also many types of non-covered transactions that could result in a  foreign entity having access to or a persistent presence near DOD  ranges. These non-covered transactions include starts-ups, as well as  acquisitions of assets other than an interest in a U.S. company, such as  equipment or intellectual property. In addition, foreign purchases or  leases of private real property\u2014for business or non-business uses\u2014near  installations would not be covered by CFIUS. Second, CFIUS primarily  relies on voluntary reporting of transactions by the involved parties to  bring covered transactions to its attention, although the President or any  member of CFIUS can also initiate a review of a covered transaction  should they discover its occurrence. In the absence of voluntary  reporting by the parties involved or independent discovery of the  transaction by CFIUS, however, covered transactions will not be  reviewed.", "For covered transactions it does review, CFIUS determines the effects of  the transaction on national security, which includes consideration of a  number of factors, including the potential national security-related effects  on United States critical infrastructure. After a review of a covered transaction is initiated, the Committee evaluates the transaction and then  either approves the transaction, approves the transaction with mitigation  or makes a recommendation to the President to block the transaction. In  the case of transactions that the Committee approves with mitigation, the  Committee and participating companies typically execute national security  agreements that impose some type of limitations or monitoring of  projects, such as limitations on the citizenship of employees of the  company or reporting of visitation by foreign citizens. However, according  to DOD and installation officials, these agreements are often difficult to  enforce. Finally, if the President finds that (1) there is credible evidence  that the foreign interest exercising control might take action that will  impair the national security and that (2) other laws, in the judgment of the  President, do not provide adequate and appropriate authority for the  President to protect national security, then the President can direct that  the transaction be suspended or prohibited. This has only happened  rarely, though. For example, in 1990 the President ordered a foreign- owned company to divest its acquisition of a manufacturing firm  producing metal parts and assemblies for aircraft, and in 2012 the  President blocked a foreign acquisition of a U.S. energy firm that was  constructing a wind-turbine plant near a specialized Navy training facility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, GAO staff who made key  contributions to this report include Maria Storts, Assistant Director; Mark  Wielgoszynski, Assistant Director; Leslie Bharadwaja; Simon Hirschfeld;  Terry Richardson; Amie Lesser; Erik Wilkins-McKee; Michael Willems;  and Richard Winsor."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
