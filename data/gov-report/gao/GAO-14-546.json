Similar UN and U.S. benefits include retirement plans and health insurance, while similar allowances include hardship and danger pay. Where comparable data were available, GAO found that each organization provided some benefits or allowances of greater monetary value than the other. For example, under a scenario where UN and U.S. staff retire at 62 with 20 years of service, the U.S. Federal Employees Retirement System replaces a higher percentage of pre-retirement salary than the UN Joint Staff Pension Fund. However, when these staff retire with 30 years of service, similar percentages of pre-retirement salary are replaced. In contrast, the UN allowance for staff serving in dangerous duty stations with families at separate locations had a higher average monetary value per recipient in 2012 than the comparable U.S. allowance.", "The UN has begun to address concerns about the sustainability of its rising total compensation costs, including initiating a review of total compensation, but that review does not include key elements. GAO analysis of UN data shows that staff-related expenditures rose steadily from $1.95 billion in 2002-2003 to $2.98 billion in 2010-2011, at an average rate of about 7 percent per 2-year budget, when adjusted for inflation. To help address costs, the UN raised its retirement age from 62 to 65 for new hires and froze rates paid for allowances for at least 1 year. In addition, the UN's International Civil Service Commission (ICSC) began a review of UN compensation, to be completed in 2015. The UN General Assembly requested that the ICSC review consider all elements of UN total compensation holistically, including both monetary and non-monetary elements. However, according to ICSC officials and documents, the review focuses only on elements within the ICSC's area of administrative responsibility, such as salary and allowances. Other key elements with significant costs, such as pensions and retiree health insurance, fall outside the ICSC's authority and therefore the study's focus. For example, the unfunded liability of the UN's retiree health insurance plan was estimated in 2012 at almost $4 billion.

For data on allowances, we collected data from State for State Foreign  Service employees and civil service employees serving overseas and  data from DOD for civil service employees serving overseas, because  these employees are comparable to UN Secretariat professional staff.  Data from State and DOD were for calendar year 2012. We also  calculated examples of retirement benefits paid by UN and U.S.  retirement programs, as well as the average cost of health care benefits  for both UN staff and U.S. government employees.

On some matters, the ICSC  can act independently, while on others its decisions are subject to  General Assembly approval. For example, the ICSC can determine  changes to the post adjustment, or cost-of-living adjustment portion of  UN salaries, without prior approval from the General Assembly. In  addition, the ICSC can set some allowances, such as the hardship  allowance for employees serving at posts where living conditions are  considered difficult, without General Assembly approval.

The UN pension plan provides  benefits similar to the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS), a  retirement plan providing U.S. federal civilian retirees with a defined  benefit.

Income  replacement rates provide a method of comparing retirement programs  that describe how much of a worker\u2019s preretirement salary is replaced in  the first year of retirement by a retirement plan. For example, an  employee with a preretirement salary of $100,000 who received $60,000  in the first year of retirement from his or her retirement plan has an  income replacement rate of 60 percent. Our scenarios had varying  results. One scenario showed that income replacement rates under FERS  were higher than for the UN Pension Fund, given the economic conditions  of the time periods we analyzed. In another scenario, the income  replacement rates for the two systems were similar. Both scenarios are  summarized in table 3. One of our scenarios compares UN staff and  U.S. civil service employees covered by FERS who retire at age 62,  contribute an equivalent percentage of salary to their retirement, and  have 30 years of service. Our estimates show that the FERS retirement  package replaces between 63 and 69 percent of salary, while the UN  Pension Fund replaces between 63 and 68 percent of salary. We also  compared UN staff and U.S. employees with 20 years of service who  retire at age 62 and contribute an equivalent percentage of salary to their  retirement. Our estimates show that FERS replaces between 48 and 55  percent of salary, and the UN Pension Fund replaces between 40 and 44  percent of salary.", "While our analysis of income replacement rates showed varying results,  several factors affected our estimates. First, to achieve higher income  replacement rates than UN staff, U.S. employees have to make voluntary  contributions to their retirement plan and accept a higher degree of risk in  their retirement income because of their TSP investments. TSP  investment risks include both individual ability and willingness to defer  income and to make appropriate asset allocation choices, as well as  market risk on returns. Because the amount that U.S. civil service  employees contribute to their TSPs affects the income replacement rate,  we also analyzed scenarios for U.S. employees who make different  contributions to their TSPs. For example, we analyzed a scenario where  U.S. civil service employees who have 30 years of government service,  retire at age 62, and contribute the average contribution rate among  FERS employees who made elective contributions to the TSP in 2012,  and found that FERS replaced between 77 to 82 percent of their  salaries. In contrast, if employees make no elective contribution to the  TSP throughout their careers, our estimates show income replacement  rates from 57 to 64 percent. Second, UN staff generally earn higher  salaries than U.S. civil service employees in comparable jobs. Therefore,  UN pensions may not replace as great a percentage of preretirement  salary as the FERS retirement plan, but in some cases may have the  same or greater estimated monetary value. Last, the income replacement  rates we obtained for FERS employees reflect the economic conditions  over the 30-year period from 1983 to 2012, with relatively high wage  growth and asset fund returns in the early years of this period. Scenarios  using different economic conditions would have obtained different income  replacement rates.", "We compared the costs of health care plans for UN staff based in New  York City, New York, and U.S. civil service employees, and found that the  average organizational cost per employee in 2012 was 5 percent higher  for U.S. employees than for UN staff. The average health care subsidy for  UN professional staff in New York who participated in a plan in 2012 was  $6,228, according to UN payroll data. Approximately 98 percent of UN  professional staff in New York received a health care subsidy, and when  we included both participants and nonparticipants, we found that the  overall average cost per UN staff member in New York was  approximately $6,100. According to OPM, the average agency cost of  providing health care plans to U.S. employees who participated in federal  employee health benefit plans in 2012 was $8,022, excluding employees  of the U.S. Postal Service. When we accounted for the 80 percent  participation rate in federal employee health benefit plans, we found that  the average agency cost per employee, excluding U.S. Postal Service  employees, was approximately $6,417, including both participants and  nonparticipants.", "Comparing allowances, we found that the UN and the U.S. government  both provide certain allowances with higher monetary value than those  provided by the other. Using available data, we were able to compare  three allowances with similar purposes. Table 4 provides a summary of  our analysis of these allowances.", "As shown in table 4, UN staff received higher average dollar amounts for  additional hardship allowance for nonfamily duty stations than State and  DOD staff received for the separate maintenance allowance. UN staff  also received a higher average dollar amount for the nonremoval  allowance than DOD staff did for the foreign transfer allowance. Finally,  State staff received higher average dollar amounts for hardship  differentials than UN staff did for hardship pay, but UN dollar amounts  were higher than those paid to DOD staff.", "We also compared other allowances that are unique to either the UN or  the U.S. government.

For instance, while  both the UN and OPM conduct regular studies to estimate the future  costs of their respective retirement systems, these studies use  differing methods and assumptions to determine future costs,  including different assumptions on key factors such as investment  growth rates and rates of inflation as well as different actuarial  methods of assigning retirement costs across years of employee  service.
