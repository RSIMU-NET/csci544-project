Milstar is intended to be DOD\u2019s most robust communications satellite system. It is designed to operate in the extremely high frequency (EHF) radio spectrum, although it has super high frequency and ultra high frequency capabilities, and it was originally designed to transmit signals at low data rates (LDR). Milstar employs computer processing capabilities on the satellites and several different radio signal processing techniques that provide resistance to electronic jamming. Computer processing associated with other DOD communication satellite systems is primarily performed with ground-based equipment and is considered to be less resistant to electronic jamming.", "In 1990, as the Cold War subsided, the Congress directed DOD to either restructure the Milstar system or develop an alternative advanced communications system to (1) substantially reduce the cost of the Milstar program, (2) eliminate unnecessary capabilities for protracted nuclear war-fighting missions and operations, and (3) increase the usefulness of the program for tactical forces. DOD chose to restructure the system. As a result of the 1991 Gulf War experience, DOD established a basis for increased Milstar support to tactical forces by using a medium data rate (MDR) communications capability.", "Currently, there are two Milstar satellite designs\u2014the LDR version, called Milstar I, and a combined LDR and MDR version, called Milstar II. A total of six satellites are included in the program\u2014two Milstar I satellites were launched in 1994 and 1995, and four Milstar II satellites are being fabricated and are scheduled to be launched in fiscal years 1999 through 2002. As a follow-on effort, DOD has initiated an advanced EHF satellite communications program to replace the Milstar I and II designs, with plans to launch the first advanced satellite in fiscal year 2006.", "Since program inception, DOD has spent several billions of dollars to acquire the Milstar I and II satellites, a mission control capability, and a variety of user terminals. In total, DOD has procured, or plans to procure, over 3,500 terminals.

However, a May 1998 draft operational test report, prepared by the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center, concluded that although the Milstar system was found to be effective for communications during normal operations, numerous deficiencies would require corrective action before the full nuclear wartime strategic capabilities could be realized. Deficiencies in three areas were highlighted\u2014(1) military commanders\u2019 voice conference network, (2) missile warning teletype network, and (3) emergency action message dissemination and force direction network. The deficiencies were associated with system connectivity\u2014a critical operational issue that addresses the primary mission of Milstar to provide minimum essential worldwide communications among all services at all levels of military conflict.", "The purpose of the operational test was to evaluate the effectiveness and suitability of the in-orbit Milstar I satellite system. According to operational test officials, testing was hampered because, in some instances, the evaluation criteria were based on ambiguous operational requirements. DOD has not yet completed efforts to validate updates to the Milstar 1992 operational requirements.

However, they believe that voice conference quality can be improved by (1) assigning additional communication channels to the strategic commanders, thereby simplifying time consuming hand-over procedures and improving timeliness; (2) consolidating voice signals through communication switches to make conferencing more efficient and user friendly; and (3) upgrading software algorithms to improve voice intelligibility.

In our attempt to determine the reason, we were provided with two viewpoints\u2014(1) Milstar support to the missile warning and assessment mission area had not been approved for testing by Milstar program officials and (2) there was a conflict with another operational test being performed at the Cheyenne Mountain Complex. The result was that operational test officials could not verify that ballistic missile alert messages could be reliably transmitted by the Milstar system.", "The Air Force Space Command subsequently tested the missile warning teletype network and identified that a required redundancy check could not be performed to ensure data accuracy.

Battery life is one of several Milstar endurance issues and is integrally linked with the Milstar system\u2019s endurance requirement. This requirement is the length of time that the system needs to be operational during and after a nuclear conflict. Continuous communication capabilities with deployed bomber forces are required if it became necessary to recall or redirect these forces.", "The endurance deficiency may have resulted from a disagreement about the interpretation of operational requirements. Milstar program officials stated that the system satisfied the 1992 Milstar requirements for endurance and that additional requirements are being imposed on the system. However, U.S. Strategic Command officials stated that recent changes to Milstar operational requirements only clarify endurance requirements and that the system should have performed in a manner consistent with these requirements. DOD does not expect to resolve this endurance issue until 2002. Ongoing DOD actions include (1) the Joint Requirements Oversight Council\u2019s approval of updated Milstar operational requirements (which are to clarify endurance requirements) by April 1999, (2) the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation\u2019s directions for a full test of endurance requirements, and (3) addressing funding shortfalls associated with endurance solutions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Software and Equipment Concerns", "paragraphs": ["The Milstar system supports multiple communication networks, and user access to these networks is through peripheral equipment such as telephone handsets, computers, facsimile machines, and teletypes (referred to as input-output communication devices).

However, schedule delays related to software development for a critical component of the Milstar II system could adversely affect these tests and plans for tactical forces to transition from older communication systems to the new Milstar II system. The component, called the automated communications management system (ACMS), is critical to efficient Milstar operations. ACMS is expected to allocate and apportion the system\u2019s limited LDR and MDR communication capabilities among multiple system users while permitting decentralized execution of communications planning and management functions by these users.", "In 1989, the Milstar program office initiated efforts to develop communications planning and resource management software, called the Mission Planning Element. According to a program official, the effort was canceled in 1994 because of technical difficulties that the contractor could not overcome. In 1995, the program office signed an agreement with a Navy development organization for ACMS, which was to perform functions similar to the Mission Planning Element. Schedule delays since this ACMS agreement was signed have totaled about 7 months. ACMS is currently scheduled to be delivered in April 1999.", "This April 1999 delivery date will not provide sufficient time for ACMS to be integrated with the ground control station and allow for systems operational testing with the first Milstar II satellite, which is to be launched in January 1999. In addition, program officials stated that ACMS software development is on a compressed schedule\u2014a reduction from  24 months to 12 months\u2014increasing the risk that the April 1999 delivery date may not be met. This creates the potential for ACMS not being available to support operations with the second Milstar II satellite to be launched in December 1999, if an additional delay occurs. According to an Air Force official, an independent study team, chartered by the Joint Staff, is assessing the effect of possible delays in the ACMS schedule, including the feasibility of meeting the planned Milstar II launch schedule.", "According to Army representatives, ACMS will not be available to support operational testing of Army terminals, which is scheduled to start in September 1999. The Army\u2019s intentions were to use these test results to decide on terminal deployment and on transitioning its tactical forces to Milstar II. Concerned that ACMS delivery will be further delayed, the Army is independently upgrading the less sophisticated, communications management system, which was developed for Milstar I. However, such an upgrade would only be able to support the small number of tactical terminals expected to be deployed for the first Milstar II satellite. The upgrade cannot support the increased number of tactical terminals that are expected to be deployed after the launch of the second Milstar II satellite in December 1999. At that time, the need for ACMS would be critical.

This situation, coupled with the degraded capabilities, could result in users not having the communications capacity they require or expect to execute their missions. Therefore, if a military conflict were to occur during this 3-year period, communications for the command and control of tactical forces, using Milstar, could be adversely affected.", "The House Committee on Appropriations expressed concern about DOD not giving adequate attention to operational risk during the transition period from the Milstar II system to an advanced system, including consideration that hundreds of Milstar terminals would be deployed by that time. The Committee directed the Secretary of Defense to provide a report by March 31, 1999, to the congressional defense committees on the effects of the communications degradation, including suggested alternatives to minimize any adverse operational effects.

In the absence of a major failure, satellites usually degrade gradually while in orbit, and their useful lives can be estimated based on such factors as component reliability and fuel availability. DOD used a computer simulation model, known as the Generalized Availability Program, to predict a 70-percent probability that MDR capabilities would be maintained at a minimally acceptable operational level until 2003. This probability was predicted to decrease annually to about 35 percent in 2006. A 1998 degradation analysis confirmed the 1995 results.", "To describe the predicted degradation in more practical terms for Milstar users, the Air Force converted the probabilities into a predicted loss of MDR communication channels.

Army representatives informed us that they remained concerned about the degradation adversely affecting tactical operations.

Also in 1995, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology directed the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence and the DOD Space Architect to develop recommendations that would mitigate possible shortfalls in EHF service to be provided by Milstar II. The Deputy Assistant Secretary responded to that direction, in a draft program plan, by presenting degradation avoidance and mitigation measures but stated that more analyses was needed. He recommended that the DOD Space Architect conduct a thorough analysis of the operational effects of the degradation.", "In 1996, the DOD Space Architect stated that an acceptable approach to making the transition from Milstar II to an advanced EHF system was to plan military operations assuming less than a fully populated constellation of four Milstar II satellites. This apparent recognition of operational risk presumed that (1) because of the fiscal environment, the year 2005 would be the earliest that an advanced system could be developed and launched and (2) the Milstar II constellation would probably fall below its planned capability of four satellites before 2005 because of launch or in-orbit failures.", "In 1997, representatives of unified commands and military satellite acquisition organizations met to refine the future military satellite communications architecture and develop an affordable transition and implementation plan for that architecture.

This information should include technical, schedule, testing, and funding matters pertinent to (1) achieving user-to-user strategic communication network connectivity and (2) managing the development difficulties associated with the automated communications management system.", "In assessing the operational risks associated with the predicted degradation of Milstar communications, as directed by the House Committee on Appropriations, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense specifically address (1) the minimally acceptable level of extremely high frequency satellite communications needed to support tactical forces and (2) the capability of the Milstar system to provide this minimum level of communications until an advanced extremely high frequency communications capability is deployed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD disagreed with our recommendation in the draft report that the Secretary of Defense provide the necessary directions to the military services and commands for (1) resolving the disagreements over operational requirements, (2) ensuring the availability of necessary software, (3) completing the certification process for interoperable equipment and software, and (4) managing the difficulties in developing the automated communications management system. DOD stated that although our draft report was essentially correct in describing Milstar issues during the 1997 operational test period, additional Secretary of Defense directions to resolve these issues are unnecessary. DOD claimed that the issues were being resolved and corrective actions were being taken through standard DOD processes and procedures associated with developing and fielding new capabilities. For example, DOD mentioned general officer level forums that were (1) providing ongoing oversight of operational, programmatic, and management issues affecting Milstar and (2) tracking issues to fulfill Secretary of Defense guidance for the transition of strategic users to Milstar by 2003.", "In acknowledging the Milstar I issues identified during operational testing, DOD emphasized that the Milstar system passed 14 of 17 threshold parameters. However, according to operational test officials, these parameters were more representative of system specifications than operational requirements that would permit a judgment about Milstar\u2019s support to strategic mission areas. DOD identified several matters that remain to be resolved for achieving an effective strategic and tactical communications system. The matters were (1) funding for voice conferencing network upgrades to improve timeliness and voice quality; (2) completing software upgrades, equipment installations, and certification of the missile warning teletype network; (3) performing operational testing of nuclear bomber force communications and endurance requirements; (4) implementing a new Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction, that addresses the management of satellite communications, to ensure interoperability certification of input-output communication devices, which are critical for user-to-user communications connectivity; and (5) completing ACMS development and performing tests to demonstrate the complex function of allocating and apportioning the fixed amount of Milstar communications capabilities. Considering the number and variety of Milstar matters that still need attention, we believe DOD should provide status and progress information for resolving these matters to the congressional defense committees. Accordingly, we modified our recommendation to the Secretary from providing directions to the services to reporting on the status and progress of resolving operational and developmental issues.", "DOD also disagreed with our recommendation dealing with the minimum level of extremely high frequency satellite communications needed to support tactical forces and the extent that Milstar could provide that level of communications until an advanced extremely high frequency communications capability is deployed. DOD stated that (1) it previously addressed the operational risk to tactical forces associated with the planned transition from Milstar to the advanced extremely high frequency satellite system; (2) another satellite system could provide some, but less effective, protected communications during the transition period; and (3) an additional review of this issue by the Secretary of Defense is unnecessary. DOD cited (1) the Joint Space Management Board as having approved military satellite communications architecture goals, strategy, and milestones; (2) the Defense Resource Board as having funded military satellite communication systems consistent with the architecture; and (3) the Joint Requirements Oversight Council as having endorsed an architecture transition plan based on a general officer level forum\u2019s evaluation of all future military satellite communication satellite requirements and capabilities through 2010.", "DOD has apparently given considerable high-level attention to the predicted degradation in Milstar communication capabilities for the 2003 to 2006 period. Also, there is evidence that the operational risk accepted for this time period was based on financial, and possibly technical, reasons as to when an advanced extremely high frequency capability could be made available. Although this decision was originally made in 1993, and subsequently reaffirmed by various DOD authorities, it does not overcome the potential condition of insufficient protected communications for tactical forces during the 3-year transition period. DOD did not specifically address our point regarding what minimum level of extremely high frequency communications would be needed during the period, other than to state that the tactical requirement for protected communications far exceeds Milstar capabilities and tactical forces are not totally dependent on Milstar for protected communications. Nor did DOD address whether Milstar could provide that minimum level until an advanced capability is deployed.
