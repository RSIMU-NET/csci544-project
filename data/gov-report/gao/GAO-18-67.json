In response, NERC created two regulatory standards requiring certain U.S. and Canadian suppliers to assess their vulnerability to GMD and take appropriate steps in response.", "GAO was asked to review electricity industry actions to prepare for and mitigate electromagnetic risks. This report examines, among other things, (1) to what extent U.S. and Canadian electricity suppliers have identified information about GMD and HEMP effects on the grid, (2) what steps selected U.S. and Canadian suppliers have taken to protect against GMD and HEMP, and (3) what opportunities exist for U.S. suppliers to recover costs for protecting against GMD and HEMP.", "GAO examined government and industry studies and interviewed federal and industry officials about potential GMD and HEMP effects on grid infrastructure; reviewed regulatory standards, monitoring processes, and NERC compliance audit data from April 2015 through August 2017; reviewed federal regulations and interviewed state regulators on cost recovery issues; and interviewed officials from a nongeneralizable sample of 13 U.S. and Canada electricity suppliers, selected based on factors such as GMD experience and preparation for GMD and HEMP events.", "GAO provided a draft of this report to five federal agencies and NERC. Technical comments provided were incorporated as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["U.S. and Canadian electricity suppliers\u2014electricity generation and transmission owners and operators\u2014have identified information on the potential effects of a severe geomagnetic disturbance (GMD), resulting from a solar storm, but have identified less information about the potential effects of a high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP), resulting from the detonation of a nuclear device, on the electric grid. There is general agreement that more research is needed on both GMD and HEMP. Government and industry have publicly reported on the potential impacts of GMD on the grid. For example, one study identified two main risks: (1) potential voltage instability, causing power system collapse and blackouts; and (2) possible damage to key system components. However, these studies do not address the unique aspects of individual suppliers' networks. Recognizing this, 11 of the 13 selected suppliers GAO contacted said they had assessed their network vulnerability; of these 11, 6 expected GMD effects to be relatively small. In contrast, Department of Energy (DOE) and industry officials told GAO that information on HEMP effects is limited in that suppliers lack key information to fully understand HEMP effects on their networks. Historically, study of HEMP effects focused on impacts to military equipment rather than the commercial electric grid. Recently, DOE and industry began research to better understand HEMP effects. Of the 11 suppliers who responded to GAO about their HEMP efforts, 3 reported having studied the impact of HEMP on their networks and 2 of the 11 had integrated, or planned to integrate, HEMP-resistant features into new control centers.", "Of the 13 selected suppliers GAO contacted, 10 reported making technological and operational improvements to enhance overall network reliability that also provided some protection against GMD and HEMP risks. For example, suppliers reported making technological improvements such as replacement of some older transformers and unprotected control centers. As of May 2017, all 13 suppliers stated they had complied with a GMD regulatory standard issued by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC)\u2014the federally designated regulatory authority responsible for developing and enforcing reliability standards\u2013-to develop operating procedures to mitigate GMD effects. A second regulatory standard\u2014which is to be implemented in phases through 2022\u2014will generally require suppliers to further assess their vulnerability to GMD.", "Selected U.S. suppliers told GAO that costs they have incurred to protect against GMD and HEMP have been relatively small so far and they expect to recover those costs through customer rates. Suppliers could face future increased costs depending on corrective actions needed to comply with the second GMD regulatory standard. Federal and state regulators indicated that regulated U.S. suppliers' costs for protecting against GMD are generally recoverable through customer rates, but recovery is less certain for protection against HEMP because less is known about HEMP risks. Further, some suppliers could face challenges to cost recovery. Specifically, independent owners of power plants\u2014those that sell power in wholesale electricity markets and are not part of an integrated utility\u2014must recover reliability improvement costs through their sales of electricity and are not assured of cost recovery; federal regulators told GAO they are aware this could be a challenge for these independent owners."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The electric grid is crucial to our country\u2019s economy and wellbeing,  providing electricity to over 300 million people and representing more  than $1 trillion in assets, as well as supporting other critical  infrastructure. Consequently, the reliability of the grid\u2014its ability to meet  consumers\u2019 electricity demand at all times\u2014is essential to national safety  and security. As early as 1941, electric power industry researchers have  expressed concerns about the potential risks posed to grid reliability by  electromagnetic events. An electromagnetic event can result from a  naturally occurring, large-scale geomagnetic disturbance (GMD), caused  by severe solar weather, or from human-made sources, such as the high- altitude detonation of a nuclear device to create a high-altitude  electromagnetic pulse (HEMP). A major GMD or HEMP event could  have long-term, significant impacts on the nation\u2019s electric grid\u2014the  commercial electric power transmission and distribution system. Given  the interdependency among infrastructure sectors, a disruption to the  electric grid could also result in potential cascading impacts on fuel  distribution, transportation systems, food and water supplies, and  communications and equipment for emergency services, as well as other  communication systems that utilize the civilian electrical infrastructure.  More recently, however, some government and research organizations  have questioned the long-term level of impact electromagnetic events  could have on the electric grid and have recommended further research  and study be conducted on the effects of electromagnetic events.", "Most of the U.S. electric grid is owned and operated by the private sector,  with federal, state, local, and other governments playing significant  regulatory and other roles. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  has the lead role in coordinating the overall federal effort to promote the  security and resiliency of the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure, which includes  the electricity grid. The Department of Energy (DOE)\u2014as the sector- specific agency for the energy sector\u2014coordinates with DHS and is also  responsible for coordinating with other relevant federal agencies and for  collaborating with critical infrastructure owners and operators to prioritize  and coordinate federal resiliency efforts. In addition, the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission (FERC), which regulates the interstate  transmission of electricity, among other things, is responsible for  reviewing and approving standards developed by the North American  Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC)\u2014the designated U.S. Electric  Reliability Organization (ERO)\u2014to provide for the reliable operation of the  bulk power system (the generation and transmission components of the  grid). The North America electric grid encompasses the United States,  parts of Mexico, and most provinces of Canada. Canada has experienced  the only extreme GMD event resulting in significant loss of power to the  North America grid. NERC\u2019s role in Canada is similar to its role in the  United States and reliability standards are mandatory and enforceable in  most Canadian provinces.", "The United States has taken steps to assess the risks posed by  electromagnetic events and identified steps to mitigate these risks. For  example, in April 2008 the Commission to Assess the Threat to the  United States from Electromagnetic Pulse Attack (EMP Commission)  issued a report that included over 90 recommendations addressing the  preparation for, and protection and recovery from, a possible EMP attack  against U.S. critical infrastructure. The majority of these  recommendations were made to DHS and DOE. In May 2013, FERC  directed NERC to develop reliability (regulatory) standards requiring  electricity suppliers to address the potential impact of GMD on the reliable  operation of the U.S. bulk power system. In June 2014, FERC approved  a standard, submitted by NERC, requiring that certain suppliers prepare  for the effects of GMD events by developing contingency operating plans,  procedures, and processes. FERC approved a second standard in September 2016, also submitted by NERC, requiring certain suppliers to  assess the vulnerability of their transmission systems to GMD events;  suppliers that do not meet certain performance requirements must  develop a plan to achieve the performance requirements. Also, in  December 2016, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2017 was enacted, requiring DHS to, among other things, conduct an  intelligence-based review and comparison of the risks and consequences  of electromagnetic events to the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure and to use  that information to inform a recommended strategy for protecting and  preparing U.S. critical infrastructure against electromagnetic threats.", "In 2016, we reported that key federal agencies had taken various actions  to address electromagnetic risks to the electric grid\u2014such as establishing  industry standards and federal guidelines and completing related  research reports\u2014and that some of these actions aligned with  recommendations made in 2008 by the EMP Commission. We also  found that while DHS components had independently conducted some  efforts to assess electromagnetic risks, DHS had not fully leveraged  opportunities to collect key risk inputs\u2014threat, vulnerability, and  consequence information\u2014to inform comprehensive risk assessments of  electromagnetic events. Moreover, we found that DHS and DOE, in  conjunction with industry, had not established a coordinated approach to  identifying and implementing key risk management activities to address  EMP risk, such as identifying and prioritizing key research and  development efforts. We recommended, among other things, that DHS  identify internal roles to address electromagnetic risks and collect  additional risk inputs to further inform risk assessment efforts. We also  recommended that DHS and DOE engage with federal partners and  industry stakeholders to identify and implement key EMP research and  development priorities. DHS and DOE concurred with our  recommendations. As of October 2017, DHS had addressed our  recommendation regarding key EMP research and development priorities  by, among other things, working with key industry stakeholders to help  identify and implement EMP research and development efforts. DHS had  also taken steps to identify key roles and responsibilities within the  Department to address electromagnetic risks as well as work with federal  and industry partners to collect additional inputs on threats,  vulnerabilities, and consequences related to electromagnetic risks, which  we are in the process of reviewing to determine whether they address our  recommendations in these areas. DOE has also taken steps to work with  industry to develop a joint government-industry EMP strategy and  supporting DOE action plan to further address our recommendation  regarding the identification of key EMP research and development  priorities. Both DHS and DOE have reported taking some actions to  identify critical electrical infrastructure assets, but have yet to fully  address this recommendation. We will continue to review DHS and DOE\u2019s  actions to address our open recommendations.", "Given our previous work reviewing federal efforts to address  electromagnetic risks, you asked us to review actions taken by the  electricity industry to prepare for and mitigate impacts from  electromagnetic events. Our objectives were to examine (1) to what  extent U.S. and Canadian electricity suppliers have identified information  about the effects of GMD and HEMP events on the electric grid, (2) what  steps selected U.S. and Canadian electricity suppliers have taken to  protect against GMD and HEMP events and how NERC has monitored  these efforts, and (3) what opportunities exist for U.S. electricity suppliers  to recover costs for protecting against GMD and HEMP events.", "In conducting our work, we interviewed representatives from 13 of the  181 U.S. and Canadian electricity suppliers subject to NERC\u2019s 2014 GMD  reliability standard that conduct planning and generation, transmission,  and distribution operations. We selected these 13 electricity suppliers  based on various factors, including input from DOE, NERC, and industry  organization officials familiar with suppliers\u2019 activities to prepare for  electromagnetic events. Of these 13, we conducted site visits to 6  suppliers to better understand their experiences with past GMD events  and identify actions they have taken to prepare for and mitigate GMD and  HEMP events, among other things. During these visits we met with  officials and observed operations and facilities, such as control centers  hardened to mitigate effects from HEMP events, and equipment  potentially vulnerable to GMD, such as high-voltage transformers. We  included three Canadian electricity suppliers among the 13 suppliers we  interviewed due to their (1) experiences with past GMD events, (2)  research on the impacts of GMD, and (3) actions taken to prepare for and  mitigate GMD events. While we cannot generalize the information we  learned from these selected suppliers to all U.S. and Canadian suppliers,  they provided us with examples of what suppliers may know about the  potential impacts of electromagnetic events on the electric grid, as well as  steps suppliers may be taking to prepare for and mitigate such impacts.  The selected U.S. suppliers also identified opportunities available to them  for recovering costs for protecting against electromagnetic events.  Further, we interviewed representatives from six industry organizations  because of these organizations\u2019 specialized knowledge and experience  with electricity suppliers.", "To address the first objective, we reviewed U.S. and Canadian  government studies issued, or commissioned by, for example, DHS,  DOE, and NERC regarding, among other things, the vulnerability of  transmission and generation infrastructure and equipment to GMD and  HEMP events, possible measures to mitigate the effects of GMD and  HEMP, and areas requiring further research. We also reviewed relevant  studies from various industry organizations\u2014such as the Electric Power  Research Institute (EPRI)\u2014and interviewed knowledgeable officials from  these organizations and government agencies to clarify our  understanding of relevant research issues. We identified these studies  based on feedback from all entities listed above and through references  in reports and other documentation. While we did not compile a  comprehensive list of all studies of the effects of GMD and HEMP on the  U.S. and Canadian electric grid, industry experts indicated that we had  identified relevant studies published on this subject since 2010. We  assessed the methodologies used in the relevant reports and determined  them to be sufficiently rigorous to provide information about the potential  effects of GMD and HEMP events on the electric grid. To better  understand the effects of solar weather on the electric grid, how GMD is  measured, and mechanisms in place for notifying electricity suppliers of  potentially dangerous solar storms, we interviewed representatives from  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and other  federal agencies and reviewed relevant documentation on processes and  procedures. To identify the frequency and intensity of past GMD events,  we analyzed the available historical record of GMD occurrences from  1933 through 2016 calculated and maintained by GFZ German Research  Centre for Geosciences. NOAA officials confirmed that the GFZ German  Research Centre for Geosciences maintains the authoritative historical  record of these data. We assessed the reliability of these data by testing  for missing data, outliers, or obvious errors, and found the data to be  sufficiently reliable to report on the number and intensity of GMD events  occurring from 1933 through 2016. With respect to ongoing HEMP  research and planning efforts, we reviewed, for example, relevant U.S.  government strategies and plans and interviewed relevant officials,  including researchers from U.S. National Laboratories. In October 2017,  we also requested an interview with a representative from the EMP  Commission but did not receive a response to our requests.", "To address the second objective, we reviewed FERC orders and NERC  reliability standards that require certain suppliers to take steps to assess  and prepare for GMD impacts, and interviewed relevant officials regarding  the standards. We also obtained information from 13 U.S. and Canadian  electricity suppliers regarding steps they had taken to comply with NERC  reliability standards and actions to prepare for electromagnetic events. To  understand how NERC has monitored electricity suppliers\u2019 steps to  comply with NERC Reliability Standard EOP-010-1, we reviewed NERC  monitoring processes. NERC officials provided the number of compliance  audits conducted between April 2015\u2014when NERC, through Regional  Entities to which it has delegated enforcement authority, first began  reviewing suppliers for compliance with EOP-010-1\u2014and August 2017  that included the EOP-010-1 reliability standard. We contrasted the  number of compliance audits with the total number of suppliers potentially  subject to NERC\u2019s GMD reliability standard EOP-010-1. We assessed the  reliability of the data on the total number of suppliers subject to EOP-010- 1 by interviewing agency officials regarding data sources, system  controls, and any quality assurance steps performed by officials before  the data were provided; we found the data to be sufficiently reliable to  provide the number of suppliers subject to EOP-010-1 since it went into  effect. We also discussed with cognizant NERC officials the  organization\u2019s processes for collecting and reporting comprehensive data  on the status of their overall compliance monitoring efforts.", "To address the third objective, we reviewed FERC regulations and orders  related to cost recovery, such as suppliers\u2019 costs for spare transmission  equipment services. We also interviewed FERC officials and  representatives of two state regulators whose jurisdictions include  suppliers we interviewed, regarding procedures available to electricity  suppliers to recover costs for actions taken to prepare for and mitigate  electromagnetic effects. We asked these officials to discuss previous,  current, and potential future regulatory actions\u2014orders or rate cases they  have overseen\u2014involving recovery of costs for actions taken to protect  against GMD and HEMP events. Further, we interviewed DHS and DOE  officials to identify the extent to which financial incentives\u2014such as  preparedness grants\u2014are available to U.S. electricity suppliers to offset  the costs of preparation and mitigation efforts. We interviewed officials  from the 10 selected U.S. suppliers regarding the extent to which they  had recovered costs expended on preparedness and mitigation efforts  and what, if any, options they were considering to recover such costs in  the future. While the information provided by these selected electricity  suppliers is not generalizable to the U.S. electricity industry, it illustrates  examples of actions selected suppliers have taken to recover costs for  GMD and HEMP mitigation and preparedness efforts. Additional details  on our scope and methodology are contained in appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2016 to February 2018 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Electricity Operation and Delivery in the United States and Canada", "paragraphs": ["The electricity operation and delivery system\u2014collectively referred to as  the grid\u2014in the United States and Canada includes four functions:  generation, transmission, distribution, and system operations (see fig. 1).  Electricity is generated at power plants by burning fossil fuels; through  nuclear fission; or by harnessing renewable sources such as wind, solar,  geothermal energy, or hydropower. Once wholesale electricity is  generated, it enters the bulk power system\u2014a network of high-voltage,  high-capacity transmission systems\u2014where it is transformed to a higher  voltage and flows through transmission lines, generally over long  distances, to areas where it is transformed to a lower voltage and sent  through the local distribution system for use by various customers.  Throughout this process, system operations are managed by a system  operator, such as a local utility.", "Below is additional information on the functions of the electric grid,  including equipment that may be vulnerable to GMD and HEMP.", "Electricity generation. Power plants generate electricity by  converting energy from other forms\u2014such as coal, natural gas, or  wind\u2014into electricity. While they produce electricity once operating  they are vulnerable when power outages occur because initially  starting a power plant after an outage typically requires an external  source of electricity to operate the control systems\u2014electronics that  are integral to their operations. Some power plants have the  capability to restore operations by employing a \u201cblack start,\u201d which is  the process of restoring a plant to operation without relying on off-site  sources of electricity, usually through using dedicated diesel  generators to provide the electricity needed. However, not all plants  have this capability and in the event of a power outage could therefore  be vulnerable to lengthy system disruptions.", "Electricity transmission. Power plants are generally geographically  distant from the areas where electricity is consumed. To move  electricity from where it is produced to where it is used, electricity is  sent over transmission lines; together, these lines form a network, or  grid. To transport energy over long distances with reduced power  losses, suppliers increase voltages\u2014the \u201cforce\u201d that makes electricity  flow through a conductor\u2014and utilize high-voltage transmission lines,  operating from 230 up to 765 kilovolts (kV) in North America.  According to the Quadrennial Energy Review, as of January 2017,  there were approximately 240,000 miles of high-voltage transmission  circuit lines in the contiguous United States. During a solar storm,  high-voltage transmission lines can act as \u201cantennae\u201d that allow GMD  to enter the electric system.", "Transformers. Transformers are critical to the efficient and effective  delivery of electricity to customers and, under certain circumstances,  can be vulnerable to the effects of GMD and HEMP. Transformers  facilitate the efficient transfer of electricity over long distances through  the transmission system by converting electricity to different voltages  along the delivery system\u2014either up or down, depending on the  design and function of the transformer (see sidebar). Figure 2  depicts a large power transformer. paired with equipment\u2014for example, a protective relay\u2014that is designed  to take them out of service temporarily when the effects of an  electromagnetic event reach the grid. If transformers were temporarily  taken out of service for preventative purposes, it could lead to an  interruption of electricity service to consumers. However, if  transformers\u2014especially those more vulnerable due to age, condition, or  design\u2014are not taken out of service during an electromagnetic event they  are at risk of being permanently damaged when additional electrical  current flows into them, causing excessive localized heating and damage  to internal components. (See fig. 3 for an example of transformer  windings that were damaged from localized heating associated with a  GMD event.) Transformers that become permanently damaged during an  electromagnetic event can also contribute to interruptions in service.  According to DOE, replacing a damaged transformer can be challenging  because they are custom-designed and interchangeability and availability  of spares is limited. If a usable spare transformer is not immediately  available, obtaining a replacement transformer is often a long and costly  process, usually involving long delivery lead times due to their size and  weight, limited inventory, a complex procurement and manufacturing  process, and other factors. According to DOE, in 2014 the average lead  time to obtain a large power transformer was between 5 and 16 months,  but could take more than 20 months in the event of supply disruptions or  delays in procuring raw materials or key parts; larger, more sophisticated  models are generally manufactured abroad. According to a transformer  manufacturer, depending on the function of the transformer, the voltage  rating, and the model, in 2017 the approximate price of a large power  transformer, weighing from 170 to 410 tons, ranged from approximately  $2 to $7.5 million in the United States.", "Distribution system. The final stage in the electric power system is  the distribution system, which carries electricity out of the  transmission system to industrial, commercial, residential, and other  consumers. The distribution system includes equipment that can be  damaged during electromagnetic events, but the extent of the risk is  limited because distribution lines are generally too short and of too  low voltage to pose a risk to distribution equipment.", "System operations: Operation of the electricity system is managed  by entities such as a local utility, which this report collectively refers to  as system operators. Because electric energy is not typically stored in  large quantities, system operators must constantly balance the  generation and consumption of electricity to maintain reliability. To do  this, system operators utilize a system of sensors and controls to  monitor power consumption and generation from a centralized  location. Operators use computerized systems to send signals to  power plants and other grid components to adjust their output to  match changes in consumption. Electromagnetic events can interrupt  or damage some of the equipment system operators use, which can  cause a disturbance in control systems (for example, such events can  cause relays to unintentionally operate, which can disable system  protection equipment). Because the electric power system  increasingly operates at or near reliability limits during peak demand  periods, a relatively modest disturbance to the system can potentially  pose a risk to system reliability.", "In the United States, the electrical infrastructure is primarily operated by  private industry, which owns approximately 85 percent of the nation\u2019s  critical electrical infrastructure.

Solar weather events include, for example, large  coronal mass ejections (CME), which are energetic eruptions in the sun\u2019s  atmosphere that can cause the release of a large mass of charged  particles from the sun into space. When a large CME travels from the  Sun to the Earth it can interact with and create disturbances in the Earth\u2019s  geomagnetic field, referred to as a geomagnetic storm; the resulting  impact on Earth is commonly referred to as a geomagnetic disturbance,  or GMD. Figure 4 illustrates how solar weather can create a GMD.  Strong GMDs can create large geomagnetically induced current (GIC) on  the grid. The degree to which GMD and accompanying GIC affect the  electric power system depends on several factors, including the  magnitude of the GMD, design and geomagnetic latitude of the power  system, and geology of the local area, among other things. According to  NERC, the most likely consequence of a strong GMD and the  accompanying GIC is the loss of voltage stability, although GMD can also  damage components of the system, including high-voltage transformers.", "In the United States, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration\u2019s (NOAA) National Weather Service manages the Space  Weather Prediction Center (SWPC), which is responsible for monitoring  and providing services on space weather, including geomagnetic  storms.

SWPC uses this  information to issue Watches, Warnings, and Alerts for geomagnetic  storms through e-mail and website postings to those who are impacted by  space weather, such as owners and operators of the electric grid,  spacecraft operations, users of radio signals, and others. In addition,  SWPC provides immediate telephone notification and confirmation of imminent and ongoing geomagnetic storms to all NERC reliability  coordinators through a NERC hotline.", "To communicate the magnitude of geomagnetic storms (disturbances in  Earth\u2019s magnetic field) and to determine whether geomagnetic alerts and  warnings should be issued, SWPC relies on a real-time estimate of the  Planetary K-index (Kp-index), which ranges from Kp = 0, or quiet, to Kp =  9, or extreme storm intensity.

A  HEMP event is caused by the detonation of a nuclear device above the  atmosphere, from about 40 to 400 kilometers (approximately 25 to 250  miles) above the Earth\u2019s surface. A HEMP attack does not cause direct  physical impacts at the Earth\u2019s surface, such as injury or damage directly  from heat, blast, or ionizing radiation, but instead creates an intense  electromagnetic pulse.

Prior to being sold to these retail consumers, such as households  and businesses, electricity is bought, sold, and traded in wholesale  electricity markets by companies that own power plants, as well as  utilities and other companies.", "Wholesale interstate electricity markets are regulated by FERC.  Historically, FERC-approved wholesale electricity rates based on utilities\u2019  costs of production plus a rate-of-return that it determined to be  reasonable. Beginning in the late 1990s, FERC took a series of  significant steps to restructure the wholesale electricity markets to  increase the role of competition\u2014market forces of supply and demand\u2014 in setting wholesale electricity prices, a process referred to as electricity  restructuring. Subsequently, FERC has provided authority for many  entities\u2014for example, independent owners of power plants\u2014to sell  electricity in wholesale markets at prices determined by supply and  demand. These entities can now compete with existing utilities and one  another to sell electricity in wholesale markets, but have no assurance  that their costs will be recovered. While electricity restructuring has  introduced a measure of market-based pricing to the generation of  electricity, transmission (and distribution, regulated by states) are still  subject to regulation on a cost-recovery basis. FERC has jurisdiction over  transmission rates on the federal level, and state regulators have  jurisdiction over the charges that utilities incorporate in customers\u2019 rates  in order to recover their transmission costs.", "As part of the restructuring process, FERC also encouraged the voluntary  creation of new entities called Regional Transmission Organizations  (RTO) and Independent System Operators (ISO) to manage regional  networks of electric transmission lines as grid operators\u2014functions that,  in these areas, had traditionally been carried out by local utilities. These  RTOs, in many cases, established and manage wholesale electricity  markets for electricity buyers and sellers to participate in. As grid  operators, RTOs are also responsible for managing transmission in their  regions, which includes establishing and implementing rules and pricing  related to transmission, among other things. As we reported in 2003, 24  states also introduced retail competition to electricity markets they  regulate and allow former utilities and new companies to compete to  serve customers; since then, the states where retail competition is  occurring have changed.

In June 2010, NERC issued a report, based on a joint effort  with DOE, which included a plan to form a task force of government  and industry efforts to examine GMD. This resulted in the formation  of the NERC GMD Task Force consisting of government and industry  officials to examine the GMD threat to the nation\u2019s power grid. The  task force\u2019s work in evaluating the potential impact of GMD events  resulted in NERC\u2019s subsequent February 2012 report which outlined  its plans for working with industry on new reliability standards for  protecting the grid against GMD events. This report concluded,  among other things, that the failure of a large number of transformers  during a severe GMD event was unlikely, although certain older  transformers, along with generator step-up transformers, could be  particularly susceptible. As a result of this work, and as directed by  FERC, NERC developed the EOP-010-1 and TPL-007-1 GMD  reliability standards.

Since 2010, DOE has been engaged in a  number of efforts regarding GMD. For example, in 2011, DOE enlisted  the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to study the  potential effect of GMD on long, high-voltage transmission lines and  associated mitigation measures that could potentially be employed.  Also, in April 2014, DOE reported on the results of its study of the  vulnerabilities of large power transformers to GMD and other threats  and the challenges facing the replacement of these transformers in  the wake of such events.", "EPRI. In conducting research for its private industry membership, the  Electric Power Research Institute engaged in a number of studies  from October 2010 to March 2014. These efforts began with an effort  to examine potential impacts from GMD through an assessment of  various risk factors. EPRI\u2019s later efforts involved the development of  approaches for modeling the impacts from GMD on the grid to allow  suppliers to better protect their networks from these events.", "Other private industry. Private entities conducted studies in January  2010 and November 2011 for Oak Ridge National Laboratory and  DHS, respectively, that examined prior GMD events and assessed the  potential future impact of these events on the grid along with areas of  vulnerability and potential mitigation measures. Other private studies  included those examining which regions of North America are most  vulnerable to GMD events in addition to the potential impact on the  insurance industry and society in general from these events.", "See appendix IV for additional details on these and other select studies  performed by government and industry regarding protection of the grid  from GMD events.", "These past research efforts have generally identified the degree to which  the electric power system is affected by a GMD event. The level of impact  from these events can depend on various factors including, among other  things, magnitude of the event, design and geomagnetic latitude of the  power system, and geology of the local area. Further, these studies  identified that GMD can have a broad range of impacts when it is  introduced to a power system, ranging from minor events such as radio interference and control malfunctions to wide-scale disruptions. NERC  has identified two predominant risks to the system: (1) potential voltage  instability in the transmission system caused by insufficient reactive  power support and (2) possible damage to system components.", "The first risk and, according to NERC, the most likely consequence of a  strong GMD event and accompanying GIC, is the insufficient reactive  power support, which can lead to voltage instability and power system  collapse. Reactive power support is necessary to stabilize the transfer of  electricity through the electric power system, from generation to  consumption. With regard to the second risk, several components of the  electric system are susceptible to damage from GMD and GIC, but  government and industry officials agree that the vulnerable components  with the greatest potential consequence in the event of loss are  transformers, which typically exist at substations throughout suppliers\u2019  transmission networks. High-voltage transmission lines act as  \u201cantennae,\u201d allowing GIC to enter the electric power system, disrupting  normal operations and, in some cases, damaging equipment.  Transformers, in turn, run the risk of overheating during a GMD event.  According to NERC, restoration times for these two risk scenarios are  significantly different. Restoration time from voltage collapse\u2014i.e., system  blackout\u2014would be a matter of hours to days, while the replacement of  transformers, as previously discussed, could take months or potentially  years. Therefore, the failure of large numbers of transformers, while less  likely, would have considerable impacts on portions of the electric power  system.", "While general information on the potential impact of GMD events on the  electric grid is available from the aforementioned government and  industry reports, individual suppliers must assess the potential impact on  their own, unique networks. For example, of the 13 selected suppliers we  spoke with, 11 reported performing analyses to evaluate the potential  impact of GMD on their specific generation systems or transmission  networks. The 11 suppliers that had performed these analyses did so in  advance of all suppliers being required to analyze the vulnerabilities of  their networks as part of their compliance with NERC\u2019s second-stage  GMD reliability standard TPL-007-1. The nature of the analyses the 11  suppliers engaged in required the use of modeling software to determine  the specific vulnerabilities of their networks which further allowed them to  design their own mitigation measures, if warranted, to address any  vulnerabilities identified and prevent equipment damage or power  outages. Suppliers we contacted noted that potential GMD mitigation  measures included installation of specific equipment to assist with  network stability and voltage regulation.", "As noted previously, past research efforts have indicated that GMD  events can have a variety of impacts ranging from minor malfunctions to  wide-scale disruptions. For example, 3 of the 11 suppliers we contacted  that had performed an analysis of their networks\u2019 potential vulnerabilities  had also reported prior impacts on their networks from a GMD event. Of  these three suppliers, two (including Hydro-Quebec) reported major  power interruption or equipment damage from the event. The remaining  supplier reported a brief power outage on one transmission line during the  same 1989 GMD event that caused a major power outage for Hydro- Quebec; however, this power outage did not result in any significant loss  of electricity to the supplier\u2019s customers. Outside of the 1989 event, this  same supplier reported minor power fluctuations and voltage drops from  smaller GMD events.", "Most suppliers we contacted that had assessed their networks\u2019  vulnerabilities to GMD expressed confidence in their ability to avoid major  damage or power interruptions from future GMD events. Specifically, 6 of  the 11 selected suppliers that had performed analyses of their networks\u2019  vulnerabilities to GMD reported that, going forward, they expected that  any effects from a future GMD event on their networks would likely be  minimal (i.e., no significant damage or power interruption). Six suppliers  also thought that procedures and technology currently in place afforded  better protection from these events than in the past. For example, one  northern U.S. supplier we contacted had, after acquiring new GMD  analysis software, studied its system and concluded that it could easily  withstand the GMD \u201cbenchmark event\u201d established by NERC in its TPL- 007-1 reliability standard and that its current technology and procedures  were adequate to deal with the threat.

Specifically, the Department of Defense has developed information  regarding the potential effects of HEMP on military assets and facilities.  According to DOE, the most detailed HEMP testing has been performed  on military communication and weapons systems, not on the commercial  electric grid. In a number of studies since 2010, both government and  private industry have examined the HEMP threat to the grid while also  noting the need for further research to fully understand the specific  threats to components of the grid that would allow suppliers to protect  against these events.

One of the two suppliers that  designed control centers resistant to HEMP did so due to a concern over  being able to maintain power to certain critical customers for which the  loss of power would have national security implications. The other  supplier that had designed an HEMP-resistant control center did so as  part of an \u201call hazards\u201d approach to protecting its transmission  infrastructure. The third supplier that had studied the potential impact of  HEMP on its system did so as part of a combined study, required by its  state legislature, on the threats posed by both GMD and HEMP.  Specifically, this supplier examined the potential impact of the HEMP E3  pulse on its system which is similar to GMD, and, therefore, is expected  to involve similar mitigation measures. The supplier stated that the lack  of available modeling and analysis tools prevents them from fully  understanding the potential impact of all components of HEMP\u2014 particularly the E1 and E2 pulses.", "Four of the 8 suppliers we contacted who stated they had not studied the  potential impact of HEMP on their networks indicated a desire to see  EPRI complete its ongoing EMP research before engaging in studies of  their own networks. Further, all eight suppliers who stated they had not  performed any studies of the potential impact of HEMP on their networks  also noted a lack of key information on the nature and risk of the HEMP  threat that would allow them to complete studies of their networks and  develop corresponding mitigation measures. Six of the suppliers cited the  classified nature of much of the available information maintained by the  federal government on the EMP threat\u2014particularly HEMP\u2014as a  contributing factor to the industry\u2019s lack of needed information on the  threat. In addition, according to NERC officials, while they have  developed reliability standards directing suppliers to study the  vulnerabilities of their networks to GMD and establish procedures for  dealing with those events, it has yet to produce similar standards for EMP  or HEMP due to the lack of information available to industry on the EMP  threat and how it may impact the grid.", "According to DOE, more research is needed to fully investigate and  evaluate how an electric utility could protect itself from, or mitigate the  effects of, HEMP on its systems. DOE also noted that government and  industry have ongoing research efforts to better understand these  potential effects and develop possible mitigation measures. For example,  DOE has three ongoing research efforts related to HEMP. First, DOE is  collaborating with DHS to advance the understanding of HEMP effects on  the grid through research at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.  Second, DOE has funded efforts underway at the Idaho National  Laboratory focused on developing potential HEMP strategies, protections,  and mitigations for the electric grid\u2014including hardening of infrastructure,  blocking of currents, developing a strategy for stocking and prepositioning  of spare parts, as well as developing operational and emergency planning  tools. Finally, DOE has enlisted the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in  analyzing the vulnerability of the grid to a HEMP event, along with the  potential damage from such an event, and how it would impact on the  reliability and delivery of electric power. The analysis will examine  resilience options such as hardening some facilities, stockpiling some  parts, and contingency planning. In addition to these research projects,  DOE officials told us both Los Alamos National Laboratory and Lawrence  Livermore National Laboratory are working to produce unclassified  information on the characteristics of the electromagnetic signals  associated with HEMP that could be shared with electricity suppliers to  better inform their planning efforts.", "In addition to its ongoing research efforts, DOE and industry have taken  steps to enhance understanding of HEMP issues. In particular, DOE and  industry issued the Joint Electromagnetic Pulse Resilience Strategy (Joint  Strategy) in July 2016 to study HEMP and improve the sharing of  information on HEMP that would be useful to industry. According to  DOE, central to development of the Joint Strategy was an effort to  enhance shared government-industry understanding of the current status  of risks from, and preparedness for, HEMP events. DOE added that this  effort is important because what is currently known about HEMP effects  to the grid has been developed from computer models designed for other  purposes (e.g., understanding Department of Defense system effects), or  is classified and thus difficult to share with industry. Specifically, the Joint  Strategy includes five strategic goals to guide DOE and industry in  minimizing HEMP impacts and improving resilience of the grid to these  events. These strategic goals are (1) improving and sharing  understanding of HEMP: threat, effects, and impacts, (2) identifying  priority infrastructure, (3) testing and promoting mitigation and protection  approaches, (4) enhancing response and recovery capabilities relating to  a HEMP attack, and (5) sharing best practices across government and  industry both nationally and internationally.", "Following development of the Joint Strategy, both DOE and EPRI  (working with DOE, on industry\u2019s behalf) committed to developing  separate, but coordinated, action plans that would implement the five  strategic goals for studying HEMP and providing needed information to  industry. DOE\u2019s Electromagnetic Pulse Resilience Action Plan (DOE  Action Plan), issued in January 2017, delineates the steps that DOE will  take to address HEMP risks and emphasizes the federal government\u2019s  ability to clarify and communicate HEMP threats and impacts, reduce  HEMP vulnerabilities, and facilitate the energy sector\u2019s response and  recovery after HEMP events. DOE stated that its Action Plan also  considers the over 90 recommendations made in the 2008 EMP  Commission report and at least partially addresses 10 of the 15  recommendations directly related to the electric power system made by  the EMP Commission in their report. See appendix V for additional  detail on the DOE Action Plan, including its relationship to the EMP  Commission\u2019s work.", "As noted in the Joint Strategy, EPRI\u2019s industry action plan\u2014initiated in  April 2016\u2014is a complement to the DOE Action Plan and includes  research to be performed to (1) detail the potential impacts of HEMP on  the bulk power system, (2) examine potential industry actions to mitigate  HEMP risks, and (3) inform industry investment decisions regarding those  mitigation options. According to DOE and EPRI, the research that is  outlined in the industry action plan is ongoing and scheduled for  completion over a 3-year period with the first two reports being issued in  September 2016 and February 2017. EPRI officials added that this  research is intended to provide the electric industry with what it needs\u2014 specifically, an unclassified, science-based approach to HEMP with  regard to (1) threat characterization, (2) testing results, (3) modeling and  simulation, and (4) recommended strategies for mitigating the impacts of  HEMP including prudent and practical hardening and recovery options.  To meet these goals, EPRI, together with participating suppliers, have  undertaken this 3-year long research effort and expect to complete this  work in 2019.

The remaining two components of this task are ongoing and  include (1) identifying characteristics of the electromagnetic signals  associated with HEMP that can be used to assess the potential  impacts on bulk power system components, and (2) investigating the  physics of HEMP\u2019s transmission to, and impact on, power system  infrastructure.", "Electric infrastructure EMP vulnerability. This task involves  identifying the vulnerability of transmission systems and support  assets (e.g., protection and controls systems, communications,  transformers, etc.) exposed to the HEMP threat by performing  laboratory tests. EPRI will test various infrastructure components at  two EMP test labs by subjecting them to E1 pulses. According to  EPRI, initial results for this task are possible by the end of 2017.", "Electric infrastructure impacts. For this task, EPRI is assessing the  potential impacts of a HEMP attack on the bulk power system by  combining the system modeling-related efforts in the first task above  with the equipment testing results of the second task above. Under  this task, EPRI is also developing assessment techniques, models,  and tools for assessing the impacts of a HEMP attack. The  aforementioned February 2017 report assessing the potential effects  of the E3 pulse component of HEMP on U.S. bulk-power transformers  represents a portion of the work under this task. In this report, EPRI  found that a small number of geographically-dispersed transformers  (14 out of the tens of thousands included in EPRI\u2019s analysis) were  potentially at risk for thermal damage from the E3 pulse. EPRI  produced a companion report assessing the potential impacts of the  E3 pulse on the stability of the bulk-power system (i.e., the potential  for voltage collapse) in December 2017 to be followed by the results  of the first E1 pulse assessment at a later date.", "Mitigation, hardening, and recovery.

In this implementation  plan, NERC obtains input from the regions on risks inherent in their  geographic areas of responsibility, and NERC links these areas of risk  with specific reliability standards. For example, since becoming effective  in 2015, NERC officials stated that the EOP-010-1 standard has been an  annual area of focus in the implementation plan under the \u201cextreme  physical events\u201d risk area.", "NERC\u2019s overarching implementation plan provides a template for the  regions to follow in developing their own regional implementation plans.  NERC\u2019s eight Regional Entities build on NERC\u2019s guidance on risks facing  all regions by assessing risks to the reliable operation of the bulk power  system in their specific geographic areas of responsibility and identifying  the reliability standards associated with those local areas of risk that they  will focus on in their compliance monitoring efforts for the upcoming year.  Further, according to NERC officials, each NERC Regional Entity  performs individual risk assessments for each of the electricity suppliers  in their areas of responsibility which further inform their approach to  compliance monitoring for each of these suppliers\u2014including which tools  to use when assessing compliance. According to NERC, these individual risk assessments, along with the overarching and region- specific risks, inform the regions compliance monitoring oversight plan for  each supplier. At the end of this planning process, NERC approves each  region\u2019s implementation and audit plans and submits the audit plans to  FERC.", "As of August 2017, NERC\u2019s regions had conducted 63 compliance audits  of suppliers that included the EOP-010-1 reliability standard out of the  total of 188 electricity suppliers potentially subject to the standard in the  United States and Canada. According to NERC officials, the EOP-010-1  reliability standard went into effect in April 2015, and, as noted previously,  NERC Regional Entities conduct compliance audits of individual  suppliers\u2014including those that must comply with EOP-010-1\u2014at least  once every 3 years. Therefore, due to this reason and the fact that  these audits are just one of several options for NERC to consider in  compliance monitoring, not every supplier subject to EOP-010-1 has been  the subject of a compliance audit that included that standard in its scope  as of the date of this report. NERC regions conducted these compliance  audits on both reliability coordinators and transmission operators  registered in the U.S. that were subject to EOP-010-1. As of September  2017, NERC had reported a total of two instances of non-compliance with  the EOP-010-1 standard since its inception in April 2015. Electricity  suppliers self-reported these two instances of non-compliance to NERC,  and they were not the result of a compliance audit. NERC concluded that  these incidents posed minimal risk to the reliability of the bulk power  system. The two suppliers engaged in mitigation activities (e.g., training of  personnel and modification of procedures) to address their non- compliance with the standard, which was verified by NERC\u2019s Regional  Entities. NERC concluded that no further action was needed in these two  cases."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Selected Suppliers Reported that Costs for Protecting against GMD and HEMP Events Have Been Relatively Small to Date, and Most U.S. Suppliers Are Expected to Be Able to Recover Costs through Charges to Electricity Customers", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Selected Suppliers Told Us Costs for Protecting against GMD and HEMP Events Have Been Relatively Small to Date, but Costs May Increase as Suppliers Comply with Future NERC Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Selected electricity suppliers told us the costs they have incurred to date  for protecting against GMD and HEMP events have been small relative to  their overall system costs. One supplier said that the costs they have  incurred are generally associated with projects that provide broader  system reliability or other benefits not specific to GMD or HEMP events.  Based on interviews with selected suppliers, there are several types of  projects that protect against GMD and HEMP events at different levels of  costs:", "Projects providing collateral GMD or HEMP protection at no  specific, incremental cost. As noted previously in this report,  selected suppliers have installed several types of equipment for the  purposes of transmission efficiency or benefits of general stability, and  this equipment also provides collateral protection against GMD or  HEMP events. This equipment has included series compensation  systems installed on transmission lines, replacement of older electro- mechanical protective relays used in the suppliers\u2019 grid control  systems with newer digital relays, and acquisition of spare  transformers or participation in shared spare transformer programs  which improves their ability to quickly restore transmission systems  from any cause, including GMD or HEMP events. Total project costs  may vary widely depending on the amount and type of equipment  suppliers choose to install, but according to suppliers we interviewed  and information from transformer manufacturers, costs for this  equipment can range from thousands of dollars per digital relay to  tens of millions of dollars for a series compensation system.", "Projects providing supplemental GMD or HEMP protection at  minimal added cost. As also noted previously in this report, some  suppliers we interviewed said they have added specifications for  improved protection against GMD or HEMP events as part of larger  equipment procurement or construction projects and that this  improved protection typically came at a relatively small increase in  total project price. For example, several suppliers told us that  transformers and other transmission equipment used to control  voltage levels can be made more resistant to GIC by using certain  designs or materials, and one supplier said this would increase  equipment costs by 2 to 3 percent or less. In addition, the two  suppliers we interviewed who have designed new control centers that  are to be hardened against a range of hazards\u2014including extreme  weather (earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, lightning), physical  attacks, and HEMP events\u2014told us that adding HEMP protection to  the design of new control centers has increased total project costs  from about 5 to approximately 20 percent.", "Projects built primarily for GMD or HEMP protection. As also  noted previously in this report, one supplier has installed a prototype  GIC-blocking device, designed specifically to protect against GMD  events, as part of a pilot effort to test its operational impacts. The  costs of deploying these devices are expected to be better understood  after the pilot effort is completed, but based on its initial results, the  supplier expects that the total cost for a well-designed GIC-blocking  device would be at least $500,000, excluding installation and other  costs and one device could be required to protect each transformer.", "Suppliers we interviewed told us they have also developed plans or  procedures to mitigate for GMD. According to suppliers, in general these  plans emphasize reducing the (1) level of power provided by individual  power plants and (2) amount of power flowing over power lines to levels  below their operating limits. For example, the plan for one coordinator\u2014a  grid operator\u2014requires that they immediately take action to reduce the  transfer of power down to GMD Operating Plan-designated limits; if these  limits are approached or exceeded, selected power plants are directed to  reduce the levels of power provided and, if necessary, the grid operator  modifies the levels of power flowing through the system until designated  transfer limits are reached. According to suppliers, lowering these power  levels can reduce the temperatures of key equipment such as  transformers and provide for greater flexibility to operate the system  during an event. In some cases, such plans can require increased use of  power plants that are more costly to operate, potentially increasing overall  system costs. The costs of emergency operating procedures  implemented in response to electromagnetic events are likely to vary  considerably on a case-by-case basis, depending on such factors as the  level of demand and the generation resources available during the event.", "In terms of customer costs, U.S. suppliers we interviewed said that the  costs they have incurred for GMD or HEMP protection thus far would  represent a negligible increase in rates paid by customers. For example,  one supplier we interviewed serves about 4.5 million retail customers, and  officials from that supplier estimated the cost of hardening a planned  control center against HEMP to be at least $10 million. If this cost is fully  passed on to customers and paid for in a single year, we calculated that it  would amount to a total of about $2 for the average customer\u2019s electric bill  for that year.", "In the future, suppliers could face increased costs for protecting against  GMD, depending on the corrective actions needed to address  vulnerabilities, which suppliers are to identify in accordance with reliability  standard TPL-007-1. The standard does not require suppliers to complete  vulnerability assessments and develop corrective action plans until 2022,  and suppliers told us it is too early to know what types of corrective  actions may be required. However, the costs associated with some types  of potential actions could be high. In particular, examples of potential  corrective actions provided in the standard, such as installing new  equipment or modifying existing equipment for improved GIC resilience,  could be costly according to some suppliers we interviewed. For example,  high-voltage transformers can cost tens of millions of dollars each. If  suppliers identify multiple transformers that are vulnerable to thermal  impacts from GIC flows, replacing or modifying them would be costly.  Similarly, a supplier may need to install GIC-blocking devices throughout  their network to effectively protect against a GMD event because the  devices re-direct GIC flows elsewhere in the network. Therefore, a  blocking device strategy could be costly if suppliers determine that large  numbers of their transformers are vulnerable.", "Based on our prior review of federal efforts to enhance electric grid  resiliency and federal emergency management programs, and interviews  with agency and industry representatives, there are no sources of direct  federal funding specifically to reimburse suppliers for costs they incur for  protecting against GMD or HEMP events. DHS officials told us there  are two DHS grant programs that could be used to indirectly support  suppliers\u2019 efforts to prepare for GMD or HEMP events. However, DHS  directly awards these grants to state, local, or tribal governments, and  DHS officials told us that it is rare for these grant funds to be passed  through to private companies and they have no record of instances in  which electricity suppliers received funding for grid preparedness  efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulated U.S. Suppliers\u2019 Costs for Protecting against GMD are Generally Recoverable, but Cost Recovery is Less Certain for HEMP Events", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal and State Regulators Have Made Specific Assurances about Recovering GMD-Related Costs", "paragraphs": ["At the federal level, in FERC\u2019s September 22, 2016, order approving  NERC\u2019s TPL-007-1 reliability standard, FERC stated that cost recovery  for prudent costs associated with or incurred to comply with the standard  would be available to suppliers for whom FERC approves rates.

For instance, one supplier expressed  concern that they could have to begin work to assess vulnerabilities and  protect against the first version of the benchmark event, and that the  revised standard would require them to re-do such work using a new  benchmark event, at additional cost. In response to such concerns, FERC  stated that it could not yet determine what impacts the revisions might  have on the actions suppliers would have to take to comply, because  NERC had not yet developed or proposed the revisions.

In  2004, FERC publicly assured suppliers that it will allow for recovery of  prudent costs necessary for ensuring the reliability of the bulk power  system. Specifically, FERC issued a policy statement assuring public  utilities that FERC will approve applications to recover prudently-incurred  costs necessary to ensure bulk power system reliability, including prudent  expenditures for compliance with good utility practices\u2014practices  engaged in or approved by a significant portion of the electricity industry  or that could be expected to accomplish the desired result at a  reasonable cost.

Table 2  summarizes the specific requirements in NERC\u2019s stage 1\u2014EOP-010-1\u2014 and stage 2\u2014TPL-007-1\u2014standards, the electricity industry entities  responsible for them, and their effective dates for the requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Select Government and Industry Studies on Electromagnetic Events", "paragraphs": ["An electromagnetic event can result from a naturally occurring, large- scale geomagnetic disturbance (GMD), caused by severe solar weather,  or from human-made sources, such as the high-altitude detonation of a  nuclear device to create a high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP).  Table 3 provides details on a select number of geomagnetic-related  studies performed since 2010 with respect to their objectives, findings,  and recommendations. These studies include details on (1) areas of  vulnerability for the grid with respect to GMD events, (2) potential impact  on the grid from these events, (3) possible mitigation measures, and (4)  areas needing further research. For example, as shown in the table, the  North American Electric Reliability Corporation\u2019s (NERC) and the  Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) June 2010 report included a plan to form a  task force of government and industry efforts to examine GMD. This  resulted in the formation of the NERC GMD Task Force, consisting of  government, industry, and academic experts, to examine the GMD threat  to the nation\u2019s power grid. The task force\u2019s work in evaluating the  potential impact of GMD events resulted in NERC\u2019s subsequent February  2012 report (also shown in table 3) which outlines its plans for working  with industry on new reliability standards for GMD events, among other  things. As a result of this work, and as directed by the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission (FERC), NERC developed the EOP-010-1 and  TPL-007-1 GMD reliability standards. Also as a result of this work, NERC  issued a GMD Planning Guide for electricity suppliers, which assists the  suppliers in carrying out studies to assess the effects of GMD on their  individual networks.", "Table 4 provides details on a select number of unclassified HEMP-related  studies performed since 2010 with respect to their objectives, findings,  and recommendations. These studies include details on (1) areas of  vulnerability for the grid with respect to HEMP events, (2) potential impact  on the grid from these events with respect to all three HEMP pulses (E1,  E2, and E3), (3) possible mitigation measures, and (4) areas needing  further research."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Details on the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Resilience Action Plan", "paragraphs": ["DOE\u2019s EMP Action Plan (DOE Action Plan), issued January 2017,  describes 19 actions to be taken by September 30, 2021, to enhance the  resilience of the electric power grid to high-altitude electromagnetic pulse  (HEMP) effects. DOE stated that its Action Plan considers the over 90  recommendations made in the 2008 Commission to Assess the Threat of  the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Attack (EMP  Commission) report and at least partially addresses 10 of the 15  recommendations directly related to the electric power system made by  the EMP Commission in their report.

Future work DOE expects to address under the plan will  include (1) evaluating existing models used to estimate EMP impacts to  the grid, (2) the adequacy of backup power generation in the wake of an  EMP event, (3) establishing a national capability for conducting EMP  testing of existing grid components, (4) identifying and evaluating  mitigation and protection measures for various grid components, and (5)  assessing the feasibility of testing different hardening techniques for  substations for EMP scenarios.
