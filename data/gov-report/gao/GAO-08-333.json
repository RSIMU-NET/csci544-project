When testing internal controls, GAO asked agencies to provide documentation on selected transactions to prove that the purchase of goods or services had been properly authorized and that when the good or service was delivered, an individual other than the cardholder received and signed for it. Using a statistical sample of purchase card transactions from July 1, 2005, through June 30, 2006, GAO estimated that nearly 41 percent of the transactions failed to meet either of these basic internal control standards. Using a second sample of transactions over $2,500, GAO found a similar failure rate--agencies could not demonstrate that 48 percent of these large purchases met the standard of proper authorization, independent receipt and acceptance, or both. Breakdowns in internal controls, including authorization and independent receipt and acceptance, resulted in numerous examples of fraudulent, improper, and abusive purchase card use. These examples included instances where cardholders used purchase cards to subscribe to Internet dating services, buy video iPods for personal use, and pay for lavish dinners that included top-shelf liquor. GAO identified some of the case studies, including one case where a cardholder used the purchase card program to embezzle over $642,000 over a period of 6 years from the Department of Agriculture's Forest Service firefighting fund. This cardholder was sentenced to 21 months in prison and ordered to pay full restitution. In addition, agencies were unable to locate 458 items of 1,058 total accountable and pilferable items totaling over $2.7 million that GAO selected for testing. These missing items, which GAO considered to be lost or stolen, totaled over $1.8 million and included computer servers, laptop computers, iPods, and digital cameras. For example, the Department of the Army could not adequately account for 256 items making up 16 server configurations, each of which cost nearly $100,000."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The serious fiscal challenges facing the federal government demand that  agencies do everything they can to operate as efficiently as possible. The  federal government spends billions annually through its purchase card  programs, using purchase cards and convenience checks to acquire  millions of items\u2014everything from paper and pencils to computers\u2014and  to make payments on government contracts for a variety of goods and  services, such as vehicles and relocation services. The primary  responsibility for purchasing these items rests with cardholders and the  officials who approve their purchases. Because of the position of public  trust held by federal employees, Congress and the American people expect  cardholders and approving officials to maintain stewardship over the  federal funds at their disposal. Specifically, purchase cardholders and  approving officials are expected to follow published acquisition  requirements and exercise a standard of care in acquiring goods and  services that is necessary and reasonable (i.e., not extravagant or  excessive) for the proper operation of an agency. Because every federal  dollar that is spent on fraudulent, improper, and abusive purchases is a  dollar that cannot be used for necessary government goods and services,  ensuring that purchase cards are used responsibly is of particular concern  at a time when the United States is experiencing substantial fiscal  challenges.", "Our previous work has shown that using the purchase card for small  purchases has reduced administrative costs and increased the flexibility to  meet a variety of government needs. If properly used, purchase cards can  also help to fulfill other objectives, such as providing opportunities for  small, disadvantaged businesses. The Federal Acquisition Regulation  (FAR) designates the purchase card as the preferred method for making  micropurchases. At the time of our audit, a micropurchase was defined as  any purchase under $2,500. In addition to making micropurchases,  government purchase cards may also be used to make payments under  established contracts. According to the General Services Administration  (GSA), the purchase card program had substantially improved  procurement efficiencies, which resulted in about $1.8 billion in annual  savings, as compared to prior paper-based procurement processes. GSA  also asserted that in fiscal year 2007, the five credit card banks provided  government agencies with refunds exceeding $170 million from card  activity.", "The purchase card program had brought substantial cost reduction to the  federal procurement process. However, since calendar year 2001, we have  testified and reported on the purchase card programs at a number of  agencies, which demonstrated that if not properly managed and  controlled, use of the purchase card results in fraud, waste, and abuse (see  app. I for previous GAO reports). For example, in September 2006, we  reported that weaknesses in the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s  (DHS) purchase card program resulted in over 100 lost (and presumed  stolen) laptop computers; unauthorized acquisition and excessive cost  related to the purchase of 20 flat-bottom boats, 12 of which were missing;  and thousands of meals ready-to-eat stored in a warehouse in El Paso,  Texas, more than 7 months after they were purchased for DHS employees  assisting with the response to hurricanes Katrina and Rita.", "In response to our findings of fraud, waste, and abuse at the Department  of Defense (DOD), Congress enacted legislation specifically directed at  improving the management of DOD\u2019s purchase card program. However,  concerns remain over whether purchase card usage continues to expose  the federal government to increased risk of fraud, waste, and abuse.  Therefore, you asked us to (1) determine whether internal control  weaknesses in the purchase card program existed governmentwide and  (2) if so, identify specific examples of fraudulent, improper, and abusive  activity.", "To identify control weaknesses and specific examples of fraudulent,  improper, and abusive activity, we reviewed applicable federal laws and  regulations related to the FAR and purchase card uses.

In our statistical samples, we included  purchase card transactions from federal agencies that are required to  follow the FAR, including executive departments, independent  establishments, and wholly owned federal government corporations as  defined by the United States Code. We refer to these entities as executive  agencies. We excluded transactions from the legislative and judicial  branches, entities under treaty with the United States, and federal agencies  with specific authority over their own purchase card programs. We tested  these samples for proper authorization and independent receipt and  acceptance.

This period included an  additional 3 months of data subsequent to the period included in our  statistical samples. We data mined using a number of criteria, including  identifying vendors of goods or services prohibited by the agency or likely  to be for personal use, split purchases, year-end purchases, and pilferable  and accountable property purchases, among others. We also data mined  transactions from federal agencies that had been granted specific  authority over their own purchase card programs, such as the U.S. Postal  Service (USPS).

The purchase card  can be used for simplified acquisitions, including micropurchases, as well  as to place orders and make payments on contract activities. The FAR  designated the purchase card as the preferred method of making  micropurchases. In addition, part 13 of the FAR, \u201cSimplified Acquisition  Procedures,\u201d establishes criteria for using purchase cards to place orders  and make payments.

Oversight of the purchase card program is also the responsibility  of OMB. OMB provides overall direction for governmentwide procurement  policies, regulations, and procedures to promote economy, efficiency, and  effectiveness in the acquisition processes.

As shown in table 1, 15 percent of all  transactions failed proper authorization.

To test  authorization, we accepted as reasonable evidence various types of  documentation, such as purchase requests or requisitions from a  responsible official, e-mails, and other documents that identify an official  government need, including blanket authorizations for routine purchases  with subsequent review by an approving official.", "The lack of proper authorization occurred because (1) the cardholder  failed to maintain sufficient documentation, (2) the agency\u2019s policy did not  require authorization, or (3) the agency lacked the internal controls and  management oversight to identify purchases that were not authorized\u2014 increasing the risk that agency cardholders will misuse the purchase card.  Failure to require cardholders to obtain appropriate authorization and lack  of management oversight increase the risk that fraudulent, improper, and  other abusive activity will occur without detection.", "Lack of independent receipt and acceptance. As depicted in table 1, our  statistical sampling of executive agency purchase card transactions also  found that 34 percent of transactions failed independent receipt and  acceptance, that is, goods or services ordered and charged to a  government purchase card account were not received by someone other  than the cardholder. According to Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government, the key duties and responsibilities need to be  divided or segregated among different people to reduce the risk of error or  fraud. Segregating duties entails separating the responsibilities for  authorizing transactions, processing and recording them, reviewing the  transactions, and handling related assets. The standards further state that  no one individual should control all key aspects of a transaction or event.", "As evidence of independent receipt and acceptance, we accepted any  signature or initials of someone other than the cardholder on the sales  invoice, packing slip, bill of lading, or any other shipping or receiving  document.

Similarly, because the scope of our work was  restricted to purchase card acquisitions, we did not audit agencies\u2019  controls over accountable property acquired using other procurement  methods.

However, the sheer number of  accountable property purchases made \u201cover the counter\u201d or directly from  a vendor increases the risk that the accountable or pilferable property  would not be reported to property managers for inclusion in the property  tracking system. Unrecorded assets decrease the likelihood of detecting  lost or stolen government property. In addition, if these items were used to  store sensitive data, this information could be lost, stolen, or both without  the knowledge of the government.

Consequently, for this audit, we selected $350 as the threshold for  our accountable property test. Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government provides that an agency must establish physical  control to secure and safeguard vulnerable assets. Examples include  security for, and limited access to, assets such as cash, securities,  inventories, and equipment, which might be vulnerable to risk of loss or  unauthorized use. Failure to maintain accountability over property,  including highly pilferable items, increases the risk of unauthorized use  and lost and stolen property.", "Our accountable asset work consisted of identifying accountable and  pilferable properties associated with transactions from both the statistical  sample and data-mining transactions, requesting serial numbers from the  agency and vendors, and obtaining evidence\u2014such as a photograph  provided by the agency\u2014that the property was recorded, could be located,  or both. In some instances, we obtained the photographs ourselves. We  then evaluated each photograph to determine whether the photograph  represented the accountable or pilferable item we selected for testing.  Property items failed our physical property inventory tests for various  reasons, including the following:  the agency could not locate the item upon request and reported the  item as missing,  the agency failed to provide photographs, or  the agency provided photographs of items where the serial numbers  did not match the items purchased.", "In many instances, we found that agencies failed to provide evidence that  the property was independently received or entered into the agency  property book.

Specifically, GSA stated that it was not within the scope of its authority to  issue guidance to agencies with respect to asset accountability and receipt  and acceptance of items purchased with government purchase cards, as  these are not strictly purchase card issues. Further, GSA stated that there  are more effective ways to deal with purchase card misuse or abuse than  issuing \u201credundant\u201d policy reminders or guidance. It also took exception  to our testing methodology. We agree with GSA that the problems we  identified with property accountability and receipt and acceptance go  beyond the bounds of strictly purchase card issues. However, our work  over the last several years has consistently shown substantial problems  with property accountability and independent receipt and acceptance of  goods and services, problems that arose because of the flexibility provided  by the purchase card program. We do not believe that our  recommendations related to policy guidance and reminders to strengthen  internal controls are redundant\u2014our previous recommendations in this  area had been targeted at specific agencies we audited. With respect to  governmentwide purchase card issues, GSA\u2019s role as the purchase card  program manager puts it in a unique position to identify challenges to  agency internal control systems and assist agencies with improving their  internal controls governmentwide. We are encouraged by OMB\u2019s support  for aggressive and effective controls over purchase cards, and believe that  GSA can seek OMB support to overcome the perceived lack of authority.  We believe that GSA has a number of tools already at its disposal, such as  online training and annual conferences, where GSA could easily remind  cardholders and approving officials to pay particular attention to  governmentwide issues, including asset accountability and independent  receipt and acceptance of goods and services identified in this report. We  also reiterate support for our testing methodology, which included  systematic testing of key internal controls through statistical sampling.  The following contains more detailed information on GSA\u2019s comments,  along with our response.", "GSA concurred with 3 of 10 recommendations. Specifically, GSA  concurred with 2 recommendations to improve controls over convenience  checks and 1 recommendation related to approval of purchases below the  micropurchase threshold. Specifically, GSA agreed to provide written  guidance to agencies that convenience check use should be minimized,  and that improper use of convenience checks would result in cancellation  of convenience check privileges. As part of its concurrence, GSA provided  that it is not practical to strictly prohibit the use of convenience checks  given the unique nature of some suppliers or services acquired by agencies  and vendor refusal to accept purchase cards. It was not our intent to  completely eliminate the use of convenience checks. As such, we clarified  our recommendation to require only that the cardholder make a  \u201creasonable\u201d\u2014not absolute\u2014effort to locate other vendors that can  provide the same goods and services and that accept the purchase card  prior to using convenience check. The requested revision is consistent  with our intent and therefore we have made the necessary change to our  recommendations. With respect to the third recommendation related to  approval of micropurchases, GSA agreed that cardholders need to obtain  prior approval or subsequent review of purchase card activity for purchase  transactions that are under the micropurchase threshold. However, GSA  believed that OMB needed to take the lead and incorporate this change in  its Circular No. A-123. GSA offered to help OMB revise Circular No. A-123  in this regard.", "GSA stated that it partially concurred with our recommendation to remind  travelers to reduce the per diem claims on their travel vouchers when  meals are provided by the government. However, based on its response, it  appears that GSA substantially agrees with our recommendation, and that  the GSA Office of Governmentwide Policy will issue this guidance. In  actuality, GSA concurred with our recommendation but disagreed that this  was a purchase card issue. Further, GSA took exception as to whether the  requirement to deduct per diem applies to continental breakfasts, stating  that continental breakfasts did not constitute \u201cfull breakfasts.\u201d Thus, GSA  stated that it needs to convene stakeholders in the GSA travel policy  community to consider whether the requirement for deducting per diem  should be applied to continental breakfasts. We disagree with this  assessment. If the costs of the continental breakfasts were in fact not  significant, we would not have reported on this finding; however, the basis  of our recommendation rests primarily on the fact that GSA itself paid for  continental breakfasts costing $23 per person, which was greater than the  portion of government per diem established by GSA for breakfast in any  city in the United States. GSA then proceeded to reimburse the same  employees the breakfast portion of per diem\u2014in effect paying twice for  breakfasts. We disagree with GSA that this is an appropriate treatment of  continental breakfast, as it implies that it is appropriate for taxpayers to  pay twice for a government traveler\u2019s meal. Consequently, we reiterate the  need for GSA to promote prudent management of taxpayer\u2019s money, and  our support for requiring travelers to reduce their per diem if they took  advantage of the continental breakfasts provided.", "GSA disagreed with all of our recommendations related to receipt and  acceptance and controls over accountable and pilferable property. GSA  stated that these issues were not within the purview of the GSA  SmartPay\u00ae program or the scope of GSA SmartPay\u00ae contracts. Further,  GSA stated that other approaches would be more effective at addressing  purchase card abuse and misuse than issuing \u201credundant\u201d policy guidance  and reminders. With respect to receipt and acceptance, GSA stated that it  did not have the authority to encourage agencies to identify a de minimis  amount, types of items that do not require receipt and acceptance, or both,  or to determine how approving officials should document receipt and  acceptance. With respect to accountable property, GSA did not believe  that it should provide reminders to agencies that computers and similar  items are sensitive and pilferable property that can easily be converted to  personal use. GSA argued that what constitutes sensitive and pilferable  property is defined by agencies and is not within its purview. GSA also  believes that it does not have authority to remind cardholders to maintain  accountability of, and notify property managers when, pilferable property  is acquired with purchase cards. Finally, GSA does not believe that it can  issue reminders to property managers to record, in a timely manner,  pilferable property acquired with purchase cards in their property  management systems. GSA suggested we modify these recommendations  accordingly.", "With respect to receipt and acceptance, we agree that GSA alone should  not issue guidance concerning agencies\u2019 internal controls over purchase  cards and related payment process. We reiterate that we did not ask GSA  to take actions in isolation\u2014instead, we recommended that GSA work  with the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Financial Management Service to  provide guidance on improving internal controls while at the same time  streamlining the acquisition process. After all, streamlining the acquisition  process is a key objective of the purchase card program. We believe this  could be achieved, in part, by requiring independent receipt and  acceptance only for items above a de minimis amount. Further,  governmentwide guidance in this area would not be redundant\u2014the fact  that no current guidance exists demonstrates the need for consistent  policy governmentwide that all agencies can follow. Consistent guidance  is crucial to engendering taxpayers\u2019 confidence in the purchase card  program\u2014as we stated above, our previous audits and our current work  showed that ineffective receipt and acceptance of goods and services  acquired with the purchase card is a widespread, governmentwide  problem. Furthermore, OMB indicated that it was extremely concerned  about purchase card abuse and supported our recommendations designed  to improve internal controls over the program. We believe that GSA can  adopt a proactive approach and coordinate with OMB to obtain its support  to overcome the perceived obstacles. In our opinion, the purchase card  program will continue to expose the federal government\u2014and the  taxpayers\u2014to fraud, waste, and abuse, unless GSA helps facilitate a  governmentwide solution.", "Similarly, GSA argued that it did not have the authority to take the  recommended actions with respect to property accountability. As with  independent receipt and acceptance, our work continues to demonstrate  that accountability for property acquired with purchase cards is ineffective  across many agencies. For example, the purchase card program provides  cardholders the ability to acquire sensitive and pilferable items directly  from vendors. This process results in cardholders bypassing the normal  property receipt and acceptance procedures, which increases the risk that  the item will not be recorded in an agency\u2019s list of accountable property.  GSA needs to recognize this risk (and other inherent risks) created by  purchase card use and proactively work with agencies to improve the  accountability of property acquired with government purchase cards. We  also believe that our recommendations fully take into account the extent  of GSA\u2019s authority\u2014to that end, our recommendation called for GSA to  provide agencies guidance and reminders to improve internal controls  over asset accountability. Even though GSA already issued guidance  related to the proper use of the purchase card program through online  training, refresher courses, and annual conferences, GSA should go a step  further and address control weaknesses related to property accountability  and receipt and acceptance. GSA\u2019s position contrasted sharply with OMB,  which, in its comments on our report, expressed support for aggressive  and effective controls over purchase cards. We believe that GSA can take  advantage of the diverse tools already at its disposal, such as online  training and annual conferences, with which GSA could easily remind  cardholders and approving officials to pay particular attention to  governmentwide issues, including asset accountability and independent  receipt and acceptance of goods and services identified in this report.", "Overall, our recommendations are focused on GSA taking a proactive  approach to improve the success of the purchase card program. Last year,  the federal government spent nearly $18 billion using purchase cards.  While the purchase card program has achieved significant savings, a  program of this magnitude needs to focus on both preventive and  detective controls to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse. In its response, GSA  also pointed out that the new SmartPay\u00ae 2 contract should provide better  management tools to agencies. However, the changes GSA identified in  SmartPay\u00ae 2 were mostly related to data mining for fraud, waste, and  abuse after a potentially fraudulent or improper transaction had taken  place, but did not address the issues we raised in this report. As our  previous work indicated, while detection can help reduce fraud, waste,  and abuse, preventive controls are a more effective and less costly means  to minimize fraud, waste, and abuse. The recommendations we made, to  which GSA took exception, were meant to improve these up-front  controls.", "GSA also took exception to our methodology, arguing that we improperly  failed items as part of our control testing. GSA argued that some  unauthorized purchases were still appropriate purchases. We believe that  this argument is flawed. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government states that transactions should be authorized and executed  only by persons acting within the scope of their authority. In other words,  authorization is the principal means of assuring that only valid  transactions are initiated or entered into and, consequently, without  authorization, adequate assurance does not exist that the items purchased  were for authorized purposes only. Our statistical sampling was designed  to test authorization control, and the results we reported reflected items  that did not pass this attribute. Such attribute testing is a widely accepted  and statistically valid methodology for internal control evaluations. GSA  also stated that our report did not adequately address the areas of personal  responsibility and managerial oversight. We disagree. We recommended  that OMB require agencies to hold cardholders financially responsible for  improper and wasteful purchases, and OMB agreed to implement our  recommendations; we believe that this would contribute to holding  cardholders accountable to management for their actions. Further, our  past reports on purchase card management have always focused on  managerial oversight. However, it is not feasible within the scope of a  governmentwide audit to test managerial oversight at every government  agency. Consequently, we focused on providing GSA, the manager of the  governmentwide purchase card program, with recommendations that  could contribute to improving management oversight at the agencies.", "Finally, GSA disagreed with our characterization that travelers who did  not reduce the per diem claimed on their travel voucher when dinners  were provided may be engaging in potentially fraudulent activities.  Because we are unable to establish that these travelers acted with the  requisite knowledge and willfulness necessary to establish either a false  statement under 18 U.S.C. \u00a71001 or a false claim, we have characterized  such activities as potentially fraudulent.", "GSA\u2019s and OMB\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendixes III and IV.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you announce the contents of this  report earlier, we will not distribute it until 30 days from its date.

We identified split purchases  by extracting multiple purchase transactions made by the same cardholder  at the same vendor on the same day. For year-end purchases, we identified  transactions from purchase card accounts where year-end activity is high  compared to the rest of the year. With respect to convenience checks, we  used various criteria, including identifying instances where convenience  checks were written to cash or payees not normally associated with  procurement needs and where a large number of convenience checks  were written to a single payee, among others. We analyzed the banks\u2019  databases for detailed transaction data, whenever available, for  accountable property and highly pilferable items.", "We then requested and reviewed supporting documentation for over 550  transactions among the thousands we identified.
