In support of its mission, the department has deployed a Web-based information-sharing application--the Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN)--and operates at least 11 homeland security networks. The department reported that in fiscal years 2005 and 2006, these investments cost $611.8 million to develop, operate, and maintain. In view of the significance of information sharing for protecting homeland security, GAO was asked to testify on the department's efforts to coordinate its development and use of HSIN with two key state and local initiatives under the Regional Information Sharing Systems--a nationwide information-sharing program operated and managed by state and local officials. This testimony is based on a recent GAO report that addresses, among other things, DHS's homeland security networks and HSIN. In performing the work for that report, GAO analyzed documentation on HSIN and state and local initiatives, compared it against the requirements of the Homeland Security Act and federal guidance and best practices, and interviewed DHS officials and state and local officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In developing HSIN, its key homeland security information-sharing application, DHS did not work effectively with two key Regional Information Sharing Systems program initiatives. This program, which is operated and managed by state and local officials nationwide, provides services to law enforcement, emergency responders, and other public safety officials. However, DHS did not coordinate with the program to fully develop joint strategies and policies, procedures, and other means to operate across agency boundaries, which are key practices for effective coordination and collaboration and a means to enhance information sharing and avoid duplication of effort. For example, DHS did not engage the program in ongoing dialogue to determine how resources could be leveraged to meet mutual needs. A major factor contributing to this limited coordination was that the department rushed to deploy HSIN after the events of September 11, 2001. In its haste, it did not develop a comprehensive inventory of key state and local information-sharing initiatives, and it did not achieve a full understanding of the relevance of the Regional Information Sharing Systems program to homeland security information sharing. As a result, DHS faces the risk that effective information sharing is not occurring and that HSIN may be duplicating state and local capabilities. Specifically, both HSIN and one of the Regional Information Sharing Systems initiatives target similar user groups, such as emergency management agencies, and all have similar features, such as electronic bulletin boards, \"chat\" tools, and document libraries. The department has efforts planned and under way to improve coordination and collaboration, including developing an integration strategy to allow other applications and networks to connect with HSIN, so that organizations can continue to use their preferred information-sharing applications and networks. In addition, it has agreed to implement recommendations made by GAO to take specific steps to (1) improve coordination, including developing a comprehensive inventory of state and local initiatives, and (2) ensure that similar coordination and duplication issues do not arise with other federal homeland security networks, systems, and applications. Until DHS completes these efforts, including developing an inventory of key state and local initiatives and fully implementing and institutionalizing key practices for effective coordination and collaboration, the department will continue to be at risk that information is not being effectively shared and that the department is duplicating state and local capabilities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to discuss challenges  facing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in coordinating  efforts on its Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN) with  state and local governments and other parties involved in the  mission of keeping our nation secure.

Specifically, in our  recent report, we reported that the department identified 11 major  networks it uses to support its homeland security functions,  including sharing information with state and local governments.  Examples of such DHS networks include the Homeland Secure Data  Network, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Network, and  the Customs and Border Protection Network. In addition, the  department has deployed HSIN, a homeland security information- sharing application that operates on the public Internet.

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has  also issued guidance that stresses the importance of information  sharing and avoiding duplication of effort. Nonetheless, although  this area has received increased attention, the federal government  faces formidable challenges in sharing information among  stakeholders in an appropriate and timely manner.", "As we concluded in October 2005, agencies can help address these  challenges by adopting and implementing key practices, related to  OMB\u2019s guidance, to improve collaboration, such as establishing joint  strategies and addressing needs by leveraging resources and  developing compatible policies, procedures, and other means to  operate across agency boundaries. Based on our research and  experience, these practices are also relevant for collaboration  between federal agencies and other levels of government (e.g., state,  local). Until these coordination and collaboration practices are  implemented, agencies face the risk that effective information  sharing will not occur.", "Congress and the Administration have made several efforts to  address the challenges associated with information sharing. In  particular, as we reported in March 2006, the President initiated an  effort to establish an Information Sharing Environment that is to  combine policies, procedures, and networks and other technologies  that link people, systems, and information among all appropriate  federal, state, local, and tribal entities and the private sector. In  November 2006, in response to congressional direction, the  Administration issued a plan for implementing this environment and  described actions that the federal government intends\u2014in  coordination with state, local, tribal, private sector, and foreign  partners\u2014to carry out over the next 3 years."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Efforts to Coordinate HSIN with Key State and Local Information- Sharing Initiatives Have Been Limited", "paragraphs": ["DHS did not fully adhere to the previously mentioned key practices  in coordinating its efforts on HSIN with key state and local  information-sharing initiatives.

DHS did not engage the  RISS program to determine how resources could be leveraged to  meet mutual needs. According to RISS program officials, they met  with DHS twice (on September 25, 2003, and January 7, 2004) to  demonstrate that their RISS ATIX application could be used by DHS  for sharing homeland security information.

According to DHS officials, they still do  not have a complete inventory of key state and local information- sharing initiatives. DHS\u2019s Office of Inspector General also reported  that DHS developed HSIN in a rapid and ad hoc manner, and among  other things, did not adequately identify existing federal, state, and  local resources, such as RISSNET, that it could have leveraged.", "Further, DHS did not fully understand the RISS program.  Specifically, DHS officials did not acknowledge the RISS program as  a state and local based program with which to partner, but instead  considered it to be one of many vendors providing a tool for  information sharing. In addition, DHS officials believed that the  RISS program was solely focused on law enforcement information  and did not capture the broader terrorism-related or other  information of interest to the department.", "Because of this limited coordination and collaboration, DHS is at  increased risk that effective information sharing is not occurring.  The department also faces the risk that it is developing and  deploying capabilities on HSIN that duplicate those being  established by state and local agencies.

These are positive steps and should help address  shortfalls in the department\u2019s coordination practices on HSIN.  However, these actions have either just begun or are planned, with  milestones for implementation yet to be defined.
