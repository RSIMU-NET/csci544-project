In the years following the 1991 Persian Gulf War, approximately  80,000 veterans have reported various symptoms including fatigue, muscle  and joint pains, headaches, memory loss, skin rash, diarrhea, and sleep  disturbances. Scientists have agreed that many veterans have unexplained  illnesses\u2014commonly referred to as Gulf War illnesses\u2014that are  characterized by one or more symptoms that do not conform to a standard  diagnosis.

Some veterans began reporting health  problems shortly after the war that they believed might be due to their  participation in the conflict. VA, DOD, HHS, and other federal agencies  initiated research and investigations into these health concerns and the  consequences of possible hazardous exposures.", "VA is the coordinator for all federal activities on the health consequences  of service in the Gulf War. These activities include ensuring that the  findings of all federal Gulf War illnesses research are made available to the  public and that federal agencies coordinate outreach to Gulf War veterans  in order to provide information on potential health risks from service in  the Gulf War and corresponding services or benefits. The Secretary of VA  is required to submit an annual report on the results, status, and priorities  of federal research activities related to the health consequences of military  service in the Gulf War to the Senate and House Veterans\u2019 Affairs  Committees. VA has provided these reports to Congress since 1995. In May  2004, VA issued its annual report for 2002. VA has carried out its  coordinating role through the auspices of interagency committees, which  have changed over time in concert with federal research priorities and  needs. Specifically, the mission of these interagency committees has  evolved to include coordination for research on all hazardous  deployments, including but not limited to the Gulf War. (See fig. 1.)", "Federal research efforts for Gulf War illnesses have been guided by  questions established by the interagency Research Working Group (RWG),  which was initially established under the Persian Gulf Veterans  Coordinating Board (PGVCB) to coordinate federal research efforts.  Between 1995 and 1996, the RWG identified 19 major research questions  related to illnesses in Gulf War veterans. In 1996, the group added 2 more  questions regarding cancer risk and mortality rates to create a set of 21  key research questions that have served as an overarching strategy in  guiding federal research for Gulf War illnesses. (See app. I for the list of  key questions.) The 21 research questions cover the extent of various  health problems, exposures among the veteran population, and the  difference in health problems between Gulf War veterans and control  populations. In 1998, the RWG expanded federal Gulf War illnesses  research priorities to include treatment, longitudinal follow-up of illnesses,  disease prevention, and improved hazard assessment; however, no new  research questions were added to the list of 21 key questions. With regard  to veterans\u2019 health status, the research questions cover the prevalence  among veterans and control populations of    symptoms,    symptom complexes,   illnesses,    altered immune function or host defense,    birth defects,   reproductive problems,    sexual dysfunction,    cancer,    pulmonary symptoms,    neuropsychological or neurological deficits,    psychological symptoms or diagnoses, and    mortality.", "With regard to exposure, the research questions cover    Leishmania tropica (a type of parasite),    petroleum,    petroleum combustion products,    specific occupational/environmental hazards (such as vaccines and    chemical agents,    pyridostigmine bromide (given to troops as a defense against nerve  agents), and    psychophysiological stressors (such as exposure to extremes of human  suffering).", "In 2002, VA established RAC to provide advice to the Secretary of VA on  proposed research relating to the health consequences of military service  in the Gulf War. RAC, which is composed of members of the general  public, including non-VA researchers and veterans\u2019 advocates, was tasked  to assist VA in its research planning by exploring the entire body of Gulf  War illnesses research, identifying gaps in the research, and proposing  potential areas of future research. VA provides an annual budget of about  $400,000 for RAC, which provides salaries for two full-time and one part- time employee and supports committee operating costs. RAC\u2019s employees  include a scientific director and support staff who review published  scientific literature and federal research updates and collect information  from scientists conducting relevant research. RAC\u2019s staff provide research  summaries for discussion and analysis to the advisory committee through  monthly written reports and at regularly scheduled meetings. RAC holds  public meetings several times a year at which scientists present published  and unpublished findings from Gulf War illnesses research. In 2002, RAC  published a report with recommendations to the Secretary of VA.

(See fig. 4.) Fiscal year 2003 research funding was about $20  million less than funding provided in fiscal year 2000.", "This overall decrease in federal funding was paralleled by a change in  federal research priorities, which expanded to include all hazardous  deployments and shifted away from a specific focus on Gulf War illnesses.  VA officials said that although Gulf War illnesses research continues, the  agency is expanding the scope of its research to include the potential long- term health effects in troops who served in hazardous deployments other  than the Gulf War. In October 2002, VA announced plans to commit up to  $20 million for research into Gulf War illnesses and the health effects of  other military deployments. Also in October 2002, VA issued a program  announcement for research on the long-term health effects in veterans  who served in the Gulf War or in other hazardous deployments, such as  Afghanistan and Bosnia/Kosovo. As of April 2004, one new Gulf War  illnesses research project, for $450,000, was funded under this program  announcement.", "Although DOD has historically provided the majority of funding for Gulf  War illnesses research, DOD officials stated that their agency currently has  no plans to continue funding new Gulf War illnesses research projects.  Correspondingly, DOD has not funded any new Gulf War illnesses  research in fiscal year 2004, except as reflected in modest supplements to  complete existing projects and a new award pending for research using  funding from a specific appropriation. DOD also did not include Gulf War  illnesses research funding in its budget proposals for fiscal years 2005 and  2006. DOD officials stated that because the agency is primarily focused on  the needs of the active duty soldier, its interest in funding Gulf War  illnesses research was highest when a large number of Gulf War veterans  remained on active duty after the war\u2014some of whom might develop  unexplained symptoms and syndromes that could affect their active duty  status. In addition, since 2000, DOD\u2019s focus has shifted from research  solely on Gulf War illnesses to research on medical issues of active duty  troops in current or future military deployments. For example, in 2000, VA  and DOD collaborated to develop the Millennium Cohort study, which is a  prospective study evaluating the health of both deployed and nondeployed  military personnel throughout their military careers and after leaving  military service.
