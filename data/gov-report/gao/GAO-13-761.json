This introduces risks to beneficiaries' personal information, as the number may be obtained and used to commit identity theft. Many organizations have replaced SSNs on these types of cards with alternative identifiers. However, the introduction of such a new data element into IT environments can require changes to systems that process and share data. Moreover, previous assessments of CMS's IT environment have found that it consists of many aging, \"stove-piped\" systems that cannot easily share data or be enhanced; thus the agency has ongoing efforts to modernize its environment.", "As requested, GAO studied CMS's efforts related to the removal of SSNs from Medicare cards. GAO's objectives were to (1) assess actions CMS has taken to identify and implement IT solutions for removing SSNs from Medicare cards and (2) determine whether CMS's ongoing IT modernization initiatives could facilitate SSN removal efforts. To do this, GAO reviewed agency documentation and interviewed officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)--which is the agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) responsible for administering Medicare--has not taken needed steps, such as designating a business owner and establishing a business case for an information technology (IT) project, that would result in selecting and implementing a technical solution for removing Social Security numbers (SSN) from Medicare cards. However, the agency has collected information and data as part of its most recent study of SSN removal that could contribute to the identification and development of an IT solution. These include information relevant to examining alternative approaches, identifying costs and risks, and assessing the impact of different approaches on the agency's existing IT systems. For example, the agency identified two approaches for removing the SSN: (1) replacing it with a new identifier, referred to as the Medicare Beneficiary Identifier, and (2) masking the first five digits of the SSN for display on Medicare cards. CMS system and business owners also conducted high-level assessments of the types of changes that would need to be made to systems identified in the agency's IT inventory. For example, system owners estimated the level of complexity of the changes, the number of hours of work at each life-cycle phase, business and technical risks, and the potential to leverage related efforts. CMS noted in its most recent study that replacing the SSN with a new identifier could reduce the risk of identity theft from a lost or stolen card, and actions taken thus far could inform a future IT project to address SSN removal. However, according to CMS officials, agency leadership has not directed them to initiate such a project. Until such a project is undertaken, the agency will not be positioned to identify or implement a solution to support the removal of SSNs from beneficiaries' cards.", "CMS has efforts under way to modernize its IT systems, some of which could be leveraged to facilitate the removal of SSNs from Medicare cards. Specifically, one of CMS's high-level modernization goals is to establish an architecture to support \"shared services\"--IT functions that can be used by multiple organizations and facilitate data sharing. According to agency officials, a service established to automate and manage certain aspects of CMS programs could be used to support a \"crosswalk\" function that would translate the existing claims number to the new beneficiary identifier (and vice versa). This would enable internal systems to receive information containing the new identifier and continue to process data based on the existing number. Another project was intended to consolidate eligibility determination services from four systems, which could reduce the extent of modifications that would have to be made to each of the systems. However, because the agency has not initiated a project for removing SSNs from identification cards, officials have not considered including shared services or other IT initiatives in their modernization activities and related plans to specifically support changes needed as a result of SSN removal. As a result, CMS may miss opportunities to incorporate such a project into ongoing agencywide modernization initiatives that could facilitate efforts to design, develop, and implement an IT solution for SSN removal in a timely and cost-effective manner."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CMS initiate an IT project to develop a solution for SSN removal and incorporate such a project into plans for ongoing IT modernization initiatives.

We compared  activities identified in these documents to department-level requirements  for identifying, developing, and implementing technical solutions for  business processes. We also assessed a sample of the systems that  CMS identified as ones that would be affected by the removal of the SSN  from cards. We based our selection on the level of effort CMS estimated  would be needed to implement modifications and the functionality  provided by the systems. Specifically, we identified 29 systems that we  determined accounted for over 90 percent of the total estimated level of  effort and selected 3 for our assessment\u20141 with a low estimate, 1 with a  high estimate, and 1 that provided critical functionality within the claims  processing IT environment.

This  step was taken, in large part, in response to certain federal and state laws  that place restrictions on entities\u2019 use and disclosure of consumers\u2019  personal information, including SSNs. Examples of federal laws include  the Driver\u2019s Privacy Protection Act, which generally prohibits a state  department of motor vehicles from disclosing or otherwise making  available SSNs and other personal information from a motor vehicle  record, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act  (HIPAA) and its implementing regulations, which protect the privacy of  health information that identifies an individual (including by SSNs) and  restricts health care organizations from disclosing such information to  others without the patient\u2019s consent. Additionally, several state statutes  include provisions related to restricting the display of SSNs, their  unnecessary collection, and their disclosure without the individual\u2019s  consent. Many state agencies have discontinued the use of the numbers  on identification cards and other documents, such as driver\u2019s licenses, to  comply with such laws.

For example, health care providers may reference Medicare  beneficiaries\u2019 printed cards at the point of care to determine eligibility for  the fee-for-service program. Providers may then query a CMS system  using the HICN printed on the card, along with other demographic data, to  obtain information regarding eligibility for specific treatments or services  they intend to deliver, such as glaucoma screening or smoking cessation  counseling. Specifically, the agency provides verification services through  its HIPAA Eligibility Transaction System (HETS), which allows providers  to access real-time data regarding beneficiaries\u2019 eligibility at the point at  which care is scheduled or delivered. Likewise, providers are required by  CMS to use the number when they submit claims to receive payment for  those treatments and services.", "CMS\u2019s and its contractors\u2019 systems also process data based on the HICN  to check for duplicate claims, apply claims and medical policy edits, issue  Medicare Summary Notices, authorize or deny payment of claims, and  conduct printing and mailing operations. For example, CMS\u2019s Medicare  Administrative Contractors, who are responsible for processing and  paying claims, use their own systems to determine whether fee-for- service claims meet certain requirements, such as completeness of data.

The states also provide information regarding Medicaid  beneficiaries for whom their programs pay Medicare Part A or B  premiums. In turn, CMS provides several types of data to the Medicaid  programs based on the HICN, including data needed to coordinate  payment for claims when a beneficiary is covered by multiple insurers and  information on the current drug prescription insurer for beneficiaries who  are covered by Medicare Part D private plans.

The costs of the  IT-related efforts for the two approaches were estimated at about $26  million (10 percent of the $255 million total estimated cost) and $64  million (20 percent of the $317 million total estimated cost), respectively.According to the May 2013 report, the estimates were based on the  assumption that these efforts would span an 18-month period, from  October 2013 to April 2015. According to Office of Information Services  officials, however, these costs and schedules represented high-level  estimates based on the two overall approaches and did not fully reflect  the effort that would be required to implement a specific IT solution.  Furthermore, while the 2013 report noted that one of the two approaches  would better protect beneficiaries\u2019 personal information, the officials said  that the agency did not intend for this study to result in the identification of  an IT solution to address SSN removal.", "CMS officials stated that any initiatives specifically intended to identify an  IT solution to address SSN removal would need to be conducted in  accordance with departmental processes and requirements for managing  the life cycle of IT projects.

The framework requires the following  activities to be completed as part of a project initiation phase before the IT  organization takes subsequent steps to identify technical solutions that  support business needs: designate a business owner to serve as an advocate for the project; identify a business need for which a technological solution is required  and a business case is established; explore alternative concepts and methods to satisfy the need; develop and approve initial project cost, preliminary schedule,  performance baseline, and basic business and technical risks;  conduct a preliminary enterprise architecture review to determine  whether the proposed project potentially duplicates, interferes with,  contradicts, or can leverage another project that already exists or is  proposed, under development, or planned for near-term disposition;  identify significant assumptions and constraints on solutions relative to  that need;  issue a project charter; and  conduct a selection review to determine if the proposed project is  sound, viable, and worthy of funding, support, and inclusion in the  information technology project portfolio.", "However, CMS has not taken a number of the key steps called for by the  IT project life-cycle management guidance to identify an IT solution to  address SSN removal and has not made plans to do so. For example, it  has not completed several steps of a project initiation phase, such as  designating a business owner who would submit a request to the Chief  Information Officer to initiate an IT project. Additionally, the agency has  not established a business case for developing an IT solution to address  SSN removal, issued a project charter, or presented a potential IT project  for SSN removal to an architectural review board for preliminary review  and approval. Furthermore, CMS has not conducted a selection review to  determine if such an IT project should be included in its portfolio of IT  investments.", "Nonetheless, when conducting the 2013 study, agency officials undertook  activities that could address certain steps called for by the agency\u2019s IT  project life-cycle management processes for initiating a project, and that  could provide information needed for identifying and implementing a  technical solution, including the following:", "CMS officials and program stakeholders explored alternative concepts  for addressing the business need, which is one of the steps called for  by agency IT project management guidance. Specifically, from  September 2012 through December 2012, Railroad Retirement Board  and SSA officials participated in work groups with CMS to determine  potential approaches to SSN removal. As a result, they identified two  approaches: (1) replacing the SSN-based HICN with a new identifier  that does not include the SSN, referred to as the Medicare Beneficiary  Identifier; and (2) truncating the first five digits of the SSN for display  on Medicare cards. Agency officials conducting the study ruled out  other options, such as embedding the number in smart cards or  magnetic strips, because they were determined to be too costly,  technically infeasible, or burdensome to providers and beneficiaries.", "Project officials collected information that could be used to develop  initial project costs and identify basic business and technical risks  associated with implementing each approach. Specifically, officials  conducting the 2013 study collected data that could be used for  establishing a technical baseline for cost estimates, such as the level  of effort system owners estimated would be required for each life- cycle phase. Project officials also collected input from system and  business owners regarding technical and business risks associated  with the two approaches. For example, the owners of one of the  shared systems described a risk that unacceptable processing times  would result from the implementation of a mechanism for translating  between the HICN and a new identifier. This information could be  useful in identifying efficient translation mechanisms that would be  less likely to introduce such a risk.", "Agency officials took steps to determine the changes that would have  to be made throughout the agency\u2019s and program stakeholders\u2019 IT  environment. The results of these actions could provide information  essential to conducting a preliminary enterprise architecture review\u2014 another step required for initiating an IT project. Specifically, officials  conducting the 2013 study identified internal and external stakeholder  systems that could be affected if the SSN was removed from cards,  and identified other IT initiatives that could be coordinated with an  SSN removal project. For example, during the 2013 study, CMS  system and functional-level business owners conducted high-level  impact assessments of the two approaches on the agency\u2019s business  processes and all systems identified in its information technology  inventory. Of CMS\u2019s more than 200 systems, these officials  identified 72 systems that could be affected by the introduction of a  new identifier and 41 that would be affected by the second approach  (masking the first 5 digits of the SSN). They conducted high-level  assessments of the types of changes that would need to be made to  those systems, including the level of complexity of the changes, the  number of hours of work at each life-cycle phase, and the potential to  leverage related efforts. Appendix II provides a detailed assessment  of the types of system changes that would have to be made to three  internal CMS systems that provide functionality key to determining  beneficiaries\u2019 eligibility for specific treatments and services, validating  and adjudicating Part A claims, and sharing data for coordination of  benefits payment between Medicare and program stakeholders.", "Agency officials also established assumptions regarding the two  approaches for SSN removal. For example, when collecting data  regarding the impact on its internal systems, system owners were  instructed to assume that a crosswalk service would be available to  translate the HICN to a new identifier, and that the new identifier  would retain the same length as the existing HICN but have a different  format. CMS officials also established assumptions regarding  conditions under which data exchanged with external stakeholders  would include either number.", "CMS collected data from its federal partners to estimate the impact of  the proposed approaches on external systems. For example, officials  conducting the 2013 study collected level-of-effort estimates from  SSA and the Railroad Retirement Board for implementing changes to  their affected systems. Although their estimates varied, the changes  these stakeholder officials described were similar. SSA officials stated  that they would have to make system changes to identify beneficiaries  when they contact SSA and provide the new identifier, instead of the  HICN, to request a new Medicare card. Railroad Retirement Board  officials also stated that they would have to make changes in order to  use the new identifier instead of the HICN when issuing or replacing  retirees\u2019 Medicare cards.", "CMS also involved state program stakeholders and collected high- level estimates of changes that would have to be made to states\u2019  Medicaid systems. Because each state implements IT solutions to  support its unique Medicaid program, the design, implementation, and  level of effort estimated to modify their systems varied widely. For  example, we assessed Medicaid program estimates provided to CMS  by eight states. Of these, three states estimated that less than 500  hours would be needed to make the changes, in part because some  of the systems already convert identifiers. One of these states  reported that no effort would be required since their systems were  already capable of updating records when changes to identifiers are  made. On the other hand, officials with another state Medicaid  program estimated that about 22,000 hours of effort would be needed  to, among other things, expand databases to include a new identifier,  and another estimated that over 58,000 hours would be required to  modify systems to process functions based on a new identifier,  including Medicare buy-in, eligibility determination, and Part D  processing systems. Three other states estimated around 4,000 hours  of work to implement mechanisms to cross reference or convert the  HICN to a new identifier.", "While the data and information collected during the 2013 study could be  leveraged to support a future IT project to address SSN removal,  according to officials with CMS\u2019s Office of Information Services, the  agency\u2019s Chief Information Officer has not received direction from CMS\u2019s  leadership to submit a proposal for an IT project that would lead to the  identification, development, and implementation of a technical solution.  We have noted in prior reports the importance of protecting Medicare  beneficiaries from increased risks of identity theft, and OMB has required  federal agencies to take steps to eliminate unnecessary uses of SSNs.  We have also noted that federal agencies\u2019 Chief Information Officers are  responsible for, among other key IT management areas, information  security along with systems development and integration. Additionally,  CMS has designated the Office of Information Services as the lead for  developing and enforcing the agency\u2019s IT policies, standards, and  practices. As such, these entities should play an active role in pursuing IT  solutions for securing personal data, such as Medicare beneficiaries\u2019  SSNs. The data and information the Office of Information Services  collected during the 2013 study could provide valuable input to future  efforts to define such a solution. Nonetheless, until the agency designates  a business owner, establishes a business case, issues a project charter,  and conducts architectural and IT project selection reviews for SSN  removal, it will lack sufficient information and resources needed to  actively pursue the identification of an IT solution for SSN removal that  best protects beneficiaries\u2019 identities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS Has Initiated Actions Intended to Address Modernization Goals That Could Facilitate SSN Removal but Has Not Made Specific Plans for Leveraging Efforts", "paragraphs": ["CMS has efforts under way to modernize its IT systems, a number of  which could be leveraged to facilitate the removal of SSNs from Medicare  cards. For example, one of the agency\u2019s modernization goals is to  establish IT functionality that can be used to support multiple business  needs of organizations and facilitate data sharing among the agency and  its stakeholders. This and other goals were described by Office of  Information Services officials who indicated that the agency is in the  process of developing an agencywide IT modernization strategy to align  with newly defined business goals.", "A well-defined modernization strategy includes plans for systems that are  integrated into an enterprise\u2019s IT environment and that do not duplicate  other systems\u2019 functionality. By planning accordingly, agencies increase  the likelihood that they will design and develop systems that easily  exchange information with other systems and improve their ability to  modernize systems in a timely and cost-effective manner.", "In this regard, CMS has initiated actions that could eliminate duplicative  programming efforts and help establish standards for integrating new  systems and making the modifications to existing systems needed to  implement an IT solution for SSN removal. For example, CMS officials  with the Office of Information Services described modernization projects  that were initiated to support administrators\u2019 ability to carry out other  programs and that were aligned with the first of the seven stated  modernization goals\u2014to establish an IT architecture capable of  supporting the development and implementation of shared services.  Specifically, the agency established such an architecture to implement  five shared services to support the administration of other agency  programs, including but not limited to, programs established by the  Affordable Care Act. The shared services are", "Enterprise Identity Management, which is planned to enable  individuals to use a single online identity (e.g., user ID) for engaging in  business with CMS that meets all federal security requirements;", "Master Data Management, which is a suite of data records and  services that will allow CMS to link and synchronize beneficiary,  provider, and organization data to multiple disparate sources;", "Enterprise Portal, a central channel for beneficiaries, providers,  organizations, and states to receive CMS information, products, and  services via consistent web pages;", "Business Rules Enterprise Service, which provides a framework for  automating and managing decision logic and routines for CMS  programs (e.g., provider and beneficiary cross check for Accountable  Care Organization programs); and", "Enterprise Eligibility, a consistent and reusable way for business  applications to access beneficiary eligibility data for a variety of uses  (e.g., claims processing, providers and plans, and external programs).", "In implementing these services, the agency has taken some steps that  could help define and put into place the necessary architectural  components and standardized interfaces to enable sharing of the  services\u2019 capabilities across the IT infrastructure and CMS\u2019s business  areas.", "One of the five shared services that CMS implemented, the Business  Rules Enterprise Service could facilitate the implementation of an IT  solution for SSN removal. For example, the IT infrastructure that was  established to implement the service could support the implementation of  a crosswalk service needed by multiple systems to translate a new  identifier to the HICN (and vice versa). By providing this functionality  through a shared service, the crosswalk would be available for use by any  system within CMS\u2019s IT infrastructure and therefore eliminate the need to  duplicate programming efforts for each system to implement such  functionality. Specifically, if such a shared service were implemented to  support an SSN-removal IT project, it would be available for use by all the  systems that, according to CMS officials, would have to be modified to  use a new identifier. As a result, of the 20 systems that the agency  estimated would account for 86 percent of the costs to modify, systems  changes would only have to be developed and tested for one  implementation rather than for 18 of the 20 systems that would need to  perform a crosswalk between a new identifier and the existing HICN.", "In addition to the five shared services described, another shared service,  the Beneficiary Data Streamlining service, was designed to consolidate  into one system the functionality for determining fee-for-service eligibility  that is currently implemented in four different systems (the Common  Working File and the three shared systems). This new service, which is  planned to be implemented in October 2013, would be used by these  systems to eliminate duplicate or unnecessary processing. Consequently,  the implementation of the service could also facilitate SSN removal  efforts. For example, it could reduce the extent of modifications that would  have to be made to the four systems by eliminating the need to make  changes to their current eligibility determination functions to process a  new non-SSN-based identifier. Instead, that capability would be provided  by the new service. As a result, the agency could save unnecessary costs  and efforts associated with duplicative programming changes to the four  affected systems.", "While these projects could offer opportunities for leveraging ongoing  modernization initiatives to facilitate SSN removal, CMS officials stated  that because the agency has not yet established a business case and IT  project for removing SSNs from Medicare cards, they have not included  shared services or other IT initiatives in their modernization activities and  related plans to specifically support changes needed as a result of SSN  removal. Until CMS establishes an IT project for SSN removal that could  be incorporated into ongoing agencywide modernization initiatives, it may  miss opportunities to leverage other ongoing system development  activities that could facilitate efforts to design, develop, and implement an  IT solution in a timely and cost-effective manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["While CMS has spent time and resources over the past 7 years studying  approaches that could be taken toward removing the SSN from Medicare  beneficiaries\u2019 cards, the agency has not actively established and pursued  a goal to identify an IT solution for doing so.

Further, the department stated that it concurred with both of our  recommendations under the condition that certain constraints were  addressed.", "With respect to our first recommendation, HHS agreed that removing the  SSN from Medicare cards is an appropriate step toward reducing the risk  of identity theft, but that the agency could not make a decision to proceed  with such a project without agreement from SSA and the Railroad  Retirement Board. In addition, the department stated that a clear source  of funding for both IT and non-IT activities associated with SSN removal  would need to be identified before proceeding. However, as we noted in  our report, CMS\u2019s Chief Information Officer and the Office of Information  Services should play an active role in pursuing IT solutions for securing  personal data, such as Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 SSNs. For this reason, it is  important that CMS determine the appropriate actions to take toward  initiating an IT project for addressing the removal of SSNs from cards and  guide its stakeholders, such as SSA and the Railroad Retirement Board,  in taking the steps needed to achieve the goals of any SSN removal  project. In addition, the final step of the IT project initiation phase, as  defined by  CMS\u2019s IT life-cycle project management guidance, is a review  to determine if proposed projects are worthy of funding and inclusion in  an IT project portfolio. Accordingly, uncertainties regarding a clear source  of funding should not constrain CMS from taking steps to initiate an IT  project to address SSN removal.", "Regarding our second recommendation, HHS concurred, again with the  caveat that the above-mentioned constraints were addressed. The  department also noted that while CMS had not implemented its shared  services initiative specifically for the purpose of SSN removal, the general  functionality exists in the shared services to support this effort, and this  was reflected in the agency\u2019s 2013 cost estimate. However, unless the  agency considers SSN removal as part of its enterprisewide  modernization initiative, it may miss additional opportunities for leveraging  system changes being made as part of the modernization to support SSN  removal.", "In this regard, we believe that CMS is currently positioned to implement  both our recommendations, regardless of perceived constraints, and to  take the actions needed to initiate an IT project as part of its agencywide  modernization initiative. If such actions are taken CMS could improve  HHS\u2019s ability to protect Medicare beneficiaries against increased risk of  identity theft introduced by the use of SSNs on Medicare cards. HHS also  provided technical comments, which we incorporated into the report as  appropriate.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

We reviewed supporting documents  that were used by project officials to gather information from system and  business owners regarding the impact that two approaches would have  on the agency\u2019s IT systems, including estimates of the levels of effort that  would be needed to implement the changes that would have to be made  to affected systems. We assessed the data from these documents,  referred to as \u201cworkbooks,\u201d to determine the steps agency officials took  that could be used to identify a technical solution for the two approaches\u2013  one to introduce a new identifier that does not include the SSN and  another to mask the first five digits of the SSN in the existing SSN-based  identifier, the Health Insurance Claim Number (HICN). We determined  which activities resulted in outcomes that could be used to initiate actions  towards identifying a specific technical solution by comparing  documented results of CMS\u2019s efforts to requirements defined by CMS\u2019s  processes for managing information technology projects to develop and  implement technical solutions for business processes.", "To better understand the extent of changes that would have to be made  to the systems, we assessed a sample of the systems that the agency  identified as being affected by the removal of the SSN from cards and  replacement with a unique, non-SSN-based number. To select the  systems for our sample, we obtained and analyzed system impact  workbooks for 29 systems that we determined accounted for over 90  percent of the total estimated level of effort needed to modify existing  systems to process the new identifier. Based on our assessment, we  determined that these systems provided adequate examples of the types  of system modifications that would be required to implement a technical  solution for agencywide efforts to remove the SSN from Medicare cards.  Additionally, we focused our analysis of the data included in the  workbooks on the option to replace the SSN-based identifier, the HICN,  on the Medicare card with a new identifier since findings resulting from  our prior assessment of CMS\u2019s 2011 report on SSN removal established  this option as the one most likely to protect beneficiaries\u2019 SSNs and help  prevent identify theft. From the 29 systems, we selected 3\u20141 system  that represented a low level of effort based on the estimated levels of  effort reported by system and business owners in the workbooks, 1 that  represented a high level of effort, and 1 of the shared systems that  performs a critical function\u2014fee-for-service claims processing. To  determine the types of changes that would have to be made to the  systems, we examined technical documents to identify architectural  components, data types, message formats, and interfaces with other  systems that would have to be modified to either translate a new identifier  to the HICN for internal processing, or translate the HICN back to the new  identifier for purposes such as printing notices or new cards. We also held  discussions with owners of the selected systems to confirm our  understanding of the systems and related files and databases, along with  the functionality they provide. In addition, we held discussions with CMS  officials from the agency\u2019s Office of Information Services, including the  Chief Information Officer, regarding actions taken to complete the 2013  study, particularly steps taken to collect information regarding the impact  on CMS\u2019s existing IT systems.", "To further address the first objective, we determined the extent to which  CMS involved stakeholders to estimate the levels of effort that would  have to be made to address the two approaches for removing the SSN  from Medicare cards. To do so, we reviewed documentation that  described the actions CMS took to solicit input from its federal Medicare  and state Medicaid program stakeholders, such as CMS\u2019s most recent  report to Congress and documented results of stakeholders\u2019 assessment  of the impact the SSN removal would have on their systems. We  obtained and analyzed such documentation from the Social Security  Administration and the Railroad Retirement Board, CMS\u2019s two federal  program stakeholders. To select states for our study, we examined  documents that were provided by 49 states and the District of Columbia in  response to CMS\u2019s request for data related to the system changes that  would have to be made. We then calculated the median level of effort  estimated and selected states whose estimates represented high,  medium, and low levels of effort. Specifically, we identified the 3 states  that estimated the highest level of effort, 4 states that estimated a  medium (or closest to the median) level of effort, and the 3 that estimated  the lowest level of effort. Of the 10 that we selected, we received  responses from 8\u2014the 3 lowest, 3 of the medium, and 2 of the highest  estimators. We assessed the data they provided to CMS and collected  additional data by conducting semistructured interviews or through written  responses to a standard set of questions. While we could not generalize  the information we collected from the 8 states to reflect the level of  participation by all 49 states and the District of Columbia, the views  obtained from these state officials offered insights into the extent to which  CMS involved its program stakeholders in assessing approaches for  removing SSNs.
