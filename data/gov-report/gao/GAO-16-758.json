GAO analyzed HUD's fiscal year 2014 data (the latest available) on Section 202 properties and service coordinators; surveyed a generalizable sample of Section 202 properties not identifiable in HUD data as having service coordinators; reviewed monitoring policies, program descriptions, and agency notices; and interviewed HUD officials from each of HUD's five Multifamily Housing regions and stakeholders."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While limitations in the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) data make an accurate assessment difficult, GAO estimates that roughly half of the 7,229 Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly (Section 202) properties have HUD-funded service coordinators\u2014staff who link residents to supportive services such as transportation assistance or meals. HUD's data indicate that 38 percent of Section 202 properties have a HUD-funded service coordinator, but these data likely underestimate the true number. GAO surveyed a generalizable sample of Section 202 properties not identifiable in HUD's data as having a service coordinator and, on this basis, estimates that an additional 12 percent of Section 202 properties actually had one\u2014bringing the actual total of Section 202 properties with service coordinators to about 50 percent. Federal internal control standards note that it is important for management to obtain relevant data from reliable sources. Properties with service coordinators are subject to additional monitoring, but without accurate information, HUD risks not taking steps to monitor Section 202 properties with service coordinators to help ensure they are connecting residents to supportive services.", "Properties without service coordinators connect residents to services in a variety of ways\u2014for example, property managers may serve this function themselves, or they may utilize other local organizations. Several stakeholders told GAO that property managers are well-positioned to know their residents, and have some insight into their needs. Others noted that property managers generally lack the time and expertise to effectively manage this responsibility, and that the manager's role can conflict with that of the service coordinator. Through GAO's survey and site visits, managers of Section 202 properties without service coordinators cited a variety of reasons for not employing them, including lack of funding and having too few units to justify hiring someone to focus on supportive services for the elderly residents.", "HUD requires its staff to monitor Section 202 properties' adherence to program requirements. However, HUD lacks written policies and procedures that describe how its staff should monitor the requirement for Section 202 property managers to coordinate the provision of supportive services. Available guidance describes general monitoring procedures for multifamily properties but does not address Section 202 specifically. HUD officials told GAO they plan to develop guidance on monitoring Section 202 properties with service coordinator grants by December 2016. Federal internal control standards note the importance of documenting responsibilities through policies. Without written policies and procedures, HUD cannot be assured that elderly residents are receiving assistance obtaining services. In addition, HUD collects performance data, such as the number of services provided, from Section 202 properties that have service coordinators but does not have policies or procedures in place to verify the accuracy of the data or for analyzing the data collected. Federal internal control standards also note the importance of evaluating data for reliability and processing data into quality information to evaluate performance. Until HUD takes steps to assess service coordinator performance data for reliability and analyze the data reported, its ability to use that information to monitor whether service coordinators are performing effectively and helping to fulfill the goals of the Section 202 program will likely be limited."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that HUD (1) improve the accuracy of its data on Section 202 properties with service coordinators, (2) develop written guidance on assessing compliance with supportive services requirements, and (3) develop procedures for verifying and analyzing performance data.

The  purpose of the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s (HUD)  Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly (Section 202) program is  to provide funding for the development and operation of supportive  housing for very low-income elderly households. Supportive housing for  the elderly is designed to meet the special physical needs of elderly  persons and to accommodate the provision of supportive services.  Under the Section 202 program, property owners are expected to help  connect residents to services that will help them to live independently and  age in place. One approach that Section 202 property owners use is to  employ a service coordinator\u2014someone who assists residents by linking  them to community-based services (such as meal programs, in-home  care, and transportation) based on their individual needs. In fiscal year  2016, Congress provided approximately $433 million for the renewal of  support for existing Section 202 units and up to $77 million to renew grant  funding for service coordinators.

Program monitoring is generally conducted by HUD staff located  in field office locations. During the course of our review, HUD was in the  process of reorganizing its Office of Multifamily Housing. Specifically,  HUD was consolidating field operations from its existing structure into  regional centers and other office types across five regions. As of the  end of fiscal year 2014, there were 7,229 active Section 202 properties  across the country, with over 366,000 units, as shown in figure 1."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Program History", "paragraphs": ["The type of financing offered through the Section 202 program has  changed over time. At the program\u2019s inception, HUD made direct loans to  private nonprofit organizations so they could build rental housing. The  interest rates were low (around 3 percent), and the loans had a term of up  to 50 years. In 1991, the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing  Act replaced loans with capital advances. Capital advances bear no  interest, and the amount of the capital advances is based on an area\u2019s  development cost limits. Repayment of the capital advance is not  required as long as the housing remains available for occupancy for very  low-income elderly persons for at least 40 years. Capital advances must  be used for the construction or rehabilitation of a structure, or acquisition  of a structure with or without rehabilitation. As discussed later in this  report, Congress last provided funding for new Section 202 developments  in fiscal year 2011.", "Rental assistance programs available to be used at Section 202  properties and their contract terms have also changed since the  program\u2019s inception. For example, the Housing and Community  Development Act of 1974 made project-based Section 8 rental assistance  available to Section 202 property owners. Owners could then subsidize  the rents of low-income households and, beginning in 1981, project- based Section 8 rental assistance was available primarily to very low- income households. Contracts for project-based Section 8 rental  assistance payments between HUD and Section 202 owners were initially  set for up to 20 years and were renewable. In 1991, the Cranston- Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act introduced a different form of  rental assistance referred to as project rental assistance. The duration of  project rental assistance contracts was initially 20 years and is currently 3  years. As the initial contracts begin to expire, the rental assistance is  renewed on a 1-year basis.", "Section 202 property owners have varying business agreements with  HUD, depending on factors including when their property came into the  program and whether they have prepaid or refinanced direct loans. For  example, Section 202 property owners are required by HUD to enter into  a Use Agreement when they prepay a loan for which HUD\u2019s consent to  prepay is required. The Use Agreement binds all subsequent owners to  continue to operate the property for at least 20 years after the maturity  date of the original loan, under terms at least as advantageous to existing  and future tenants as the terms required by the original loan agreement or  any project-based rental assistance payments contract. Property owners  that prepaid or refinanced their direct loan and that do not have rental  assistance contracts are referred to by HUD as \u201cstand-alone\u201d Section 202  properties. These properties are contractually bound by their Section  202 Use Agreement to continue to operate under terms at least as  advantageous to existing and future tenants as the terms required by the  original loan agreement.", "According to HUD officials, property owners that received a capital  advance must enter into both a Use Agreement and a Regulatory  Agreement. The Use Agreement for Section 202 properties that received  a capital advance requires the property to meet the terms of the Section  202 program for at least 40 years. The Regulatory Agreement sets out  various obligations, restrictions, and requirements on the owner beyond  those set forth in the Use Agreement.", "The eligible resident population for the Section 202 program has also  changed over time. When the Section 202 program was established in  1959, its purpose was to provide housing for moderate-income elderly  households. Non-elderly persons with disabilities became eligible for the  program in 1964 when non-elderly disabled individuals and families were  added to HUD\u2019s definition of \u201celderly families.\u201d In 1968, HUD set income  eligibility limits for Section 202 developments, limiting new households to  those that were low income. Resident income guidelines changed in 1981  for Section 202 properties that received project-based rental assistance.  The law required that HUD units receiving project-based Section 8 rental  assistance be made available primarily to very low-income households. In  1990 the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act established  HUD\u2019s Section 811 program.

Although the Housing Act of 1959 did not  explicitly mention supportive services, HUD officials told us that Section  202 properties have been required to connect residents to services for the  entire history of the program. The Housing and Community Development  Act of 1974 established a requirement that HUD seek to assure that  Section 202 developments be in support of and supported by state and  local plans which respond to federal program requirements by providing a  range of services such as health, welfare, counseling, referral services,  and services designed to encourage and assist tenants to use the  services and facilities available to them. Applicants for Section 202  funds must submit plans describing how the property\u2019s residents would be  connected to supportive services and HUD must ensure that housing  assisted under the Section 202 program provides a range of services  tailored to the needs of the elderly persons occupying such housing.  Owners must have the managerial capacity to assess the service needs  of the residents and coordinate the provision of supportive services and  tailor the services to the individual needs of the residents. The cost of  providing services and employing a service coordinator is an eligible  project rental assistance cost under the Section 202 program.", "Service coordinators in HUD-assisted developments for elderly persons  and persons with disabilities work with residents to provide a wide range  of services. According to HUD\u2019s most recent funding notice for the service  coordinator grant program, a service coordinator is responsible for  ensuring that elderly residents, especially those who are at-risk or frail,  and non-elderly residents with disabilities are linked to the supportive  services they need to continue living independently in their current  homes. An at-risk elderly person means an individual 62 years of age or  older who is unable to perform one or two activities of daily living, and a  frail elderly person means an individual 62 years of age or older who is  unable to perform at least three activities of daily living.", "Service coordinators can be funded through HUD\u2019s Multifamily Housing  Service Coordinator grant program. Owners of eligible properties may  apply for funds through HUD\u2019s grant process. For a development to  qualify, at least 25 percent of its residents must be considered frail  elderly, at-risk elderly, or disabled non-elderly. Applicants must show  that they have no other funds available to pay for a service coordinator.  Grants are made for an initial 3-year term and are renewable. Grants  provide funding for the salary, benefits, and related administrative costs  associated with employing a service coordinator. Service coordinators  funded with grant funds cannot organize activities that are unrelated to  supportive services or provide supportive services directly.", "Service coordinators for Section 202 properties can also be funded  through the property\u2019s operating budget with HUD approval. HUD  officials refer to these as budget-based service coordinators. For  example, owners of Section 202 properties can include the service  coordinator position in the development\u2019s operating budget, where the  position is supported by rental assistance under a project rental  assistance contract or project-based Section 8 contract. Also, in cases  where properties accrue a rental subsidy that is not needed to pay  operating costs (residual receipts), the monies must be spent on activities  that will benefit the property and the residents, which can include a  service coordinator. In addition, Section 202 property owners that prepay  or refinance a direct loan and subsequently have a debt service savings  can use the additional cash flow to fund a service coordinator.

According to HUD  officials, managers of Section 202 properties must submit budget  requests annually, including requests to use HUD funds for service  coordinators, to appropriate HUD field staff for review and approval.  According to HUD staff, generally a property\u2019s first request for service  coordinator funding should be made using a specific HUD form, and a  version of this same form should be submitted in subsequent years as  well. HUD staff told us that upon receiving requests to use HUD funds to  pay for a service coordinator, field staff are supposed to record the  approved source of HUD funding in HUD\u2019s centralized real estate  management database. According to HUD headquarters officials, if field  staff do not record the use of HUD funds for service coordinators in  HUD\u2019s database, then HUD\u2019s data will be inaccurate.", "In July 2016 HUD finalized guidance for field office staff on collecting and  recording information on the presence and source of HUD funding for  service coordinators, including service coordinators at Section 202  properties.

As discussed more fully later in this report, HUD employs  additional monitoring and oversight procedures at properties with HUD- funded service coordinators for the specific purpose of helping to ensure  that these service coordinators are effectively linking residents to  supportive services, in keeping with the goals of the Section 202 program.

We also identified common reasons why Section 202 properties may not  have service coordinators, such as insufficient funding."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Properties without Coordinators Rely on a Variety of Means to Connect Residents to Services", "paragraphs": ["The most commonly cited alternative approach to connecting Section 202  residents to services was to have the on-site property manager share  information with residents. We estimate that about 77 percent of  properties that did not have a HUD-funded service coordinator used this  approach. Besides working with residents to understand their needs and  to identify relevant community-based services, as a service coordinator  would, the property manager can also (or instead) supply written  materials. These materials (collected into binders or posted onto bulletin  boards, for example) provide descriptions of locally available services,  along with contact information. An estimated 47 percent of properties that  did not have a HUD-funded service coordinator provided an on-site  booklet or other written materials on local services.", "Section 202 property managers, agency officials, and other stakeholders  identified benefits and limitations of this alternative approach. For  example, several of these stakeholders told us that property managers  are well-positioned to know their residents, and have some insight into  their needs. However, other stakeholders told us that having property  managers assist residents with supportive services has at least two  limitations. First, on-site managers do not necessarily have the time or  expertise to effectively address residents\u2019 supportive service needs.  Second, some property managers and agency officials told us that there  is a certain degree of tension between the roles of property manager and  service coordinator. For example, one property manager told us that  because property managers are responsible for lease compliance and  evictions, it would not make sense for them to assist residents with  services while also trying to evict them. Further, while providing on-site  written materials is an inexpensive way of making some residents aware  of local services, some stakeholders noted that residents may need help  reading and interpreting written information. Also, some stakeholders  reported that they serve residents who do not read English, and thus  written materials need to be translated.", "A second commonly cited alternative was for Section 202 properties to  work with Area Agencies on Aging or other local resources, which can  coordinate services for residents. We estimate that about 54 percent of  properties that did not have a HUD-funded service coordinator used this  approach. Area Agencies on Aging are public or private nonprofit  agencies that are designated by the state to address the needs and  concerns of all older persons at the regional and local levels.  They  coordinate and offer services that help older adults remain in their homes,  if that is their preference, aided by services that make independent living  a viable option. Besides Area Agencies on Aging, Section 202 properties  can also partner with other local organizations to connect residents to  services. For example, the on-site property manager at one Section 202  property we visited described partnering with organizations as diverse as  Adult Protective Services, local food pantries, and affordable  transportation services.", "Relying on Area Agencies on Aging or other local resources to connect  Section 202 residents to supportive services also has benefits and  limitations, according to property managers and other stakeholders with  whom we met. Some Section 202 property managers told us that Area  Agencies on Aging can coordinate services for residents. These services  would not have a cost to the property. Further, the staffs at Area Agencies  on Aging contract with local service providers to deliver many direct  services, such as meals, transportation, and in-home services. However,  some property managers also identified several limitations to this  approach. First, these resources are not available (or not conveniently  available) to all Section 202 properties. Second, these resources have  limited funding, thus are limited in the assistance that they can provide.  Finally, even when they do have sufficient available staff, not being  located on-site poses disadvantages. Moreover, because they are not  visible to residents on a daily or recurring basis, they are less able to build  trust and rapport with residents, compared to on-site service coordinators.", "A third approach we identified through our site visits and our discussions  with industry groups was for eligible residents to access services through  various Medicaid-funded programs. At 7 of the 15 Section 202  properties we interviewed, property managers told us that some or all of  the residents were assisted through either case managers, home-health  or personal care aides, or other service organizations funded by  Medicaid. Depending on how a state has structured its provision of  Medicaid home- and community-based services, a combination of  standard medical and nonmedical services may be available to eligible  individuals\u2014including, but not limited to, case management,  homemakers, home health aides, personal care aides, and adult day  health services. However, most properties that cited this alternative  approach\u2014five out of seven\u2014serve disabled adults (which could include  elderly residents). The managers of these properties generally stated that  their property did not employ a service coordinator because their  residents\u2019 needs were served by Medicaid-funded programs.", "Stakeholders with whom we spoke described benefits of the availability of  home- and community-based services funded by Medicaid programs, but  cited eligibility requirements and Medicaid funding being based on the  individual (rather than on the place) as limitations of this approach to  helping residents of Section 202 properties. For example, some  stakeholders told us that personal care attendants can come to residents\u2019  homes and assist them with personal care needs\u2014including bathing,  shopping, cleaning, and medical management\u2014and that home health  aides may provide medical services to residents who are unable to travel  to a physician. One Section 202 property manager told us that, because  of their expertise, these types of attendants and aides are better suited to  working with disabled residents, including disabled elderly residents, than  are service coordinators. Several property managers explained, however,  that only eligible individuals can benefit from Medicaid-funded care, which  limits its utility as an alternative to property-based service coordinators  who can serve everyone.", "An additional approach that various stakeholders identified as a potential  alternative to service coordinators is a specific Medicare and Medicaid  program known as Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE).  Like the Medicaid home- and community-based services program, PACE  helps the elderly meet their health care needs in the community instead of  going to a nursing home or other care facility. However, PACE programs  also provide a range of integrated preventive, acute care, and long-term  care services to help manage the medical, functional, and social needs of  the frail elderly. PACE organizations provide care and services to  individuals who are eligible for Medicare or Medicaid, or both, in their  homes, the community, and at PACE centers. Many PACE participants  get most of their care from staff employed by the PACE organization in  the PACE center. Residents of Section 202 properties who are PACE  participants would thus be able to coordinate their supportive service  needs without the assistance of a service coordinator.", "Stakeholders likewise cited benefits and limitations to the use of PACE.  Staff from an industry group explained that, unlike service coordinators,  PACE centers can supply an all-encompassing range of services to  PACE participants directly. Furthermore, a property manager noted that  PACE centers have a social component, essentially serving as a club  where elderly people can go. However, stakeholders also explained that  not all elderly residents would be eligible for PACE. To be eligible to  participate in PACE, an individual must need a nursing-home level of care  (as certified by that individual\u2019s state) and live in a PACE organization  service area. Not all states offer PACE under Medicaid.

Specifically, for an  estimated 48 percent of properties that did not have a service coordinator  in fiscal year 2014, the availability of local resources, such as Area  Agencies on Aging, was a reason why the property did not employ a  service coordinator. During our site visits, some property managers  explained that a service coordinator was not needed because residents  received services (e.g., case management) through other programs,  including Medicaid. For example, a Section 202 property we visited in  Chicago that serves individuals with severe and persistent mental  illnesses (some of whom are elderly) is operated by a mental health  services provider that provides services directly to residents. This  provider is reimbursed by Medicaid. Also, at a property we visited near  Los Angeles that serves developmentally disabled adults, some of whom  are elderly, residents are required to spend 56 hours per week at a center  that provides federally-funded supportive services. Managers of other  properties we visited told us that some residents are assisted by home- health aides that come directly to their unit to help them with activities of  daily living. While some property managers with whom we met did not  know how their aides were funded, they thought such persons were  funded through Medicaid.", "Finally, nearly half of the Section 202 property managers that we  surveyed reported that they did not employ a service coordinator due to  the property\u2019s small size. Specifically, we estimate that of the properties  that did not have a service coordinator in fiscal year 2014, 49 percent did  not have one because of the small number of units at the property.  Property managers and an owner with whom we met told us that when a  property has a small number of units, it may not be cost-effective to  employ a full-time service coordinator. For example, the owner of a 19- unit property told us that the property manager was able to assist all the  residents with their service-related needs and that hiring a full-time  service coordinator would not be cost-effective. Furthermore, for  properties with fewer than 25 units, we estimated that 23 percent of these  properties would want a service coordinator, even if funding were  available for one."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "HUD Lacks Guidance on Monitoring Supportive Services Requirements and Does Not Analyze Performance Data", "paragraphs": ["HUD requires its staff to monitor Section 202 properties\u2019 adherence to  program requirements but does not have written guidance for staff with  monitoring responsibilities on the level and type of activity a Section 202  property must perform to demonstrate meeting the program\u2019s requirement  to help residents obtain supportive services.

These staff stated that field staff should identify  the stand-alone properties in their geographic area of responsibility and  conduct risk assessments of these properties, consistent with the  agency\u2019s procedures for its multifamily programs. According to HUD,  stand-alone Section 202 properties are generally required to annually  self-certify their compliance with the Section 202 program, including the  supportive services requirement, and provide this information to their  appropriate field office. Field staff are also responsible for collecting the  self-certifications and logging their receipt in a HUD information system,  according to HUD headquarters officials.

For Section 202 properties that receive funding from HUD in the  form of a direct loan, capital advance, or rental assistance, HUD staff (or  contractors) are to periodically conduct management and occupancy  reviews.

For example, HUD field staff  review semiannual performance reports to verify that individual service  coordinators are linking the residents of specific Section 202 properties to  services. Semiannual performance reports, which HUD requires from  Section 202 properties with HUD-funded service coordinators, are  prepared by service coordinators, and include both outputs and  outcomes.

For example, HUD may  renew grants based on the grantee\u2019s acceptable performance, and will  use semiannual performance reports to inform this decision. According to  HUD officials, the agency uses semiannual performance reports as a part  of its process for assessing requests for grant renewals. HUD officials told  us that they receive around 1,100 renewal requests each year and that  none have been denied as a result of semiannual performance report  information. According to HUD staff, if the agency has concerns about a  Section 202 property\u2019s performance, HUD staff would take steps to work  with the owner to address them.", "In addition to the semiannual performance reports, properties with HUD- funded service coordinators are to provide assurance that the service  coordination function is effectively implemented. According to HUD  guidance, property managers can use assessments of the quality of the  service coordinator\u2019s work to provide this assurance. Quality assurance  assessments are an allowable administrative expense, not to exceed 10  percent of the service coordinator\u2019s salary, and are to be conducted by a  qualified third party. For Section 202 properties with grant-funded service  coordinators, grant funds can be used to pay for the assessment.

At the outset of our review, HUD  officials told us that they did not have an information system to collect this  information but that the performance data would be more useful if they  were aggregated. They also noted that it would be cost-prohibitive for the  agency to revise an existing information system to accommodate  performance data from the semiannual performance report. During the  course of our review, HUD began taking steps that would enable it to  electronically extract data from semiannual performance reports and put  them into a spreadsheet. The Office of Management and Budget  approved a change to information collection procedures for the  semiannual performance report in November 2015. This change required  service coordinators to submit the report using a fillable format, a feature  which would enable HUD to extract performance data. According to Office  of Management and Budget documentation, semiannual performance  reports had to be submitted to HUD in the fillable format for the reporting  period of October 1, 2015, through March 31, 2016. In July 2016 HUD  officials provided us with a spreadsheet of performance data they had  downloaded for this performance period. In providing the data, HUD  noted that the data are still in a preliminary and raw form and may have  quality issues. We requested documentation of HUD\u2019s plans for analyzing  the data.

Nevertheless, the lack of public sector funding for capital  improvements is a challenge because many properties are old and need  physical improvements. Refinancing offers owners a way of accessing  funds to make improvements to properties, which may be deteriorating or  in need of modernization, so that they can continue to provide affordable  housing. In order to prepay a loan and refinance a Section 202 property,  property owners generally must obtain HUD approval.", "HUD has published guidance that outlines the requirements Section 202  direct loan prepayments must meet in order to receive this approval.  Beyond extending the physically useful life of a Section 202 property,  refinancing also offers a means of lengthening properties\u2019 obligations to  serve their target populations under the terms of the Section 202  program. As a condition of securing HUD\u2019s approval to refinance, owners  of direct loan properties sign a Use Agreement, which, as previously  discussed, obligates the property to maintain the affordability terms of the  original loan and any existing project-based rental assistance contract for  a period of at least 20 years beyond the loan\u2019s original maturation date.", "Section 202 properties can be refinanced in a number of ways. For  example, owners can borrow from a conventional lender and use the loan  proceeds to pay off their original HUD loan and also to finance needed  capital repairs. HUD helps to encourage this practice by working with  approved lenders to make available mortgage insurance for the  refinancing and substantial rehabilitation of Section 202 properties  through the Section 221(d)(4) program. Section 202 owners can also  finance capital repairs through low-income housing tax credits (LIHTC).  LIHTCs are competitively awarded by state-level housing finance  agencies, and they allow awardees\u2014for example, Section 202 owners  planning to make substantial rehabilitations on their properties\u2014to attract  equity investment to their properties by selling ownership interests to  parties interested in using the tax credits. As with refinancing performed  via conventional lenders, HUD helps to encourage LIHTC-based  refinancing by providing certain flexibilities for using HUD mortgage  insurance products to insure transactions that use LIHTCs. For example,  HUD streamlined its procedures for processing HUD\u2019s multifamily  mortgage insurance applications involving LIHTCs. As part of this effort,  HUD made program changes that reduce up-front and overall transaction  costs.", "HUD has used Senior Preservation Rental Assistance Contracts as a tool  to assist some Section 202 properties in refinancing.

HUD made its first  award of these contracts in 2013, providing $14.8 million to preserve  rental assistance in 12 Section 202 properties.

We conducted pretests by telephone  with five Section 202 property managers (one in each of HUD\u2019s five  Multifamily Housing regions). On the basis of survey specialist input  and these pretests, we made revisions to questionnaire drafts as  necessary to reduce the likelihood of measurement and nonresponse  errors (the types of nonresponse associated with the perceived  burden, lack of question clarity, or relevance to the respondent). In  addition, our analysts answered respondent questions and resolved  difficulties that respondents had in completing our questionnaire. We  asked open-ended comment questions at various points in the  questionnaire to allow respondents to explain or provide context for  their answers, which helped inform and corroborate our interpretation  and analysis of the survey results.", "Nonresponse error. Nonresponse error can result from failing to  collect information on some or all questions from those sampled. To  minimize the possibility of nonresponse error, we made multiple  follow-up contacts with nonrespondents throughout data collection to  reduce nonresponse. We performed nonresponse bias analyses to  determine whether those not responding may have answered in a  fundamentally different way on key questions we asked. Specifically,  we compared response rates across strata definitions and examined  the accuracy of estimates of the population by property size. We  observed similar response rates within each of the strata and found  no statistically significant differences in weighted estimates of property  size when compared to the sample frame. Based on this analysis we  found no evidence of significant nonresponse bias in the results.", "Data processing error. Data processing error can result from faulty  or incomplete recording of survey responses, or from improperly  designed analysis of the survey results once collected. To minimize  the possibility of data processing error, a second data analyst  independently verified the accuracy of all computer analyses. In  addition, Section 202 property managers made their responses  directly into an automated web survey instrument, preventing errors  associated with manual data entry of written answers.
