The 2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act requires NARA to submit an expenditure plan for ERA to congressional appropriation committees. GAO's objectives were to (1) determine whether NARA's fiscal year 2009 plan meets the legislative conditions set forth in the 2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act, (2) provide an update on NARA's progress in implementing recommendations made in GAO's review of NARA's 2008 expenditure plan, and (3) provide any other observations about the expenditure plan and the ERA acquisition. To do this, GAO reviewed the expenditure plan, interviewed NARA officials, and reviewed program data and documentation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["NARA's fiscal year 2009 expenditure plan satisfies the six legislative conditions in the 2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act. NARA implemented one of GAO's prior recommendations and partially implemented the other. Specifically, NARA developed a risk mitigation plan for the EOP system in the event that it was not ready in time for the presidential transition in January 2009. In addition, NARA began including summaries of performance against ERA cost and schedule estimates in its monthly reports to Congress. However, during its review, GAO found methodological weaknesses that could limit NARA's ability to accurately report on program cost, schedule, and performance. GAO made four observations on NARA's expenditure plan and the ERA acquisition: (1) The expenditure plan does not specifically identify whether completed system increments include all planned functionality or what functionality will be included in future increments, including the outcomes NARA expects from the remainder of its fiscal year 2009 funding. Until NARA fully describes the outcomes expected from this funding, Congress will lack important information for evaluating the agency's requests for funds. (2) The expenditure plan states that it relies on Earned Value Management (EVM), a tool for project management intended to provide objective reports of program status. However, NARA is not fully implementing practices necessary to make effective use of EVM, limiting the reliability of its progress reports. Without consistently following these best practices, NARA will be hindered in accurately monitoring and reporting on the cost, schedule, and performance of the ERA system. (3) Although NARA certified initial operating capability for the EOP system in December 2008, less than 3 percent of the electronic records from the Bush Administration had been ingested into the system at the time of GAO's review, and NARA did not expect the remainder to be ingested until October 2009. In the interim, NARA is using systems developed in accordance with its risk mitigation plan to support the search, processing, and retrieval of presidential records. These systems cost less than $600,000, compared with the $40 million NARA has obligated for the EOP system. Until NARA completely ingests the Bush Administration records into EOP, it will be unable to use the system for its intended purpose. (4) NARA lacks a contingency plan for the ERA system in the event of a failure or disruption. While NARA identified 11 security weaknesses related to contingency planning during system testing and planned actions to address them, it has completed only 1 of the 11 planned actions. Further, NARA does not have a fully functional backup and restore process for ERA, a key component for ensuring system availability. Until NARA fully develops and tests a contingency plan, it risks prolonged unavailability of the ERA system in the event of a failure or disruption."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since 2001, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has  been developing an Electronic Records Archive (ERA) to preserve and  provide access to massive volumes of electronic records independent of  their original hardware or software.

The plan does not  specifically identify whether completed increments included all  previously planned functionality or what functionality will be provided  in future increments. For example, the plan does not specify what  outcomes NARA expects to achieve with the remainder of its fiscal  year 2009 funding. NARA officials attributed the plan\u2019s lack of  specificity to ongoing negotiations with its contractor.

NARA officials estimated that  the records would not be fully ingested until October 2009. Agency  officials attributed delays in part to unexpected difficulties, such as  data not being extracted in expected formats and incomplete  replication of one type of data. In the interim, NARA is primarily  supporting search, processing, and retrieval of presidential records  using the replicated systems described in the risk mitigation plan that  we recommended the agency develop last year, which cost less than  $600,000 to put in place, compared to the nearly $40 million NARA has  obligated for EOP.

She stated that she was pleased to note our recognition that  the Fiscal Year 2009 ERA Expenditure Plan met the legislative conditions.  In addition, the Acting Archivist summarized actions taken or planned in  response to four of our five recommendations. Specifically, she stated that  NARA provided a briefing to Congress on the specific outcomes to be  achieved by the ERA program on April 27, 2009, and that further detail will  be added to the next expenditure plan to address costs and functions  delivered to date and what is planned for future increments. She further  stated that NARA is in the process of upgrading its EVM system and will  strive to comply with all 13 best practices. Finally, the Acting Archivist  stated that an ERA Contingency Plan has been developed and is in final  review.", "The Acting Archivist disagreed with our observation that the EOP system  is not currently fulfilling its intended purpose. She stated that this  observation failed to differentiate between what the system is capable of  doing and the work currently being done on the system. She added that  the system does provide required functionality\u2014including searching any  records ingested in the system\u2014and that all the remaining data from the  Bush Administration will be ingested by the end of the fiscal year. The  Acting Archivist also stated that the problem was with the copies of the  records that NARA received from the White House, not with the EOP  system, and that the data issues have been resolved. We disagree with the  Acting Archivist\u2019s statements because the EOP system still lacks the  capability to search and retrieve all Bush Administration records in  NARA\u2019s possession. Specifically, as we reported in our briefing, NARA  used the EOP system to satisfy one request for presidential records during  the first 3 months of the transition, but used the less expensive replicated  systems to answer another 24 requests. In addition, before the transition,  NARA estimated that it would not complete ingesting data until May 2009,  limiting the capability of the system in the transition\u2019s early months  regardless of the replication errors that ultimately occurred. Finally, the  Acting Archivist\u2019s estimate that the Bush data will not be fully ingested  until the end of the fiscal year further highlights the fact that NARA still  possesses Bush Administration electronic records that cannot be searched  using EOP. Until all the Bush Administration records are ingested, the  EOP system will not be performing its stated function.", "Regarding our recommendation that NARA include in its next expenditure  plan an analysis of the costs and benefits of using the EOP system to  respond to presidential records requests compared to the systems  currently being used, the Acting Archivist stated that it did not seem cost- effective to conduct a retrospective analysis as to whether there might  have been technology solutions for systems that have already been retired.  However, NARA has not yet provided evidence that the mitigation plan  systems have been retired. In addition, we are not recommending a study  of past alternatives, but a study of the ongoing costs and benefits of using  the EOP system compared with the technology used under NARA\u2019s risk  mitigation plan. This would provide the agency with useful information in  planning future spending, given that NARA was able to respond to  requests for Bush Administration records using systems costing  significantly less than what has been spent to date on the EOP system.  Such an analysis could also inform the contingency plan the Acting  Archivist said is being finalized in response to our recommendation.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Archivist of the United States.

In lab tests, the restore process took about 56  hours for 11 million files. This is significant because, while the backup is being  performed, the replication of data must be stopped; otherwise it could bring the system to  a halt.

Further, the ingest of presidential records into the system  required the use of additional software tools and is now scheduled to take 5 months  longer than NARA estimated before the transition, even though NARA received a  significantly lower volume of records than anticipated. The Acting Archivist also wrote that  EOP supports functions other than the search of presidential records, such as the  lifecycle management of presidential records, and that comparisons between the  replicated systems and EOP are not valid. While we acknowledge that EOP was  designed to perform functions other than search, we disagree that a comparison between  EOP and other systems would not be valid. Instead, we believe that an appropriate  analysis of the costs and benefits of using the various systems should account for the  need to satisfy non-search requirements, such as lifecycle management of records, using  systems other than EOP.", "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation  Finally, the Acting Archivist wrote that the replicated systems were being used for a small  subset of records.
