At the federal level, the program is administered by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services. Within broad federal guidelines, each state designs and administers its own Medicaid program, which HCFA must approve for compliance with current law and regulations. HCFA is also responsible for providing program guidance and oversight to the state programs. Nationwide, Medicaid served approximately 34 million low-income people in fiscal year 1994, with combined federal and state expenditures of $143 billion.", "California established its Medicaid program, named Medi-Cal, in 1965. The cost of the Medi-Cal program was estimated to be about $15 billion in federal and state funds in fiscal year 1994, serving about 5.4 million people. The California Department of Health Services (DHS) is the agency responsible for administering the Medi-Cal program. It determines policy, establishes fiscal and management controls, contracts with managed care health plans, and reviews program activities.", "California has over 20 years of experience with Medi-Cal managed care programs. DHS began contracting with Prepaid Health Plan (PHP) pilot projects in 1968. Abuses and scandals plagued the early years of PHP contracting, resulting in beneficiaries being denied access to care. This led the California legislature to pass the Waxman-Duffy Prepaid Health Plan Act in 1972, which established standards for California Medicaid PHP contracts and for program administration. Controls have been continually strengthened over the years through amendments to the Waxman-Duffy Act. The Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975 gave the California Department of Corporations authority to license and regulate fully capitated PHPs in the state. One Waxman-Duffy amendment made Knox-Keene licensure a prerequisite to obtaining a Medi-Cal PHP contract. With the advent of the Waxman-Duffy and Knox-Keene acts, the majority of then-contracting PHPs had to leave the Medi-Cal program because they failed to meet the new standards.", "Beginning in the 1980s, the state enacted several pieces of legislation authorizing the development and testing of alternative ways to deliver managed health care services to Medi-Cal beneficiaries. The first legislation, in 1981, authorized the development of pilot Primary Care Case Management (PCCM) programs. Subsequent legislation, in 1982, authorized County Organized Health Systems (COHS) and a Geographic Managed Care (GMC) program, and also permitted routine PCCM contracting."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "California\u2019s Current Medicaid Managed Care Program", "paragraphs": ["Medi-Cal managed care is currently built on a foundation of PHPs and PCCMs. Contractors are all paid on a capitated basis for the services they provide; that is, the state pays the managed care plan a monthly fee for each enrollee, and the plan assumes responsibility for the full cost of the services it has contracted to provide. PHPs are capitated to provide all basic benefits covered by Medi-Cal, excluding a few selected services such as organ transplants, chronic renal dialysis, long-term care, and dental care. The capitation fee is intended to equal DHS\u2019 cost of providing the same services on a fee-for-service basis to an actuarially equivalent population.", "PCCMs are operated by physicians and other primary care providers who are capitated to provide all outpatient physician services and to manage all of the services provided to their enrollees.

Although the state has added staff, a HCFA official told us that DHS has just enough people to keep current programs running and that heavy workloads remain a HCFA concern.", "Another factor involved in DHS\u2019 inadequate monitoring that HCFA found in its 1992 review was a generally low level of contract manager experience and technical expertise. Our review also indicated that DHS could improve its monitoring and management of health plans by giving contract managers more training and guidance. In our discussions with DHS officials and contract managers, we found that only on-the-job training and ad hoc workshops were provided.

If the costs of the services these plans provide are higher than the capitation payments they receive, the plans must make up the difference. As a result, primary care physicians in managed care plans typically serve as \u201cgatekeepers\u201d who must preapprove certain services for their patients. Financial incentive arrangements adjust the compensation paid to primary care physicians to discourage them from providing health services such as inpatient hospital care, referrals to specialists, and certain diagnostic tests when the services are unneeded. While there are no reliable current data on the extent to which managed care plans use financial incentives, evidence suggests that most HMOs use some incentives.", "All three Medi-Cal PHPs we spoke to regarding their financial arrangements do use incentives. One plan, which has salaried primary care physicians, pays them a bonus of up to 20 percent of salary partly on the basis of the cost of individual physician referrals for specialty and hospital care. A second plan pays a medical group on a capitated basis to provide virtually all medical services in-house except inpatient care. Any surplus or deficit up to a specified limit in the inpatient hospital budget is shared equally with physicians. The third plan, which passes along almost all the financial risk, compensates each of its medical groups on a capitated basis for nearly all medical services, including services for which patients must be referred outside the group. It also uses bonus incentives for low hospital utilization. Appendix II contains a more detailed discussion on the use of financial incentives.", "Ideally, financial incentives operate to reduce unnecessary medical procedures, but they also have the potential to deny patients beneficial and necessary services. Although there are few data on whether financial incentives actually reduce the quality of medical care, the American Medical Association, the Department of Health and Human Services, advocacy groups, academic experts, and our past reports have commented on the potential of incentives to impair quality. Among the factors cited as influencing how much of a hazard incentives may pose are (1) the extent to which a physician\u2019s compensation is placed at risk for services approved by, but not directly provided by, the physician; (2) whether the incentives are based on the service utilization patterns of individual physicians or of a group of physicians in the aggregate; (3) whether a physician\u2019s risk is spread over a large patient pool and the duration of the period used for computing a bonus or deficit; (4) whether the managed care plan provides stop-loss insurance to limit a physician\u2019s risk; and (5) whether the plan has an effective quality assurance program that attempts to counteract any adverse effect the incentive may have on patient care.", "Although DHS reviews financial incentive arrangements, officials told us they have no criteria or guidelines regarding the types of financial incentives that are acceptable. Their auditors, who review the Medicaid managed care plans\u2019 financial statements, use their individual professional judgment when analyzing financial arrangements between the plans and their subcontractors.

A Department of Corporations official told us that the only general rule applied when reviewing financial incentive arrangements is that a provider or provider group that does not provide hospital or other institutional care may not be capitated for such care. Apart from applying this rule, the Department of Corporations reviews financial incentive arrangements on a case-by-case basis. In general, though, it does not examine the arrangements closely because the managed care plan is responsible for ensuring that its subcontracting arrangements meet the state\u2019s quality assurance requirements.", "Pursuant to the Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-508), HCFA is currently developing standards for imposing restrictions on the financial incentive arrangements that managed care plans contracting under Medicare and Medicaid can enter into with their physicians.

They did this because AFDC and AFDC-related populations (1) most closely resemble patients in existing primary care practices and generally do not require the same specialized health care services as the SSI population, (2) are more likely to benefit from the types of preventive services that are the hallmark of a managed care delivery strategy, and (3) have the greatest problems getting access to care.", "Officials in two California counties operating COHSs have stated that the way to achieve the maximum benefits from managed care is to have the entire Medicaid population, including the SSI recipients, enrolled. They attributed some of the financial savings of their programs to the mandatory enrollment of the SSI population in their counties. They said that including SSI beneficiaries increases the COHSs ability to spread risk and to achieve savings.", "In contrast, after its 1992 review, HCFA officials recommended that instead of including more beneficiaries as the COHS officials suggest, California limit the size of its program by targeting its managed care effort to specific high-risk/high-cost beneficiary groups, rather than enroll the entire AFDC and AFDC-related population in so many counties. Given the state\u2019s limited administrative resources, the expansion effort could be improved by targeting managed care on groups that would benefit the most from case management while, at the same time, controlling costs, HCFA officials believe. Administering a managed care program of over 3 million AFDC and AFDC-related beneficiaries will create an even greater administrative strain on the state than it is now experiencing, HCFA officials said.", "However, DHS officials point out that the primary goal of the new program is to improve Medicaid beneficiaries\u2019 access to health care services while controlling costs.
