Local boards are required to  promote employers\u2019 participation in the workforce investment system and  assist them in meeting hiring needs. Training services provided must be  directly linked to occupations in demand in the local area. WIA requires  states and localities to track the performance of WIA-funded activities and  Labor to hold states accountable for their performance in the areas of job  placement, employment retention, and earnings change.", "The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) oversees the High  Growth, Community Based, and WIRED grant initiatives. The vast majority  of these grants are awarded under a provision of WIA, which provides  authority for demonstration, pilot, multiservice, research, and multistate  projects, and a provision of the American Competitiveness and Workforce  Improvement Act (ACWIA), which provides authority for job training  grants funded by the H-1B visa program.", "Labor is required to conduct impact evaluations of its programs and activities  carried out under WIA, including pilot and demonstration projects. While  impact evaluations make it possible to isolate a program\u2019s effect on  participants\u2019 outcomes, there are several ways to conduct them, including  experimental and quasi-experimental methods. In 2004 and 2007, GAO  recommended that Labor comply with WIA requirements to conduct an  impact evaluation of WIA services to determine what services are most  effective for improving employment-related outcomes. Labor agreed with our  recommendation. In December 2007, the agency announced it had begun a  quasi-experimental evaluation\u23afan impact evaluation that does not use a  control group\u2014of the WIA Adult and Dislocated Worker programs, with a  final report expected in November 2008.", "Federal law recommends, but does not require, that all grants be awarded  through competition. The Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act  encourages competition in grant programs, where appropriate, to ensure  that the best possible projects are funded. In addition, Labor\u2019s own  guidance governing procurement and grant operations\u2014the Department  of Labor Manual Series\u2014states that competition is recommended, unless  one or more of eight exceptions apply. Further, a guide on improving  grant accountability developed by the Domestic Working Group Grant  Accountability Project recommends grants be awarded competitively  because competition facilitates accountability, promotes fairness and  openness, and increases assurance that grantees have the systems in place  to efficiently and effectively use funds to meet grant goals.", "Effective monitoring is also a critical component of grant management.  The Domestic Working Group\u2019s suggested grant practices state that  financial and performance monitoring is important to ensure  accountability and the attainment of performance goals. Labor monitors  most grants through a risk-based strategy based on its Core Monitoring  Guide. A key goal is to determine compliance with specific program  requirements. In addition, entities receiving Labor grants are subject to the  provisions of the Single Audit Act if certain conditions are met.

As a related effort, the Community Based grants were designed to build  the training capacity of community colleges for high-growth, high-demand  occupations. The goal of third grant initiative, WIRED, was to \u201ccatalyze\u201d  the creation of high-skill and high-wage opportunities for workers within  the context of regional economies, to test models for integrating  workforce and economic development, and to demonstrate that workforce  development is a key driver in transforming regional economies.

According to Labor, they have seen a \u201csystem-shift\u201d  in the approach to implementing workforce solutions through an increase  in demand-driven topics at conferences since the roll out of the initiatives.  Labor said this shift has been driven by partnerships between the  workforce investment system, business, industry, and educators using the  High Growth framework. Labor also said it is seeing demand-driven  strategies in state and local strategic plans and in states using their own  money to fund High Growth-like projects. Labor pointed out that the  system has evolved to the point where high performing local workforce  boards with demand-driven practices are mentoring lesser performers.  Lastly, Labor said the content on its Web site, Workforce3 One, was also  evidence of change. For example, Labor held an interactive seminar  broadcast on this site to train participants to use an online tool to share  curricula developed through the initiatives.", "However, experts identified a number of challenges states face in pursuing  demand-driven practices. These included insufficient funding, limited  flexibility in how funds can be used, statutory requirements to target  services to certain groups of workers, and the need to respond to local  economic conditions. Commenting on workforce boards\u2019 ability to form  strategic partnerships, one expert noted that there are no funds to support  such endeavors and no performance standards to measure them. With  regard to regional economic development, experts said boards are  structured around local areas, not regions, regional economies are highly  variable, regional governance structures can make achieving buy-in  difficult and that rural areas can be particularly challenged in pursuing  regional approaches."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Seven Years After Awarding the First Grant, Labor Will Be Challenged to Evaluate Their Impact", "paragraphs": ["Despite the money invested and emphasis placed on these initiatives,  Labor did not fully integrate them into its strategic plan or ETA\u2019s research  plan from the start.

Labor officials said the  strategic plan did not address the initiatives because it focuses on budget  issues. Just as the initiatives are not fully integrated into the strategic plan,  neither are they fully integrated into ETA\u2019s research plan, which cites  plans for future evaluations, but it does not specify an assessment of their  impact.

Labor  said that, prior to 2005, it consistently collected data from grantees on the  number of participants enrolled in and completing training funded under  High Growth\u2014the only one of the three grant initiatives operating at that  time. However, it did not collect performance outcomes similar to those  being collected for its other training and employment services.", "Labor will face challenges in obtaining the data necessary to make  meaningful comparisons. In 2005, Labor instituted what were called  common measures to assess the effectiveness of one-stop programs and  services. The common measures include participant employment  outcomes, earnings, and job retention after receiving services. At the time,  Labor could not require High Growth and Community Based grantees to  provide data on the common measures because it did not have Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) approval. In anticipation of OMB  approval, starting in 2006, Labor included information on the common  measures in all new solicitations for High Growth and Community Based  grants, notified grantees of its goal for standardizing performance  reporting, and provided technical assistance to help grantees prepare for  it. Labor also encouraged grantees to work with local workforce system  partners to leverage their experience in tracking and reporting  performance outcomes. According to Labor, it has an OMB approved  reporting format in place and expects data collection to begin in early  program year 2008. However, because some of the first grantees have  already completed their projects, obtaining information about workers  that have left the program may prove difficult and costly. According to  Labor, it can collect common measures for WIRED grantees, but it has not  yet done so.", "As a result, Labor may not have consistent data for individuals  participating in the programs funded under the grant initiatives. In  addition, it may lack data that will allow it to compare outcomes for  individuals served by grant-funded programs with those served by  employment and training programs offered through the one-stop system.  Having comparable outcome data is important because the goal of an  impact evaluation is to determine if outcomes are attributable to a  program or can be explained by other factors.", "Labor has some plans underway to evaluate the initiatives but may face  challenges drawing strong conclusions from them.

Another grant, valued at almost $4 million, provides  a database and geographic information system that WIRED grantees can  use to facilitate data analysis and reporting, among other things.", "While these monitoring and technical assistance efforts are useful to help  grantees manage their grants, they do not provide a risk-based monitoring  process to identify and resolve problems, such as compliance issues, in a  consistent and timely manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Labor Provides Risk-Based Monitoring for High Growth and Community Based Grants and Has Documented Steps for Monitoring WIRED Grants", "paragraphs": ["Labor uses a risk-based strategy to monitor High Growth and Community  Based grant initiatives. For these initiatives, it selects grantees to monitor  based on indications of problems that may affect grant performance.  Labor\u2019s risk-based approach to monitoring most grants reflects suggested  grant practices. Suggested grant practices recognize that it is important to  identify, prioritize, and manage potential at-risk grant recipients for  monitoring given the large number of grants awarded by federal agencies.  Through this process, Labor staff determine if grantee administration and  program delivery systems operate, the grantee is in compliance with  program requirements, and information reported is accurate.", "Labor\u2019s risk-based monitoring strategy involves conducting site visits  based on grantees\u2019 assessed risk-levels and availability of resources,  among other things. These site visits include written assessments of  grantee\u2019s management and performance and compliance findings and  requirements for corrective action. For example, Labor\u2019s site visit guide  includes questions about financial and performance data reporting  systems, such as how well the grantee maintains files on program  participants.", "Labor has monitored about half of the High Growth grants and over one- quarter of the Community Based grants. Labor officials said these  monitoring efforts have resulted in a number of significant findings which  have generally been resolved in a timely manner. (See table 4.) For  example, during a November 2006 site visit of a Community Based grantee,  Labor identified three findings: incomplete participant files, failure to  follow internal procurement procedures, and missing grant partnership  agreements. Similarly, during a site visit in spring 2006 to a High Growth  grantee, Labor found that the grantee did not accurately track participant  information and reported incorrect information on expenditures, among  other things. As of September 2007 Labor said these findings had been  resolved (see table 4).", "As another part of Labor\u2019s risk-based monitoring strategy, Labor\u2019s internal  requirements specify that Labor staff are to make site visits to all new  grantees, including High Growth, Community Based, and WIRED, within  12 months of beginning grant activity and to new grantees rated as \u201cat  risk\u201d within 3 months. Labor officials said they consider \u201cnew grantee\u201d site  visits to be orientation visits and had not made visits to most new  grantees. They said they broadly interpret this requirement to include a  variety of methods of contact and generally use teleconference and video  conference training sessions rather than site visits, based on the  availability of resources. For example, Labor calls each new Community  Based grantee to schedule new grantee training. Labor is taking steps to  update its internal requirements to better reflect the purpose of the new  grantee monitoring.", "According to Labor, in response to a recommendation we made in our May  2008 report, it has initiated the process for monitoring the financial and  administrative requirements of the WIRED grants. Labor says it developed  a WIRED Supplement to the Core Monitoring Guide which it is using to  conduct reviews of WIRED grants. Labor also stated that it is developing a  schedule of reviews that will provide for the monitoring of all WIRED  grants prior to September 30, 2008, to be followed by reviews of remaining  WIRED grants.", "Labor said the monitoring reviews are being conducted by four teams of  ETA staff, consisting of experienced Regional Office financial staff,  National Office staff, and the Federal Project Officers assigned to the  grant. All of the teams have been provided training to maximize the results  of the initial review. ETA will utilize standard procedures for issuance and  resolution of any monitoring report issues.", "While Labor has said it has taken steps to implement our recommendation  on documentation and monitoring, we have not assessed the sufficiency of  those efforts. Labor has said it is taking steps to ensure that it can evaluate  the impact of the initiatives, and this is an area that warrants continued  oversight.", "Madam Chairman, this completes my prepared statement.
