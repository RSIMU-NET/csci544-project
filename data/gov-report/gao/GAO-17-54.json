A key difference is that the MAC-MO strategy intends to control costs through the use of firm-fixed price contracts and the use of third-party planners, which could be cost-effective if the planner produces clearly defined work specifications for the repair contractor to price and execute. Prior to implementation of the new strategy, the Navy conducted market research and pilot-tested attributes of the strategy with pilot maintenance periods for a number of ships.", "The Navy recognized several lessons learned from its pilot maintenance periods and has made subsequent process changes to address key lessons and support MAC-MO. These include a longer time frame for the planning process for finalizing work requirements (see figure). According to the Navy, this additional time is needed to promote stable requirements and, therefore, pricing.", "The Navy is assessing outcomes of individual maintenance periods; however, it lacks a systematic process involving the fleet- and shore-based maintenance communities to assess overall implementation of MAC-MO. This is inconsistent with federal standards for internal control, which state that management should evaluate its response to risks and evaluate progress made toward program objectives. Not ensuring progress is systematically assessed\u2014particularly in light of the many stakeholders involved\u2014could undermine the Navy's ability to obtain the improved outcomes it seeks with the MAC-MO strategy.", "The MAC-MO strategy will increase competition opportunities and set aside work for small businesses, but it is too soon to determine how these changes will impact the ship repair industrial base. Industry viewpoints GAO collected on MAC-MO varied both by shipyard location and contractor size. However, former MSMO contract holders reported that the uncertainty associated with the need to continually compete for work could result in decisions to reduce their workforce and facilities. Small businesses GAO spoke with have in the past mostly performed work as subcontractors to MSMO contract holders, but many expressed interest in competing as prime contractors under MAC-MO."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends the Navy assign responsibility to a single entity to systematically assess implementation of the MAC-MO strategy.

The Navy relies on these ships to be  ready to operate when needed and to meet their expected service lives.  To accomplish these objectives, the Navy contracts for ship repair,  maintenance, and modernization through scheduled periods, called  availabilities, during which the ship is temporarily unavailable for  operations. The Navy concluded in 2010 that the material readiness of  the surface ship force was well below acceptable levels to preserve ships  to their full service lives, finding that deferrals of scheduled maintenance  and reductions in the amount of time allowed for completing major repairs  contributed to persisting deficiencies. These deferrals and reductions also  had not remedied the longstanding problem of cost and schedule growth  in ship maintenance availabilities. The Navy has since taken steps to  improve the readiness of its non-nuclear surface combatant and  amphibious warfare ships, including introducing a revised operational  schedule intended to provide, among other things, for the predictable  scheduling of tasks for ship maintenance, known as the Optimized Fleet  Response Plan (OFRP).", "In 2015, the Navy transitioned to a different contract strategy for the  maintenance and modernization of surface ships, which it expects to  support the goals of the OFRP and alleviate cost and schedule growth  incurred during availabilities. This new strategy is called Multiple  Award  Contract-Multi Order (MAC-MO). As opposed to the prior strategy, which  used cost-reimbursement contracts and was only competed among ship  repair contractors every 5 years, MAC-MO  will use firm-fixed-price  contracts, a third-party contractor to identify and plan the work, and  increased competition, among other things. The MAC-MO strategy will  cover maintenance needs for six classes of surface combatant and  amphibious assault ships, which the Navy estimates will cost about $6.5  billion to maintain from fiscal year 2016 through fiscal year 2020.", "House Report 114-102 accompanying the fiscal year 2016 National  Defense Authorization Act included a provision for us to review the Navy\u2019s  implementation of the MAC-MO  contracting strategy.

To  determine how the previous Multi-Ship,  Multi-Option (MSMO) and current  MAC-MO strategies differ in terms of contract pricing, planning the work,  and structuring the competition among ship repair yards, we analyzed the  contents of MAC-MO acquisition planning documentation, and reviewed  related Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions and MSMO  contracts. To assess process changes the Navy has taken to address  challenges and to capitalize on intended benefits of the MAC-MO  strategy, we analyzed documentation on lessons learned from the  availabilities used to pilot the MAC-MO strategy and actions the Navy  took in response, such as were identified in staffing and training plans,  and proposals for revised planning milestones. For these two objectives,  we also interviewed Navy officials responsible for planning, administering,  and funding the ship repair contracts, including the offices of the Deputy  Commander for Surface Warfare (SEA 21); Commander, Naval Surface  Force, Atlantic; Commander, Naval Surface Force, Pacific; Commander,  Navy Regional Maintenance Center; the Mid-Atlantic  Regional  Maintenance Center (MARMC) in Norfolk, Virginia; the Southwest  Regional Maintenance Center (SWRMC) in San Diego, California; and  the Southeast Regional Maintenance Center (SERMC) in Mayport,  Florida. These are the three maintenance centers where the Navy is  implementing the new contracting strategy. To understand how the new  strategy might affect the Navy\u2019s industrial base for ship repair, we used a  data collection instrument and a semi-structured interview to collect  viewpoints and a description of existing facilities from 14 selected  contractors serving the Navy homeports of Norfolk, Virginia; Mayport,  Florida; and San Diego, California. The contractors included former  MSMO contract holders and additional contractors the Navy identified as  potential competitors for MAC-MO contracts in its market research,  including small businesses.

For example, the Navy is currently in  process of modernizing cruisers and destroyers to upgrade their  combat systems. CNO availabilities can last 6 months or longer and  are normally scheduled every 2 to 3 years throughout a ship\u2019s service  life.

These availabilities are  only completed on an as-needed basis in order to keep a ship  operating. For example, in 2015, staff at one regional maintenance  center discovered a propeller blade was loose during a contractor\u2019s  routine cleaning of an underwater hull of an amphibious ship and  immediately arranged for the repairs.", "In support of its mission to ensure surface ships are mission-ready and  able to achieve their expected service life, NAVSEA\u2019s Surface  Maintenance Engineering Planning Program (SURFMEPP) has  developed a series of products used to support long-term maintenance  for ships, focusing on capturing the technical requirements for a class of  ships. For example, maintenance plans for a class of ships could identify  a need for equipment overhauls, propulsion shaft replacements, and  corrosion protection. To identify requirements for a specific ship,  SURFMEPP coordinates the development of a \u201cbaseline availability  work  package\u201d with the relevant type commander. This package represents the  NAVSEA-mandated  technical requirements to ensure a ship reaches its  expected service life and meets its operational commitments and is  tailored specifically to each ship. Planners then use these requirements  as a basis for developing detailed work specifications that direct the ship  repair contractor how to perform the work. SURFMEPP also manages the  Master Specification Catalog, which is a module within the Navy  Maintenance Database that contains information and specifications  needed by planners to develop the work specifications for the repair or  modernization of a specific surface ship.

A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is  not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor\u2019s cost  experience in performing the contract. This contract type places  maximum risk and full responsibility for all costs\u2014and resulting profit  or loss\u2014on the contractor. It therefore provides maximum incentive  for the contractor to control costs. In 1982, we reported on  deficiencies with the Navy\u2019s implementation of this contracting  strategy for ship repairs.", "MSMO (2004 to present): The Navy has used the MSMO strategy,  which features the use of cost-reimbursement contracts, to contract  for ship maintenance work with the private sector. Cost- reimbursement contracts provide for the payment of allowable  incurred costs, to the extent prescribed in the contract. Under a cost- reimbursement contract, the government does not contract for the  performance of a specified amount of work for a predetermined price,  but instead agrees to pay the contractor\u2019s reasonable costs of  performance regardless of whether the work is completed. In  addition, as part of the MSMO strategy, the contractor responsible for  executing the work develops the specifications to which the work was  performed. While the Navy initially identified several benefits with the  MSMO strategy, including contractor assistance with developing the  work package specifications, Navy leadership determined that the  business case for the strategy had deteriorated as ship availabilities  were incurring excessive cost and schedule growth.", "MAC-MO (2015 to present): In 2015, the Navy began transitioning to  the use of its newest contracting strategy for ship maintenance\u2014 MAC-MO\u2014which relies on (1) cost-reimbursement type contracts with  a third-party planner (i.e., a contractor other than the contractor  performing the actual repair work) to develop work specifications and  (2) firm-fixed-price contracts with ship repair contractors to execute  availabilities. In addition, the MAC-MO contracting strategy features  the use of indefinite delivery/indefinite  quantity (IDIQ) contracts for  ship repair contractors. IDIQ contracts do not specify exact times for  delivery of supplies or services at contract award; those are  established via task orders during contract performance. The use of  multiple award, IDIQ contracts (contract awards to more than one  contractor) and orders is consistent with Department of Defense  Better Buying Power initiatives aimed at increasing competition.", "Shortly preceding implementation of the MAC-MO strategy, in November  2014 the Navy began implementing OFRP\u2014a revision of its earlier Fleet  Response Plan outlining fleet training, maintenance, deployment, and  sustainment schedules. As we found in a May 2016 report, to meet heavy  operational demands over the past decade, the Navy has increased ship  deployment lengths and has reduced or deferred ship maintenance,  reducing the predictability of ship deployments. In addition, we found  that public and private shipyards involved in Navy ship maintenance face  a number of challenges in completing maintenance on time, including  unanticipated work requirements, workforce inexperience, and workload  fluctuations. The OFRP is intended to prioritize maintenance by  developing a predictable schedule that allows sufficient time to  accomplish needed maintenance tasks and ensure that platforms meet  their expected service lives."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Market Research and Piloting Helped Inform Roll-out of MAC-MO Strategy, Which Offers Potential Benefits Compared to MSMO", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of the key attributes of the MAC-MO contracting strategy  versus its MSMO predecessor indicates that the new strategy offers  significant potential benefits, key among them being the ability to control  contract costs through the use of firm-fixed-price contracts.

However, according  to NAVSEA  officials, the Navy subsequently decided not to pursue  this contracting approach on the basis of two factors. First, single  award IDIQs would have required potential contractors to pre-price  availabilities years into the future, which industry cited as highly  problematic. In addition, NAVSEA found that the use of single award  IDIQs would likely undermine its negotiating position with respect to  individual modernizations.", "In addition, in 2014 NAVSEA  used San Diego-based pilot availabilities for  five ships to test the MAC-MO strategy, and assembled lessons learned.  These availabilities, which SWRMC oversaw in San Diego, California,  ranged in level of complexity.

For example, the officials said that although RMC staff reported  the need to hire qualified contracting specialists to support the MAC-MO  strategy, shortages in this position existed under MSMO because the  demands of the job produced high turnover. In 2014, several years after  the establishment of the RMCs, U.S. Fleet Forces Command  commissioned a study that assessed RMC manning requirements.

However, a senior CNRMC official cited budget  constraints within U.S. Fleet Forces Command, which approves RMC  budgets, as a limiting factor on how rapidly the RMCs could overcome  existing staffing shortfalls. Nonetheless, a CNRMC official stated that  MAC-MO might alleviate shortfalls, although it could be years before the  impacts are realized.", "In addition, Navy officials stated that they plan to continuously assess and  incorporate lessons learned throughout implementation of the MAC-MO  strategy. According to CNRMC officials, one recent example of this  learning occurred during the execution of the gap ship availabilities in  Norfolk, which identified a need to train contracting staff on how to obtain  funding for contract changes when funding for the original contract had  been obligated in the prior fiscal year. Since this process was never  needed to fund changes to MSMO cost-reimbursement contracts,  MARMC  staff were unfamiliar with the process. In addition, RMC  officials identified a variety of lessons learned after the third-party  planning contractor completed its first set of work specifications for the  USS Normandy, a gap ship availability.  RMC officials reported that  although the third-party planner met almost all of the planning milestones,  the experiences during the planning process underscored the importance  of RMC staff meeting frequently with the planner to discuss and answer  questions and review specifications and outcomes of ship checks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Transition to the MAC-MO Strategy Requires Stakeholders to Stabilize Requirements Early to Support Development of Accurate Specifications", "paragraphs": ["Unstable work requirements have historically posed risks to the Navy\u2019s  maintenance and readiness goals and hold significant implications for the  MAC-MO contracting strategy. Without stable requirements, the third- party planner cannot develop work specifications that reflect the full scope  of work needed to be done. In our May 2016 report on OFRP, we found  that from 2011 to 2014, on average, surface combatants experienced a  34 percent increase in unanticipated growth in maintenance  requirements, resulting in average annual cost growths of $164.8 million.  Officials primarily attribute the unanticipated growth and new work to  estimating difficulties and high operational tempo, among other reasons.  Increases in growth and new work also have consequences for the length  of a maintenance availability as RMC staff and contractors need to  negotiate contract changes and agree on costs. For example, the Navy  reported that from May to October 2015, the median time to process and  complete negotiations for new work for surface combatants was 18 days,  exceeding the Navy\u2019s standard of 5 days.", "The MAC-MO  San Diego pilot availabilities identified the need for  NAVSEA  to provide sufficient time to finalize work requirements (known as package lock) before the third-party planner develops the work  specifications that accompany the solicitation. Accordingly, in 2015,  NAVSEA  proposed revised planning milestones for CNO availabilities,  which lengthened the amount of time between the start of the planning  process and the start of maintenance availability from 360 days (which  was the MSMO standard) to 540 days. Although key stakeholder roles  remain the same under the new MAC-MO  milestones, NAVSEA\u2019s move  to lock the work package earlier to allow time for solicitation of the  contract has implications for stakeholders who develop modernization  and maintenance requirements, as well as stakeholders who verify the  accuracy of the work specifications prepared by the third-party planner.  For example, the requirements must be locked 175 days, rather than 90  days, before the start of an availability.", "According to NAVSEA officials, the Navy has not yet formally approved  and implemented the revised MAC-MO milestones. NAVSEA  officials  reported currently using the revised milestones for its firm-fixed-price  contracts as it wants to see how they work before formally approving  them. See figure 5 for a comparison of the planning milestones for a CNO  availability  under MSMO and MAC-MO.", "Senior NAVSEA,  type command, RMC, and SURFMEPP officials agreed  that development of fully-defined and timely work requirements is needed  to support the planning process, but senior RMC officials as well as  NAVSEA  officials expressed concerns related to the occasionally  conflicting goals of the fleet and the maintenance community. As officials  explained, the fleet would prefer to wait as late as possible to define the  requirements, as for example, ship systems continue to operate\u2014and can  thus break\u2014up to the point that a ship enters an availability.  Alternatively,  the maintenance community prefers to lock requirements early in order to  award the contract and support the solicitation of the availability.  One  senior NAVSEA  program official commented that defining requirements  later in the planning process was possible under the MSMO contracting  strategy because the contract holder was responsible for repairing and  maintaining the same ship year after year and could more easily  accommodate changes in the scope of work to be completed. According  to Navy officials, under MSMO, the contractor could even be tasked with  writing requests for contract changes, which was the common practice at  MARMC,  but not SERMC or SWRMC. Alternatively,  under MAC-MO,  RMC staff exclusively are expected to develop these requests.", "Several NAVSEA officials, including RMC officials, and a type command  official commented that the use of firm-fixed-price contracts under MAC- MO will force earlier definition of requirements, which necessitates the  Navy becoming more disciplined in its planning processes. Further, one  RMC contracting official, experienced with the use of firm-fixed-price  contracting, commented that one of the biggest challenges to MAC-MO  will be making sure stakeholders responsible for developing  the  requirements are collectively meeting each of the milestones for locking  the requirements. Consistently, Navy officials at the various commands  we interviewed acknowledged the importance of achieving accurate work  specifications for a maintenance availability,  as inaccurate work  specifications could result in contract modifications, leading to schedule  delays and cost growth and thus contravening the goals of MAC-MO.", "Several senior Navy officials expressed hope about the MAC-MO  strategy\u2019s likelihood of success because they said the nature of firm-fixed- price contracts would make the tradeoffs between adding additional work  after the start of an availability  and adhering to the schedule more  apparent, adding discipline to the process. A CNRMC official commented  that adding additional work under the MSMO contracting strategy was  relatively easy because the type commands and the modernization teams  could go straight to the contractor and ask for more work to be done, and  the contractors were willing to have new work added. In contrast, under  the MAC-MO  strategy adding work will be more time-consuming yet  transparent because the cost of additional work will need to be negotiated  before the work commences. Further, one senior acquisition planning  official added that even if the need for new and growth work was  identified after the contract was awarded, the government has the option  of performing the work later at a subsequent availability  provided the  additional work is not related to the core functionality of the ship or a  safety issue."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Navy Lacks a Systematic Process for Evaluating MAC-MO Implementation and Progress", "paragraphs": ["The Navy has processes in place for evaluating the contract performance  of its individual surface ship availabilities, including metrics that measure  schedule delays, cost growth, and contract changes associated with  growth and new work. This evaluation process, which is centered in the  RMCs, has largely carried over from the previous MSMO strategy,  although under MAC-MO\u2019s firm-fixed-price contracts, it will not include  award fee evaluation board reviews of the availability contractor. In  addition, while the CNRMC collectively analyzes the metrics, it is not  responsible for determining whether the strategy itself is achieving its  objectives.", "Apart from these availability-specific evaluations, the Navy does not have  a systematic process in place to evaluate the extent to which the MAC- MO strategy is meeting its overall objectives and whether risks to its  success, such as timely completion of work requirements under the  proposed milestones and shortfalls in RMC staffing, have been  cooperatively addressed and mitigated by stakeholders within the Navy  maintenance community. According to federal standards for internal  control, management should design control activities to respond to risks  and evaluate if objectives are being met, which involves leadership-level  reviews of performance and establishment of performance measures.  As we have previously reported, risk assessment can provide a  foundation for effective program management because it provides  reasonable assurance that such risks are being minimized.", "As noted above, the Navy faces some challenges to successfully  implementing MAC-MO.  Greater discipline is required to plan and execute  ship availabilities using firm-fixed-price contracts and third-party planners,  requiring greater coordination among stakeholders in the fleet and  NAVSEA  to identify potential risks to the strategy. Achieving stable  requirements and specifications requires extensive coordination within the  type commands, across NAVSEA offices, and with the third-party  planner\u2014an approach the Navy has only demonstrated to a limited extent  to date, primarily through its San Diego pilot availabilities. Further, as  experiences with the Norfolk gap ships suggest, the Navy is likely to  identify additional lessons learned. Without effective coordination across  myriad stakeholders within the Navy\u2019s maintenance communities who  together are responsible for scheduling, planning, budgeting, overseeing,  and setting policy for surface ship availabilities, there is the risk that MAC- MO will not be implemented as envisioned and the potential benefits may  not be fully realized.", "The Navy already recognizes the importance of establishing forums  where issues of cross-cutting interest to the fleet and maintenance  communities can be addressed. In June 2016, the Navy chartered a  committee to identify and address maintenance and modernization  requirements for surface ships. This committee, known as the Surface  and Expeditionary Warfare Maintenance and Modernization  Committee,  includes stakeholders from the fleet and shore-based maintenance  communities. As stated in the Navy instruction establishing the  committee, this coordination is best accomplished through a standing  group of knowledgeable and accountable representatives who actively  participate in the development and assessment of maintenance and  modernization requirements and resourcing solutions. In addition, as  SWRMC recommended as part of its lessons learned from the San Diego  pilot availabilities, a committee known as Surface Team 1 could have the  potential to track the successful aspects of MAC-MO\u2019s implementation  and develop metrics to evaluate its performance. The Navy has tasked  Surface Team 1, a previously existing committee, whose representatives  also include members of the fleet and shore-based maintenance  communities, with responsibilities for setting and developing surface ship  maintenance and modernization priorities, but has not tasked it with  assessing MAC-MO\u2019s implementation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "MAC-MO Strategy Will Increase Competition Opportunities, but It Is Too Soon to Assess Other Effects on the Ship Repair Industrial Base", "paragraphs": ["NAVSEA  designed the MAC-MO contracting strategy to increase the  number of competition opportunities for the maintenance and  modernization of surface ships.

Under MSMO two contracts could be awarded for a class of ships\u2014one  for maintenance availabilities that required a drydock facility (docker  contract) and one for those that did not (non-docker contract).", "To illustrate the number of IDIQ orders that could potentially be competed  under the MAC-MO strategy, we analyzed DDG 51-class destroyer  availabilities completed in Norfolk between fiscal years 2010 and 2014.  The Navy executed these maintenance availabilities under two different  MSMO contracts\u2014a docker contract and a non-docker contract.

They plan to release a  solicitation for rolling admissions in San Diego and Norfolk in early fiscal  year 2017. The purpose of the rolling admission is to expand the  contractor base for modernization of surface combatants and amphibious  ships.

Although NAVSEA  officials told us they  solicited few if any coast-wide availabilities  under MSMO, as part of the  transition to the MAC-MO  strategy, NAVSEA  has already competed  several availabilities  coast-wide and plans to compete nine additional  maintenance availabilities along the East and West Coasts from 2017 to  2019. Accordingly, any contractor on either coast with access to a pier  and drydock will be able to compete for these availabilities.

Contract solicitations for work taking longer than 6  months generally must be competed coast-wide. According to NAVSEA  officials, under MSMO, the availabilities were planned to be shorter than 6  months.", "Navy officials offered various reasons as to why availabilities under  MSMO were planned to be completed in less than 6 months. Because MSMO contracts typically provided for 5 years of planned availabilities for  a ship class within a given homeport, NAVSEA officials told us estimates  of availability  durations regularly had to be made years before the actual  work requirements were known. Nevertheless, by planning the  availabilities to be less than 6 months, NAVSEA  did not need to compete  them coast-wide (as it would have under the 1986 statute) and move the  ship out of its homeport. In one instance, though, we found a MSMO  contract that included options to cover any instances of work anticipated  to take longer than 6 months, such as extended modernization  availabilities. Therefore, the period of performance of these availabilities  would have exceeded the 6-month limitation if the options had been  exercised. NAVSEA  and RMC officials told us that, in general, RMC  contracting staff have been opposed to moving a ship out of its homeport  because of the potential negative effects on sailor morale and the  anticipated costs of moving the ship.", "NAVSEA  officials reported taking two separate actions to clarify the  homeport exception to coast-wide competitions. First, NAVSEA officials  recognized that the Navy homeport policy does not use the term \u201cwork\u201d,  which is included in the current statute. Specifically, the homeport policy  does not define the scope of work included in an availability  or when  measuring of that work (estimating the number of days needed to execute  the availability)  should take place. NAVSEA  officials stated they are  drafting a revision to the 1996 homeport policy and that this draft revision  will define the term \u201cwork\u201d as meaning \u201cwork for the overhaul, repair, or  maintenance of a naval vessel\u201d. Additionally,  the Navy\u2019s proposed policy  revision will require that 540 days prior to the start of an availability, the  Navy identify how work days will be measured for that availability.  In  addition, NAVSEA officials told us they are developing a legislative  proposal to increase the 6-month exception to coast-wide competitions to  allow for a longer period before they have to do a coast-wide competition  because availabilities with modernization packages now regularly exceed  6 months, unlike in the past."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Multiple Factors Likely to Affect the Industrial Base as Contractors Respond to the MAC-MO Strategy", "paragraphs": ["A variety of factors, including the Navy\u2019s level of demand for maintenance  and repair work at each of the three homeports in our review, will  determine how the MAC-MO strategy might affect the industrial base, if at  all.

To  determine the key differences between the MAC-MO and the Multi-Ship,  Multi-Option (MSMO) contracting strategies in contract pricing, planning  the work, ordering, and structuring the competition among ship repair  contractors, we analyzed NAVSEA\u2019s  acquisition planning documentation  for the MAC-MO strategy and reviewed contents of selected MSMO  contracts the Navy identified as illustrative, most recent, or were still in a  period of performance and MAC-MO contract documentation for third- party planning contract awards. We also considered applicable Federal  Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions describing the conditions under  which firm-fixed-price and cost-reimbursement contracts are appropriate.  To identify the Navy\u2019s rationale on how to proceed with the new strategy,  we analyzed acquisition planning documentation to understand how  NAVSEA  applied the results of its market research as prescribed by the  FAR. To further our understanding of NAVSEA\u2019s decision to proceed  with the MAC-MO strategy, we examined the characteristics of ship  availabilities used to pilot features of the strategy, for example, the use of  firm-fixed-price contracts and use of indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity  (IDIQ) contracts and interviewed Southwest Regional Maintenance  Center (SWRMC) in San Diego, California, who administered the pilot  contracts. We also interviewed senior NAVSEA  officials, including the  Commander, Navy Regional Maintenance Center (CNRMC) staff, and  contractors with experience in executing ship availabilities, to obtain their  perspectives on the strategy. To identify the progress the Navy had made  as of September 2016 in implementing the MAC-MO strategy, including  the \u201cgap ship\u201d contract awards, we interviewed and obtained information  from the Mid-Atlantic  Regional Maintenance Center (MARMC) staff in  Norfolk, Virginia and senior NAVSEA  contracting staff, and analyzed  supporting contract documentation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Navy Process Changes", "paragraphs": ["To assess process changes the Navy has made to address any  challenges and to capitalize on anticipated benefits, we analyzed Navy  documentation containing assessments of lessons learned from pilot  maintenance availabilities used to test key features of the MAC-MO  strategy. We identified a total of 18 lessons learned based on our  assessment the Navy\u2019s documentation of the San Diego pilot and USS  Porter maintenance availabilities. We categorized 11 of the lessons- learned as key because they were also identified as lessons-learned in  one or more interviews with NAVSEA officials knowledgeable about the  pilot ship experiences. We excluded 7 lessons that did not meet this  additional criterion. We interviewed Navy officials responsible for  availability  funding and oversight, contract administration, and program  management pertaining to the MAC-MO contracting strategy and pilot  availabilities. These offices included the Deputy Commander for Surface  Warfare; Commander, Naval Surface Force, Atlantic; Commander, Naval  Surface Force, Pacific; CNRMC; MARMC  in Norfolk, Virginia; SWRMC in  San Diego, California; and the Southeast Regional Maintenance Center  (SERMC) in Mayport, Florida. To assess the Navy\u2019s progress in taking  actions to address potential challenges posed by the 11 key lessons  learned, we evaluated Navy documents, including staffing and training  plans for the contracting workforce across the RMCs, proposals for  revised planning milestones, strategy and planning documents, and the  contents of contracts for the third-party planner. We also interviewed  Navy contracting, maintenance, and program management officials  previously mentioned. To assess the extent to which the Navy has taken  actions, we developed the following three-point scale:", "Not Met\u2014The Navy has not taken any action to respond to identified  lessons learned.", "Partially Met\u2014The Navy has taken some action to respond to the  identified lessons learned, but has not completed the action needed to  address the identified risk.", "Met\u2014The Navy has completed the action needed to address the  identified lesson learned.", "To identify roles and responsibilities for planning maintenance  availabilities, we reviewed procedural documents to ascertain the lead  offices that administer, plan and coordinate Navy availabilities,  including  organizations that oversee repair and modernization efforts at private  shipyards. In addition, as previously discussed, we interviewed officials  responsible for planning and implementing the strategy. To describe the  extent of maintenance overruns and their impact on the Navy, we used  information from a previous GAO report that analyzed ship maintenance  data from fiscal years 2011 to 2015, which included availabilities  conducted before and after Optimized Fleet Response Plan  implementation, to ascertain the extent to which maintenance  availabilities for surface combatants had been completed on time.", "To identify the extent to which the Navy has made provisions to assess  implementation of the strategy and if it is meeting its goals, we  interviewed senior NAVSEA  officials on whether performance metrics had  been developed to assess the strategy and if an organization had been  assigned responsibility. We used federal internal control standards to  determine if the Navy appropriately defined objectives related to the  contracting strategy; assessed its internal processes to identify risks  related to the strategy, including the development of performance  measures; and created strategies to mitigate those risks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ship Repair Industrial Base", "paragraphs": ["To assess how the MAC-MO  contracting strategy might affect the ship  repair industrial base for surface ships, we examined the ways in which  the strategy had the potential to increase competition opportunities and  how the contractors within the industrial base might respond to these  opportunities. To understand how IDIQ multiple award contracts and how  setting aside noncomplex work to small businesses might promote  competition, we identified how MAC-MO and MSMO contract provisions  differed, as previously described, and also obtained the perspectives of  NAVSEA  officials and selected contractors. To understand the potential  of IDIQ multiple award contracts for increasing competition, we selected  two contracts reflective of the work\u2014DDG 51 class ships in the homeport  of Norfolk, Virginia\u2014that would to be included under the MAC-MO  strategy. To do so, we analyzed documentation listing the availabilities  completed under two MSMO contracts\u2014one contract requiring a drydock  and one not requiring a drydock\u2014to ensure we covered the range of  availabilities that could be covered by a MAC-MO  complex and  noncomplex contract. We analyzed the data for consistency and  completeness, although we did not trace the data to the original contract  documentation. Since the purpose of this analysis was to illustrate how  the number of competitive opportunities contract awards could increase  under an IDIQ contract for one class of ships, and the Navy\u2019s  maintenance needs can change year by year, the results are not  generalizable to other availabilities or future time periods. In addition, to  understand how the Navy intends to promote the use of coast-wide  competitions, we interviewed NAVSEA policy officials about the  application of the Navy\u2019s June 1995 Ship Depot Maintenance  Solicitation  Policy and obtained data from CNRMC on the use of such competitions  under MSMO.", "To identify the Navy\u2019s projected workload for non-nuclear surface ships in  the homeports of Mayport, Florida; Norfolk, Virginia, and San Diego,  California, where the MAC-MO strategy will be implemented, we obtained  data from CNRMC from fiscal years 2015 through the end of 2020. The  CNRMC estimated these trends based on an analysis of needed staffing  resources, including data housed in the Navy Database Environment.  Since the purpose of our analysis was to show the Navy\u2019s projections in  anticipated port workload, we did not conduct our own assessment of the  accuracy of this data. We excluded data on the coast-wide competitions  from our analyses because these availabilities could be executed in ports  other than the ship\u2019s homeport.", "To obtain the perspective of contractors from the three homeports where  the MAC-MO  contracting strategy will implemented, we conducted semi- structured interviews to obtain viewpoints from selected 14 contractors.  We identified 30 contractors which (1) held MSMO contracts as prime  contractors under the MSMO contracting strategy, (2) the Navy identified  as potential competitors in the MAC-MO acquisition plan, and (3) the  Navy identified as potential competitors in its market research  documentation. From these 30 contractors, we selected 14 contractors  that represented a mix of these categories. Specifically, the 14  contractors included 6 former MSMO contract holders and 8 non MSMO contract holders, which comprised 7 small businesses and 7 large  businesses. We used data provided by the Navy to verify if the selected  contractors met the Navy\u2019s small business certification requirements. We  conducted 10 semi-structured interviews in person and 4 by  teleconference. The viewpoints of the 14 contractors are  nongeneralizable to all contractors which conduct and perform work  under Navy maintenance, repair, and modernization contracts.", "Further, we used a data collection instrument to collect information from  each of the selected 14 contractors on their facilities, workforce, and  sources of revenue. For example, we gathered information on what types  of facilities the contractor owned, such as a drydock or a pier, the number  of the contractor\u2019s full-time staff, and the percentage of revenue from  entities other than from the Navy. We verified that contractors did or did  not have drydocks for 10 of the 14 contractors during our onsite  contractor visits. We did not verify the number of full-time staff that the  contractor employed or the contractor sources of revenue.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2015 to November  2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named, Christopher R.
