Similarly, GAO found that the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative had only managed a small amount of spending through its four government-wide strategic sourcing initiatives in fiscal year 2011, although it reported achieving significant savings on those efforts. Further, we found that most selected agencies' efforts did not address their highest spending areas, such as services, which may provide opportunities for significant savings.", "Companies' keen analysis of spending is key to their savings, coupled with central management and knowledge sharing about the services they buy. Their analysis of spending patterns comprises two essential variables: the complexity of the service and the number of suppliers for that service. Knowing these variables for any given service, companies tailor their tactics to fit the situation, and do not treat all services the same. Leading companies generally agreed that foundational principles--maintaining spend visibility, centralizing procurement, developing category strategies, focusing on total cost of ownership, and regularly reviewing strategies and tactics--are all important to achieving successful services acquisition outcomes. Taken together, these principles enable companies to better identify and share information on spending and increase market knowledge about suppliers to gain situational awareness of their procurement environment and make more informed contracting decisions. Like the federal government, leading companies have experienced growth in spending on services, and over the last 5 to 7 years have been examining ways to better manage spending. Officials from seven leading companies GAO spoke with reported saving 4 to 15 percent over prior year spending through strategically sourcing the full range of services they buy, including those very similar to what the federal government buys--for example, facilities management, engineering, and information technology.", "Agencies have not fully adopted a strategic sourcing approach but some have actions under way. For example, in April 2013, DOD was assessing the need for additional resources to support strategic sourcing efforts, and noted a more focused targeting of top procurement spending categories for supplies, equipment, and services. VA reported that it had taken steps to better measure spending through strategic sourcing contracts and was in the process of reviewing business cases for new strategic sourcing initiatives. In 2012, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released a Cross-Agency Priority Goal Statement, which called for agencies to strategically source at least two new products or services in both 2013 and 2014 that yield at least 10 percent savings. In December 2012, OMB further directed agencies to reinforce senior leadership commitment by designating an official responsible for coordinating the agency's strategic sourcing activities.

Reasons for this  include a lack of leadership commitment within agencies, a desire on the  part of agency officials to maintain control over their contracting, a lack of  strategic sourcing expertise, data barriers, and perceptions about  strategic sourcing that increase the hesitancy to use it, such as a fear that  reporting savings will lead to budget cuts.

In addition to  leveraged buying, tactics include managing demand by changing  behavior, achieving efficiencies through standardization of the acquisition  process, evaluating total cost of ownership, and better managing supplier  relationships. We have particularly emphasized the importance of  comprehensive spend analysis for efficient procurement since 2002.  Spend analysis provides knowledge about how much is being spent for  goods and services, who the buyers are, who the suppliers are, and  where the opportunities are to save money and improve performance.  Private sector companies are using spend analysis as a foundation for  employing a strategic approach to procurement.", "We have previously reported that because procurement at federal  departments and agencies is generally decentralized, the federal  government is not fully leveraging its aggregate buying power to obtain  the most advantageous terms and conditions for its procurements.  Agencies act more like many unrelated, medium-sized businesses and  often rely on hundreds of separate contracts for many commonly used  items, with prices that vary widely. Recognizing the benefits of strategic  sourcing, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a  memorandum in 2005 that implemented strategic sourcing practices.  Agencies were directed to develop and implement strategic sourcing  efforts based on the results of spend analyses.", "In addition to individual agency efforts, a government-wide strategic  sourcing program\u2014known as the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative  (FSSI)\u2014was established in 2005. FSSI was created to address  government-wide opportunities to strategically source commonly  purchased products and services and eliminate duplication of efforts  across agencies. The FSSI mission is to encourage agencies to  aggregate requirements, streamline processes, and coordinate purchases  of like products and services to leverage spending to the maximum extent  possible. At the time of our 2012 report, four FSSI efforts were ongoing\u2014 focused on office supplies, domestic delivery of packages,  telecommunications, and print management\u2014and three were planned  related to SmartBUY, Wireless plans and devices, and publication  licenses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Expanded Use of Strategic Sourcing Could Save Billions in Federal Procurement Costs", "paragraphs": ["In our September 2012 report, we found that most of the agencies we  reviewed leveraged a fraction of their buying power through strategic  sourcing.

In fiscal year 2011,  DHS reported managing 20 percent of its spending and achieving savings  of $324 million. At the government-wide level, the FSSI program reported  managing $339 million through several government-wide initiatives in  fiscal year 2011 and achieving $60 million in savings, or almost 18  percent of the procurement spending it managed through these initiatives.  After strategic sourcing contracts are awarded, realizing cost savings and  other benefits depends on utilization of these contracts. We found that  only 15 percent of government-wide spending for the products and  services covered by the FSSI program went through FSSI contracts in  fiscal year 2011. Agencies cited a variety of reasons for not participating,  such as wanting to maintain control over their contracting activities, or  because the agency had unique requirements.

A spending  analysis reveals how much is spent each year, what was bought, from  whom it was bought, and who was purchasing it. The analysis also  identifies where numerous suppliers are providing similar goods and  services\u2014often at varying prices\u2014and where purchasing costs can  be reduced and performance improved by better leveraging buying  power and reducing the number of suppliers to meet needs. The FSSI  program and selected agencies generally cited the Federal  Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG)\u2014the federal  government\u2019s current system for tracking information on contracting  actions\u2014as their primary source of data, and noted numerous  deficiencies with these data for the purposes of conducting strategic  sourcing research. Agencies reported that when additional data  sources are added, incompatible data and separate systems often  presented problems. We have previously reported extensively on  issues agencies faced in gathering data to form the basis for their  spend analysis. However, some agencies have been able to make progress on conducting enterprise-wide opportunity analyses despite  flaws in the available data. For example, both the FSSI Program  Management Office and DHS told us that current data, although  imperfect, provide sufficient information for them to begin to identify  high spend opportunities. DHS has in fact evaluated the majority of its  10 highest-spend commodities and developed sourcing strategies for  seven of those based on its analysis of primarily FPDS-NG data.

For  example, Army officials cited a need for expertise in strategic sourcing  and spend analysis data, and OMB officials echoed that a key  challenge is the dearth of strategic sourcing expertise in government.  VA and Energy also reported this challenge. A few agencies have  responded to this challenge by developing training on strategic  sourcing for acquisition personnel. For example, the Air Force noted  that it instituted training related to strategic sourcing because it is  necessary to have people who are very strong analytically to do the  front-end work for strategic sourcing, and these are the hardest to  find. The training course facilitates acquisition personnel in obtaining  the strong analytical skills to perform steps like market evaluation. VA  has also begun to develop training to address this challenge.", "Leadership commitment: We also found in 2012 that most of the  agencies we reviewed were challenged by a lack of leadership  commitment to strategic sourcing, although improvements were under  way. We have reported that in the private sector, the support and  commitment of senior management is viewed as essential to  facilitating companies\u2019 efforts to re-engineer their approaches to  acquisition as well as to ensuring follow through with the strategic  sourcing approach. However, we found in 2012 that leaders at some  agencies were not dedicating the resources and providing the  incentives that were necessary to build a strong foundation for  strategic sourcing.", "Metrics: A lack of clear guidance on metrics for measuring success  has also impacted the management of ongoing FSSI efforts as well as  most selected agencies\u2019 efforts. We found that agencies were  challenged to produce utilization rates and other metrics\u2014such as  spending through strategic sourcing contracts and savings achieved\u2014 that could be used to monitor progress. Several agencies also  mentioned a need for sustained leadership support and additional  resources in order to more effectively monitor their ongoing initiatives.", "Agency officials also mentioned several disincentives that can discourage  procurement and program officials from proactively participating in  strategic sourcing, and at many agencies, these disincentives have not  been fully addressed by leadership. Key disincentives identified by  agency officials include the following:", "A perception that reporting savings due to strategic sourcing could  lead to program budgets being cut in subsequent years,", "Difficulty identifying existing strategic sourcing contracts that are  available for use as there is no centralized source for this information,", "A perception that strategically sourced contract vehicles may limit the  ability to customize requirements,", "A desire on the part of agency officials to maintain control of their", "Program officials\u2019 and contracting officers\u2019 relationships with existing", "The opportunity to get lower prices by going outside of strategically  sourced contracts.", "Leaders at some agencies have proactively introduced practices that  address these disincentives to strategically source. For example, DHS  and VA reported increasing personal incentives for key managers by  adding strategic sourcing performance measures to certain executives\u2019  performance evaluations. In addition, several agencies including DOD,  DHS, and VA have instituted policies making use of some strategic  sourcing contracts mandatory or mandatory \u201cwith exception,\u201d although the  extent to which these policies have increased use of strategic sourcing  vehicles is not yet clear. Some agencies have made use of automated  systems to direct spending through strategic sourcing contracts. For  example, FSSI issued a blanket purchase agreement through its office  supplies initiative that included provisions requiring FSSI prices to be  automatically applied to purchases made with government purchase  cards.

This represents over half of all government procurements.  Making services procurement more efficient is particularly relevant given  the current fiscal environment, as any savings from this area can help  agencies mitigate the adverse effects of potential budget reductions on  their mission. Moreover, our reports have shown that agencies have  difficulty managing services acquisition and have purchased services  inefficiently, which places them at risk of paying more than necessary.  These inefficiencies can be attributed to several factors. First, agencies  have had difficulty defining requirements for services, such as developing  clear statements of work which can reduce the government\u2019s risk of  paying for more services than needed. Second, agencies have not always  leveraged knowledge of contractor costs when selecting contract types.   Third, agencies have missed opportunities to increase competition for  services due to overly restrictive and complex requirements; a lack of  access to proprietary, technical data; and supplier preferences.", "We found that strategic sourcing efforts addressed products significantly  more often than services and that agencies were particularly reluctant to  apply strategic sourcing to the purchases of services. For example, of the top spending categories that DOD components reported targeting  through implemented strategic sourcing initiatives, only two are services.  Officials reported that they have been reluctant to strategically source  services for a variety of reasons, such as difficulty in standardizing  requirements or a decision to focus on less complex commodities that  can demonstrate success. Yet, like the commercial sector, federal  agencies can be strategic about buying services. For example, DHS has  implemented a strategic sourcing initiative for engineering and technical  services, which is also in the top 10 spending categories for the Army, Air  Force, and Navy.", "The reluctance of federal agencies to apply strategic sourcing to services  stands in sharp contrast to leading companies.

We reported on the results of this review in April 2013. Like  the federal government, leading companies have experienced growth in  spending on services, and over the last 5 to 7 years, have been  examining ways to better manage them. Officials from seven leading  companies GAO spoke with reported saving 4 to15 percent over prior  year spending through strategically sourcing the full range of services  they buy, including services very similar to what the federal government  buys: facilities management, engineering, and information technology, for  example.

This awareness positions companies to make more informed contracting  decisions.", "For example, in addition to leveraging knowledge about spending, leading  companies centralize procurement decisions by aligning, prioritizing, and  integrating procurement functions within the organization. The companies  we spoke with overcame the challenge of having a decentralized  approach to purchasing services, which had made it difficult to share  knowledge internally or use consistent procurement tactics. Without a  centralized procurement process, officials told us, companies ran the risk  that different parts of the organization could be unwittingly buying the  same item or service, thereby missing an opportunity to share knowledge  of procurement tactics proven to reduce costs. Company officials noted  that centralizing procurement does not necessarily refer to centralizing  procurement activity, but to centralizing procurement knowledge. This is  important because there is a perception in the federal community that  strategic sourcing requires the creation of a large, monolithic buying  organization.", "Companies also develop category-specific procurement strategies with  stakeholder buy-in in order to use the most effective sourcing strategies  for each category. Category-specific procurement strategies describe the  most cost-effective sourcing vehicles and supplier selection criteria to be  used for each category of service, depending on factors such as current  and projected requirements, volume, cyclicality of demand, risk, the  services that the market is able to provide, supplier base competition  trends, the company\u2019s relative buying power, and market price trends.  Company officials told us that category strategies help them conduct their  sourcing according to a proactive strategic plan and not just on a reactive,  contract-by-contract basis. One company\u2019s Chief Procurement Officer  referred to the latter as a \u201cthree bids and a buy\u201d mentality that can be very  narrowly focused and result in missed opportunities such as not  leveraging purchases across the enterprise or making decisions based  only on short term requirements. Similarly, Boeing says it sometimes  chooses to execute a short-term contract to buy time if market research  shows a more competitive deal can be obtained later.", "In addition, companies focus on total cost of ownership\u2014making a holistic  purchase decision by considering factors other than price. This is also  contrary to a perception that strategic sourcing can lose a focus on best  value. For example, while Walmart may often award a contract to the  lowest bidder, it takes other considerations into account\u2014such as  average invoice price, time spent on location, average time to complete a  task, supplier diversity, and sustainability\u2014when awarding contracts.  Humana is developing internal rate cards for consulting services that  would help the company evaluate contractors\u2019 labor rates based on their  skill level.

Two factors\u2014the degree of complexity of the service  and the number of available suppliers\u2014determine the choice of one of  four general categories of procurement tactics appropriate for that  service: leveraging scale, standardizing requirements, prequalifying  suppliers, and understanding cost drivers.

Typical tactics  applicable to this quadrant of services include consolidating purchases  across the organization; using fixed price contracts; developing  procurement catalogs with pre-negotiated prices for some services; and  varying bidding parameters such as volume and scale in order to find new  ways to reduce costs.", "For commodity services with few suppliers, such as specialized logistics  and utilities, companies focus on standardizing requirements. Typical  tactics applicable to this quadrant of services include paring back  requirements in order to bring them more in line with standard industry  offerings, and developing new suppliers to maintain a competitive  industrial base. For example, Walmart holds pre-bid conferences with  suppliers such as those supplying store security for \u201cBlack Friday\u201d\u2014the  major shopping event on the day after Thanksgiving\u2014to discuss  requirements and what suppliers can provide.

This dynamic,  strategic approach has helped companies demonstrate annual, sustained  savings. Companies generally aim to commoditize services over the long  term as much as possible because, according to them, the level of  complexity directly correlates with cost.

Companies have shown that it is possible to save money by strategically  managing services. They have done so not just by consolidating  purchases of simple, commodity-like services; they have devised  strategies and tactics to manage sophisticated services. Companies have  also shown that savings come over a wide base and that results can be  achieved with leadership, shared data, and a focus on strategic  categories that is dynamic rather than static.
