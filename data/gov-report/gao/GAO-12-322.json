However,  there are more local government employees than state government  employees (about 14 million compared with about 5 million), and while  local governments sometimes participate in plans administered by states,  the local governments generally retain responsibility for contributing the  employer\u2019s share of funding to the plans for their employees. As a result,  local governments contribute more to pension plans each state fiscal  year, overall, than do state governments (see fig. 1).", "Pension plans are generally characterized as either defined benefit or  defined contribution plans. Unlike in the private sector, defined benefit  plans provide primary pension benefits for most state and local  government workers. About 78 percent of state and local employees  participated in defined benefit plans in 2011, compared with only 18  percent of private sector employees. In a defined benefit plan, the  amount of the benefit payment is determined by a formula (in the public  sector, the formula is typically based on the retiree\u2019s years of service and  final average salary, and is most often provided as a lifetime annuity).  However, unlike private sector employees with defined benefit plans,  state and local government employees generally contribute to their  defined benefit plans.

Nor are they insured by the  Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation as private plans are. Federal law  generally does not require state and local governments to prefund or  report on the funded status of pension plans.

One alternative measure of financial condition across  pension plans, although not optimal when assessing the financial health  of a single plan, is the ratio of fund assets to annual expenditures. Fund  assets represent the dollar amount a plan has built up, while annual  expenditures ultimately determine how quickly assets are spent down.  Alternatively, when assessing the financial condition of an individual  defined benefit plan, various approaches are used, and looking at multiple  factors is especially useful in providing a more complete picture of a  plan\u2019s financial condition. In addition to the level of funding (level of plan  assets relative to plan liabilities), assessments of a plan\u2019s financial  viability by rating agencies and others may take into consideration the  influence of the plan sponsor, the plan\u2019s underlying methods and  assumptions, and efforts to manage risk (see table 2).", "As illustrated in figure 3, an analysis of historical Census Bureau data on  state and local government pensions shows that the ratio of fund assets  to annual expenditures fell during the stock market downturn related to  the oil crisis of the early 1970s, but eventually recovered and reached its  peak in 2000, driven by strong investment results throughout the 1990s.  Since that peak, both the market downturn in the early 2000s and  sustained economic weakness beginning in 2008 drove the ratio of  sector-wide assets relative to expenditures lower. Overall, these data  show that the aggregate ratio of fund assets to annual expenditures, as of  2009, is lower, but in line with historical norms dating back to 1957.", "At the same time, data on individual plans indicate that this measure can  vary considerably across plans.

This trend was predictable.  As public plans matured, they began to have greater proportions of retirees  to active workers. As such, payments to retirees increased relative to plan  contributions and, as a result, in more recent years, sector-wide  expenditures have outpaced contributions. Nevertheless, given the asset  levels of most state and local government plans and the pace of  expenditures relative to contributions, most plans can be expected to cover  their commitments for the near future with their existing assets.

Whereas under a defined benefit system, employer  contributions generally rise and fall depending in part on investment  returns, plan sponsors of a defined contribution system contribute a set  amount regardless of investment returns. This reduces the risk facing the  pension system as well as the state or locality sponsoring the plan.

Two states and one locality we reviewed limited  contributions in the short term by capping increases in employer  contributions or by simply postponing otherwise scheduled contributions.  Capping increases in contributions allowed these states and this locality  to temporarily suppress the increases that would otherwise have been  required given 2008 investment losses and other factors. In the case of  the Pennsylvania, the state addressed an expected 19 percent increase  in actuarially required contributions to the State Employees\u2019 Retirement  System by capping annual increases at 3 percent for 2012, 3.5 percent  for 2013, and 4.5 percent thereafter. Similarly, the Illinois Municipal  Retirement Fund allowed local plan sponsors to cap contribution  increases at 10 percent starting in 2010.", "Although adjusting plan funding produced some short-term savings for  state and local budgets, it also increased the unfunded liabilities of the  pension system and will necessitate larger contributions in the future. In  the case of Philadelphia, the city used its authority under state law to  partially defer pension payments by $150 million in fiscal year 2010 and  $90 million in 2011. While these deferrals helped the city reduce its  contributions in the short term, state law requires that the money be  repaid with interest by fiscal year 2014. The city has adopted a temporary  1 percent increase in the sales tax to help cover these future costs.", "Issuing pension obligation bonds (POB) is another funding strategy,  although relatively few states and localities have used it, as it can expose  plan sponsors to additional market risk. POBs are taxable general  obligation bonds that provide a one-time cash infusion into the pension  system. They convert a current pension obligation into a long-term, fixed  obligation of the government issuing the bond. POBs are issued for  generally one of two purposes: either to provide temporary budget relief  by financing a plan sponsor\u2019s actuarially required contribution for a single  year, or as part of a longer-term strategy for paying off a plan\u2019s unfunded  liability. Using POBs to pay off all or a portion of a plan\u2019s unfunded liability  potentially reduces future actuarially required pension contributions, but  requires plan sponsors to make annual debt service payments on the  POBs instead.", "We analyzed data on state and local government bond issuances  nationwide and found that other than the states of Illinois and  Connecticut, and the Chicago Transit Authority, most state and local  governments have not issued sizable POBs over the past 6 years (see  fig. 8). This type of pension funding has been limited, with only 25 or  fewer POB issuances in each of the last 6 years. The total amount of  POBs issued in a single year has not exceeded more than 1 percent of  total assets in state and local pension plans.", "These transactions involve significant risks for government entities  because investment returns on the bond proceeds can be volatile and  lower than the interest rate on the bonds. In these cases, POBs can leave  plan sponsors worse off than they were before, juggling debt service  payments on the POBs in addition to their annual pension contributions.  In a recent brief, the Center for State and Local Government Excellence  reported that by mid-2009, most POBs issued since 1992 were a net  drain on government revenues. In light of these concerns, officials in  Pennsylvania noted that the state had enacted legislation in 2010  prohibiting the use of POBs.", "Two of the pension systems included in our review\u2014Illinois and Sonoma  County, California\u2014have issued POBs since 2008. Illinois, which is  discussed at length below, has been the largest single issuer in recent  years, issuing over $7 billion in POBs since 2010. In the case of Sonoma  County, California, the county issued $289 million of POBs in 2010 with  maturities ranging up to 19 years. County officials explained that the  POBs were financially advantageous because they had an average  interest rate of just under 6 percent, which is lower than the 8 percent  expected return on the pension fund investments at the time the bonds  were issued. The difference between the POB interest rates and the  assumed rate of return is projected to save the county $93 million in  contributions over the life of the bonds. significantly. The POBs could increase the county\u2019s future expenses if  actual investment returns fall below 6 percent. Over the prior 10-year  period ending in 2010, the retirement system\u2019s average investment rate of  return was 4.1 percent, but returns over the prior 20-year period have  been significantly higher at 8.4 percent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States and Localities Often Combine Strategies", "paragraphs": ["States and localities often packaged multiple pension changes together.  For example, our analysis of the NCSL reports revealed that 23 states  have both increased employee contributions and reduced member  benefits. Each change made, and the interplay among the changes,  contributes to various impacts on plan sponsors, pension sustainability,  and plan members. The following examples demonstrate some of the  ways states have packaged these changes, and the varying impacts that  are expected as a result.", "The county pension system subsequently lowered its assumed rate of return to 7.75  percent. This action, along with any future actuarial changes, would affect the expected  savings from the POBs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Reducing Benefits and Increasing Contributions for New Members", "paragraphs": ["Missouri is an example of a state that packaged increases in member  contributions with reductions in benefits to narrow the gap between plan  assets and liabilities. For new general members of the Missouri State  Employees Retirement System and the Missouri Department of  Transportation and Highway Patrol Employees\u2019 Retirement System, the  state increased the normal retirement age from 62 to 67, expanded the  vesting period from 5 to 10 years, and required members to contribute 4  percent of pay to the pension system, although current members do not  contribute. These changes are expected to lower the state\u2019s contributions  to the system over the long run by more than 5 percent of payroll, but the  initial savings are much smaller. In fiscal year 2012, the benefit and  contribution changes are expected to reduce the state\u2019s contribution to its  largest plan by less than 1 percent of payroll, since there will be only a  small number of newly hired members in the system. However, by fiscal  year 2018, employees covered under the reduced benefit structure are  expected to account for over half of payroll, further reducing the state\u2019s  annual contributions. Plan officials said these changes could pose issues  for recruitment and retention, although the influence of retirement plan  details will vary based on individual circumstances.  They also noted that  the changes could affect employee morale, since new employees will  have to work longer to qualify for benefits and the required pension  contributions will reduce their compensation.", "In the case of Pennsylvania, the state passed a package of pension  changes in 2010 that offset a short-term funding cap with long-term  benefit reductions to limit the impact on the plan\u2019s funded status. For the  State Employees\u2019 Retirement System, the most significant funding  change was a statutory cap on employer contribution rate increases. The  legislation addressed an expected 19 percent increase in actuarially  required contributions by capping any increases at 3 percent for fiscal  year 2011/2012, 3.5 percent for fiscal year 2012/2013, and 4.5 percent  thereafter. In the short term, the caps effectively reduced the state\u2019s  expected contributions over the next 4 years by $2.5 billion. But in the  long term, the caps, along with other actuarial changes, are expected to  increase the state\u2019s pension contributions to the system by $7 billion over  the next 32 years. To help offset the additional long-term costs,  Pennsylvania enacted pension legislation calling for various benefit  reductions for future employees. For example, the state reduced the  benefit multiplier for future employees from 2.5 to 2 percent (with an  option for members to maintain the 2.5 multiplier by paying a higher  member contribution rate); increased the normal retirement age from 60  to 65; and expanded the vesting period from 5 to 10 years. These benefit  reductions will reduce future liabilities and are expected to lower the  state\u2019s pension costs by almost $8.5 billion over the next 32 years, for an  estimated net savings of $1.5 billion over the cost of the caps and other  funding adjustments. Both pension and budget officials said these  changes will help the state better manage rising pension contributions in  the short term, but the overall savings from the legislative package are  relatively modest over the long term. Meanwhile, the changes will require  new employees to work longer for lower benefits and will leave more  employees with no benefit at all. Plan officials said it is too early to tell if  this will affect employee recruitment and retention.", "In the case of Illinois, the state combined use of POBs, actuarial changes,  and benefit reductions to manage the state\u2019s pension costs. The state  issued $3.5 billion of POBs in 2010 and $3.7 billion in 2011 with  maturities up to 8 years and used the proceeds to fund the state\u2019s annual  contributions to various pension systems. An Illinois budget official  explained that issuing the POBs helped the state avoid making additional  spending cuts to other portions of the state\u2019s budget. Alternatively, given  the state\u2019s budgetary challenges, some pension officials said that if the  state had not issued the POBs, it is more likely that it would have not paid  its full required pension contributions.", "Use of POBs will be costly to Illinois, since the state will face annual debt  service payments of about $1 billion over the next 9 years. However, the  state increased individual and corporate taxes in 2010 and state budget  officials told us the state plans to use the additional revenue to fund these  debt service payments as well as other budgetary priorities. Whether the  state\u2019s statutorily required contributions are funded through POBs or  general revenue does not directly affect the financial condition of the  pension system. However, some pension officials were concerned that  the debt service payments on the POBs would reduce available funding  for future pension contributions.", "Illinois has also lowered employer contributions to the state\u2019s pension  systems in the short term by adjusting actuarial methods. In 2009, the  state required its pension systems to switch from a market value (no  smoothing) to a 5-year smoothing method for calculating actuarial assets  and employer contributions. Plan officials explained that the change was  intended to reduce the state\u2019s contributions and dampen the impact of  fiscal year 2009 market losses for the short term. As a result of the  change, the state\u2019s actuarially calculated contribution to the State  Employees\u2019 Retirement System of Illinois was reduced by $100 million in  the first year, according to plan officials. However, plan actuaries noted  that this strategy only defers contributions when plan assets experience a  loss, as they did in fiscal year 2009. Future contributions will be higher  than they would have been previously once the fiscal year 2009 market  losses are fully recognized.", "In addition to the use of POBs and actuarial changes, Illinois also reduced  benefits for new employees and applied the future savings to reduce  employer contributions in the short term. For example, the state raised  new employees\u2019 normal retirement age to 67, capped final average salaries used for pension purposes, and reduced annual COLAs.According to plan officials, these changes are expected to reduce the  State Employees\u2019 Retirement System\u2019s future liabilities by a third. State  budget officials said the projected total estimated savings for the state  over the next 35 years will be about $220 billion. Since the changes apply  only to new employees, the savings will slowly accrue over the next 35  years. Nevertheless, the state took advanced credit for these future  benefit reductions, further reducing contributions in the short term.  According to plan actuaries, by taking this advance credit, the state also  increased unfunded liabilities in the short term, adversely affecting its  retirement systems."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["State and local governments continue to experience the lingering effects  of investment losses and budget pressures in the wake of the recent  economic downturn.
