DOD  Instruction 4151.20 describes a series of mathematical computations and  adjustments that the armed services are required to use to compute their  core capability requirements and to identify the workload that needs to be  planned to support these requirements. Also, the instruction requires that  the armed services identify the weapon systems required to execute the  Joint Chiefs of Staff contingency scenarios, which represent plans for  responding to conflicts that may occur in the future. After systems are  identified, the armed services compute annual depot maintenance  capability requirements for peacetime, in direct labor hours, to represent  the amount of time they will regularly take to execute required  maintenance. An armed service may determine that repair capabilities for  certain systems maintained at the depots are so similar that they share  common base repair processes that can effectively satisfy the repair  requirements of other systems.", "During this process of identifying the systems for which they will be  required to maintain repair capabilities, DOD Instruction 4151.20 requires  that the armed services organize and aggregate their capability data by  categories of equipment and technologies known as work breakdown  structure categories. The work breakdown structure category is a  grouping of work associated with DOD\u2019s weapon systems and equipment.  DOD uses these categories to organize data on its various core capability  requirements and workloads to manage and report on its core  capabilities. There are 11 categories at the top level\u2014\u201dfirst level\u201d\u2014of the  work breakdown structure. A first-level category summarizes information  for an entire type of system or equipment. Table 1 shows the 11 first-level  categories of the work breakdown structure.", "A first-level category can be broken down into second-level  subcategories, which are the major elements that make up the system or  equipment in the first-level category. For example, the first-level category  for Aircraft can be broken down into the second-level subcategories for  Airframes, Aircraft Components, and Aircraft Engines, which are major  elements that make up an aircraft. The second-level subcategories can  be further broken down into third-level subcategories, which are  subordinate elements that make up the major elements in the second- level categories. For example, the second-level subcategory for Airframes  is further divided into the third-level subcategories\u2014different types of  airframes, such as Rotary, Fighter/Attack, or Bomber. The subcategories  can be further broken down to the lowest-level element of the system.  Lower-level categories are subcategories of the eleven first-level work  breakdown structure categories. DOD refers to these levels as \u201clevels of  indenture.\u201d The work breakdown structure can be expressed at any level  of detail down to the lowest-level part, such as a bolt.

According to OSD officials, these data should not be included in the Core  Report. However, in its review of the Core Report, OSD did not correct  this error. DOD Instruction 4151.20 requires the armed services to  calculate and report all planned workload that supports core capability  requirements and any additional workload performed at depots. The  Marine Corps\u2019 data contained this anomaly in the Sea Ships category  because DOD Instruction 4151.20 does not provide clear guidance on  how reporting agencies should report additional depot workload they  performed that has not been identified as a core requirement.", "The reporting agencies expressed concerns about the inter-service  workload data requested on the core submission worksheets because, as  we found, some of the services do not categorize their inter-service  workload in the same work breakdown structure category as the service  for which they are performing the workload or which is performing  workload for them. According to Air Force officials, one service\u2019s inter- service transfer-in (workload being performed by another service) may  not match another service\u2019s inter-service transfer-out (workload given to  another service to perform), because the services are not coordinating  verification that each service is accounting for inter-service workload in  the correct work breakdown structure category. Additionally, MDA is  reporting workload being performed by the Navy on MDA systems.  However, according to Navy officials, the Navy is not performing any work  on MDA systems that are identified as core. DOD Instruction 4151.20  requires the reporting agencies to report inter-service workload as part of  their core submission worksheet; however, the instruction does not  require the reporting agencies to coordinate on how they are capturing  their inter-service workload. The reporting agencies may not be  accurately capturing inter-service workload because DOD has not  provided any guidance on how they should coordinate to categorize their  workload in the same work breakdown structure category.", "Further, the reporting agencies are not calculating or displaying their  workload shortfalls consistently. For example, the Army and Air Force  calculate and display their shortfalls on the core submission worksheet,  while the Navy and Marine Corps\u2019 shortfalls are calculated by DOD and  not displayed on the core submission worksheet. The Navy and Marine  Corps did not calculate or display any shortfalls on their core submission  worksheets because, according to Navy and Marine Corps officials, DOD  Instruction 4151.20 does not require them to do so. In another example,  MDA reported shortfalls in each of the categories where it identified a  core capability requirement. However, as we previously mentioned,  according to MDA officials, they could not accurately calculate shortfalls  because MDA does not have any depots. Also, MDA did not display its  shortfalls on the core submission worksheet because DOD Instruction  4151.20 does not require it to do so. The reporting agencies are not  calculating or displaying their shortfalls consistently because DOD does  not provide the reporting agencies guidance on how to calculate or  display their shortfalls.", "Additionally, the reporting agencies are not consistently calculating the  estimated cost of planned workload as reported in the Core Report. For  example, the armed services use the Financial Management Regulation  as a basis for calculating their estimated cost of planned workload.  Specifically, Air Force officials stated that they calculated the estimated  cost of planned workload using rates from the Financial Management  Regulation and multiplied those rates by the rate per hour of the repair  group category or specific work type. In another example, MDA officials  stated that they use the Financial Management Regulation; however, its  calculation included private sector maintenance workload and costs for  the core planned workload. However, the Core Report should include cost  information only for workload performed at military depots, and not  workload performed by the private-sector. MDA officials told us that OSD  guidance does not explain how to calculate the estimated cost for core  planned workloads. OSD provided supplemental guidance as part of its  memorandum to the reporting agencies; however, the memorandum  stated that the estimated costs of performing the core planned workloads  only needed to be identified at the top level of the work breakdown  structure. Further, the DOD Instruction 4151.20 template for the core  submission worksheet does not include guidance on how to calculate the  cost. In the Core Report, MDA\u2019s reported estimated cost of planned  workload may not be accurate, because DOD does not provide guidance  to the reporting agencies on how to calculate the estimated cost of  performing the planned workloads. However, according to OSD and the  armed services, they do not use the estimated cost of planned workload  to make budgetary decisions.", "According to the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, management should design control activities to achieve  objectives and respond to risks and they should implement control  activities through policies. For example, management should design  control activities so that all transactions are completely and accurately  recorded.

An OSD official told us  that OSD answered questions the reporting agencies had as they were  assembling their information.

OSD did  not consistently include in the Core Report these similar capabilities that  were used to mitigate the shortfalls.
