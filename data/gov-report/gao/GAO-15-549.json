Each of the agencies GAO reviewed has designated officials responsible for strategic sourcing and created offices to identify and implement strategic sourcing opportunities, including those specific to IT services. Most of these agencies' IT services spending, however, continues to be obligated through hundreds of potentially duplicative contracts that diminish the government's buying power. These agencies managed between 10 and 44 percent of their IT services spending through preferred strategic sourcing contracts in fiscal year 2013. In contrast, GAO previously reported that leading companies generally strategically managed about 90 percent of their procurement spending, including services.", "Further, most of these agencies' efforts to strategically source IT services have not followed leading commercial practices, such as clearly defining the roles and responsibilities of the offices responsible for strategic sourcing; conducting an enterprise-wide spend analysis; monitoring the spending going through the agencies' strategic sourcing contract vehicles; or establishing savings goals and metrics. As a result, the agencies are missing opportunities to leverage their buying power and more effectively acquire IT services.", "Contracting officials from the agencies GAO reviewed generally had limited insights into the labor rates paid for similar IT services. GAO's analysis of 30 contract actions for similar IT services in fiscal year 2013 found that the agencies paid widely varying labor rates for similar services with the same contractors. The average difference between the lowest and highest labor rate for the categories GAO reviewed was 62 percent, in part due to geographic or work location, unique security, education or skill requirements, and the contractor unit performing the work. Further, for the 30 contract actions for IT services that GAO reviewed, the two contractors proposed more than 117 discrete labor categories\u2014some with multiple variations\u2014which complicated efforts to compare labor rates. Prior GAO reports on leading commercial practices have noted that companies use standardized labor categories for IT services to enable comparison of labor rates and ultimately realize cost savings. Several government-wide and agency-specific efforts to address aspects of these challenges, including providing tools to assess labor rate variations or streamlining labor categories, are under development or in their early implementation stages."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To improve efforts to strategically source IT services, GAO recommends that each agency conduct spend analysis, monitor spending, develop savings goals and metrics, and consider the use of standardized labor categories, as appropriate for their agency.

For over a decade, we have issued reports on how the  private sector has used strategic sourcing\u2014which moves away from  numerous individual procurements of goods and services to a broader  aggregate approach\u2014to reduce costs and improve quality. In 2013, we  found that leading commercial companies achieved savings of 4 to15  percent annually through strategically sourcing the full range of services  they buy, including IT services. Our work also found, however, that  federal agencies had generally been reluctant to strategically source their  high-spend services categories due to the difficulty in standardizing  requirements or a decision to focus on less complex commodities that  can demonstrate success and had not established utilization and savings  goals and metrics. In 2015, the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s  (OMB) Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy observed that far too  often, acquisition professionals continue to make purchases with little  insight into what their counterparts across the government are buying,  who they are buying it from, what they are paying, and how they are  buying it.", "You asked us to review government efforts to strategically source IT  services. This report addresses the extent to which (1) selected agencies  manage IT services spending through strategic sourcing approaches, and  (2) acquisition personnel had insight into labor rates for similar IT  services.", "We focused our review on three federal agencies that were among the  top spenders for IT services in fiscal year 2013\u2014the Departments of  Defense (DOD) and Homeland Security (DHS), and the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Collectively, these three  agencies obligated about $16.1 billion, or about 53 percent of the total  federal fiscal year 2013 obligations on IT services, as reported in the  Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG). Within  DOD, we focused our review on the departments of the Army, Navy, and  Air Force, which accounted for 62 percent of DOD IT services spending.", "To assess the extent to which selected agencies manage IT services  spending through strategic sourcing approaches, we interviewed officials  responsible for agency-wide strategic sourcing efforts, policy, and  guidance.

For each contract vehicle, we analyzed fiscal year 2013 IT  services spending based on data reported in FPDS-NG to assess the  extent to which these vehicles were used. We defined IT services to  include 34 relevant product service codes, such as IT strategy and  architecture services, based on our review of prior GAO work. We used  fiscal year 2013 FPDS-NG data because it was the most recent fiscal  year with complete government-wide obligation data when we initiated  our review. To assess the reliability of the FPDS-NG data, we reviewed  existing documentation and electronically tested the data to identify  obvious problems with completeness or accuracy. We determined that  these data were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of reporting  government-wide and agency spending on IT services. We also reviewed  and assessed each vehicle against OMB strategic sourcing guidance and  commercial leading practices identified in GAO prior work. Specifically,  we focused on agency efforts to manage their strategic sourcing efforts  and the extent to which they have policies, goals, and metrics for strategic  sourcing utilization as well as goals and metrics for calculating savings.  For the information technology services component of each vehicle, we  reviewed available acquisition strategy and planning documents,  business case analyses, briefings, relevant agency guidance, policy, and  regulation, and interviewed department level officials responsible for  strategic sourcing, as well as program officials responsible for execution  and administration of the vehicles.", "To assess the extent to which agency acquisition personnel have insights  into labor rates for similar IT services, we identified a high-spend IT  service category. We selected IT strategy and architecture services,  which was among the top five spend categories for each of the agencies  we reviewed and among the top two government-wide. IT strategy and  architecture relates to the planning, development, and maintenance of  software and solutions specifically to support government requirements.  We then selected a nongeneralizable sample of 30 contract actions with  two of the largest contractors common to these agencies. For these 30  case studies, we identified 12 categories and experience levels that were  common across at least two contract actions with a common contractor.  To compare the variation in labor rates for each category, we selected the  lowest and the highest rates for the relevant time period. To better  understand the factors that can affect variation in labor rates, we  interviewed officials for 11 of the contract actions and representatives of  the two contractors included in our review. We also provided them  examples of labor rate comparisons for discussion purposes. As a result,  we identified some of the factors that can affect labor rates for the same  labor categories such as whether the work is performed at a government  or contractor site; security clearance requirements; performing business  unit; education, experience, certifications, and skills required; and  contract type. While we did not control for these factors in our labor rate  analysis, we believe that our comparisons are informative because they  illustrate the extent to which agency acquisition personnel have insights  into labor rates for similar IT services.", "Finally, we reviewed government-wide and agency efforts to improve  government insight into labor rates for IT services and we compared  government practices to leading commercial practices identified in our  prior work.

While strategic sourcing may not be suitable for all procurements, we  found that leading companies generally strategically manage about 90  percent of their procurement spending, including the full range of services  they buy.", "Strategic sourcing begins with an opportunity assessment\u2014an analysis of  spending and the identification of products and services for which  strategic sourcing should be implemented. Spend analysis provides  knowledge about how much is being spent for which products and  services, who the buyers are, who the suppliers are, and where the  opportunities are for leveraged buying and other tactics to save money  and improve performance. Once a product or service is selected for  strategic sourcing, a standardized process is followed to develop,  implement, and manage the sourcing strategy for that product or service.  Key strategic sourcing practices include processes to track and manage  performance through goals and metrics for utilization and savings to help  ensure that the benefits of strategic sourcing are achieved. Figure 1  illustrates the key steps in the strategic sourcing process.", "In our 2013 report on leading commercial practices, we reported that  leading companies do not take a one-size-fits-all approach to strategic  sourcing, but rather they tailor their tactics based on two factors\u2014the  degree of complexity of the service and the number of available  suppliers\u2014to determine the choice of procurement tactics appropriate for  that service. Less complex services, referred to as commodity services,  are those where requirements are relatively easy to define and  performance more clearly measured; for example, housekeeping,  telecommunications, and maintenance services. More complex services,  referred to as knowledge-based services, are those where requirements  are more complex, performance is more difficult to measure, and where  service provider staff skill levels are paramount; for example, information  technology services, engineering and management support, and legal  services. For knowledge-based services with many suppliers, such as  information technology, typical tactics include prequalifying suppliers by  skill level and labor hour rates to eliminate non-competitive companies;  tracking supplier performance over time to inform companies\u2019  prioritization of suppliers based on efficiency; and continually measuring,  tracking, and managing suppliers to ensure optimal performance. In the  long term, companies try to address their procurement constraints by  reducing requirements complexity to commoditize services and  developing new suppliers to increase competition. This allows companies  to more aggressively leverage their buying power for all types of services.  Figure 2 shows how the two factors help companies categorize different  services and select appropriate tactics.", "After strategic sourcing contracts are awarded, realizing cost savings and  other benefits depends on utilization of these contracts and efforts to  drive as much applicable spending through the contracts as possible.  Officials from the leading commercial companies we reviewed in our prior  work told us that the key to an effective centralized process is ensuring  that services spending goes through approved contracts. Companies  focus on compliance in order to eliminate unapproved purchases. The  leading companies we reviewed also established annual savings  expectations to drive a corporate culture of savings.", "Lastly, our prior work found that private companies had also identified  inefficiencies such as paying different rates for similar services. For  example, we found one company conducted a year-long spend analysis  effort which revealed, among other things, cases where a supplier  charged different rates to different departments for the same service.  Private companies were ultimately able to use this information to reduce  costs and better manage suppliers and to determine the point at which  reduction in price may diminish quality of performance. This dynamic,  strategic approach has helped companies demonstrate annual, sustained  savings of 4 to 15 percent annually for the services they buy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OMB Strategic Sourcing Guidance and Government-wide Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Since 2005, OMB has directed federal agencies to take action to leverage  and control government spending through strategic sourcing.

OMB also directed agencies to establish a  structure for strategic sourcing governance at the agency level and  provided that the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) may  identify commodities that could be strategically sourced government-wide.  In response to OMB direction, the General Services Administration  established the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI) in 2005 to  address government-wide opportunities to strategically source commonly  purchased products and services and eliminate duplication of efforts  across agencies. Current FSSI efforts include office supplies, janitorial  supplies, and domestic delivery services.", "In December 2012, OMB further directed agencies to reinforce senior  leadership commitment by designating an official responsible for  coordinating the agency\u2019s strategic sourcing activities. OMB also  established the Strategic Sourcing Leadership Council, comprised of the  seven largest and highest spending agencies to take a leadership role on  strategic sourcing. OMB called upon these agencies to lead government- wide strategic sourcing efforts by taking steps such as recommending  management strategies for specific goods and services\u2014including  several that are IT-related\u2014to ensure that the federal government  receives the most favorable offer possible. Additionally, OMB directed  these agencies to promote strategic sourcing practices inside their  agencies by taking actions including collecting data on procurement  spending. OMB\u2019s memorandum noted that government-wide strategic  sourcing efforts should include minimum characteristics including the  collection of sufficient pricing, usage, and performance data to enable  active commodity management. Further, OMB established a Cross- Agency Priority Goal Statement for Fiscal Years 2013 and 2014 which  directed agencies to reduce the costs of acquiring common products and  services by strategically sourcing at least two new commodities or  services in both 2013 and 2014 that yield at least a 10 percent savings  and increase their use of FSSI vehicles by at least 10 percent in both  fiscal years 2013 and 2014.", "In December 2014, OFPP issued a memorandum that directs agencies to  take specific actions to implement category management, an approach  based on leading practices that aims to manage entire categories of  spending across government for commonly purchased goods and  services. The memorandum notes that despite some progress in  implementing strategic sourcing, agencies continue to duplicate  procurement efforts, and award contracts for similar services to the same  vendors, which imposes significant costs on contractors and agencies.  The category management approach includes strategic sourcing and  other strategies to drive performance (i.e., developing common standards  in practices and contracts, driving greater transparency in acquisition  performance, and improving data analysis); and is intended to address  problems including significant contract duplication across government and  limited sharing of pricing and other contract information between agencies  and industry.", "As part of this effort, the Strategic Sourcing Leadership Council, which  was renamed the Category Management Leadership Council, approved  breaking down spending into 10 common categories such as IT, travel,  and construction, which, according to OFPP, altogether accounted for  $277 billion in fiscal year 2013 federal procurements. Each category will  be led by a team of experts who will develop a common, government- wide strategy for smarter buying. An online portal called the Common  Acquisition Platform, currently in development by GSA, is intended to  compile all acquisition categories in one place for easier navigation of  purchasing options and include agency provided data on prices paid by  their customers for goods and services; contract performance  assessments; best buying practices; and other contract information to  allow for appropriate comparisons between contracts.

At that time, the Army could not provide  information on all the department\u2019s strategic sourcing efforts because  planning and execution was carried out in a decentralized manner.

In planning and implementing EAGLE II, DHS refined its  savings methodology and increased the savings factor to 5 percent. To  do so, DHS analyzed historical task orders under EAGLE I and confirmed  that increased task order competition results in additional savings  achieved off of the contract ceiling rates. In fiscal year 2013, EAGLE  reported a total savings of $39 million based on $1.3 billion in obligations  through EAGLE I and EAGLE II. The DHS Chief Information Officer has  also set enterprise-wide savings goals for IT in response to PortfolioStat  expectations and identified a number of approaches to achieve savings  including the use of strategically sourced vehicles. DHS, however, has  not set a utilization and savings goal for IT services, even though that  spending may be managed through EAGLE I and EAGLE II contracts as  well as other DHS strategic sourcing vehicles.

Air Force officials  responsible for strategic sourcing noted that there are plans to look more  closely at NETCENTS spending through a new business intelligence  effort. Specifically, in January 2015, the Secretary of the Air Force  announced plans to create a new Information Technology Business  Analytics Office to collect empirical data and metrics to help with a data- driven approach to better understanding spending. Representatives from  this office reported that the analysis is being used by senior Air Force  leaders to determine by base and major command where spending is  occurring outside of Air Force mandatory use vehicles, to increase  enforcement, and to help project future IT requirements. The Air Force  does not currently track savings associated with the use of NETCENTS  for IT services, even though the total contract ceiling for services is $16.1  billion, more than double the ceiling of $7.4 billion for products. A  NETCENTS program official reported that his office does not have the  resources or data needed to calculate savings for services which would  require a comparison between actual labor rates paid to the maximum  labor rates proposed by vendors, or a comparison of actual labor rates  paid to the independent government cost estimate based on historical  costs, data that is not routinely collected.", "The Navy\u2019s April 2012 policy requires the use of certain contracts for IT  services through its IT commodity strategy, though it lacks a utilization  goal regarding the amount of addressable spending that should be going  through these contracts. A senior official from the Navy\u2019s strategic  sourcing program office acknowledged that decisions to initiate new  contracts rather than leverage existing vehicles are not being properly  supported or justified and existing contract solutions could be used more  regularly. The official also noted that while the office reviews Navy  spending based on FPDS-NG data to assess usage of the established  vehicles, it does not play a direct role in managing spending as the  decisions to contract outside of the existing vehicles is made on a  decentralized basis. He recommended that the Navy\u2019s policy be more  directive and authoritative and that exceptions, which are approved at the  major command level, be subject to greater oversight. To calculate the  savings achieved through its IT commodity strategy, the Navy calculated  savings based on comparing the independent government cost estimates  with the actual prices paid for specific IT services acquisitions and  reported savings of $8 million for fiscal year 2013.", "The Army does not have a mandatory use policy or attempt to track  savings for IT services under its CHESS contract vehicle. For example,  the Army\u2019s CHESS vehicle is mandatory for purchases of commercially  available hardware, but not for services even though the total contract  ceiling of $20.4 billion for services is about double the $10.5 billion ceiling  for products. A CHESS program official noted that the vehicle provides  users with access to a number of qualified IT services vendors and in  contrast with other non-Army vehicles it does not charge a fee for its use.  The official also stated that CHESS is a preferred source for IT services,  but the rationale for not requiring use of CHESS for IT services is to allow  Army components greater flexibility to select the vendor that can meet  their needs most efficiently, including small businesses, of which there  are few options under CHESS. The next generation of the CHESS  Information Technology Enterprise Solutions-2 Services contract is in the  acquisition planning process and expected to be awarded in 2017. The  Army intends to apply the strategic sourcing process, and the vehicle is  being designed to include more small businesses.", "NASA\u2019s IT Infrastructure Integration Program (I3P) contracts were  intended to consolidate a number of previously existing NASA enterprise- wide contracts and center contracts, but they were not created based on  a comprehensive analysis of the agency\u2019s IT services spending. In  August 2011, the NASA Chief Information Officer, Assistant Administrator  for Procurement, and the Deputy Chief Acquisition Officer issued a joint  memorandum directing NASA buyers to consider the use of existing  NASA contracts, including I3P, for the procurement of IT products and  services. In April 2014, NASA also issued policy requiring the use of I3P  for NASA\u2019s end user services, such as help desk and data backup  services. Despite these policies, a senior official from NASA\u2019s office of the  Chief Information Officer noted that NASA centers continue to manage  their own contracts for certain IT services. The official further noted that  NASA is working to develop a better understanding of agency-wide  spending following the 2014 NASA Inspector General report. NASA  officials also noted that they are considering changes for future contract  awards to incorporate lessons learned.

For these  12 labor categories, we found differences between the lowest and highest  rates for a single category and level ranging from 18 percent to 183  percent. Across all our comparisons, the highest rates were an average  62 percent higher than the lowest.

Representatives from one of  the contractors we reviewed also told us that the business sector  performing the contract can be an important factor in determining the  labor rate.

For example, Navy  officials noted that they considered checking labor rates for an IT services  requirement with rates paid under the Army\u2019s CHESS contract, but found  that they had difficulty identifying a point of contact. These officials  stressed that given their workload and the short timeframes generally  afforded to prepare for and negotiate contracts, they need reliable  information they can readily access if the information was to be of any  utility to them.", "Some contracting officials cited published GSA schedule rates as their  only source of data on labor rates for similar services outside of their  agencies. As we have recently reported, contracting officers noted that  some GSA schedule vendors set their rates as a ceiling and routinely  discount prices for orders. In these cases, published schedule rates  likely do not represent the lowest rates available. For example, one DOD  component was charged $163.85 per hour for a systems architect and  officials were aware that the rate represented a discount from the GSA  published rate, but did not have access to data showing that another  DOD component obtained a rate of $126.96 with the same contractor for  a systems architect.", "Further, contracting officials told us that variations in individual labor  category titles present another barrier to the comparison of labor rates. To  illustrate the variation in labor category titles, our analysis of the 30  contract actions awarded to two contractors for similar IT services  identified 117 discrete labor category titles, coupled with multiple and  differing experience scales, leading to 199 unique labor category and  experience level combinations. For example, when identifying its  proposed systems engineer staff, one contractor used the scale junior or  senior for one task order and systems engineering I, II, or III for another  task order, even though the type of service to be provided was similar.", "Our prior work on commercial leading practices noted that without  centralized procurement knowledge such as comparable labor rate  information, companies ran the risk that different parts of the organization  could be unwittingly buying the same item or service, thereby missing an  opportunity to share knowledge of procurement tactics proven to reduce  costs. For example, officials at one company noted a lack of standardized  data on the type or category of labor acquired, and the cost per hour of  the labor, hampered efforts to use existing information to more effectively  manage service spending. In contrast, officials from one company  reported that collecting standardized data on the cost of labor hours by  skill set enabled the company to aggressively negotiate future labor and  overhead rates with service providers.", "Similar to these efforts, DHS\u2019s EAGLE II and GSA\u2019s Alliant vehicles have  developed standardized labor categories and descriptions based on  private sector best practices. According to DHS officials, standardized  labor categories facilitate the collection and analysis of labor rates which  the agencies can use to better manage their suppliers and compare  prices paid. DHS officials explained that while EAGLE I used common  labor category names, DHS had difficulty comparing labor rates across  EAGLE I task orders due to variance in experience scales between  contractors. As a result of this lesson learned and to improve ease of  contract use, EAGLE II contractors must adhere to a standard labor  category experience scale. Similarly, according to GSA officials, the  solicitation for GSA\u2019s Alliant II contract will establish 31 standardized labor  categories and four experience levels for contractors to use in their  proposals. GSA also plans to collect transactional data from IT services  contractors which it intends to provide transparency into prices paid and  other factors. Further, GSA used standardized labor categories and  experience levels for Alliant I and provides the median prices paid for  each labor category by contractor for each year of the contract. According  to program officials from the CHESS, NETCENTS, and I3P vehicles we  reviewed, they have not started to collect data to assess variation in labor  rates which limits their knowledge and insights needed to reduce contract  costs and identify other efficiencies.", "GSA officials stated that a key principle underlying development of a  standard list of labor categories is to allow for customization at the task  order level. These officials explained that if the standard list is too  detailed, there is a greater chance that it will be viewed as inappropriate  for specialized requirements. One contractor told us that government  specified labor categories and descriptions can be beneficial because  they help the contractor understand the scope of work and what  qualifications the government anticipates as necessary to complete the  task and for price evaluation, it helps ensure that all competitors are on a  level playing field. One drawback noted is that the contractor must map  actual performers to government categories which may be different than  the contractor\u2019s current labor category structure.

It involves identifying core categories of  spend, and developing heightened levels of expertise, sharing best  practices, providing streamlined solutions, and managing supply and  demand for each of the categories. The objective is to increase efficiency  and effectiveness while reducing costs and redundancies. The  memorandum directs agencies, including executive agents of  government-wide acquisition contracts and managers of multi-agency and  enterprise-wide contracts, to provide data on rates paid by their  customers; contract performance assessments; and best buying  practices.

This tool provide users with price  comparisons based on search parameters including labor category  description, years of experience, education level, business size, and  contractor versus government work site pricing. For example, with the tool  a user can identify prices for a senior engineer with a specific education  level and will generate information such as the average hourly labor rate  as well as the range of prices paid. Although it is too soon to evaluate the  effectiveness of this tool, it has the potential to provide contracting staff  with greater visibility into labor category rates with enough fidelity to  account for many of the same factors we identified as contributing to price  variation.", "DOD\u2019s Contract Business Analysis Repository will allow DOD acquisition  personnel to evaluate pricing information for all negotiated contract  actions exceeding $25 million.

Each agency has designated individuals to serve as their agency\u2019s  strategic sourcing accountable official; established, to varying degrees,  policies governing strategic sourcing efforts; and has designated contract  vehicles as their preferred strategic sourcing solution for IT services. As  such, these agencies are following the path taken by the leading  commercial companies we previously reviewed. However, it takes much  more than putting a contract into place to fully implement strategic  sourcing approaches. At the enterprise level, most agencies have  opportunities to better adopt leading commercial practices by conducting  spend analysis for IT services, monitoring the use of their strategic  sourcing vehicle in comparison to their total spending on IT services,  establishing utilization goals and metrics; establishing policies requiring  the mandatory use or consideration of their preferred strategic sourcing  contract vehicle and taking steps to monitor compliance with such  policies, and identifying methods for calculating savings and setting  savings goals. For example, the amount of spending through these  agencies\u2019 preferred strategic sourcing contract vehicles ranged from 10  percent at the Navy to 44 percent at DHS, which falls far short of the 90  percent that leading commercial companies obtained. Following these  leading practices enabled commercial companies to achieve annual  savings of 4 to 15 percent. Translated into the federal environment,  achieving even a 4 percent savings on the $30 billion federal agencies  obligated on IT services in fiscal year 2013 would result in over $1 billion  in savings or efficiencies. Moreover, these steps can help agencies carry  out responsibilities to reduce the costs and administrative efforts of  maintaining hundreds of potentially duplicative contracts. Until such time  that agencies establish such policies, goals, and metrics, they remain at  risk of missing opportunities to better manage their spending on IT  services.", "At the tactical, contracting level, a key practice undertaken by some  leading commercial companies is to obtain better insights into the actual  prices paid for IT services. To do so often required companies to improve  their business intelligence tools, standardize labor categories, and collect  data on the actual prices paid for such services. Federal acquisition and  contracting officials we interviewed believed that such information would  be beneficial, but they acknowledged they currently lack the tools and  capacity to do so in a timely and reliable manner. As a result, the  capability does not currently exist for agency contracting officials to know  how the prices they obtained compare to those obtained by other  contracting officers, including those within their own agency. The goal  should not necessarily to obtain the lowest price, but to have insights  about where a labor rate falls in the spectrum of prices being paid by  other agencies. Armed with this information, contracting officers can  better determine whether a contractor may be charging too much or too  little, but also identify if a requirement is driving contractors to charge  more or less than expected. Either way, such insights are the basis to ask  questions and obtain more in depth knowledge. Further, the hundreds of  labor categories and experience levels we found for the 30 contract  actions reviewed also show the significant challenges contracting officers  face to compare labor rates. Some agencies, such as DHS, have taken  steps to reduce the number of labor categories to which contractors must  propose in order to collect data necessary to assess variation in labor  rates, but the Army and Air Force have not.
