Establishing  Army Futures Command is reported to be the most significant institutional  change to the Army since it reorganized in 1973 after the Vietnam War.  According to Army documentation, the intent of the new command is to  provide unity of command, accountability, and modernization at the speed  and scale required to prevail in future conflicts. The organization is led by  a four-star general like its organizational peers: Army Materiel Command,  Training and Doctrine Command, and Forces Command. The Army  declared the commencement of operations for the command in July 2018,  and has begun to define its organizational structures. Army Futures  Command is expected to be fully operational by July 2019, meaning it will  have sufficient staff with operational facilities, secure funding, and the  ability to execute its assigned mission, roles, and responsibilities.", "Army Futures Command is headquartered in Austin, Texas. According to  Army officials and documentation, the Army chose Austin because of its  proximity to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics talent, as  well as private sector innovators that officials believe will assist the  command in achieving its modernization goals. According to senior Army  leadership, the new command headquarters will have around 300 staff in  place by July 2019, a workforce that may grow to as many as 500 employees\u2014100 military and 400 civilians. Our analysis of Army\u2019s plans  for initial staffing at the Army Futures Command headquarters, based on  data from July 1, 2018, found that about one-third of headquarters staff  would be involved directly in modernization efforts, such as engineers and  operations specialists, and the remaining two-thirds would consist of  support staff, including legal counsel and contracting professionals.", "According to Army Futures Command officials and documentation, the  new organization will be organized around three major components:", "Futures and Concepts Center is responsible for identifying and  prioritizing capability and development needs and opportunities.

Each cross-functional team consists of core staff and subject  matter experts from across the Army. To facilitate the rapid approval of  requirements, each cross-functional team is led by a general officer or a  senior civilian official who could communicate directly with the highest  levels of the Army. The goal of staffing these teams is to ensure that each  team had individuals who specialized in acquisition, requirements,  science and technology, test and evaluation, resourcing, contracting, cost  analysis, sustainment, and military operations. The goal of bringing  different experts together is to facilitate collaboration and immediate  opportunities for stakeholders to provide input as opposed to the more  traditional requirements development process, in which input has typically  been provided separately. Officials told us that, while all of these subject  matter experts may have provided input on the requirements  development process in the past, placing them on a single team offers the  promise of streamlining those efforts and could eliminate the need for  multiple reviews.

The leading  practices and their implementation by the cross-function teams are  described in table 2 below.", "In addition to the practices listed above, the cross-functional team pilots  generally applied leading practices for requirements development. One  leading practice the teams generally applied was promoting  communication between requirements developers, warfighters, and  industry representatives. This enables the cross-functional teams to  better match developer resources with end-user needs.", "While applying this practice, the cross-functional team pilots had initial  progress in writing requirements documents more efficiently. According to  cross-functional team officials, they were able to shorten the requirements  development process for several capabilities.", "However, we found that Army Futures Command does not have a formal  plan to identify and share lessons learned from cross-functional team  pilots to incorporate or expand application of these leading practices.  Doing so would allow Army Futures Command the opportunity to  accelerate the progress these teams made and spread the benefits  across all of the teams and a wider range of specific military capabilities  they are pursuing. We recommended that the Army (1) incorporate cross- functional teams\u2019 experiences in applying leading practices and (2)  execute a process for identifying and incorporating lessons learned. The  Department of Defense concurred with these recommendations, and  stated that Army Futures Command expects to apply leading practices  and capture lessons learned by the end of 2019.", "Our January 2019 report also identified leading practices for mergers and  organizational transformations. These leading practices are listed in table  3 below.", "We found that the Army Futures Command had implemented some of  these practices, particularly leadership\u2019s dedication to the new command  and the clear statement of its mission. However, we have previously  reported that, according to federal internal controls standards, it is  important to implement all of these practices in order to establish the  organizational structure necessary to enable an entity to plan, execute,  control, and assess the organization in achieving its objectives.  Establishment of this structure is particularly important for the Army where  leadership and its priorities can change frequently. Therefore, we  recommended in January 2019 that Army Futures Command fully apply  these leading practices.

Historically, the Army has been unable to ensure that  requirements for new capabilities are feasible due, in part, to a declining  workforce for requirements development. In June 2017, we reported that  the Army had prioritized combat readiness over resourcing its  requirements development process to meet future readiness needs. We  recommended that the Army assess the resources, particularly personnel,  necessary for requirements development. The Army concurred with the  recommendation, and has stated it would implement this recommendation  once Army Futures Command is fully operational. As Army Futures  Command centralizes and takes responsibility for requirements  development, this recommendation is even more pertinent.

Many of these programs failed to provide any capability to  the warfighter despite the considerable time and funding expended. Some  examples of these cancelled programs are listed in table 4 below.", "While the Army has dedicated significant funding towards its long-term  modernization priorities, other changes may also be needed. Among  them, we recommended in our January 2019 report, that Army Futures  Command take steps to follow our leading practices to mature technology  to a sufficiently high level prior to system development, which can reduce  risk.", "There are indications that, in some cases, the Army plans to mature  technology to a sufficiently high level prior to system development. For  example, officials from the Future Vertical Lift cross-functional team told  us they will complete technology demonstrations on two competitive  prototypes before choosing to develop a design for the Future Attack  Reconnaissance Aircraft. However, we found that the Army may continue  its past practice of proceeding into system development with less mature  technologies. In particular, we identified some plans to mature  technologies in a relevant environment prior to authorizing the start of a  new acquisition program, rather than the higher level of demonstrating  them in an operational environment as recommended by our leading  practices. This increases risk that new capabilities will require further  maturation in system development, which could raise costs and extend  timelines for delivery of equipment to the warfighter.", "We recommended in our January 2019 report that the Army should  demonstrate technologies in an operational environment before starting a  formal acquisition program. The Department of Defense concurred with  the recommendation and stated that the Army Futures Command will  execute a new development process that will include operational  technology demonstrations. Pilot processes for this are expected to begin  in 2019.", "In summary, we recognize that the Army is early in its modernization  efforts but could make changes now that would be helpful. Army Futures  Command should implement not only the leading practices we describe  as well as the lessons learned by its own cross-functional teams. The  Army should also increase the transparency of its efforts by clarifying how  it evaluates its progress towards modernization goals and clearly stating  the full costs of pursuing those goals.
