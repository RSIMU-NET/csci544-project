Specifically, this report discusses: (1) the current system for adjudicating matters of federal law in American Samoa and how it compares to those in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI); (2) the reasons offered for or against changing the current system for adjudicating matters of federal law in American Samoa; (3) potential scenarios and issues associated with establishing a federal court in American Samoa or expanding the federal jurisdiction of the local court; and (4) the potential cost elements and funding sources associated with implementing those different scenarios.

Reasons offered for changing the existing system focus primarily on the difficulties of adjudicating matters of federal law arising in American Samoa, principally based on American Samoa's remote location, and the desire to provide American Samoans more direct access to justice. Reasons offered against any changes focus primarily on concerns about the effects of an increased federal presence on Samoan culture and traditions and concerns about juries' impartiality given close family ties. During the mid-1990s, several proposals were studied and many of the issues discussed then, such as the protection of local culture, were also raised during this study. Based on previous studies and information gathered for this report, GAO identified three potential scenarios, if changes were to be made: (1) establish a federal court in American Samoa under Article IV of the U.S. Constitution, (2) establish a district court in American Samoa as a division of the District of Hawaii, or (3) expand the federal jurisdiction of the High Court of American Samoa. Each scenario would present unique issues to be addressed, such as what jurisdiction to grant the court. The potential cost elements for establishing a federal court in American Samoa include agency rental costs, personnel costs, and operational costs, most of which would be funded by congressional appropriations. Exact details of the costs to be incurred would have to be determined when, and if, any of the scenarios were adopted. The controversy surrounding whether and how to create a venue for adjudicating matters of federal law in American Samoa is not principally focused on an analysis of cost effectiveness, but other policy considerations, such as equity, justice, and cultural preservation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["American Samoa is unique among U.S. insular areas in that it does not  have a federal court.

In  the mid-1990s, legislative proposals were developed that would have  included the establishment of a federal court in American Samoa.

Then, again, in February 2006,  the Delegate from American Samoa introduced legislation in the U.S.  Congress to establish a federal court in American Samoa and later that  month, the American Samoa legislature held a public hearing to solicit  public comments.

Rather, our purpose is to provide  decision makers with information regarding the issues associated with  potential scenarios for change.", "To meet our objectives, we reviewed historical documents, congressional  testimonies, law review articles, and previous studies, and conducted  interviews with federal government officials, to include: the Administrative  Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC); the Department of the Interior (DOI);  the Department of Justice (DOJ); the General Services Administration  (GSA); the U.S. Attorneys offices serving federal courts located in CNMI  and Guam, Hawaii, and USVI; the Inspector General offices of the  Departments of Education, Homeland Security, Transportation, and  Health and Human Services; the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth  Circuit; the U.S. District Court of Hawaii; the District Court for the  Northern Mariana Islands; the District Court of Guam; and the District  Court of the Virgin Islands. We also reviewed historical documents and  court statistical data from and conducted interviews with American Samoa  government officials in the legislative, judicial, and executive branches of  government. In addition, to address the first three objectives, we held  group discussions with members of the local bar association and the local  chamber of commerce, and conducted a public forum with college  students and members of the general public during our visit to American  Samoa in October 2007. Further, we established an e-mail account and  received comments from the general public regarding their views on  possible scenarios for establishing a federal court in American Samoa or  expanding the federal jurisdiction of the High Court of American Samoa.  Although these views cannot be generalized to the population of American  Samoa as a whole, they provided us with a better understanding of the  range of issues that were important to members of the local community.  To address the first three objectives, we also interviewed recognized legal  experts on territorial governance issues. These experts were not intended  to be representative of all expert opinions on American Samoa judicial  issues, but were contacted because they could provide insights on  territorial governance issues in general. For the fourth objective, we  collected available data regarding the potential cost elements and funding  sources related to establishing a federal court in American Samoa from  AOUSC, GSA, and DOJ\u2019s Executive Office for United States Attorneys  (EOUSA) and U.S. Marshals Service (USMS). Since these agencies could  only provide rough estimates of potential costs, and because of the  numerous caveats associated with the various costs elements, the data  cannot be used for budget purposes or to measure the true costs regarding  the establishment of a federal court in American Samoa. Further, since the  court scenarios were hypothetical and the exact details of the jurisdiction,  staffing, and physical facilities are not known, the estimated costs cannot  be aggregated to obtain a precise estimate of the total costs for the  scenarios. We did not collect any cost data related to expanding the  federal jurisdiction of the High Court of American Samoa, since this would  be a unique judicial structure and there is no comparable existing federal  court structure upon which to estimate costs. We found the cost data  provided to be sufficiently reliable to provide rough estimates of potential  future costs for establishing a federal court in American Samoa, with  limitations as noted.

American Samoa consists  of five volcanic islands and two coral atolls, covering a land area of 76  square miles, slightly larger than Washington, D.C. The capital of American  Samoa, Pago Pago, is located on the main island of Tutuila, which is  mostly rugged terrain with relatively little level land. Agricultural  production is limited by the scarcity of arable land, and tourism is  impaired by the island\u2019s remote location and lack of tourist-rated facilities.  Two tuna canneries constitute the main sources of private sector  employment. Most of the economic activity and government operations on  Tutuila take place in the Pago Pago Bay area.", "According to the American Samoa Department of Commerce data, in 2005  the population of American Samoa was about 65,500.

In these deeds, the United States pledged to promote  peace and welfare, to establish a good and sound government, and to  preserve the rights and property of the people. The U.S. Navy was initially  responsible for federal governance of the territory. Then, in 1951, federal  governance was transferred to the Secretary of the Interior, which  continues today.  The Secretary exercises broad powers with regard to  American Samoa, including \u201call civil, judicial, and military powers\u201d of  government in American Samoa.

The Governor has responsibility for  appointing the Attorney General, Director of Public Safety, and other  executive branch agency leaders. The legislature, or Fono, is comprised of  18 senators and 20 representatives. Each of the senators is elected in  accordance with Samoan custom by the city councils of the counties that  the senator represents.  Each of the representatives is popularly elected  from the representative districts. American Samoa exercises authority  over its immigration system through its own locally adopted laws.

The bill was  opposed by some federal judicial officials citing an unfair burden that  would be placed on the District of Hawaii, as well as on defendants,  witnesses, and juries, due, in part, to the logistical difficulties in  transporting them between American Samoa and Hawaii. By 1996, the  proposed legislation was revised to establish an Article IV court in  American Samoa with full staff accompaniments and limited federal  jurisdiction that would exclude cases that would put into issue the office  or title of matai and land tenure. While DOJ sent the legislation to the  President of the Senate and Speaker of the House in October 1996, it was  never introduced into the 104th Congress or in subsequent congressional  sessions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concerns about Human Trafficking and Federal Grant-Related Corruption Have Heightened Law Enforcement Focus on American Samoa", "paragraphs": ["While the mid-1990\u2019s legislative proposals were primarily concerned with  white-collar crime in American Samoa, more recently, different types of  criminal activities have emerged. Prior to 1999, FBI officials told us that  allegations of criminal activity in American Samoa were investigated by  agents based in the Washington, D.C. field office and, due to the distance  and costs involved, very few investigations were initiated. Around mid- 1999, FBI began to assign Hawaii-based agents to investigations in  American Samoa in response to increasing reports of criminal activity.  Then, due to growing caseload and a crime assessment, in December 2005  FBI opened a resident agency in American Samoa. According to an FBI  official, other than a National Park Service fish and wildlife investigator  affiliated with the National Park of American Samoa, the FBI agents were  the first federal law enforcement agents to be stationed in American  Samoa.  FBI\u2019s increased activities over the past 8 years, and establishment  of a resident agency, have targeted a growing number of crimes in  American Samoa, including public corruption of high-ranking government  officials, fraud against the government, civil rights violations, and human  trafficking. Among the most notable was U.S. v. Lee, which was the largest  human trafficking case ever prosecuted by DOJ, as reported in 2007.  This  2001 case involved about 200 Chinese and Vietnamese victims who were  held in a garment factory, and in 2003, Lee was convicted in the U.S.  District Court of Hawaii of involuntary servitude, conspiring to violate civil  rights, extortion, and money laundering. Another federal case in 2006  resulted in guilty pleas from the prison warden and his associate for  conspiring to deprive an inmate of rights, by assaulting him and causing  him bodily injury.", "In December 2004, we found that American Samoa\u2019s failure to complete  single audits, federal agencies\u2019 slow reactions to this failure, and  instances of theft and fraud limited accountability for 12 key federal grants  supporting essential services in American Samoa.  We recommended,  among other things, that the Secretary of the Interior coordinate with  other federal agencies to designate the American Samoa government as a  high-risk grantee until it completed all delinquent single audits. In June  2005, DOI designated the American Samoa government as a high-risk  grantee.  The American Samoa government subsequently completed all  overdue audits and made efforts to comply with single audit act  requirements. Later, in December 2006, we reported that insular area  governments, including American Samoa, face serious economic, fiscal,  and financial accountability challenges and that their abilities to  strengthen their economies were constrained by their lack of  diversification in industries, scarce natural resources, small domestic  markets, limited infrastructure, and shortages of skilled labor. Again, we  cited the long-standing financial accountability problems in American  Samoa, including the late submission of the reports required by the Single  Audit Act, the inability to achieve unqualified (\u201cclean\u201d) audit opinions on  financial statements, and numerous material weaknesses in internal  controls over financial reporting and compliance with laws and  regulations governing federal grant awards. We made several  recommendations to the Secretary of the Interior, including increasing  coordination activities with officials from other federal grant-making  agencies on issues such as late single audit reports, high-risk designations,  and deficiencies in financial management systems and practices. DOI  agreed with our recommendations, but we have not yet assessed its  progress toward implementing them.", "In addition to these GAO reviews, FBI and various inspector general  agents have conducted a broad investigation into federal grant-related  corruption in American Samoa, which yielded guilty pleas in October 2005  from four former American Samoa government officials, including the  Director of Procurement of American Samoa, the Director of the  Department of Education of American Samoa, the Director of the  Department of Health and Social Services for American Samoa, and the  Director of the School Lunch Program for American Samoa. Additionally,  recent audits and investigations by the Inspector General offices of the  Departments of Homeland Security, Education, and the Interior indicate  that the American Samoa government has inadequate controls and  oversight over federal funds, that federal competitive bidding practices  have been circumvented, and that American Samoan officials have abused  federal funds for personal benefit. For example, in September 2007,  officials from the U.S. Department of Education designated the American  Samoa government as a high-risk grantee due to serious internal control  issues raised in previous single audits, and cited a number of underlying  fiscal and management problems. Due to the department\u2019s concerns about  the American Samoa government\u2019s ability to properly administer and  provide services with its funds, the department imposed several special  conditions, including restrictions on the drawdown of grant funds. Also,  the American Samoa legislature, or Fono, has been assisting federal  agencies in their efforts to investigate public corruption and other crimes.  Specifically, in early 2007, the Fono established a Senate Select  Investigative Committee to review and investigate any unlawful, improper,  wasteful, or fraudulent operations involving local and federal funds or any  other misconduct involving government operations within all departments,  boards, commissions, committees, and agencies of the American Samoa  government. An official stated the committee reviews and investigates  complaints, holds senate hearings with relevant witnesses, and can refer  cases to either the American Samoa Attorney General or FBI for  investigation and prosecution."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reasons Offered for Changing the Current System Focus Principally on the Difficulties of Adjudicating Matters of Federal Law and Greater Access to Justice", "paragraphs": ["As was the case in the 1990s, and was repeated in the interviews we  conducted and e-mail comments we received, the reasons offered for  changing the American Samoa judicial system principally stem from  challenges associated with adjudicating matters of federal law arising in  American Samoa and the desire to provide American Samoans with  greater access to justice. Federal law enforcement officials have identified  a number of issues that limit their ability to pursue matters of federal law  arising in American Samoa. These include logistical challenges related to  American Samoa\u2019s remote location. Proponents of changing the judicial  system of American Samoa also cite reasons, such as providing more  direct access to justice as in other insular areas, serving as a possible  deterrent to crime, and providing a means to alleviate the shame,  embarrassment, and costs associated with being taken away to be tried  more than 2,000 miles from American Samoa. While the main areas of  concern in the mid-1990s and in our discussions were related to criminal  matters arising in American Samoa, there were also concerns regarding  civil matters, such as federal debt collection, although these were not  addressed in much detail."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Logistical Challenges Related to American Samoa\u2019s Remote Location", "paragraphs": ["Without a federal court in American Samoa, investigators and federal  prosecutors whom we interviewed said they were limited in their ability to  conduct investigations and prosecute cases due to logistical obstacles  related to working in such a remote location. In addition to high travel  costs, and infrequent flights into and out of American Samoa, DOJ officials  said they face difficulties involving effective witness preparation and  difficulties communicating with agents during a small window of time  each day (due to the 7-hour time difference between Washington, D.C. and  American Samoa). In some cases, search warrants or wiretaps were not  used by the prosecutors to the extent that they would have been if  American Samoa were in closer proximity to Washington, D.C. or  Honolulu, Hawaii. Federal prosecutors told us that far fewer witnesses  have been called to testify in front of the grand jury, given the burden of  high travel costs from American Samoa. Federal prosecutors also told us  that they must also rely on witness observations and summaries from  federal agents stationed in American Samoa rather than meet key  witnesses face to face before bringing charges or issuing subpoenas, as  they would typically do. Further, according to DOJ officials, the cost  related to managing these cases has limited the number of cases they are  able to pursue.  Federal law enforcement agents told us that a federal  court located in American Samoa could bring additional investigative and  prosecutorial resources so that they would be able to pursue more cases.  Although some have suggested that judicial and prosecutorial resources  from the judicial districts of CNMI and Guam be deployed to American  Samoa, the high travel costs and logistical obstacles would not be any less,  given that there are no direct flights between American Samoa and Guam  or between American Samoa and CNMI. See figure 2 showing the  distances between American Samoa and CNMI, Guam, Hawaii, and  Washington, D.C.", "Another key reason offered for changing the system for adjudicating  matters of federal law in American Samoa is that a federal court would  provide residents with more direct access to justice and the ability to  pursue cases in the federal court system. Currently, the ability to  adjudicate federal cases exists only in very limited cases through the High  Court, at a significant cost of time and money to travel to U.S. District  Courts in Hawaii or Washington, D.C.; or not at all, in the case of some  civil matters and bankruptcy. Proponents state that the establishment of a  federal court would provide American Samoa parity with other insular  areas, such as CNMI, Guam, and USVI, which have federal courts. Further,  a legal expert said that a federal court in American Samoa would provide  the community with an opportunity to see first hand how parties can come  together to resolve their differences with regard to federal matters. For  example, some have asserted that if public corruption trials were held in  American Samoa, they would act as a deterrent to others contemplating  fraudulent behavior; increase accountability with regard to government  spending; and provide satisfaction in witnessing wrong doers brought to  justice.  Some stated in the February 2006 public hearing held by the  Fono and in e-mail comments we received that they have felt shame and  embarrassment when defendants are taken to distant courts and in our  group discussions, it was stated that American Samoa is perceived by  others as unable to render justice to its own residents. Further, some  officials of American Samoa have noted the significant costs that  defendants\u2019 families must bear in traveling great distances to provide  support during trials. This burden is exacerbated by the comparatively low  family incomes in American Samoa, which, as stated earlier, are less than  half of the U.S. median household income, according to 2000 Census  Bureau data.", "Finally, some people we met with stated that the current system of holding  federal criminal trials outside of American Samoa subjects defendants to  possible prejudices by jurors in other locations.  They cited the relative  unfamiliarity of the judges and jurors in Washington, D.C. or Honolulu,  Hawaii regarding American Samoa cultural and political issues and  suggested that American Samoans would receive a fairer trial in American  Samoa than in these locations.  This issue had also been discussed in the  mid-1990s.  For example, in his testimony during August 1995  congressional hearings, the then-Governor of American Samoa stated that  the people of American Samoa have the ability to deliver just verdicts  based on the evidence presented.  He noted that for almost 20 years prior,  the trial division of the High Court had successfully conducted six-person  jury trials as evidence that American Samoan customs and family loyalties  had not prevented effective law enforcement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from Group Discussions and E-mail Responses Reflect Some of the Same Reasons Offered for Changing the Current System", "paragraphs": ["Views in support of changing the current system were also reflected in  some comments made during the group discussions we held in American  Samoa and in some of the e-mail responses we received.

Other members of the  public and a local community group expressed their belief that a federal  court in American Samoa may act as a deterrent for the abuse of federal  funds and public corruption, and provide opportunities for American  Samoans to pursue federal legal matters, such as bankruptcy. While there  was no consensus opinion, certain members of the local bar association  mentioned that having a federal court could be beneficial for economic  development, by attracting qualified attorneys and court staff to American  Samoa.

In raising these issues, some cited the deeds of cession  which specify that the United States would preserve the rights and  property of the Samoan people.

As noted above, matai hold positions of  authority in the community; for example, only matai may serve as  senators in the American Samoa legislature, and matai control the use and  development of the communal lands and allocate housing to their  extended family members. The land tenure system of American Samoa is  such that the majority of the land in American Samoa is communally  owned, and the sale or exchange of communally owned land is prohibited  without the consent of the Governor. Also prohibited is the sale or  exchange of communally owned and individually owned property to  people with less than one-half Samoan blood. American Samoa  government officials assert that the land tenure system fosters the strong  familial and community ties that are the backbone of Samoan culture and  that limits on the transfer of land are important to preserve the lands of  American Samoa for Samoans and protect the Samoan culture.", "Currently, cases regarding matai titles and land issues, such as disputes  over the rightful successor to a matai or land use or improvements, are  heard by the land and titles division of the High Court of American Samoa.   This division is composed of the Chief Justice and Associate Justice, as  well as associate judges, who are appointed based on their knowledge of  Samoan culture and tradition. Pursuant to the federalist structure of the  U.S. judiciary, if a federal court were established in American Samoa most  cases arising under local law, such as matai and land disputes, would  likely continue to be heard by the local court. However, some American  Samoa officials stated that they are concerned that if a federal court were  established in American Samoa, federal judges, without the requisite  knowledge of Samoan culture and tradition, would hear land and title  cases. They stated that they would like to keep matai title and land tenure  issues within the jurisdiction of the High Court.", "Another concern that was raised by government officials and residents of  American Samoa is that the presence of a federal court in American Samoa  may generate constitutional challenges to the matai and land tenure  system. Though such challenges may be brought in existing venues, some  voiced concerns that the establishment of a federal court in American  Samoa may make such challenges less costly and perhaps more likely.", "To this day, our native land tenure system remains at the very core of our  existence: our culture, our heritage and our way of life.

Neither the U.S. Census Bureau nor the  American Samoa Department of Commerce provides data on the number  of U.S. citizens in American Samoa. Thus, the proportion of the American  Samoa adult population who are U.S. citizens is unknown. If the number of  U.S. citizens is fairly small, then the pool from which to select federal  jurors would be fairly small without a statutory change. In addition, law  enforcement officials have speculated that extended family ties in  American Samoa may limit the government\u2019s ability to successfully  prosecute cases. Specifically, they raised the issue of jury nullification\u2014 the rendering of a not guilty verdict even though the jury believes that the  defendant committed the offense\u2014as a potential problem that may occur  if jury trials were held in American Samoa, due to the influence of familial  ties or other societal pressures on jurors. Federal law enforcement  officials we met with added that some witnesses involved in testifying  against others in previous federal criminal cases have relocated outside of  American Samoa and have lost their jobs and housing as a result of their  participation in cases.

The legislation  specified that the court would have limited jurisdiction that would exclude  matters pertaining to matai title and land tenure issues. Under this  scenario, federal law would authorize a federal court structure that most  closely resembled federal courts in CNMI, Guam, and USVI. It would  include an Article IV district court with a district judge, court clerk, and  support staff. Below is a description of the key issues under this scenario.", "Jurisdiction: The statute creating the Article IV district court would  specify the court's jurisdiction. It could be limited to criminal cases  only, or may or may not include bankruptcy, federal question, and  diversity jurisdiction. American Samoa officials and others whom we  interviewed were divided on whether the law establishing a district  court in American Samoa should explicitly exclude matai and land  tenure issues from the court\u2019s jurisdiction. Another possibility is that,  as in other insular area federal courts, the federal jurisdiction of the  court could grow over time. For example, while the District Court of  Guam began with jurisdiction over cases arising under federal law in  1950, subsequent federal laws expanded its jurisdiction to include that  of a district court of the United States, including diversity jurisdiction,  and that of a bankruptcy court.", "Appeals process:  The process for appealing decisions would be the  same as in other Article IV district courts.

They point out that they designated judges from the  Ninth Circuit to the District of Guam for over 2 years, when there was  an extended judge vacancy. Further, the Ninth Circuit has designated  local judges to handle federal matters, when necessary. For example,  the judges from the Districts of CNMI and Guam routinely use local  Superior Court or Supreme Court judges to handle federal court  matters and trials, in cases when they must recuse themselves from a  court matter or in the case of a planned or emergency absence.", "However, Pacific Island Committee members with whom we met  stated that presumably federal judges would only handle federal court  matters.

Similarly, the authority under the CJA to authorize a  federal defender organization to provide representation or to  compensate panel attorneys is vested in the district court. The  Department of Justice would need to determine whether it would  establish a federal prosecutor position in American Samoa to prosecute  certain federal cases in the High Court.  There are local Public  Defender and Attorney General Offices in American Samoa and the  extent to which they could assist with cases is unknown.  According to  the Chief Justice of the High Court, it is unlikely that the existing  probation and pretrial or court security staff would be able to handle  an increased workload.

Legal experts with whom we met told us that, because this is  a unique arrangement, the High Court and U.S. judiciary may be faced  with having to constantly solve unique problems and develop solutions  on a regular basis. For example, judicial officials stated that the High  Court Justices would have to be cognizant of their roles and  responsibilities when shifting from the duties of a local High Court  Justice to the duties of a federal judge. A judicial official also noted  that the High Court justices may have to become familiar with federal  sentencing guidelines, which require a considerable amount of training.  In the August 1995 hearing, the DOJ Deputy Assistant Attorney General  stated that vesting federal jurisdiction in the High Court runs counter  to well-established legislative policy that district courts should have  exclusive jurisdiction over certain types of proceedings to which the  United States is a party.

During the nineteenth century, Germany, Great Britain, and  the United States developed commercial and military pursuits in Samoa,  and in 1899 the three powers divided their authority over the islands, as  Germany and Great Britain renounced all rights to Tutuila and the other  Samoan islands east of Longitude 171 degrees west of Greenwich, and the  United States renounced all rights to the western islands.  On February 19,  1900, President McKinley issued an Executive Order placing control of the  islands under the authority of the Department of the Navy, and on the  same day, the Secretary of the Navy issued an order providing that the  islands were established into a Naval Station, to be known as the Naval  Station, Tutuila, and to be under the command of a Commandant.  On  April 17, 1900, the high chiefs of Tutuila formally ceded the islands of  Tutuila and Aunuu to the United States, and on July 16, 1904, the high chief  of Manua ceded the islands of Tau, Olosega, Ofu, and Rose to the United  States.  The Deeds of Cession were not formally accepted by the United  States until 1929 when Congress, by joint resolution, accepted and ratified  them and provided that \u201cuntil Congress shall provide for the government  of such islands, all civil, judicial, and military powers shall be vested in  such person or persons and shall be exercised in such manner as the  President of the United States shall direct\u2026.\u201d", "In 1951, President Truman transferred the authority to govern American  Samoa from the Secretary of the Navy to the Secretary of the Interior.   The Secretary of the Interior subsequently issued an order to delimit the  extent and nature of the authority of the American Samoa government,  which provided for a Governor and an independent judicial branch.   American Samoa ratified a Constitution, which went into effect on  October 17, 1960, and a revised Constitution went into effect on July 1,  1967.  The Constitution provides for legislative, judicial, and executive  branches.  The legislature, called the Fono, consists of a House of  Representatives and Senate.  The House of Representatives is composed  of twenty members popularly elected from representative districts.  The  Senate is composed of eighteen members, each of whom must be matai  and elected in accordance with Samoan custom by the city councils of the  counties that the member is to represent.  The 1967 Constitution provided  that the executive branch was to consist of a Governor, to be appointed by  the Secretary of the Interior.  In 1977, the Secretary of the Interior  superseded this provision by issuing an order providing that the Governor  and Lieutenant Governor were to be popularly elected.  The Governor\u2019s  veto power is similar to that of the U.S. President, except that if the  Governor vetoes a bill and the legislature overrides the veto with a two- thirds majority of each house, the Governor, if still disapproving of the bill,  may submit it to the Secretary of the Interior, who has the ultimate  authority to decide if the legislation becomes law.  The Constitution also  provides for a judicial branch, which consists of the High Court, local  district courts, and other courts that may be created by law.  In 1983,  Congress provided that the Constitution of American Samoa may only be  amended by an act of Congress.", "American Samoa has limited representation in Congress.  In 1970, the  American Samoa legislature created the Office of the American Samoa  Delegate-at-Large, which was to provide American Samoa with official  representation in Washington, D.C.  In 1978, Congress recognized the  delegate from American Samoa and accorded the delegate status  equivalent to that of the delegates from Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Although the village courts are no longer used, the High Court and the  local district court remain in place, with the same basic division of  jurisdiction, such that the High Court has jurisdiction over major local  matters, including matters involving land and matai titles, and the local  district court has jurisdiction over minor local matters, such as  misdemeanor criminal cases and civil cases in which the amount in  controversy does not exceed $5,000. While new avenues to appeal  decisions of the High Court have been established, the appellate process  within the American Samoa judiciary remains similar, with the appellate  division of the High Court maintaining jurisdiction over decisions of the  other High Court divisions and the local district court.  Further, although  the judges were initially appointed by the Governor, since 1931, the Chief  Justice of the High Court has been appointed by the President\u2019s delegate,  first the Secretary of the Navy and then the Secretary of the Interior."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Jurisdiction", "paragraphs": ["In 1900, the first Commandant of the Naval Station, Commander Benjamin  Tilley, issued Regulation No. 5, which established a system of courts in  American Samoa.  The system of courts consisted of village courts, local  district courts, and the High Court.  The village courts had jurisdiction  over minor civil and criminal cases involving Samoans.  The local district  courts had jurisdiction over more significant cases and cases involving  non-Samoans.  The High Court had exclusive jurisdiction over major  cases involving sums over $250 or criminal penalties over 6 months and all  cases involving real property, treason, murder, and offenses committed  within the Naval Station.  According to a former Naval Governor of  American Samoa, the village and local district courts had a case load  generally consisting of cases involving offenses such as acts of physical  violence, burglary, larceny, sex offenses, desertion, failure to pay taxes,  traffic offenses, trespass, nonsupport of wife, and disorderly conduct.  At  the same time, the High Court mostly handled land and matai title  disputes.", "In 1952, the judiciary of American Samoa underwent a major  reorganization.  The village courts were no longer used, and their  jurisdiction was transferred to the local district courts.  The High Court  was reorganized into three divisions: appellate, probate, and trial.", "The structure of the High Court has continued to change over time, and  jurisdiction over certain matters has been transferred between divisions.   By 1969, local law had added to the High Court a fourth division, the land  and titles division, which was to handle disputes related to land and matai  titles.  In 1979, local law eliminated the probate division and transferred  such jurisdiction to the trial division of the High Court.  In 2000, local law  established a family, drug and alcohol court division.  The law authorized  the Chief Justice to transfer from the trial division of the High Court or the  local district court to the family, drug and alcohol court division juvenile  cases, domestic relations cases, certain domestic violence cases, and  certain alcohol and substance abuse-related cases.", "In addition to restructuring the High Court, local law has also granted the  High Court additional jurisdiction, such as over certain admiralty and  maritime matters.  In 1975, in response to Vessel Fijian Swift v. Trial  Division of the High Court of American Samoa, in which the High Court  held that it did not have in rem admiralty jurisdiction absent an express  grant of such jurisdiction, local law granted the High Court jurisdiction,  both in personam and in rem, over admiralty and maritime matters in  common law.  In 1982, the U.S. District Court of Hawaii confirmed that  the High Court could exercise both in rem and in personam jurisdiction in  admiralty and maritime cases.  Although the High Court has jurisdiction  over matters of admiralty and maritime common law, the High Court does  not necessarily have jurisdiction over actions arising under federal  maritime statutes, unless explicitly provided by federal law.  Federal law  has so provided in, for example, the statute governing maritime  commercial instruments and liens.", "Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, and again in the early 2000s, federal law  also provided that the High Court has jurisdiction over cases arising under  certain other federal statutes.  For example, the High Court has been  granted jurisdiction over cases arising under certain federal statutes  governing grain standards, pesticide control, animal welfare, animal  and plant health, and poultry and meat inspection.", "Thus, current law provides that the High Court and local district court  have jurisdiction over all local matters and certain federal matters.  The  High Court is composed of the trial; land and titles; family, drug and  alcohol; and appellate divisions.  The trial division has jurisdiction over  civil cases in which the amount in controversy exceeds $5,000 (except  land and matai title matters), criminal cases in which a felony is charged,  admiralty and maritime matters, juvenile cases, probate, domestic  relations except adoptions and certain child and spousal support cases, all  writs, and any matter not otherwise provided for in statute.  The land and  titles division has jurisdiction over all matters relating to matai titles and  all controversies relating to land.  The family, drug and alcohol court  division has jurisdiction over the following types of cases transferred from  the trial division or the local district court: juvenile cases, including traffic  offenses; domestic relations cases; domestic violence crimes except  homicides and other Class A felonies; and criminal cases in which alcohol  or other substance abuse is involved, including serious traffic offenses,  except cases charging possession of a controlled substance with intent to  distribute.  The appellate division has appellate jurisdiction over all final  decisions of the trial and land and titles divisions, appellate jurisdiction  over all local district court and administrative decisions, and appeals of  other matters specifically provided for by statute.  The local district court  retains jurisdiction over civil cases in which the amount in controversy  does not exceed $5,000 (except land and matai title matters), criminal  cases in which the offense charged is a misdemeanor or any offense  punishable by not more than 1 year of imprisonment, traffic cases except  those involving a felony, initial appearances and preliminary examinations  in all criminal cases, adoptions and certain child and spousal support  cases, and certain public health offenses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appeals", "paragraphs": ["Beginning in 1900, the appellate division of the High Court had appellate  jurisdiction over decisions of the trial division of the High Court and over  decisions of the local district courts, and when the land and titles and  family, drug, and alcohol court divisions were established within the High  Court, the appellate division of the High Court assumed appellate  jurisdiction over decisions of those divisions.  Initially, the local district  courts had appellate jurisdiction over decisions of the village courts, but  once the village courts became defunct in 1952, the local district court lost  its appellate jurisdiction.  As such, current law provides that the appellate  division of the High Court has appellate jurisdiction over decisions of the  trial, land and titles, and family, drug, and alcohol court divisions of the  High Court, as well as appellate jurisdiction over decisions of the local  district court accompanied by a stenographic record and appeals based on  a question of law.  All decisions of the local district court in cases without  a stenographic record may be appealed to the trial division of the High  Court for de novo review.", "The Secretary of the Interior may also exercise appellate jurisdiction over  decisions of the High Court.  In June 1985, the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-Day Saints requested that the Secretary of the Interior intervene and  overturn a decision of the High Court regarding a piece of land in  American Samoa.  Though he declined to intervene, finding that such an  intervention would undermine the U.S. policy of fostering greater self- government and self-sufficiency, the Secretary of the Interior stated that  he had the authority to review the decision of the High Court.  When the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints subsequently challenged the  constitutionality of the Secretary\u2019s refusal to overturn the High Court  decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit  approved of the Secretary of the Interior\u2019s assertion of authority, stating  that:  The Congress has delegated its judicial authority with  respect to American Samoa to the President, who has in  turn delegated it to the Secretary\u2026.  The Congress, that is,  could have, so far as Article III is concerned, provided that  the Secretary himself would exercise the judicial power in  American Samoa.  No doubt, the due process clause of the  Fifth Amendment may qualify this prerogative in some way.   The Secretary might not be able to exercise his authority,  nor perhaps even to retain it in dormancy, in a case to  which he is a party.  But that is a far cry from this case.   Here, there is no claim that the Secretary was interested in  the outcome.  So far as due process is concerned, therefore,  he could have decided it himself and there can be no cause  of action because the court that did so was subservient to  him.", "A decision of the High Court may not only be appealed to the Secretary of  the Interior, it may also be collaterally challenged by filing an action in the  U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the Secretary of the  Interior for failing to administer American Samoa in accordance with the  U.S. Constitution and federal law.  This approach was first tested in King  v. Morton in the mid-1970s.  In that case, an individual charged in the  High Court of American Samoa with willfully failing to pay his income tax  moved for, and was denied, a jury trial.  He subsequently commenced an  action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the  Secretary of the Interior, requesting that the court declare unconstitutional  the Secretary of the Interior\u2019s administration of American Samoa in such a  way that denied him the right to trial by jury.  The district court dismissed  the case for lack of jurisdiction, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the  District of Columbia Circuit held that the U.S. District Court for the  District of Columbia could have jurisdiction under the federal question or  writ of mandamus statutes, stating that the district court is \u201ccompetent to  judge the Secretary\u2019s administration of the government of American  Samoa by constitutional standards and, if necessary, to order the Secretary  to take appropriate measures to correct any constitutional deficiencies.\u201d   The court again found that district court is competent to hear challenges  to the constitutionality of the Secretary of the Interior\u2019s administration of  American Samoa in Corporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus  Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. Hodel.  In that case, the U.S. District Court  for the District of Columbia found that, though the Church of Jesus Christ  of Latter-Day Saints failed to raise a federal question, the court had  jurisdiction to hear valid claims under the Constitution or federal law  against the Secretary of the Interior regarding his administration of  American Samoa.  Thus, current law provides that decisions of the  appellate division of the High Court may be appealed either directly to the  Secretary of the Interior or challenged collaterally in the U.S. District  Court for the District of Columbia, whose decisions may be appealed to  the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and then to  the U.S. Supreme Court."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Judges", "paragraphs": ["Beginning in 1900, the Commandant of the Naval Station was the President  of the High Court and could appoint others to serve as judges.

According to U.S. Census Bureau Data for  2000, the population of the Northern Mariana Islands is about 69,000,  composed primarily of Asians, including Filipinos and Chinese, and Pacific  Islanders, including Chamorros, Carolinians, and other Micronesians.   About 58 percent of individuals residing in the Northern Mariana Islands  are foreign born, and about 57 percent are not U.S. citizens.  English,  Chamorro, and Carolinian are the official languages of the Northern  Mariana Islands.", "The Chamorro people are believed to have arrived in the Northern Mariana  Islands about 1500 B.C.  In 1565, Spain claimed the Mariana Islands as a  possession, and in the mid-seventeenth century, Spain began to colonize  the islands.  During the time of Spanish colonization, the Chamorro  population of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands declined  significantly\u2014from between 50,000 and 100,000 when the Spanish first  arrived in the mid-sixteenth century to around 1,500 by the time of the  Spanish census in 1783.  In the late-seventeenth century, Spain removed  almost all of the population of the Northern Mariana Islands, with the  exception of a small population on Rota that evaded the Spanish, to Guam,  so that the islands remained nearly uninhabited until the nineteenth  century.  In the mid-nineteenth century, people from the Caroline Islands  began to migrate to the Northern Mariana Islands, and in the late- nineteenth century, the Chamorros were allowed to return from Guam.", "During the twentieth century, the Northern Mariana Islands passed under  the control of several foreign powers.  After the Spanish-American War,  Spain sold the Northern Mariana Islands to Germany.  In 1914, Japan  occupied the Northern Mariana Islands and became formally responsible  for the islands in 1920.  In 1944, the United States invaded the Northern  Mariana Islands and defeated the Japanese.  Subsequently, in 1947, the  Northern Mariana Islands, along with the Caroline and Marshall Islands,  entered into a trusteeship called the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands,  to be administered by the United States.  The Northern Mariana Islands,  however, after an unsuccessful attempt to be integrated with Guam,  sought a separate relationship with the United States.  By 1972, the  Northern Mariana Islands had entered into separate status negotiations  with the United States, and in 1975 the Northern Mariana Islands and the  United States concluded a Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the  Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of  America, making the Northern Mariana Islands a \u201cself-governing  commonwealth \u2026 in political union with and under the sovereignty of the  United States of America.\u201d  The Covenant granted citizenship to residents  of the Northern Mariana Islands and stated that the Northern Mariana  Islands would approve a constitution that would provide for a local  legislature, a popularly-elected Governor, and a local court system.  The  Covenant also provided for a District Court for the Northern Mariana  Islands.

Similarly, appellate jurisdiction over decisions of the  Superior Court was transferred from the District Court for the Northern  Mariana Islands to the newly-created local Supreme Court.

Thus, current law provides that,  when such an assignment is necessary for the proper dispatch of the  business of the court, the chief judge of the Third Circuit may assign a  judge of a court of record of the Virgin Islands established by local law, a  circuit or district judge of the Third Circuit, or a recalled senior judge of  the District Court of the Virgin Islands; and the Chief Justice of the United  States may assign any other United States circuit or district judge with the  consent of the assigned judge and the chief judge of that circuit, to serve  temporarily as a judge of the District Court of the Virgin Islands."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IX: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Christopher Conrad, Assistant  Director, Chuck Bausell, Jenny Chanley, George Depaoli, Emil Friberg,  Jared Hermalin, Nancy Kawahara, Tracey King, Jeff Malcolm, Jan  Montgomery, Amy Sheller, and Adam Vogt made key contributions to this  report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
