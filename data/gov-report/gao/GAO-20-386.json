However, gaps in the Defense Security Cooperation Agency's (DSCA) oversight of Department of Defense (DOD) components' activities increase the risk that fees collected into the FMS transportation accounts may be inaccurate. While DSCA requires components to perform annual reviews of FMS cases to verify the accuracy of transportation fees collected, DSCA does not routinely oversee these reviews. Additionally, DSCA lacks oversight of the timeliness of DOD components' reporting of deliveries, which should occur within 30 days. DSCA officials indicated that they are developing guidance and processes to help address these challenges, but had not completed them as of February 2020.", "DSCA's financial oversight of expenditures from the FMS transportation accounts does not provide reasonable assurance that expenditures are allowable and paid from the correct account. In fiscal year 2016, DSCA established internal guidance for financial oversight of expenditures from the accounts. While that guidance includes a process to review expenditures on a monthly basis, DSCA has not established procedures for conducting that review, including how to analyze expenditure data, or identify and address discrepancies. As a result, DSCA may not review FMS transportation expenditures consistently or identify and address discrepancies. GAO found that approximately 19 percent of expenditures reported to DSCA over a 3-month period in fiscal year 2019 inconsistently identified the DOD component responsible for the transaction. For example, a transaction may indicate that both Navy and Air Force are responsible for the shipment. Further, DSCA has not documented how the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) should generate the reports DSCA uses for its review, and DFAS's review of expenditures excludes some expenditures from two DOD components. Without a routine process to review expenditures and correct discrepancies, DSCA cannot provide reasonable assurance that all expenditures are allowable and paid from the correct account, raising the risk of misuse of funds.

Rather, according to DFAS officials, if DFAS identifies  such a discrepancy with a specific expenditure, that cost remains as an  expenditure from the main transportation account.", "Because DFAS\u2019s procedures do not include steps to reconcile the amount  of payments to all service providers against a list of detailed cost  transactions or to identify all transportation expenditure transactions,  DFAS may not review all FMS transportation expenditures and may not  pay all expenditures from the correct transportation account. Additionally,  because the list of transportation account codes provided to DFAS does  not include all FMS account codes, neither DFAS nor DSCA review all  expenditures from the FMS transportation accounts, which raises the risk  of unallowable or unapproved expenditures. As a result, DSCA\u2019s ability to  provide reasonable assurance that all transportation expenditures are  allowable and paid from the correct account is limited. DSCA officials told  us that they are developing guidance in coordination with DFAS to identify  and follow up on discrepancies and clarify how DFAS is to perform its  analysis, and that the guidance should be implemented by July 2020.  However, until DSCA finalizes that guidance to DFAS, DSCA may review  inconsistent analyses and may not review all transportation expenditures,  and the risk remains that DSCA may use the FMS transportation  accounts to pay for unallowable costs, or pay transportation costs from  the incorrect account."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DSCA has developed financial oversight procedures for overseeing the  billions of dollars that are collected into and expended from the FMS  transportation accounts, but we found weaknesses in oversight of both  collections and expenditures.

Similarly, regarding expenditures, we identified gaps in  DSCA\u2019s oversight.

DOD noted that  annual case reviews and delivery reporting are not directly related to  financial transactions tied to the FMS transportation account.

We chose to review data from these fiscal years based  on data availability. Under a prior review of the management oversight of  FMS transportation fees, we assessed the reliability of these data by  reviewing for duplicate entries, gaps, and obvious errors, comparing the  data to similar data obtained under prior reviews, and interviewing agency  officials to clarify questions about how to interpret the data. On the basis  of this assessment, we determined these data to be reliable for the  purposes of summarizing the total collections into and expenditures from  the FMS transportation accounts during fiscal years 2007 to 2018.", "To examine DSCA\u2019s oversight of DOD components\u2019 activities that affect  fees collected into the FMS transportation accounts, we reviewed DOD\u2019s  current guidance related to the FMS transportation fee, as well as other  documentation and internal guidance developed by DSCA. We  interviewed DSCA and DFAS officials on their implementation of  oversight procedures. To determine and assess the controls DSCA  should be using to manage and oversee the account, we reviewed DOD\u2019s  Financial Management Regulation, DSCA\u2019s Security Assistance  Management Manual, other internal DSCA guidance, federal accounting  standards, federal internal control standards, and our prior report on  DSCA\u2019s management oversight of the FMS transportation account  balances.", "To examine DSCA\u2019s financial oversight of expenditures from the FMS  transportation accounts, we reviewed DOD\u2019s current regulations related  to financial oversight and transportation, including DOD Financial  Management Regulation and DOD Defense Transportation Regulation.", "Additionally, we reviewed DSCA\u2019s Managers\u2019 Internal Control Program  procedures for monthly FMS transportation account reviews, and we  interviewed DSCA officials responsible for these reviews. We also  reviewed DSCA\u2019s Security Assistance Management Manual, which  provides guidance to DOD components related to the FMS program, and  DFAS\u2019s internal guidance on reviewing and realigning expenditures from  the FMS transportation account.", "We analyzed a nongeneralizable, 3-month sample of expenditure data for  the FMS transportation accounts provided by DFAS for the period from  May through July 2019, including transportation service provider bills and  detailed transaction-level expenditures. These data included the  transportation account codes and transportation control numbers that  DSCA and DFAS use to verify that individual expenses are allowable, and  to realign transportation expenditures to the correct FMS transportation  account. We initially obtained 1 month of transportation expenditure data,  but decided to expand our analysis to 3 months of data to account for any  variability between months. Additionally, we chose to review data from  this period because they were the most current at the time of our request,  and therefore the data were compiled using DFAS\u2019s current process. We  determined this period to be sufficient for our analysis of the data, which  DSCA and DFAS use to provide assurance that expenditures from the  FMS transportation accounts are allowable and paid from the correct  account.", "To assess the reliability of these data, we reviewed the data for internal  consistency by reviewing for duplicate entries, gaps, and obvious errors;  compared them to DOD regulations on transportation account code and  transportation control number construction; and interviewed DSCA and  DFAS officials about their data collection and verification procedures. We  found the data to be sufficiently reliable for our purpose of presenting the  total number and dollar amount of transportation expenditures reviewed  by DSCA and DFAS for each month, and to identify the number and  dollar amount associated with expenditure records where we identified  discrepancies. We found instances of blank or incorrectly formatted  transportation account codes and transportation control numbers, and  instances where the first characters of the transportation account code  and transportation control number did not match, which DFAS officials  identified as possible discrepancies in the data. As we discuss in the  report, these instances raise questions about the reliability of the data for  financial oversight, since DSCA and DFAS use this information to ensure  that expenditures are allowable and paid from the correct FMS  transportation accounts. We did not conduct any independent testing of  the data to determine whether the amounts reflected correct payments  made toward accurate billings.", "To review DFAS\u2019s internal guidance for reviewing and realigning  expenditures from the FMS transportation account, we reviewed copies of  the procedures provided by DFAS for each of the three transportation  service providers. We identified major steps in the procedures related to  reviewing expenditure data, as well as various internal controls related to  analyzing data. We reviewed each of the procedures against one another  to determine the extent to which they addressed the same elements, and  we compared relevant procedures against standards for internal control  related to obtaining, evaluating, and correcting data, to determine whether  they were sufficient to provide financial oversight. Additionally, we  interviewed DFAS officials responsible for these procedures.", "In order to determine whether DFAS\u2019s procedures included all  expenditures, we requested and obtained information from Army, Navy,  and Air Force on the transportation account codes that each component  used in fiscal year 2019, and compared them to the account codes  provided to DFAS by DSCA and used to query the third-party  transportation service provider system for relevant FMS transportation  expenses. We identified a list of transportation account codes not queried  as part of DFAS\u2019s procedures, and we requested that DFAS query the  third-party transportation service provider\u2019s system for the period of May  through July 2019 using that list. We requested data from this period to  be consistent with the expenditure data DFAS initially provided us for the  same period. We reviewed the resulting data and compared it to the  previously-provided data in order to determine the relative size of each  data set for this period.
