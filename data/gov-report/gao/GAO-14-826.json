DHS's U.S. Customs and Border Protection's (CBP) Operational Field Testing Division (OFTD) conducted 144 covert operations at 86 locations from fiscal years 2006 through 2013, selecting its locations from a total of 655 U.S. air, land, and sea port facilities; checkpoints; and certain international locations. These operations allowed OFTD to assess capabilities for detecting and interdicting\u2014or intercepting\u2014nuclear and radiological materials at locations tested. Results showed differences in the rate of success for interdicting smuggled nuclear and radiological materials across facility types. CBP had a $1 million budget for covert operations of various activities\u2014including nuclear and radiological testing\u2014covering fiscal years 2009 through 2013, and DHS policy requires that components with limited resources make risk-informed decisions. However, CBP testing does not inform capabilities across all border locations, and CBP has not conducted a risk assessment that could inform and prioritize the locations, materials, and technologies to be tested through covert operations. Given limited resources, assessing risk to prioritize the most dangerous materials, most vulnerable locations, and most critical equipment for testing through covert operations, DHS could better inform its decisions on how to expend its limited resources effectively, consistent with the department's risk management policies.", "OFTD has not issued reports annually as planned on covert operation results and recommendations, limiting CBP oversight for improving capabilities to detect and interdict smuggling at the border. OFTD has issued three reports on the results of its covert operations at U.S. ports of entry since 2007. However, OFTD officials stated that because of resource constraints, reports have not been timely and do not include the results of covert tests conducted at checkpoints. Furthermore, OFTD tracks the status of corrective actions taken to address recommendations in these reports; however, CBP does not track corrective actions identified from their individual covert operations that were not included in these reports. Establishing appropriate time frames for reporting of covert operations results and addressing barriers to meeting these time frames would help enhance CBP's accountability for its covert testing operations.

Accordingly, deploying radiation detection equipment at the U.S.  border is part of DHS\u2019s strategy for addressing the threat of nuclear and  radiological terrorism. In April 2005, the President issued a directive  establishing DNDO within DHS and giving DNDO responsibility, among  other things, to enhance and coordinate federal, state, and local efforts to  detect nuclear and radiological materials.

The United States has invested billions of dollars to  detect and interdict smuggled nuclear and radiological materials at U.S.  ports of entry and checkpoints, and CBP reports multiple benefits of its  covert operations that can identify the need for changes in how  technology is used to detect nuclear and radiological material, agency  policies or procedures, or personnel training to ensure that interdiction  programs are working most effectively. Given the limited resources  directed toward covert operations testing of U.S. detection and  interdiction capabilities, it is essential that DHS make risk-informed  decisions to enhance its ability to assess the success of these  investments. By assessing risk to prioritize the most dangerous materials,  most vulnerable locations, and most critical equipment for testing through  covert operations, DHS could better inform its decisions on how to  expend its limited resources effectively, consistent with the department\u2019s  risk management policies. In addition, establishing appropriate reporting  time frames of covert operations results, and developing a mechanism to  track whether ports of entry and checkpoints have implemented corrective  actions, could help CBP ensure accountability and inform management  decision making on the need for further investments or actions to protect  U.S. borders from these potential consequences."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Actions", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that resources for covert operations provide reasonable  assurance that efforts to detect and interdict nuclear and radiological  material smuggled across the border are working as intended and  appropriately targeting the most critical materials, locations, and detection  technologies, we recommend that the Secretary of Homeland Security  conduct or use a risk assessment to inform the department\u2019s priorities\u2014 related to such decisions as test locations, materials, and equipment\u2014for  covert operations at U.S. checkpoints and ports of entry in air, land, and  sea environments.", "To help ensure that CBP has the information necessary to provide  oversight and accountability for implementing corrective actions to  address weaknesses identified by covert operations we recommend that  the Commissioner of CBP: determine time frames for OFTD reporting of covert operation results  and status of corrective actions necessary to timely address border  security weaknesses and work with OFTD to address any barriers to  meeting these time frames, and develop a mechanism to track the corrective actions taken to address  all weaknesses identified through covert operations at the ports of  entry and checkpoints."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of the sensitive version of this report to DHS for  review and comment.
