Over the past decade, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has reported on inconsistencies in states' assessment of nursing homes' quality of care, including understatement--that is, when state surveys fail to cite serious deficiencies or cite them at too low a level. In 2008, GAO reported that 9 states had high and 10 had low understatement based on CMS data for fiscal years 2002 through 2007. This report examines the effect on nursing home deficiency understatement of CMS's survey process, workforce shortages and training, supervisory reviews of surveys, and state agency practices. GAO primarily collected data through two Web-based questionnaires sent to all eligible nursing home surveyors and state agency directors, achieving 61 and 98 percent response rates, respectively."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["A substantial percentage of both state surveyors and directors identified general weaknesses in the nursing home survey process, that is, the survey methodology and guidance on identifying deficiencies. On the questionnaires, 46 percent of surveyors and 36 percent of directors reported that weaknesses in the traditional survey methodology, such as too many survey tasks, contributed to understatement. Limited experience with a new data-driven survey methodology indicated possible improvements in consistency; however, an independent evaluation led CMS to conclude that other tools, such as survey guidance clarification and surveyor training and supervision, would help improve survey accuracy. According to questionnaire responses, workforce shortages and greater use of surveyors with less than 2 years' experience sometimes contributed to understatement. Nearly three-quarters of directors reported that they always or frequently experienced a workforce shortage, while nearly two-thirds reported that surveyor inexperience always, frequently, or sometimes led to understatement. Substantial percentages of directors and surveyors indicated that inadequate training may compromise survey accuracy and lead to understatement. According to about 29 percent of surveyors in 9 high understatement states compared to 16 percent of surveyors in 10 low understatement states, initial surveyor training was not sufficient to cite appropriate scope and severity--a skill critical in preventing understatement. Furthermore, over half of directors identified the need for ongoing training for experienced surveyors on both this skill and on documenting deficiencies, a critical skill to substantiate citations. CMS provides little guidance to states on supervisory review processes. In general, directors reported on our questionnaire that supervisory reviews occurred more often on surveys with higher-level rather than on those with lower-level deficiencies, which were the most frequently understated. Surveyors who reported that survey teams had too many new surveyors also reported frequent changes to or removal of deficiencies, indicating heavier reliance on supervisory reviews by states with inexperienced surveyors. Surveyors and directors in a few states informed us that, in isolated cases, state agency practices or external pressure from stakeholders, such as the nursing home industry, may have led to understatement. Forty percent of surveyors in five states and four directors reported that their state had at least one practice not to cite certain deficiencies. Additionally, over 40 percent of surveyors in four states reported that their states' informal dispute resolution processes favored concerns of nursing home operators over resident welfare. Furthermore, directors from seven states reported that pressure from the industry or legislators may have compromised the nursing home survey process, and two directors reported that CMS's support is needed to deal with such pressure. If surveyors perceive that certain deficiencies may not be consistently upheld or enforced, they may choose not to cite them."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Federal and state governments share responsibility for ensuring that  nursing homes provide quality care in a safe environment for the nation\u2019s  1.5 million residents dependent on such care.

The Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), within the Department of Health &  Human Services (HHS), contracts with state survey agencies to conduct  periodic inspections, known as surveys, and complaint investigations, both  of which assess whether homes meet federal standards.

Our first report, issued in May 2008, identified the extent of nursing home  understatement nationwide. It found that 15 percent of federal nursing  home surveys nationwide and 25 percent of these surveys in nine states  identified state surveys that failed to cite serious deficiencies. This report  examines how the following factors affect the understatement of nursing  home deficiencies: (1) the CMS survey process, (2) workforce shortages  and training, (3) supervisory reviews, and (4) state agency practices.", "To do this work, we analyzed data collected from two GAO-administered  Web-based questionnaires, one to nursing home surveyors and the other to  state agency directors; analyzed federal and state nursing home survey  results; interviewed CMS officials from the Survey and Certification Group  and selected Regional Offices; reviewed federal regulations and guidance,  and our prior work; and conducted follow-up interviews with state agency  directors, as needed, to clarify and better understand their unique state  circumstances.", "Our prior work documented the prevalence of understatement   nationwide and described several factors that may contribute to survey  inconsistency and the understatement of deficiencies by state survey  teams: (1) weaknesses in CMS\u2019s survey methodology, including poor  documentation of deficiencies, (2) confusion among surveyors about the  definition of actual harm, (3) predictability of surveys, which allows  homes to conceal problems if they so desire, (4) inadequate quality  assurance processes at the state level to help detect understatement in the  scope and severity of deficiencies, and (5) inexperienced state surveyors  as a result of retention problems.

The  survey team determines whether the care and services provided meet the  assessed needs of the residents and measure resident outcomes, such as  the incidence of preventable pressure sores, weight loss, and accidents. In  contrast to a standard survey, a complaint investigation generally focuses  on a specific allegation regarding a resident\u2019s care or safety and provides  an opportunity for state surveyors to intervene promptly if problems arise  between standard surveys.", "Surveyors assess facilities using federal nursing home quality standards  that focus on the delivery of care, resident outcomes, and facility  conditions. These standards total approximately 200 and are grouped into  15 categories, such as Quality of Life, Resident Assessment, Quality of  Care, and Administration. For example, there are 23 standards (known as  F-tags) within the Quality of Care category ranging from the prevention of  pressure sore development (F-314) to keeping the resident environment as  free of accident hazards (F-323) as is possible.", "Surveyors categorize deficient practices identified on standard surveys  and complaint investigations\u2014facilities\u2019 failures to meet federal  standards\u2014according to scope (i.e., the number of residents potentially or  actually affected) and severity (i.e., the degree of relative harm  involved)\u2014using a scope and severity grid (see table 1). Homes with  deficiencies at the A through C levels are considered to be in substantial  compliance, while those with deficiencies at the D through L levels are  considered out of compliance. Throughout this report, we refer to  deficiencies at the actual harm and immediate jeopardy levels\u2014G through  L\u2014as serious deficiencies. CMS guidance requires state survey teams to  revisit a home to verify that serious deficiencies have actually been  corrected.", "In addition, when serious deficiencies are identified, sanctions can be  imposed to encourage facilities to correct the deficiencies and enforce  federal quality standards. Sanctions include fines known as civil money  penalties, denial of payment for new Medicare or Medicaid admissions, or  termination from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. For example,  facilities that receive at least one G through L level deficiency on  successive standard surveys or complaint investigations must be referred  for immediate sanctions. Facilities may appeal cited deficiencies and if the  appeal is successful, the severity of the sanction could be reduced or the  sanction could be rescinded. Facilities have several avenues of appeal,  including informal dispute resolution (IDR) at the state survey agency  level. The IDR gives providers one opportunity to informally refute cited  deficiencies after any survey. While CMS requires that states have an IDR  policy in place, it does not specify how IDR processes should be  structured."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Survey Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To conduct nursing home surveys, CMS has traditionally used a  methodology that requires surveyors to select a sample of residents and  (1) review data derived from the residents\u2019 assessments and medical  records; (2) interview nursing home staff, residents, and family members;  and (3) observe care provided to residents during the course of the survey.  When conducting a survey, surveyors have discretion in: selecting a  sample of residents to evaluate; allocating survey time and emphasis  within a framework prescribed by CMS; investigating potentially deficient  practices observed during the survey; and determining what evidence is  needed to identify a deficient practice. CMS has developed detailed  investigative protocols to assist state survey agencies in determining  whether nursing homes are in compliance with federal quality standards.  These protocols are intended to ensure the thoroughness and consistency  of state surveys and complaint investigations.", "In 1998, CMS awarded a contract to revise the survey methodology. The  new Quality Indicator Survey (QIS) was developed to improve the  consistency and efficiency of state surveys and provide a more reliable  assessment of quality. The QIS uses an expanded sample of residents and  structured interviews with residents and family members in a two-stage  process. Surveyors are guided through the QIS process using customized  software on tablet personal computers. In stage 1, a large resident sample  is drawn and relevant data from on- and off-site sources is analyzed to  develop a set of quality-of-care indicators, which will be compared to  national benchmarks. Stage 2 systematically investigates potential  quality-of-care concerns identified in stage 1. Because of delays in  implementing the QIS, we recommended in 2003 that CMS finalize the  development, testing, and implementation of a more rigorous survey  methodology, including investigative protocols that provide guidance to  surveyors in documenting deficiencies at the appropriate scope and  severity level. CMS concluded a five-state demonstration process of the  QIS in 2007 and is currently expanding the implementation of the QIS. As  of 2008, only Connecticut had implemented the QIS statewide, and CMS  projected that the QIS would not be fully implemented in every state until  2014."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Administration", "paragraphs": ["States are largely responsible for the administration of the survey  program.

Salaries, particularly surveyor salaries, are the most significant  cost component of state survey activities, which are supported through a  combination of Medicare, Medicaid, and non-Medicaid state funds. CMS  has some requirements for the make-up of nursing home survey teams,  including the involvement of at least one registered nurse (RN) in each  nursing home survey. In February 2009, we reported that officials from the  Association of Health Facility Survey Agencies (AHFSA) and other state  officials told us they have had difficulty recruiting and retaining the survey  workforce for several years. In our report, we recommended that CMS  undertake a broad-based reexamination to ensure, among other aspects,  an adequate survey workforce with sufficient compensation to attract and  retain qualified staff.", "Training: States are responsible for training new surveyors through  participating in actual surveys under direct supervision. Within their first  year of employment, surveyors must complete two CMS online training  courses\u2014the Basic Health Facility Surveyor Course and Principles of  Documentation\u2014and a week-long CMS-led Basic Long-Term Care Health  Facility Surveyor Training Course; at the conclusion of the course  surveyors must pass the Surveyor Minimum Qualifications Test (SMQT) to  survey independently. In addition, state survey agencies are required to  have their own programs for staff development that respond to the need  for continuing development and education of both new and experienced  employees. Such staff development programs must include training for  surveyors on all regulatory requirements and the skills necessary to  conduct surveys. To assist in continuing education, CMS develops a  limited number of courses for ongoing training and provides other training  materials.", "Supervisory Reviews: States may design a supervisory review process for  deficiencies cited during surveys, although CMS does not require them to  do so. In July 2003, we recommended that CMS require states to have a  minimum quality-assurance process that includes a review of a sample of  survey reports below the level of actual harm to assess the  appropriateness of scope and severity levels cited and help reduce  instances of understated quality-of-care problems. CMS did not  implement this recommendation.", "State Agency Practices and Policies: State survey agencies\u2019 practices,  including those on citing deficiencies and addressing pressure from the  industry or others, are largely left to the discretion of state survey  agencies. In the past, we reported that in one state, CMS officials had  found surveyors were not citing all deficiencies. If a state agency fails to  cite all deficiencies associated with noncompliance, nursing home  deficiencies are understated on the survey record.

A federal survey team conducts an independent  survey of a home recently surveyed by a state survey agency in order to  compare and contrast its findings with those of the state survey team. This  comparison takes place after completion of the federal survey. When  federal surveyors identify a deficiency not cited by state surveyors, they  assess whether the deficiency existed at the time of the state survey and  should have been cited.

State teams are evaluated in six areas, including two\u2014 General Investigation and Deficiency Determination\u2014that affect the  appropriate identification and citation of deficiencies. The General  Investigation segment assesses the effectiveness of state survey team  actions such as collection of information, discussion of survey  observations, interviews with nursing home residents, and implementation  of CMS investigative protocols. The Deficiency Determination segment  evaluates the skill with which the state survey teams (1) analyze and  integrate all information collected, (2) use the guidance for surveyors, and  (3) assess compliance with regulatory requirements. Federal observational  surveys are not independent evaluations of the state survey because state  surveyors may perform their survey tasks more attentively than they  would if federal surveyors were not present; however, they provide more  immediate feedback to state surveyors and may help identify state  surveyor training needs.", "We previously reported that state survey teams\u2019 poor performance on  federal observational surveys in the areas of General Investigation and  Deficiency Determination may contribute to the understatement of  deficiencies. Further, poor state performance in these two areas  supported the finding of understatement as identified through the federal  comparative surveys. We found that about 8 percent of state survey teams  observed by federal surveyors nationwide received below-satisfactory  ratings on General Investigation and Deficiency Determination from fiscal  years 2002 through 2007. However, surveyors in high-understatement  states performed worse in these two areas of the federal observational  surveys than surveyors in the low-understatement states.

Both surveyors and state agency  directors mentioned concerns about the length, complexity, and  subjectivity of the written guidance. One state agency director we  interviewed told us that the size of the SOM made it difficult for surveyors  to carry the guidance and consult it during surveys. Although the SOM is  available in an electronic format, surveyors in this state did not use  laptops. In addition, a small percentage of surveyors commented on our  questionnaire that CMS guidance was inconsistently applied in the field. A  common complaint from these surveyors was that different supervisors  required different levels of evidence in order to cite a deficiency at the  actual harm or immediate jeopardy level. Forty percent of surveyors and  58 percent of state agency directors reported that additional training on  how to apply CMS guidance was needed.", "A specific concern raised about the current survey guidance was  determining the severity level for an observed deficiency.

As we reported in 2003, CMS  officials acknowledged that the language linking actual harm to practices  that have \u201climited consequences\u201d for a resident has created confusion;  however, the agency has not changed or revised this language.", "State agency directors and surveyors indicated that CMS\u2019s written  guidance for certain federal nursing home quality standards could be  improved and that revised investigative protocols were helpful.  Specifically, 11 state agency directors reported that CMS guidance on  quality standards related to abuse could be improved. State agency  directors commented that the guidance for certain quality standards was  too long, with the guidance for two standards being over 50 pages long.  One state agency director also noted that overly complex guidance will  lead to an unmanageable survey process. Surveyors\u2019 concerns about the  sufficiency of CMS\u2019s guidance varied for different quality standards (see  table 3). For instance, 21 percent of surveyors nationwide reported that  CMS guidance on pain management was not sufficient to identify  deficiencies, whereas only 5 percent reported that guidance on pressure  ulcers was not sufficient. Our analysis found that fewer surveyors had  concerns with the guidance on quality standards revised through CMS\u2019s  guidance update initiative. For example, the guidance on pressure ulcers  was revised in 2004 and the guidance on accidents was revised in 2007;  these topics ranked last among the areas of concern. Furthermore, state  agency directors from several states commented on the usefulness of  CMS\u2019s revised investigative protocols for federal quality standards.", "Another weakness associated with the federal survey process was the  potential for surveys to be predictable based solely on their timing.  Eighteen percent of state agency directors reported that survey  predictability or other advance notice of inspections at least sometimes  contributed to understatement in their states. We analyzed state agencies\u2019  most-recent nursing home surveys and found that 29 percent of these  surveys could be considered predictable due to their timing. We previously  reported that survey predictability could contribute to understatement  because it gives nursing homes the opportunity to conceal deficiencies if  they choose to do so. CMS officials previously stated that reducing  survey predictability could require increased funding because more  surveys would need to be conducted within 9 months of the previous  survey.

However, all eight directors  reported that the new QIS methodology was likely to improve survey  consistency both within and across states. In addition, five of these  directors reported that the new QIS methodology was likely to improve  survey quality. Five of the eight directors also indicated that the QIS  required more time than the traditional survey methodology.", "CMS funded an independent evaluation of the QIS, which was completed  by a contractor in December 2007. The evaluation assessed the  effectiveness of the new methodology by studying (1) its effect on  accuracy of surveys, (2) documentation of deficiencies, (3) time required  to complete survey activities, (4) number of deficiencies cited, and   (5) surveyor efficiency. The evaluation did not draw a firm conclusion  about the overall effectiveness of the QIS as measured through these five  areas. For instance, the QIS methodology was associated with an increase  in the total number of deficiencies cited, including an increase in the  number of G-level deficiencies and the number of quality standard areas  cited. However, the evaluation did not find that the QIS methodology  increased survey accuracy, noting that QIS and traditional survey samples  were comparable in overall quality and in the frequency of standards cited  for deficiencies with either a pattern or widespread scope. The results  suggested that more deficiencies with higher scope could have been cited  for both the QIS and traditional surveys. Similarly, there was no evidence  that the QIS resulted in higher-quality documentation or improved  surveyor efficiency. Although five state agency directors reported that the  QIS required more time to complete than the traditional methodology, the  evaluation found some evidence of a learning curve, suggesting that  surveyors were able to complete surveys faster as they became familiar  with the new process. The evaluation generated a number of  recommendations for improving the QIS that are consistent with reducing  understatement, such as improving the specificity and usability of  investigative protocols and evaluating how well the new methodology  accurately identifies the areas in which there are potential quality  problems. Since the evaluation did not find improved accuracy, CMS  concluded that non-QIS factors, including survey guidance clarification  and surveyor training and supervision, would help improve survey  accuracy. Additionally, CMS concluded that future QIS development  efforts should concentrate on improving survey consistency and giving  supervisors more tools to assess the performance of surveyor teams.", "Ten state agency directors that had not yet started implementing the QIS  responded to our questionnaire with concerns about the cost associated  with implementing the new methodology, including the resources required  to train staff and obtain new equipment.

Seventy- two percent of state agency directors reported that they always or  frequently had a surveyor workforce shortage, and another 16 said it  occurred sometimes. The average vacancy rate for surveyors was   14 percent, and one-fourth of states had a vacancy rate of higher than   19 percent (see table 5). Among the 49 reporting states, the vacancy rate  ranged from a maximum of 72 percent in Alabama to 0 percent in Nevada,  Rhode Island, Vermont, and Utah. The workforce shortages have stemmed  mostly from the preference to employ RNs as surveyors in state survey  agencies, with half of reporting states employing RNs as more than   75 percent of their surveyor workforce. In the past, states have claimed  that they had difficulty matching RN salaries offered by the private sector,  and this hampered the hiring and retention of RNs. The Virginia state  agency director commented during an interview that the nursing home  industry values individuals who have passed CMS\u2019s SMQT and hires its  surveyors after they are trained and certified by CMS. Virginia and others  also identified the stress of the job\u2014regular travel, time pressures to  complete the workload, and the regulatory environment\u2014as a challenge to  retaining staff. Previously, we reported that workforce instability arising  from noncompetitive RN surveyor salaries and hiring freezes affected  states\u2019 abilities to complete their survey workload or resulted in the hiring  of less-qualified staff. Most recently, the poor economy has further  constrained state budgets for surveyors. For example, to address its  budget shortfall in 2009, California will furlough its state employees  including surveyors for 2 days every month from February 2009 through  June 2010. An additional 11 states also reported furloughs for 2009, and  13 are considering furloughs, salary reductions, or layoffs or will employ  such measures in the future.", "Inexperienced Surveyors. Many states are attempting to accomplish  their workload with a larger share of inexperienced surveyors, and state  agency directors sometimes linked this reliance on inexperienced staff to  the understatement of nursing home deficiencies. On average, 30 percent  of surveyors had less than 2 years\u2019 experience (see table 5); however the  percentage of inexperienced surveyors ranged from 10 to 82 percent  across states who reported this information. Among state agency  directors, 16 percent indicated that inexperienced surveyors always or  frequently contributed to understatement, while another 48 percent  indicated that surveyor inexperience sometimes contributed to  understatement in their states. In response to our questionnaires,   26 percent of surveyors indicated that survey teams always or frequently  had too many inexperienced surveyors and another 33 percent indicated  that sometimes survey teams had too many inexperienced surveyors (see  table 6). Half or more of all surveyors in six states\u2014Alabama, Alaska,  Arizona, Idaho, New Mexico, and Utah\u2014reported that there were always  or frequently too many new surveyors who were not yet comfortable with  their job responsibilities. For example, 79 percent of surveyors in Arizona  reported that too many new surveyors were not comfortable with their job  responsibilities, and the state agency director was among the 34 percent  who reported that survey teams sometimes had an insufficient number of  experienced surveyors. Overall, 26 percent of state agency directors  indicated that the skill level of surveyors has decreased in the last 5 years.", "In interviews, six state agency directors commented that inexperienced  surveyors possessed different skills or needed more time than experienced  surveyors to complete surveys and that workforce shortages resulted in  constant recruiting, over-burdened experienced surveyors, or the need for  additional supervision and training resources. Four states\u2014Kentucky,  Nevada, New Mexico, and Virginia\u2014reported not having enough dedicated  training staff to handle the initial training for new surveyors.", "Workload. State inability to complete workload was, in part, an  outgrowth of the workforce shortages and reliance on inexperienced  surveyors. More than two-thirds of state agency directors reported on our  questionnaire that staffing posed a problem for completing complaint  surveys, and more than half reported that staffing posed a problem for  completing standard or revisit surveys. In addition, 46 percent of state  agency directors reported that time pressures always, frequently, or  sometimes contributed to understatement in their states. In response to  our questionnaire, 16 percent of surveyors nationwide reported that  workload burden influenced the citation of deficiencies\u2014including 14  states with 20 percent or more surveyors reporting the same. More than 50  percent of surveyors identified insufficient team size or time pressures as  having an effect on the thoroughness of surveys. Surveyors\u2019 comments  reiterated these concerns\u2014over 15 percent of surveyors who wrote  comments complained about the amount of time allotted to complete  surveys or survey paperwork, and 11 percent indicated that staffing was  insufficient to complete surveys. One state agency director suggested to  us that CMS establish a national team of surveyors to augment states\u2019  when they fell behind on their workload or had staffing shortages. He  thought the availability of national surveyors could assist states  experiencing workforce shortages and help ensure state workloads were  completed.

As noted earlier, even though CMS has  established specific training requirements, including coursework and the  SMQT certification test, states are responsible for preparing their new  surveyors for the SMQT. According to CMS, 94 percent of new surveyors  nationally passed the SMQT test in 2008 and, on average, surveyors  answered about 77 percent of the questions correctly. These results seem  to support the state agency directors\u2019 assertions that initial training was  insufficient and suggest that the bar for passing the test may be set too  low. Even though we cannot be certain whether the inadequacies are with  the federal or state components of the training, reported differences  among states in satisfaction with the initial surveyor training also could  reflect gaps in state training programs. About 29 percent of surveyors in  high-understatement states reported that initial training was not sufficient  to cite appropriate scope and severity levels, compared with 16 percent of  surveyors in low-understatement states (see table 7). Similarly, 28 percent  of surveyors in high-understatement states, compared with 20 percent of  those in low-understatement states, indicated that initial training was not  sufficient to identify deficiencies for nursing homes. Further, 18 percent of  state agency directors linked the occurrence of understatement always,  frequently, or sometimes with insufficient initial training. From 16 to   20 percent of state agency directors indicated that initial training was  insufficient to (1) enable surveyors to identify deficiencies and (2) assign  the appropriate level of scope and severity.", "Ongoing Training. Ongoing training programs are the purview of state  agencies; therefore, differences between states about the sufficiency of  this training also may point to gaps in the state training programs. On our  questionnaire, about 34 percent of surveyors in high-understatement states  indicated a need for additional training on (1) identifying appropriate  scope and severity levels and (2) documenting deficiencies. This was  significantly more than those from low-understatement states, which  indicated less of a need for additional training in these areas\u201416 and   27 percent, respectively. Among state agency directors, 10 percent  attributed understatement always or frequently to insufficient ongoing  training, while 14 percent indicated that insufficient ongoing training  sometimes gave rise to understatement. Although 74 percent of state  agency directors indicated that the state had ongoing annual training  requirements, the required number of hours and the type of training varied  widely by state in 2007. Among the 33 states that provided the required  amount of annual state training, these hours ranged from 0 to 120 hours  per year. Meanwhile, 37 states reported one or more type of required  training: 32 states required surveyors to attend periodic training, 22  required on-the-job training, 10 required online computerized training, and  13 states required some other type of training.", "State agency directors indicated that they relied on CMS materials for  ongoing training of experienced surveyors, yet many reported additional  training needs and suggested that use of electronic media could make  continuing education and new guidance more accessible. While 98 percent  of states indicated that the CMS written guidance materials and resources  were useful, over 50 percent of all state agency directors identified  additional training needs in documenting deficiencies, citing deficiencies  at the appropriate scope and severity level, and applying CMS guidance.

States\u2019 workload requirements and  workforce shortages affected the surveyors\u2019 ability to attend initial and  ongoing training. Seven of the eight state agency directors we interviewed  linked workforce shortages and resource constraints to their state\u2019s ability  to complete the survey workload or allow staff to participate in training  courses. One director stated that workload demands compromised  comprehensive training for new staff, and another reported difficulty  placing new staff in CMS\u2019s initial training programs. Due to workload  demands, a third state agency director stated that she could not allow  experienced staff time away from surveying to attend training courses  even when staff paid their own way. Five of the seven state agency  directors suggested that it would be more efficient for training activities to  be conducted more locally such as in their states or to be available  through online, video, or other electronic media, and several emphasized  the need to reduce or eliminate travel for training.

On average, surveys at the D through F level underwent about two steps of  review, while surveys with deficiencies at the immediate jeopardy level   (J through L) went through three steps. For example, Washington  reviews its surveys using either a two-step review that includes survey  team and field manager reviews or a three-step process that includes both  these reviews and an additional review by central state agency staff for  serious deficiencies. As a result, central state agency staff in Washington  do not review deficiencies below the level of actual harm. In addition we  found that five states\u2014Alaska, Hawaii, Illinois, Nebraska, and Nevada\u2014 did not review all surveys with deficiencies at the D through F levels.

Currently, high vacancy rates can  place pressure on state surveyors to complete surveys under difficult  circumstances, including compressed time frames, inadequately staffed  survey teams, and too many inexperienced surveyors. States are  responsible for hiring and retaining surveyors and have grappled with  pervasive and intractable workforce shortages. State agency directors  struggling with these workforce issues reported the need for more readily  accessible training for both their new and experienced surveyors that did  not involve travel to a central location. Nearly 30 percent of surveyors in  high-understatement states stated that initial surveyor training, which is  primarily a state activity that incorporates two CMS on-line computer  courses and a 1-week federal basic training course culminating in the  SMQT, was not adequate to identify deficiencies and cite them at the  appropriate scope and severity level. State agency directors reported that  workforce shortages also impede states\u2019 ability to provide ongoing training  opportunities for experienced staff and that additional CMS online training  and electronic training media would help states maintain an experienced,  well-informed workforce. They noted that any such support should be  cognizant of states\u2019 current resource constraints, including limited funding  of travel for training.", "Supervisory Review Limitations. Currently, CMS provides little  guidance on how states should structure supervisory review processes,  leaving the scope of this important quality-assurance tool exclusively to  the states and resulting in considerable variation throughout the nation in  how these processes are structured. We believe that state quality  assurance processes are a more effective preventive measure against  understatement because they have the potential to be more immediate and  cover more surveys than the limited number of federal comparative  surveys conducted in each state. However, compared to reviews of serious  deficiencies, states conducted relatively fewer reviews of deficiencies at  the D through F level, those that were most frequently understated  throughout the nation, to assess whether or not such deficiencies were  cited at too low a scope and severity level. In addition, we found that  frequent changes to survey results made during supervisory review were  symptomatic of workforce shortages and survey methodology  weaknesses. For example, surveyors who reported that survey teams had  too many new surveyors, more often also reported either frequent changes  to or removals of deficiencies during supervisory reviews\u2014indicating that  states with inexperienced workforces may rely more heavily on  supervisory reviews. In addition, variation existed in the type of feedback  surveyors receive when deficiencies are changed or removed during  supervisory reviews, providing surveyors with inconsistent access to  valuable feedback and training. CMS did not implement our previous  recommendation to require states to have a quality assurance process that  includes, at a minimum, a review of a sample of survey reports below the  actual harm level to assess the appropriateness of the scope and severity  cited and help reduce understatement.", "State Agency Practices and External Pressure. In a few states,  noncitation practices, challenging relationships with the industry or  legislators, or unbalanced IDR processes\u2014those that surveyors regard as  favoring nursing home operators over resident welfare\u2014may have had a  negative effect on survey quality and resulted in the citation of fewer  nursing home deficiencies than was warranted. In one state, both the state  agency director and over 40 percent of surveyors acknowledged the  existence of a noncitation practice such as allowing a home to correct a  deficiency without receiving a citation. Forty percent of surveyors in four  other states also responded on our questionnaire that noncitation  practices existed. Currently, CMS does not explicitly address such  practices in its guidance to states, and its oversight is limited to reviews of  citation patterns, feedback from state surveyors, state performance  reviews, and federal monitoring surveys to determine if such practices  exist. Twelve state agency directors reported on our questionnaire  experiencing some kind of external pressure. For example, in one state a  legislator attended a survey and questioned surveyors as to whether state  agency executives were coercing them to find deficiencies. Under such  circumstances, it is difficult to know if the affected surveyors are  consistently enforcing federal standards and reporting all deficiencies at  the appropriate scope and severity levels. States\u2019 differing experiences  regarding the enforcement of federal standards and collaboration with  their CMS regional offices in the face of significant external pressure also  may confuse or undermine a thorough and independent survey process. If  surveyors believe that CMS does not fully or consistently support the  enforcement of federal standards, these surveyors may choose to avoid  citing deficiencies that they perceive may trigger a reaction from external  stakeholders. In addition, deficiency determinations may be influenced  when IDR processes are perceived to favor nursing home operators over  resident welfare.", "Because many aspects of federal and state operations contribute to the  understatement of deficiencies on nursing home surveys, mitigating this  problem will require the concerted effort of both entities. The interrelated  nature of these challenges suggests a need for increased CMS attention on  the areas noted above and additional federal support for states\u2019 efforts to  enforce federal nursing home quality standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To address concerns about weaknesses in CMS survey methodology and  guidance, we recommend that the Administrator of CMS take the  following two actions:    make sure that action is taken to address concerns identified with the new  QIS methodology, such as ensuring that it accurately identifies potential  quality problems; and   clarify and revise existing CMS written guidance to make it more concise,  simplify its application in the field, and reduce confusion, particularly on  the definition of actual harm.", "To address surveyor workforce shortages and insufficient training, we  recommend that the Administrator of CMS take the following two actions:    consider establishing a pool of additional national surveyors that could  augment state survey teams or identify other approaches to help states  experiencing workforce shortages;   evaluate the current training programs and division of responsibility  between federal and state components to determine the most cost- effective approach to: (1) providing initial surveyor training to new  surveyors, and (2) supporting the continuing education of experienced  surveyors.", "To address inconsistencies in state supervisory reviews, we recommend  that the Administrator of CMS take the following action:    set an expectation through guidance that states have a supervisory review  program as a part of their quality-assurance processes that includes  routine reviews of deficiencies at the level of potential for more than  minimal harm (D-F) and that provides feedback to surveyors regarding  changes made to citations.", "To address state agency practices and external pressure that may  compromise survey accuracy, we recommend that the Administrator of  CMS take the following two actions:  reestablish expectations through guidance to state survey agencies that  noncitation practices\u2014official or unofficial\u2014are inappropriate, and  systematically monitor trends in states\u2019 citations; and   establish expectations through guidance to state survey agencies to  communicate and collaborate with their CMS regional offices when they  experience significant pressure from legislators or the nursing home  industry that may affect the survey process or surveyors\u2019 perceptions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency and AHFSA Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS and AHFSA for comment. In  response, the Acting Administrator of CMS provided written comments.  CMS noted that the report adds value to important public policy  discussions regarding the survey process and contributes ideas for  solutions on the underlying potential causes of understatement. CMS fully  endorsed five of our seven recommendations and indicated it would  explore alternate solutions to our remaining two recommendations, one of  which the agency did not plan to implement on a national scale. (CMS\u2019s  comments are reprinted in appendix II.) AHFSA\u2019s comments noted that  several states agreed with one of our recommendations, but did not  directly express agreement or disagreement with the other  recommendations. AHFSA made several other comments on our findings  and recommendations as summarized below.", "CMS agreed with five of our recommendations that called for:   (1) addressing issues identified with the new QIS methodology,   (2) evaluating current training programs, (3) setting expectations that  states have a supervisory review program, (4) reestablishing expectations  that noncitation practices are inappropriate, and (5) establishing  expectations that states communicate with their CMS regional office when  they experience significant pressure from legislators or the nursing home  industry. In its comments, the agency cited several ongoing efforts as  mechanisms for addressing some of our recommendations. While we  acknowledge the importance of these ongoing efforts, in some areas we  believe more progress and investigation are likely needed to fully address  our findings and recommendations. For example, we recommended that  CMS ensure that measures are taken to address issues identified with the  new QIS methodology, such as ensuring that it accurately identifies  potential quality problems; CMS\u2019s response cited Desk Audit Reports that  enable supervisors to provide improved feedback to surveyors and  quarterly meetings of a user group as evidence of efforts under way to  continuously improve the QIS and to increase survey consistency.  However, we noted that a 2007 evaluation of the QIS did not find improved  survey accuracy compared to the traditional survey process and  recommended that CMS evaluate how well the QIS accurately identifies  areas in which there were potential quality problems. While improving the  consistency of the survey process is important, CMS must also focus on  addressing the accuracy of QIS surveys.", "For the remaining two recommendations, CMS described alternative  solutions that it indicated the agency would explore:    Guidance. The agency agreed in principle with our recommendation to  clarify and revise existing written guidance to make it more concise,  simplify its application in the field, and reduce confusion. However, CMS  disagreed with shortening the guidance as the preferred method for  achieving such clarification. Instead, the agency suggested an alternative\u2014 the creation of some short reference documents for use in the field that  contain cross-links back to the full guidance\u2014that we believe would fulfill  the intent of our recommendation.", "National surveyor pool. CMS indicated it did not plan to implement our  recommendation to consider establishing a pool of additional national  surveyors that could augment state survey teams experiencing workforce  shortages, at least not on a national scale. The agency stated that the  establishment of national survey teams was problematic for several  reasons, including that it (1) began to blur the line between state  accountability for meeting performance expectations and compensating  states for problematic performance due to state management decisions,  and (2) was improper for CMS to tell states how to make personnel  decisions While the agency noted that it used national contractors to  perform surveys for other types of facilities such as organ transplant  centers, it expressed concern about their use to compensate for state  performance issues because of the more frequent nursing home surveys.", "We believe that state workforce shortages are a separate issue from state  performance on surveys. Since 2003, we have reported pervasive state  workforce shortages and this report confirms that such shortages  continue. For example, we reported that one-fourth of states had vacancy  rates higher than 19 percent and that one state reported a 72 percent  vacancy rate. We also believe that addressing workforce shortages is  critical to creating an effective system of oversight for nursing homes and  reducing understatement throughout the nation.", "However, CMS noted that it would explore this issue with a state-federal  work group in order to identify any circumstances in which a national pool  may be advisable and to identify any additional solutions. Reflecting this  comment from CMS, we have revised our original recommendation to  include other potential solutions as well as a national pool of surveyors.  One suggestion in AHFSA comments may be worth exploring in this  regard\u2014providing funds to state survey agencies for recruitment and  retention activities.", "AHFSA commented that vigorous oversight and enforcement are essential  to improving the quality of life and quality of care for health care  consumers and are critical if improvements already achieved are to be  maintained. The association noted that several states agreed with our  recommendation on the need for CMS to revise existing written guidance  to make it more concise. While the association did not directly express  agreement or disagreement with our other recommendations, it did note  that most states would need additional funding to meet any new staffing  requirements associated with our recommendation that CMS set an  expectation for states to have a supervisory review program.", "However, AHFSA noted what it considered to be conflicting assertions  within the report. For example, it noted that we cited inexperienced staff  as a factor that contributes to understatement but also appeared to take  issue with the practice of supervisors changing reports prepared by  inexperienced staff. While our report identifies a wide variety of factors  that may contribute to understatement, we did not and could not  meaningfully prioritize among these factors based on the responses of  nursing home surveyors and state agency directors. We did find that many  states were attempting to accomplish their survey workload with a large  share of inexperienced surveyors and that state agency directors  sometimes linked this reliance on inexperienced staff to the  understatement of nursing home deficiencies. In addition, we found that  frequent changes made during supervisory review were symptomatic of  workforce shortages and survey methodology weaknesses. For example,  surveyors who reported that survey teams had too many new surveyors,  more often also reported either frequent changes to or removals of  deficiencies during supervisory reviews. We believe that state quality  assurance processes have the potential to play an important role in  preventing understatement, which may result in states with inexperienced  workforces relying more heavily on supervisory reviews.", "AHFSA also stated that our report did not address limitations of federal  monitoring surveys, specifically the potential inconsistency among CMS  regional offices in how these surveys are conducted. Assessing CMS\u2019s  performance on federal monitoring surveys was beyond the scope of this  report. However, our May 2008 report noted several improvements CMS  had made since fiscal years 2002 and 2003 in federal comparative surveys  intended to make them more comparable to the state surveys they are  assessing; these improvement include; (1) reducing the time between the  state and federal surveys to ensure that they more accurately capture the  conditions at the time of the state survey, (2) including at least half of the  residents from state survey investigative samples to allow for a more clear- cut determination of whether the state survey should have cited a  deficiency, and (3) using the same number of federal surveyors as the  corresponding state survey, again to more closely mirror the conditions  under which the state survey was conducted.", "Finally, AHFSA questioned whether the information that we received from  surveyors about the IDR process was universally valid because their input  about quality assurance reviews might be biased. Our methodology did not  rely solely on surveyor responses to our questionnaire but used a separate  questionnaire sent to state survey agency directors to help corroborate  their responses. Thus we reported both that (1) over 40 percent of  surveyors in four states indicated that their IDR process favored nursing  home operators and (2) one state survey agency director agreed and three  others acknowledged that frequent IDR hearings sometimes contributed to  the understatement of deficiencies. We also collected and reported data on  the number of deficiencies modified or overturned, which AHFSA said was  a more accurate measure of the effect of IDRs.", "We also incorporated technical comments from AHFSA as appropriate.", "As arranged with your offices, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days after its  issue date.
