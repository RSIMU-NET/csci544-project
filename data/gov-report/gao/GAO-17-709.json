This report examines (1) VHA's processes for enrolling veterans for health care benefits and (2) its related oversight. GAO reviewed federal laws, regulations, and VHA policies and procedures. GAO also interviewed officials from HEC and 6 of VHA's 170 VAMCs selected to provide variation in factors such as number of enrollment applications processed and geographic location; reviewed actions to resolve a randomly selected, nongeneralizable sample of pending enrollment applications from these 6 VAMCs; and interviewed HEC and VAMC officials on oversight of enrollment processes."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Health Administration's (VHA) implementation and oversight of enrollment processes need improvement to help ensure the timely enrollment of veterans for health care benefits.", "VHA frequently did not meet timeliness standards: VHA studies conducted in 2016 revealed that enrollment staff frequently did not process veterans' enrollment applications within the timeliness standard of 5 business days. These issues were found both at VHA's Health Eligibility Center (HEC)\u2014the central enrollment processing center\u2014and at local VA medical centers (VAMC) that also process enrollment applications. In response to an audit recommendation, HEC officials said they have begun prioritizing workload to help meet the timeliness standard. Additionally, the overall time needed to process enrollment applications may increase when staff need to place applications in a pending status, as pending applications require additional information, such as military service information, for staff to make enrollment determinations. However, none of the six VAMCs GAO reviewed had a specific policy for how to resolve pending applications. GAO found that VAMC enrollment staff had not resolved more than half of the pending applications GAO reviewed at these six VAMCs, some of which had been pending for more than 3 months at the time of the review. Although HEC developed new procedures for its enrollment staff to use when resolving pending applications, these procedures were not communicated to VAMCs. Officials from the VAMCs GAO reviewed said that they had not received guidance on these procedures and were confused about whether they would continue to have a role in this process. In the absence of HEC communication with VAMCs, there may be inefficiencies in resolving pending applications. VHA, through HEC, is assessing efforts to improve the timeliness of enrollment application processing and the accuracy of enrollment determinations.", "VHA lacks a standardized oversight process and reliable data to monitor enrollment processes system-wide: Although HEC officials said they are responsible for oversight of enrollment processes system-wide, VHA has neither sufficient policies that delineate this role nor procedures that document key oversight activities that should be conducted. For example, policies do not describe the oversight activities HEC should conduct to help ensure the accuracy of enrollment determinations system-wide. Further, VHA does not have reliable data for overseeing the timeliness of processing enrollment applications at VAMCs, which process 90 percent of the applications system-wide. Officials from the six VAMCs in GAO's review and HEC also had varying interpretations of how to measure the timeliness standard. For example, officials from four of the six VAMCs said the standard was met when enrollment staff entered an application into their local system, irrespective of whether an enrollment determination was made. In contrast, HEC officials said the measurement encompasses the time needed to make an enrollment determination, including any time the application was pending. Without reliable data that are consistently measured, VHA cannot accurately oversee the timeliness of application processing system-wide, or assess the extent to which VAMCs face challenges in implementing enrollment processes. To improve oversight, VHA, through HEC, recently implemented an effort to review the accuracy of some enrollment determinations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that VHA (1) define the responsibilities of VAMCs in resolving pending enrollment applications; (2) define oversight responsibilities to help ensure timely application processing and accurate enrollment determinations; (3) develop procedures for collecting reliable data system-wide to evaluate the timeliness of application processing; and (4) clarify its 5-day timeliness standard.

It provides health care to veterans through 170  medical centers and more than 1,000 outpatient facilities. To receive  care, most veterans must be deemed eligible by VHA through an  assessment of military service and financial need, and enrolled in the  VHA health care system. Enrollment is generally the first step veterans  take when accessing VHA care, thus timely and accurate processing of  veterans\u2019 enrollment applications is critical to helping ensure that eligible  veterans obtain needed health care.", "Over the past decade, VHA has faced growing demand by veterans for its  health care services\u2014due, in part, to veterans returning from military  operations in Afghanistan and Iraq and the needs of an aging veteran  population\u2014and that trend is expected to continue. The total number of  veterans enrolled in VHA\u2019s health care system rose from 7.9 million in  fiscal year 2006 to almost 9 million in fiscal year 2016.", "We and others have expressed concerns about VA\u2019s inability to  effectively provide and oversee timely access to health care, which, in  some cases, reportedly has resulted in harm to veterans. For example,  in 2016, we reported that not all newly enrolled veterans received timely  medical appointments. In 2015, VA\u2019s Office of Inspector General  reported that VHA had mismanaged aspects of its enrollment processes,  and that, as of September 30, 2014, nearly 870,000 veterans\u2019  applications for enrollment were \u201cpending;\u201d that is, no enrollment  determination had been reached for them. Based on serious concerns  about VA\u2019s management and oversight of its health care system, we  concluded that VA health care was a high-risk area and, in 2015, added it  to GAO\u2019s High-Risk List. We expressed continued concerns about VA  health care in our 2017 high-risk update.", "The Explanatory Statement accompanying the Consolidated  Appropriations Act, 2016 included a provision for us to examine VA\u2019s  oversight of patient access to care. This report examines the extent to  which VHA  1.  has implemented processes for enrolling veterans for health care  2.  oversees processes for enrolling veterans for health care benefits.", "To examine the extent to which VHA has implemented processes for  enrolling veterans for health care benefits, we reviewed relevant federal  laws and regulations, and VHA policies and procedures. We interviewed  officials from VHA\u2019s Member Services, including those from its Health  Eligibility Center (HEC), about how they process veterans\u2019 enrollment  applications, including determining eligibility, and from its Compliance and  Internal Control Program Office. Additionally, we reviewed local policies  and procedures for processing enrollment applications, and interviewed  officials responsible for processing enrollment applications at 6 of the 170  local VA medical centers (VAMC) across the United States. These  VAMCs were (1) New Mexico VA Health Care System (Albuquerque,  New Mexico); (2) Charles George VAMC (Asheville, North Carolina); (3)  Battle Creek VAMC (Battle Creek, Michigan); (4) North Florida/South  Georgia Veterans Health System (Gainesville and Lake City, Florida); (5)  Providence VAMC (Providence, Rhode Island); and (6) San Francisco VA  Health Care System (San Francisco, California). We selected the 6  VAMCs for variation in factors such as the number of enrollment  applications processed in fiscal year 2015, number of enrollment  applications in a pending status, facility complexity, geographic location,  and involvement in VHA enrollment pilots.", "Although in 2015 VA\u2019s Office of Inspector General identified limitations in  using HEC data for assessing performance of enrollment processing,  based on our discussions with HEC officials, we determined that HEC  data on the number of enrollment applications processed and pending  were sufficiently reliable for our use in selecting individual VAMCs for  review to address our reporting objectives. We also interviewed officials  from 3 additional VAMCs participating in one of VHA\u2019s enrollment pilots to  discuss any lessons learned or enhancements they identified based on  their participation in the pilots. These VAMCs were (1) VA North Texas  Health Care System (Dallas, Texas); (2) Captain James A. Lovell Federal  Health Care Center (North Chicago, Illinois); and (3) South Texas  Veterans Health Care System (San Antonio, Texas).", "Further, for each of the six VAMCs included in our overall review of  enrollment processing, we requested a list of veterans whose enrollment  applications were placed in a pending status between October 1, 2016,  and January 6, 2017, and remained pending as of January 6, 2017.  From these lists we selected 60 veterans\u2014a random, nongeneralizable  sample of 10 veterans from each of the six VAMCs. For each of the 60  applications, we sent VAMC officials a questionnaire to obtain information  on any actions taken to resolve the pending status. Based on the  officials\u2019 responses to our questionnaires, and follow-up interviews in  March and April 2017, we determined for each of the applications whether  an enrollment determination was reached, and if so, the amount of time it  took to resolve the pending status. We also identified reasons why any  applications remained in a pending status.", "To examine the extent to which VHA oversees enrollment processes, we  reviewed relevant documents, including national VHA and available local  VAMC enrollment policies and procedures from the VAMCs in our review.  We also reviewed previously issued external and internal audits of  enrollment processes conducted by VA\u2019s Office of Inspector General and internal VHA auditors. Additionally, we interviewed officials from HEC, the  six VAMCs in our review, and the six Veterans Integrated Service  Networks (VISN) responsible for overseeing these VAMCs about their  oversight efforts. We identified and examined the key mechanisms,  including reports and data, officials told us they use to monitor the status  of enrollment applications, and whether applications are processed in  accordance with VHA timeliness standards. We also asked officials  whether, based on their oversight, they had identified deficiencies or  made any changes to their enrollment processes.", "We evaluated VHA\u2019s implementation of its enrollment processes, and its  key mechanisms for overseeing its enrollment processes against federal  internal control standards related to control activities, control environment,  and information and communication.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2016 through  September 2017 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.

Application information includes demographic, military  service, financial, and insurance information. A veteran may apply  online, by mail, by fax, by phone, or in person. Once a veteran submits an  application, there are three key steps for processing the application:  intake of application, verification of eligibility, and enrollment  determination. There may be an additional processing step\u2014resolving a  pending application\u2014if enrollment staff need additional information to  determine eligibility. According to VHA policy, staff are required to  process applications within 5 business days of receipt. Figure 1  provides an overview of the enrollment process, as of June 2017.", "Intake of application. If a veteran applies in person, or faxes or mails an  application to a VAMC, local enrollment staff enter the application  information into the VAMC\u2019s Veterans Health Information Systems and  Technology Architecture (VistA) system. If a veteran applies in person,  by phone, or faxes or mails an application to HEC, HEC enrollment staff  enter application information into the Enrollment System. A veteran may  also apply online, and the application information is directly transmitted  into the Enrollment System. Historically, VAMCs have received more  than 90 percent of enrollment applications for processing.", "Verification of eligibility. After the intake of an application, VAMC and  HEC staff attempt to verify whether veterans meet eligibility requirements  based on their military service and, if applicable, financial information.  VAMC staff attempt to verify military service by reviewing supporting  documentation provided by veterans (e.g., military discharge or  separation papers). If veterans do not provide any documentation of  military service, staff will try to verify this information through military  service databases. For application information that HEC staff have  entered into the Enrollment System or for those applications that have  been submitted online with information transmitted directly to the  Enrollment System, the system assesses eligibility based on the  information entered. Both VistA and the Enrollment System automatically  assess whether a veteran\u2019s self-reported income meets VHA income  thresholds for eligibility, as applicable. VAMC staff are required to  ensure that application information is accurately entered into VistA.  Application information that is entered into local VistA systems is  transmitted nightly into the Enrollment System.", "Enrollment determination. The Enrollment System makes all enrollment  determinations, including those for applications processed at VAMCs.  Specifically, the Enrollment System determines whether veterans are  enrolled, rejected, or ineligible for health care benefits. Veterans who  are enrolled or rejected are placed in a category based on type of  eligibility\u2014called a priority group\u2014established to manage the provision of  care. For example, priority group 1 consists of veterans who are rated  50 percent or greater based on service-connected disabilities. Priority  group 5 consists of veterans who are eligible because their incomes are  at or below VHA\u2019s eligibility thresholds; and priority group 8g consists of  non-service connected veterans whose incomes are above the  thresholds, and thus are rejected for health care benefits. HEC sends a  letter and a personalized handbook to each veteran once it has made an  enrollment determination with the decision and a description of benefits, if  applicable.", "Resolving pending applications. If VAMC or HEC enrollment staff  cannot verify veterans\u2019 eligibility for making an enrollment determination,  the application is categorized as pending. To resolve a pending  application, VAMC or HEC staff are to contact the veteran to obtain the missing information (e.g., military service or financial information). VAMC  and HEC staff share responsibility for resolving pending applications. For  instance, HEC staff may send a pending application for VAMC staff to  help process. VAMC staff may also contact HEC staff for assistance in  collecting missing information because, for example, according to  officials, HEC has greater access to military service databases."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VHA\u2019s Implementation of Enrollment Processes Has Hindered the Timely and Accurate Enrollment of Veterans, and VHA Is Assessing Efforts to Improve These Processes", "paragraphs": ["VHA enrollment staff, both from HEC and VAMCs, frequently did not  process enrollment applications in accordance with VHA\u2019s timeliness  standards and made incorrect enrollment determinations.

In response to an audit  recommendation, HEC officials said they have begun prioritizing workload  to help meet the timeliness standard.", "A VHA Chief Business Office analysis showed that VAMCs also did not  consistently process online applications within 5 business days.  According to the analysis, only 35 percent of online applications were  processed by VAMCs within 5 business days in fiscal year 2012 and 65  percent through the first 7 months of fiscal year 2016. VAMC officials we  contacted said because there is no mechanism for veterans to provide  supporting military service records, such as discharge papers, with their  online applications, VAMC staff need to obtain the information by  querying available military service databases or following up with the  veterans, which may cause delays in processing. Several VAMC officials  said that HEC should implement automated controls that do not allow  veterans to submit online applications without attaching supporting  documents that include information needed for making enrollment  determinations.", "Additionally, the overall time needed to process enrollment applications  may increase when staff need to place applications in a pending status. In  its September 2015 report, VA\u2019s Office of Inspector General found that,  as of September 2014, the Enrollment System contained nearly 870,000  pending applications, many of which had been pending for more than 5  years. According to the report, 72 percent of those applications were  pending because additional financial information was needed from  veterans. In response to the report, in 2016, HEC and VAMCs undertook  outreach efforts, such as attempting to contact all veterans with pending  applications via phone and letters. According to HEC officials, as of May  2017, they were able to resolve about 30 percent of the applications  (about 255,000 applications). This included enrolling approximately  88,000 veterans, as well as removing from pending status applications for  which HEC officials said veterans were no longer living. HEC officials and  VAMC staff in our review said they experienced problems resolving  pending applications because they were generally several years old and  lacked accurate contact information.

VAMC officials told us they were not aware that some  of the unresolved were in a pending status prior to our review. For the  remaining 9 applications, we found VAMC enrollment staff attempted to  contact the veterans, but were unable to resolve the application, for  example, due to the lack of response from the veteran or lack of valid  contact information. These 9 applications had been in a pending status  between 2 and 5 months at the time of our review.", "For the 25 applications that enrollment staff resolved, we found that staff  enrolled the veterans for 19, and for the other 6, staff determined the  veterans were ineligible or rejected for enrollment.

Similar to the first pilot, technology issues  precluded effective processing. For example, automated verification  was not consistently successful, and most applications processed (65  of 86) required manual intervention to reach an enrollment  determination. In addition, officials said the online application did not  always capture information needed to make an enrollment  determination.", "HEC officials told us they did not obtain sufficient information from the  pilots to make a decision on which option would replace VAMCs use of  VistA for processing applications.

VHA policy states the starting point for measuring adherence with its  timeliness standard is the date the application was submitted online by  the veteran, time-stamped when received by VAMCs or HEC, or the date  the veteran came in person to apply. However, the policy does not  define the end point for measuring the amount of time elapsed and does  not specify whether the processing time includes the time applications are  pending due to missing information. HEC officials told us the end point is  the date of an enrollment determination, and measurement of timeliness  should include any time the application was pending. Officials from four of  the six VAMCs in our review, in contrast, said they considered the  timeliness standard met when an application was entered into the system,  irrespective of whether an enrollment determination was made or whether  the application was pending.", "According to federal internal control standards for information and  communication, management should use quality information to achieve  the entity\u2019s objectives. Management obtains relevant data from relevant  internal and external sources in a timely manner based on identified  information requirements. Relevant data collected have a logical  connection with identified information requirements, and management  evaluates the sources of data for reliability. Without a central repository of  reliable data about enrollment processes and a clearly defined  measurement of the processing standard, VHA cannot reliably and  consistently oversee processing timeliness of enrollment applications,  assess the extent to which VAMCs face challenges in meeting the  standard, and make appropriate decisions to improve processes system- wide.", "HEC officials acknowledged their lack of adequate information to monitor  timeliness of application processing system-wide and told us they plan to  develop the capacity to collect this information. Under the National  Enrollment Improvement, HEC officials identified several steps for  collecting standardized and centralized data for conducting oversight,  including (1) eliminating VAMCs use of VistA for processing enrollment  applications and solely using the Enrollment System, which is able to  capture application receipt dates, (2) developing standardized procedures  for capturing in the Enrollment System the date a mailed application was  received, and (3) developing a series of reporting metrics for assessing  the timeliness of processing applications across different modes.", "However, HEC officials told us that they need VHA approval to implement  these actions, and as of June 2017, they did not have a timeline for when  these actions might be implemented to allow them to accurately track and  report on processing timeliness across all modes and VAMCs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VHA Has Efforts Underway and Planned to Oversee the Accuracy of All Enrollment Determinations", "paragraphs": ["HEC has efforts underway and planned to oversee the accuracy of  enrollment determinations made system-wide. First, VHA\u2014through  HEC\u2014has recently implemented an effort to review the accuracy of  enrollment determinations for which veterans were found to be ineligible  or rejected for health care benefits. This effort, which began in March  2017, employs a dedicated team of HEC staff to centrally conduct these  secondary reviews daily, according to HEC officials. Prior to this date,  VHA instructed VAMCs to conduct monthly secondary reviews of the  accuracy of these enrollment determinations, and report the results of  these reviews to HEC. However, HEC officials said they conducted an  internal review of a sample of applications that had undergone this  secondary review, and found that 20 to 30 percent still were incorrectly  determined to be ineligible or rejected. Although HEC officials said  VAMCs should continue these secondary reviews, HEC will also conduct  its own independent review of all ineligible or rejected enrollment  determinations. HEC officials said they plan to use the results of the  reviews for quality assurance and training purposes with HEC and VAMC  enrollment staff. Additionally, HEC officials told us they plan to expand  their reviews of the accuracy of enrollment determinations and are  currently assessing how to conduct second level reviews effectively  system-wide.

Without efficient and effective enrollment processes, veterans may be  delayed in obtaining needed services or incorrectly denied benefits.  VHA\u2019s current enrollment processes are decentralized and fragmented,  with enrollment processing spread across 170 individual VAMCs as well  as VHA\u2019s HEC. The current processes are also prone to delays and  errors, such as enrollment staff frequently not meeting the 5-day  timeliness standard and making incorrect enrollment determinations when  processing veterans\u2019 enrollment applications.", "In particular, in some instances veterans may not have provided all the  information HEC or VAMC staff need to process an enrollment application  and the application becomes pending. VAMCs, however, do not have  effective processes for obtaining information needed to resolve pending  applications, which has resulted in veterans experiencing unnecessary  delays waiting for enrollment determinations. Although HEC has  developed new procedures for its staff to resolve pending applications,  the procedures do not delineate whether VAMCs have a continued role in  this process or whether they should be following these new procedures.", "A system-wide standard procedure that clarifies the roles and  responsibilities of VAMC enrollment staff in resolving pending applications  may help improve efficiency and help ensure that veterans receive a  timely response when applying for health care benefits.", "Additionally, limitations in VHA\u2019s oversight further impede its ability to  ensure the timeliness of application processing and the accuracy of  enrollment determinations system-wide. VHA has not sufficiently defined  roles and responsibilities for HEC and VISNs for conducting oversight of  enrollment processing. Without establishing and clearly communicating  the entity responsible for oversight and the activities that should be  routinely conducted, there are no assurances that oversight is being  conducted system-wide and deficiencies are being addressed  appropriately. Oversight is further challenged by the lack of reliable and  consistent data needed to evaluate timeliness of processing enrollment  applications, and a clearly defined policy to measure processing  timeliness. Due to this lack of data needed for system-wide oversight,  VHA may be unable to determine if all veterans who submit an application  to VAMCs\u2014which handle a majority of the applications system-wide\u2014are  receiving timely enrollment determinations.
