To conduct this audit, GAO analyzed Iraqi financial data, reviewed U.S. and Iraqi documents, and interviewed U.S. and Iraqi officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO analysis of Iraqi government data showed that Iraq generated an estimated cumulative budget surplus of $52.1 billion through the end of 2009. This estimate is consistent with the method that Iraq uses to calculate its fiscal position. Adjusting for $40.3 billion in estimated outstanding advances as of September 2009 reduces the amount of available surplus funds to $11.8 billion. In April 2010, a senior Ministry of Finance official stated that advances should be deducted from the budget surplus because they are committed for future expenditures or have been paid out. According to this official and Board of Supreme Audit reports on Iraq's financial statements, advances include funds for letters of credit, advance payments on domestic contracts, and other advances. However, Iraq's Board of Supreme Audit has raised concerns that weaknesses in accounting for advances could result in the misappropriation of government funds and inaccurate reporting of expenditures. Furthermore, the composition of some of these advances is unclear; about 40 percent of the outstanding advances through 2008 are defined as \"other temporary advances.\" Under the terms of a February 2010 International Monetary Fund (IMF) arrangement, Iraq agreed to prepare a report on its outstanding advances, which will identify those advances that are recoverable and could be used for future spending, and set a time schedule for their recovery. This Iraqi report is to be completed by September 30, 2010. Another means of assessing Iraq's fiscal position is to examine its financial deposit balances. Iraqi government data and an independent audit report show that, through the end of 2009, Iraq had accumulated between $15.3 billion and $32.2 billion in financial deposit balances held at the Central Bank of Iraq, the Development Fund for Iraq in New York, and state-owned banks in Iraq. This range reflects a discrepancy between the amount of government-sector deposits reported by the Central Bank of Iraq to the IMF and the amount that the Ministry of Finance asserts is available for government spending. In November 2009, the Ministry of Finance reclassified $16.9 billion in state-owned banks as belonging to state-owned enterprises and trusts, leaving $15.3 billion of $32.2 billion available to the Iraqi government for other spending. The IMF is seeking clarification on the amount of financial deposits that is available for government spending. Under the terms of Iraq's 2010 arrangement with the IMF, the Ministry of Finance is required to complete a review of all central government accounts and return any idle balances received from the budget to the central Iraqi Treasury by March 31, 2010. As of August 2010, according to the IMF, this review was still under way. Iraqi government data show that Iraq's security ministries--the Ministries of Defense and Interior--increased their spending from 2005 through 2009 and set aside about $5.5 billion for purchases through the U.S. Foreign Military Sales program. However, over this 5-year period, these ministries did not use between $2.5 billion and $5.2 billion of their budgeted funds that could have been used to address security needs. The administration is requesting $2 billion in additional U.S. funding in its fiscal year 2011 budget request to support the training and equipping of Iraq's military and police. GAO believes that Congress should consider Iraq's available financial resources when reviewing the administration's fiscal year 2011 budget request and any future funding requests for securing and stabilizing Iraq. Also, GAO recommends that the Departments of State and the Treasury work with the Iraqi government to further identify available resources."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since 2003, the United States has reported obligating about $642 billion for  U.S. military operations in Iraq and provided about $24 billion for training,  equipment, supplies, facility construction, and other services for Iraqi  security forces.

Moreover, according to the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA);  the United States Forces-Iraq (USF-I); and the Iraqi Ministers of Finance,  Defense, and Interior, the program provides a way for the security  ministries to spend their money without risking the loss of funds to the  corruption and mismanagement that hamper Iraqi government  contracting. Under FMS, the Ministries of Defense and Interior must  identify their equipment or training needs, transfer funds to an account at  the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and sign a purchase agreement.

This  includes purchase agreements with the Ministry of Defense valued at  about $4.3 billion and purchase agreements with the Ministry of Interior  valued at about $840 million. Through these FMS agreements, Iraq has  purchased tanks, helicopters, naval patrol boats, training aircraft, and  other equipment to improve the capabilities of its army, navy, and air  force. To operate and maintain this equipment, Iraq also has used FMS to  purchase training, support equipment, spare parts, and maintenance and  repair packages. In addition, Iraq has purchased technical services for the  planning, designing, and constructing of security infrastructure, such as  buildings to house its General Directorate of Counterterrorism and a pier  and seawall for a naval base at Umm Qasr.", "According to U.S. and Iraqi officials, the security ministries have used FMS  transfers as a means of setting aside funds that remained unspent at the  end of the fiscal year. For example, in April 2010, officials at the Ministry  of Defense said that they had received Ministry of Finance approval to  transfer $143 million of their unspent 2009 funds into the FMS account.  Similarly, officials from the Ministry of Interior said that they planned to  transfer $300 million to $350 million of their unspent 2009 funds into the  FMS account, and they noted that, if approved, this would be the 4th  consecutive year in which they executed a transfer after the end of the  calendar year.", "The United States is also using U.S. funds to supplement Iraq\u2019s FMS  purchases. Under seven arrangements, the United States contributed  about $550 million and Iraq contributed more than $880 million to provide  Iraq with more than $1.4 billion in equipment and services (see table 7).  For example, in June 2009, Iraq\u2019s Ministry of Defense signed and funded a  $110 million agreement with the United States to purchase eight T-6A  training aircraft for the Iraqi air force. In July 2009, the United States  supplemented this purchase by signing an agreement to provide almost  $100 million in funding for seven additional training aircraft, spare parts,  training, and maintenance. According to officials from USF-I and U.S.  Central Command, these arrangements provide an incentive for Iraq to  purchase U.S. equipment, rather than equipment from foreign vendors,  thereby enhancing military interoperability and reinforcing the strategic  partnership between the two countries.

U.S. officials have cited several reasons that the security  ministries have been unable to fully use their budgeted funds, including  overly centralized decision making and weak procurement capacity.

Our high estimate for outstanding advances ($7.5  billion) assumes that none of the $7.5 billion set aside for FMS purchases,  letters of credit, or other advances has resulted in an expenditure. To  determine the portion of funds set aside for FMS purchases that may have  resulted in the delivery of equipment or services, and that therefore may  have already been recorded as an expenditure by the Ministries of Defense  and Interior, we reviewed a report from the Defense Finance and  Accounting Service showing the value of FMS deliveries to the security  ministries, as of December 31, 2009.

However, billions of dollars that Iraq has budgeted for security  have gone unused. As U.S. troops withdraw, the Iraqi government must  take a larger role in providing security throughout the country. Congress  recently provided the administration with $1 billion in new funding to  support Iraq\u2019s military and police through its passage of a fiscal year 2010  supplemental appropriation. The administration is currently requesting an  additional $2 billion in fiscal year 2011 funding for similar uses. However,  our analysis of Iraqi government data showed cumulative budget surpluses  of $52.1 billion through December 2009, of which at least $11.8 billion is  available for future spending.

In its comments, DOD stated that the Iraqi government believes it  needs to keep about $10 billion to $12 billion, or about 2 to 3 months of  spending, in government accounts as a reserve. Under its arrangement  with the IMF, Iraq agreed to maintain $2.6 billion in the Development Fund  for Iraq to pay for 2 to 3 months of employee wages. Iraq was capable of  maintaining this amount with at least $15.3 billion in financial deposits  that it had at the end of 2009. Furthermore, through June 2010, Iraq  generated almost $2 billion more in revenue than it had predicted in its  budget.

We  subtracted dinar-denominated expenditures from the amounts budgeted to  these ministries in dinars from 2005 through 2009 to determine their  annual unspent funds during this period. We then calculated the sum of  these annual unspent funds to determine their cumulative unspent  resources. Finally, we used the 2009 Iraqi dinar-dollar exchange rates to  convert the cumulative total to dollars. To determine the additional  amounts set aside by these ministries for FMS purchases, we reviewed a  report provided by DSCA detailing the amounts deposited by the  Ministries of Defense and Interior in Iraq\u2019s FMS account as of December  31, 2009. To determine amounts that the Ministries of Defense and Interior  have set aside to finance purchases from foreign vendors through letters  of credit, we obtained data from the Trade Bank of Iraq on letters of cr issued that remained outstanding as of December 31, 2009. Finally, we als received documentation from the Ministry of Defense indicating that it set  aside about $100 million for advances on domestic contracts through the  end of December 2009. With the exception of these Ministry of Defense  data on advances for domestic contracts, our analysis did not reflect any  additional funding that the security ministries may have set aside to pay  for advances. We requested this information from the Ministries of  Defense and Interior through the USF-I advisors to these ministries, but  the ministries did not provide us with any additional data. In our analysis,  we therefore assumed that other advances for the Ministry of Interior total  zero.", "To calculate the amount of cumulative unused funds by these ministries  from 2005 through 2009, we subtracted the cumulative unexpended funds  set aside for FMS purchases, letters of credit, and other advances from the  total unspent funds over the same period. We calculated a range of unused  funds to reflect uncertainty regarding the portion of funds set aside for  FMS purchases, letters of credit, and other advances that had been  recorded as an expenditure. To determine the portion of funds set aside  for FMS purchases that may have resulted in the delivery of equipment or  services, and that therefore may have already been recorded as an  expenditure by the Ministries of Defense and Interior, we reviewed a  report from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service showing the  value of FMS deliveries to the security ministries, as of December 31, 2009.  Similarly, to determine the value of letters of credit that may have resulted  in expenditures, we reviewed data from the Trade Bank of Iraq on letters  of credit that were closed as of December 31, 2009. Finally, to determine  the portion of other advances that may have been expended, we reviewed  data on advances for domestic contracts provided by the Ministry of  Defense.

Our low estimate of unused  funds assumes that none of the funds set aside for FMS purchases, letters  of credit, or Ministry of Defense advances on domestic contracts have  resulted in expenditures.

In a draft of this report,  we stated that we were able to independently corroborate about $15.6  billion of the $40.3 billion in advances that were set aside for FMS  purchases and letters of credit, but we were unable to corroborate the  remaining $24.7 billion. However, in comments on our draft report,  DOD noted that data on all advances are from the Board of Supreme  Audit and the Ministry of Finance and should therefore be treated  consistently. The Board of Supreme Audit raised concerns about all  advances, despite our attempt to independently corroborate a portion  of these advances. We therefore modified our report by deducting the  full $40.3 billion to estimate the low end of our range, but we also  noted that the composition of all the advances was unclear, and the  Board of Supreme Audit highlighted weaknesses in Iraq\u2019s accounting  for them.

We disagree with DOD\u2019s assertion that the message of our report is  inaccurate and not supported by the financial data. As this report  states, Iraq ended 2009 with at least $15.3 billion in financial deposits.  Moreover, IMF-required reviews of Iraq\u2019s outstanding advances and  central government accounts will clarify the total funds available to  the government for spending in 2010 and beyond. The review of  deposits in central government accounts was due to be completed by  March 31, 2010, but, according to the IMF, it was still under way as of  August 2010.

We report a range for Iraq\u2019s available financial deposits on the basis a discrepancy betwe reported by the Central Bank of Iraq to the IMF and the amount that  the Ministry of Finance asserted is available for government spending.  Under the terms of Iraq\u2019s February 2010 arrangement with the IMF Ministry of Finance is required to complete a review of all central  government accounts in the banking system, reconcile them with  Treasury records, and return any idle balances received from the  budget to the central Iraqi Treasury. This review was to be completed  by March 31, 2010, but was still under way as of August 2010. We  believe that it is premature to suggest that Iraq\u2019s available resource fall at the low end of this range until the Ministry of Finance has  completed its review, as it will clarify the total resources available fo government spending. en the amount of government-sector deposits  4.  We agree that it may be prudent for Iraq to maintain a fiscal reserve t o  hedge against volatility in oil prices, its primary source of government  revenues. Under the terms of Iraq\u2019s February 2010 arrangement with  the IMF, Iraq agreed to maintain $2.6 billion in the Development Fund  for Iraq to provide sufficient funds to cover 2 to 3 months in employee  wages for government workers. As we note in this report, Iraq ended  2009 with at least $15.3 billion in available financial deposits. This  amount should be sufficient to provide for a fiscal reserve and cover  an $8 billion to $10 billion deficit DOD predicts Iraq will generate in  2010.  5.  We note in this report that the security ministries spent more than  90  percent of the funds made available to them in 2009. This reflects the  actual value of equipment that has been delivered and training  provided to the security ministries. Data we obtained from the U.S. a Iraqi governments do not allow us to determine amounts disburs advances from these ministries\u2019 budgets on an annual basis, including  in 2009. Rather, we accounted for advances on a cumulative basis by  estimating the total amount of funding spent or otherwise set asi FMS and other foreign and domestic contracts from 2005 through 2009.  6.  As we previously noted, Iraq\u2019s arrangement with the IMF requires that  Iraq maintain $2.6 billion in reserve to cover 2 to 3 months of employee wages for government workers. Our analysis of Iraqi financial data  indicated that Iraq ended 2009 with at least $15.3 billion in available  financial deposits. Furthermore, as DOD acknowledged in its  comments, past experience suggests that any potential deficit in 2010  is likely to be far less than predicted by Iraq\u2019s 2010 budget. This is  particularly likely given that\u2014based on current oil prices and export  volume\u2014Iraq may generate more revenue in 2010 than predicted by its  budget. Iraq\u2019s 2010 budget was based on oil selling for $62.50 per  barrel. From January through June 2010, oil exported by Iraq average almost $75 per barrel, generating revenues almost $2 billion in excess  of that which was predicted by its budget. If this trend continues, Iraq  may have about $4 billion in additional oil export revenues by the e nd  of the year, even if export volume remains lower than expected. Thus,  even if Iraq generates an $8 billion to $10 billion deficit in 2010, as  expected by DOD, Iraq should have sufficient resources to provide for  a small fiscal reserve. DOD provided no documentation to substan Iraqi officials\u2019 statements that a $10 billion to $12 billion reserve is no needed. The IMF does not require this reserve level, nor did any I raqi  official indicate to GAO that such a reserve level was needed. aq has some unsettled foreign debt obligations to neighboring  countries. However, according to Treasury data, creditors have  forgiven more than one-half of Iraq\u2019s prewar debt since 2003, and  continued diplomatic efforts may reduce these obligations further.", "DOD also stated that Iraq does not act like a country with a large fiscalbalance, since it has drawn upon external financing provided through a s  Stand-by Arrangement with the IMF. However, as Treasury noted in it lion  comments on this draft, the IMF has only disbursed about $455 mil of the $3.6 billion available to Iraq for budget support. It is unclear   whether Iraq will need to use the entire IMF financing arrangement in 2010-2011.  8.  We disagree that our report asserts that funds reclassified by the  Ministry of Finance are available for budget support. Rather, as we  point out in comment 3, we report a range for Iraq\u2019s available financial  deposits on the basis of a discrepancy between the amount of  government-sector deposits reported by the Central Bank of Iraq to the  IMF and the amount that the Ministry of Finance asserted is available  for government spending. In our report, we note that in November  2009, the Ministry of Finance reclassified $16.9 billion as unavailable  for government spending, including $7.6 billion held in central ministry  accounts and $9.3 billion held in state-owned enterprises\u2019 accounts.", "We also disagree with DOD\u2019s assertion that the Central Bank of Iraq  has already recognized that the $9.3 billion held in central ministries\u2019  accounts at state-owned banks does not belong to the central  government. The Central Bank of Iraq consolidates these categ its reporting to the IMF, which the IMF in turn reports in its  International Financial Statistics. The Ministry of Finance is  currently undertaking a review of all central government accounts in  ories in  the banking system to reconcile them with Iraqi Treasury records and  ensure that any idle balances received from the budget are returne the central Iraqi Treasury. This Iraqi review should help to clarify  whether some of these government deposits that it reclassified are, in  fact, unencumbered and available for future spending. 9.  Our draft report clearly stated that, according to the Ministry of  Finance, at the end of 2009, outstanding advances should be deduc from available surplus funds, and that $16.9 billion in government  deposits that were reclassified by the Ministry of Finance was not  available for government spending. However, contrary to that which is  implied in DOD\u2019s comment, the Ministry of Finance did not report an  amount of outstanding advances in any of the documentation t provided to us, nor did it calculate an adjusted budget balance by  subtracting out advances. Rather, GAO estimated outstanding  advances to be $40.3 billion as of September 2009 based on our  analysis of Ministry of Finance data and deducted these advances  estimate Iraq\u2019s adjusted surplus.", "Furthermore, we disagree with DOD\u2019s suggestion that the potential  future availability of these funds\u2014as determined by the results of IMF- required reviews of Iraq\u2019s central government accounts and  outstanding advances\u2014is separate from the question of whether Ira capable of additional cost-sharing. When completed, these reviews will clarify the total resources available for cost-sharing.  10.  We modified the section referencing a decrease in deposits from 2008 2009 by explicitly citing the independent Ernst and Young audit reports  that have identified problems verifying deposit balances at the Central  Bank of Iraq and Iraq\u2019s largest state-owned bank\u2014Rafidain bank.  Furthermore, we note in our report that the amount of outstanding  advances increased by about $10 billion from the end of 2008 through  September 2009, which may offer an explanation for why we did not  observe an increase in the deposits of state-owned banks that  corresponds to the decrease in deposits at the Central Bank of Iraq over  this period. However, we also note in this report that the data on  financial deposits do not illustrate a clear relationship between Iraq\u2019s  fiscal balance, adjusted for advances, and financial deposits. For  example, Ministry of Finance data show that in 2008 Iraq generated a  $1.8 billion deficit, after adjusting for advances. However, over the same  period, Iraq\u2019s financial deposits increased by $11.7 billion, from $29.4  billion to $41.1 billion. Accordingly, there is no clear relationship  between Iraq\u2019s adjusted fiscal balance and financial deposits, as DOD  asserts.", "11."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
