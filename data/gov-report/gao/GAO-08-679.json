Other tribal officials cited a desire to maintain compatibility with public schools and/or cited challenges, such as a lack of expertise, as reasons not to pursue alternatives. The three tribal groups pursuing alternatives reported a lack of federal guidance and communication, although they have recently received some initial technical assistance from BIE and Education officials. These tribal groups reported receiving little guidance from BIE and difficulties in communicating with BIE because the Bureau did not always have internal response timelines or meet the ones it had.

The  Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), as amended and  reauthorized by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLBA), authorizes  federal aid to state and local education agencies, including BIE, for the  education of disadvantaged students. As a condition for receiving grants  under Title I-A of the act, states and BIE are accountable for the academic  achievement of students in all public and BIE schools, respectively.  Specifically, NCLBA requires that states and BIE develop academic  content and student achievement standards; measure student proficiency  in math, reading, and science with assessments aligned to these standards;  and determine whether schools are making adequate yearly progress  (AYP) toward meeting the goal that all students will meet or exceed the  state\u2019s proficient level of academic achievement on the state assessments  by 2014. Recognizing that students at BIE schools may have unique needs  and special circumstances, NCLBA provides for tribal governments or  tribal school boards to waive all or part of BIE\u2019s definition of AYP and  propose an alternative.", "As required by NCLBA, BIE established a definition of AYP for BIE-funded  schools through the process of negotiated rulemaking, which involved  federal and tribal officials. BIE issued regulations in 2005 defining  adequate yearly progress for the BIE-funded schools as that of the state in  which the school is located. BIE has used agreements, or memoranda of  understanding (MOU), with the states to delineate the terms of accessing  state assessments and scoring arrangements. BIE\u2019s regulations provide a  framework for tribal governments or tribal school boards\u2014collectively  referred to as tribal groups throughout this report\u2014to waive all or part of  the state\u2019s definition of AYP, content standards, and assessments, and  propose an alternative definition. Such alternatives are subject to the  approval of the Secretaries of the Interior and Education. Upon request,  BIE is required to provide technical assistance\u2014for which it has access to  federal funds designated to assist with assessment-related activities\u2014to  tribal groups that seek to develop an alternative definition of AYP. An  agreement is in place between the Department of Education (Education)  and Interior governing the approval of alternatives. In this engagement, we  are providing information on the extent to which: (1) BIE schools have  adopted state definitions of AYP, content standards, and assessments; (2)  tribal groups have sought alternatives and their reasons as well as the  reasons other tribal groups have not done so; and (3) the federal  government has assisted the tribal groups developing alternatives.", "To obtain information to address our research objectives, we conducted  site visits to BIE schools, reviews of relevant documents and laws, and  interviews with Indian associations and cognizant officials from BIE,  Education, tribal groups and BIE schools, and state departments of  education. We visited seven states\u2014Arizona, California, Florida,  Mississippi, New Mexico, South Dakota, and Washington, and interviewed  officials from 21 BIE schools across those states. We selected the schools  to provide perspectives from several tribes across the nation. The states  we visited collectively account for 133 of the 174 BIE schools and a  majority of BIE students. We also interviewed state education officials  from those seven states.", "To determine the extent to which tribal groups have adopted state  definitions of AYP, content standards, and assessments, we reviewed BIE  documentation, including existing MOUs, and interviewed state education  officials from the seven states and BIE officials, including all 21 BIE  education line officers (ELO), who serve a role analogous to that of a  school district superintendent. To determine the extent to which tribal  groups have sought or adopted alternatives, the nature of the alternatives,  the rationale for seeking them, and the challenges the tribal groups faced,  we interviewed Indian education associations, BIE\u2019s ELOs, as well as  officials representing those tribal groups that had proposed using some  alternative to a state definition of AYP, content standards, or assessments.  In addition, we spoke with officials representing tribal groups that had  neither administered their state\u2019s assessment nor proposed an alternative.  We also interviewed officials of one tribal group that indicated its intent to  continue to use the state\u2019s framework for AYP. We interviewed officials  from the Navajo Nation, Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida,  Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, Seminole Tribe of Florida, Oceti  Sakowin Education Consortium (OSEC), Soboba Band of Luiseno Indians,  as well as officials from the BIE off-reservation boarding school in  California and the eight BIE-funded schools in Washington State, which  serve students from multiple tribes.

According to BIE, in the 2006-07 school  year, educational opportunities were provided to approximately 48,000  students in these schools located across 63 reservations. According to BIE,  American Indian students enrolled in the BIE-funded schools represent  228 tribes, but the majority of students belong to a small number of  tribes.", "The primary mission of BIE schools is to provide quality educational  opportunities that are compatible with tribes\u2019 cultural and economic well- being and their wide diversity as distinct cultural and government entities.  To accomplish its mission, BIE\u2019s elementary and secondary school system  is multifaceted, with schools located in a variety of settings, including  rural, town, suburban, and urban areas. However, the schools are located  primarily in rural areas and small towns and serve American Indian  students living on or near reservations. The BIE school system includes  day schools, on-reservation boarding schools, and off-reservation boarding  schools\u2014which house and educate students from numerous tribes. BIE  schools also vary in size, with an average enrollment of approximately 280  students in school year 2006-07. While the BIE helps fund 174 schools and  12 dormitories, it does not operate all of them; in the 2006-07 school year,  67 percent of BIE schools were tribally operated under federal contracts  or grants (see table 1). Over the past 2 decades, these contracts and grants  have transferred the operation of BIE-funded schools to tribes and tribal  school boards, offering the potential for tribal groups to take greater  ownership of their children\u2019s education."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BIE Organization", "paragraphs": ["The BIE is organized into two major divisions, with one division located in  Albuquerque, New Mexico\u2014called Central Office\u2013West\u2014 and the other  division located in Washington, D.C.\u2014called Central Office\u2013East. The  Central Office\u2013East division conducts research, policy analysis, and  planning, and houses the Division of Post Secondary Education, which  operates two post-secondary institutions and administers operating grants  for 24 colleges operated by tribes and tribal organizations. The BIE  performs some functions of a state education agency and receives grants  from Education. Further, at the time of our review, BIE Central Office\u2013 West had oversight responsibilities for 21 BIE education line offices  located in 10 states that provide assistance and/or oversight for the 186  schools and dormitories.

The act requires states to set  challenging academic content and achievement standards in reading or  language arts, mathematics, and science, and determine whether school  districts and schools make AYP toward meeting these standards. To make  AYP, schools generally must:    show that the percentage of students scoring at the proficient level or  higher meets the state proficiency target for the school as a whole and  for designated student groups,   test 95 percent of all students and those in designated groups, and    meet goals for an additional academic indicator, such as the state\u2019s  graduation rate.", "NCLBA requires states to establish these performance goals so that all  students reach proficiency in reading/language arts, mathematics, and  science by 2014. Schools that have not met their states\u2019 performance  goals for 2 or more consecutive years are identified for improvement and  must implement certain remedial actions that are meant to improve  student academic achievement.", "NCLBA required the Secretary of the Interior to develop a definition of  AYP for BIE schools, through negotiated rulemaking. Interior established  a No Child Left Behind Negotiated Rulemaking Committee (committee) to  develop proposed rules to implement this requirement, among others. By  law, the committee was to be comprised of representatives of the federal  government and tribes served by BIE-funded schools. The committee  held a series of meetings from June 2003 through October 2003 to develop  its recommendations. After a public comment period, the final rule was  published in April 2005. Under the rule, each BIE school must adopt the  academic content standards, assessments, and definition of AYP of the  state in which the school is located beginning with the 2005-06 school  year. Moreover, if states do not give tribal groups access to their  assessments, the tribal groups are obligated to develop alternative  definitions of AYP. The regulations do not delineate how to determine AYP  in the cases in which schools cannot access state assessments and have  not developed an alternative.

The  process is complex because of the many differences in assessments and  criteria for AYP determination across the states. For example, some states  assess students in additional areas, such as testing students in both  reading and language arts. In addition, the complexity of state statistical  formulas for calculating AYP also varies among states. Some states\u2019  formulas include multiple confidence bands while other states use none;  some states reference students\u2019 improvement over their past performance  while others use only current individual performance data on students.  Similarly, annual measurable objectives, alternate AYP indicators, and  formulas for calculating graduation rates also vary across states.", "Under NCLBA, tribal governments or school boards (tribal groups) must  either adopt the Secretary\u2019s definition of AYP\u2014i.e., that of the state in  which they are located\u2014or waive all or part of the definition and propose  an alternative. Specifically, tribal groups that waive all or part of the state\u2019s  definition of AYP must submit a proposal for an alternative definition of  AYP within 60 days of the decision to waive. BIE regulations state that  BIE will notify the tribal group within 60 days of receiving the proposed  alternative definition whether the proposal is complete and, if complete,  an estimated timetable for the final decision. All proposed alternatives  are subject to the approval of the Secretaries of Interior and Education,  with the tribal groups obligated to use the state\u2019s definition, content  standards, and assessments unless the alternative is approved.

BIE  officials told us that, while they were aware that schools should have been  notified of their AYP status prior to the beginning of the 2007-08 school  year, the delay in notification was prolonged due to staffing issues, as well  as schools and states missing deadlines to report assessment data. For  example, BIE officials told us that there was a delay getting assessment  results for the BIE schools in New Mexico due to a statewide scoring  delay. In addition, BIE officials told us that it had been hard to collect  attendance data and graduation data needed to make AYP determinations;  however, they stated that these data will be more readily available in their  new student information system\u2014the Native American Student  Information System.", "BIE officials told us that for the 2006-07 school year, they were unable to  apply one feature of Arizona and North Carolina\u2019s new definitions of AYP  and made determinations for the 51 schools in Arizona and the 2 in North  Carolina using those states\u2019 respective AYP definitions without this new  feature. In particular, BIE officials told us that Arizona and North Carolina  had recently begun to use a growth model, which BIE was unable to use,  as required by the states\u2019 definition of AYP. Some growth models  measure individual student progress across time and require a student  data system that can link the individual students\u2019 current test scores to  those of prior years. BIE officials told us that their new Native American  Student Information System has such capabilities, but had not been fully  implemented. Officials expressed optimism they would be able to  incorporate growth model-based components of AYP in the next round of  AYP determinations (2007-08).", "In addition, BIE officials told us that four schools, two in California and  two in Florida, were not administering the state exams. These schools  were continuing to administer the standardized tests they had used in  prior years. Officials from all four schools told us that their schools had  adopted the academic content standards of their respective states, but had  not administered the state assessments for different reasons.

In particular, 10 of the 21 BIE ELOs stated that some  schools in their purview had not aligned their curricula to the state  standards for various reasons, including teacher turnover and resistance  to change. For example, one ELO told us that some teachers who had been  teaching the same material for over 40 years resisted changing the  curriculum and preferred to continue to teach as they had been doing for  years. Furthermore, officials from at least nine schools we contacted told  us that their schools had not fully aligned their curriculum with the state  content standards.

First, it plans  to define graduation rates differently from the state. In particular, South  Dakota uses a 4-year window to determine graduation rates. OSEC  officials told us that a definition of graduation rate that included those  who successfully completed high school within 6 years would more  accurately reflect the reality that many students take more than 4 years to  graduate. In addition, OSEC officials told us that they wanted to replace  the attendance component of the state\u2019s definition of AYP with a language  and culture component.", "Furthermore, OSEC would like to develop standards and assessments for its  students in subject areas currently covered by the state assessment, such as  reading, math, and science. To this end, the consortium has submitted a  proposal to BIE officials that provides a framework for developing academic  content standards for math, reading, and science, as well as developing an  assessment. OSEC officials consulted with BIE officials regarding the  proposal, and BIE has since forwarded the proposal to Education for review.  Education officials met with officials from BIE and OSEC in November 2007  to evaluate OSEC\u2019s needs and offer technical assistance.

They also told us that because attendance in the  Miccosukee School was not compulsory, they rejected the use of  attendance as an additional AYP indicator. After having met with  Education officials and a consultant, the Miccosukee told us that they  were considering various options in their development of an alternative  assessment, including augmenting the Terra Nova or developing a new  assessment based on a modified version of Florida\u2019s academic content  standards. Officials also told us that they were working on developing  standards for Miccosukee culture and language to implement an  assessment that would serve as the additional AYP indicator in lieu of  attendance for their students in third through eighth grade."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Remaining Tribal Groups Have Not Pursued Alternatives for Various Reasons, including the Desire to Maintain Compatibility with Public Schools and Potential Challenges to Developing Alternatives", "paragraphs": ["Officials representing BIE schools in California, Mississippi, and  Washington told us that it was important that their schools be compatible  with the local public schools. For example, officials from the BIE schools  in Mississippi told us that they wanted their students to take the same  tests as students attending Mississippi public schools, in part to ensure  that they received the same diploma. In addition, officials from one  California school explained that their students come from public schools  and may return to public schools in high school. These officials told us  that it made more sense for the students to take the state tests for  continuity. In addition, BIE school officials in California, Mississippi, and  Washington told us that because they followed the state curriculum, it  would be logical to administer the state assessment. However, while the  tribal groups representing the eight BIE schools in Washington have not  waived the state definition of AYP, they have proposed a technical change  that would affect how BIE officials determine AYP for these schools. In  particular, BIE considers the 2002-03 school year as the baseline for its  AYP determinations; however, officials representing the BIE schools in  Washington told us that the 2005-06 school year is a more appropriate  baseline, as it is the first year in which they administered the state  assessment for AYP purposes. While the Washington state superintendent  approved the schools\u2019 request to change the baseline school year, BIE  officials have not done so. As a result, officials representing one of the  schools challenged BIE\u2019s AYP determination for the 2005-06 school year.", "School officials and education line officers identified several potential  challenges that tribal groups might encounter in their efforts to develop  alternative standards or assessments, including a lack of expertise, funding,  and time (see table 6). According to ELOs and school and Education  officials, the specialized knowledge needed to develop an alternative  definition of AYP is generally beyond the capacity of tribal groups. For  example, ELOs and Education officials stated that the technical expertise  needed to develop an assessment was not available among members of some  tribes and would need to be obtained through consultant contracts. School  officials from Mississippi and Washington agreed that developing such  alternatives would require expertise beyond that available within their tribal  groups. With regard to financing the development of alternatives, Education  officials stated that developing standards and assessments could cost tens of  millions of dollars\u2014financial resources that are generally not available  among many tribal groups for this purpose.", "Education officials and ELOs also agreed that developing alternatives  requires an extensive time commitment that may not be sustainable given  changes in leadership. In particular, Education officials told us that  developing, piloting, and testing alternative content standards or  assessments can take from 12 months to 3 years. Some of the education  line officers we interviewed volunteered that the required time  commitment could affect support for such a project. Five of the ELOs and  two school officials specifically noted that the time needed to develop an  alternative would be a challenge for their tribal groups or school boards,  with one school official citing the time commitment needed to help  teachers understand and incorporate alternative standards into their  lesson plans. One school official stated that changes in BIE leadership had  led to different interpretations of how to implement the NCLBA provision  related to developing alternatives."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Tribal Groups Considering Alternatives and School Officials Reported a Lack of Federal Guidance and Communication, but BIE and Education Have Recently Begun Providing Some Initial Assistance", "paragraphs": ["Most tribal groups, school officials, and ELOs we spoke with said they had  little guidance about the process BIE uses to help tribal groups develop  alternatives.

Likewise, we found school officials were also unsure of BIE\u2019s process for  applying for an alternative. For example, officials from the two BIE  schools in California said they had no knowledge of the BIE process to  assist tribal groups and school boards to develop alternatives. In addition,  officials from one school said they hired legal counsel to assist them with  their request because they were uncertain about BIE\u2019s process for  applying for an alternative.", "About half of the ELOs, despite being the first point of contact, told us  they did not have enough information to accurately describe the process a  tribal group would use to waive the Secretary of the Interior\u2019s definition  and pursue development of an alternative definition of AYP. This may be  at least partly due to turnover among ELOs. Eight of the 21 ELOs said they  had been in their current position for 12 months or less while 7 had been  in their current position from 1 to 3 years.

In another case, the Miccosukee\u2019s written request to  waive the state assessment and develop an alternative went unanswered  by the BIE from October 2006 to June 2007. BIE officials, in  acknowledging their slow response to the tribal groups\u2019 requests for  technical assistance, stated that in some cases tribal groups\u2019 written  requests were not always clear about what they wanted from the BIE or  had not adhered to the regulation that requires the waiver request be  submitted by either a tribal governing body or school board.", "Other tribal groups we interviewed reported frustration in communicating  with BIE due to BIE\u2019s failure to proactively initiate communication when  necessary. For example, officials from one of the BIE schools in California  stated that, although BIE officials were aware that the state had not given  the schools access to the state assessment, BIE had not communicated  with or offered any type of assistance to the schools. Further, OSEC  submitted to BIE a written request for guidance and funds to pay for the  development of assessment tools on developing an alternative definition of  AYP. In its response, the BIE denied the consortium\u2019s written request  without further discussion or inquiry, noting that the request did not come  from either a school board or a tribal governing body but rather a  consortium of schools.", "BIE officials told us that their prior focus had been on ensuring that BIE  schools were accessing and using the state standards and assessments and  therefore did not devote resources to assist those tribal groups who  sought to develop alternatives to the state systems.

However, this BIE staff person has several other key responsibilities  including responsibility for applying 23 state AYP definitions to calculate  the AYP status of BIE schools and responsibility for overseeing the special  education program for all BIE schools. In addition, BIE officials informed  Education officials in September 2007 of the OSEC and Miccosukee\u2019s  requests for technical assistance, and in November 2007 of the Navajo\u2019s  request for technical assistance.", "In response to the requests, BIE and Education officials have recently  offered technical assistance to those tribal groups that are seeking to  develop alternatives. For example, officials from BIE and Education met  with the Miccosukee and OSEC in November 2007 to assess the type of  technical assistance needed in order for the tribe to pursue development  of its alternative. Likewise, officials from BIE and Education also met with  the Navajo Nation in March 2008 to assess their technical assistance needs  as they continue to pursue development of an alternative. In addition to  identifying the types of technical assistance needed by those tribal groups  that have formally submitted a request to waive state standards,  assessments, or definitions of AYP, Education officials told us they have  also sent a contractor to assist tribal groups as they pursue the  development of alternative assessments. Specifically, in Florida, the  Education contractor is charged with helping the Miccosukee to identify  the steps needed to ensure its assessment complies with relevant  regulations under NCLBA by reflecting Florida\u2019s state standards\u2014or any  modified standards that the Miccosukee may adopt.

The BIE reported receiving from  Education a total of $11.7 million for school years 2002-03 through 2007-08,  that was targeted to assessment-related expenses. According to BIE, all of  these funds had been obligated, primarily for improvements to BIE\u2019s  student information and tracking systems and other assessment-related  uses, including professional development. In fact, some tribal groups told  us they were not aware that BIE received funds that might be available to  assist with development of alternatives.

Under the existing MOUs, the state (or BIE) may terminate the agreement,  but notice is required. Additionally, the MOU ensures that tribes\u2019 access to  tests is not dependent on decisions made by particular state officials or  administrations, who could otherwise terminate or impose conditions on  the sharing arrangements without notice. In part because BIE may have  little leverage in negotiating with state education departments, BIE may  encounter difficulty in reaching agreement on these MOUs, especially if a  state imposes challenging conditions. In addition, a large burden is placed  on tribal groups and schools that lack access to state assessments\u2014in  terms of developing an alternative assessment that meets federal  guidelines. Without prompt assistance, such schools may lack appropriate  measures of what children know and can do that could support plans for  educational improvement. Similarly, lack of alignment between curricula  and standards or inability to promptly produce determinations of  performance can slow the pace of improvement for students and schools.", "Clearly, if tribal groups wish to propose an alternative, they must  understand the process in place to pursue this option. Developing  alternatives requires clear and timely communication between BIE and  tribal groups, as well as between BIE and Education. To date, guidance  from BIE on developing alternatives has been limited and BIE\u2019s  communication with tribal groups, BIE ELOs, and Education has been  slow or lacking. Without improved guidance to tribal groups and ELOs,  those tribal groups seeking to develop alternatives may lack information  or receive inaccurate information about how to develop an acceptable  alternative definition. Further, unless BIE establishes response time  frames and processes, the communication between BIE and those tribal  groups seeking alternatives will remain ineffective. As a result, these tribal  groups could continue to view BIE as a hindrance rather than a partner in  the process. While BIE and Education have recently begun offering  technical assistance, clear guidance from BIE and timely communication  between BIE and tribal groups could not only improve working relations,  but also facilitate the use of the provision allowing the alternatives to  address the unique cultural needs of the students."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve support for tribal governments and school boards in their  adoption of definitions of AYP, we are making the following four  recommendations.
