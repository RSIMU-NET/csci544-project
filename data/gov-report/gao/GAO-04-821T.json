Postwar field testing used to estimate the source term did not realistically simulate the actual conditions of bombings or demolitions. Finally, the results of all models--DOD and non-DOD models--showed wide divergences as to the plume size and path. DOD's and VA's conclusion about no association between exposure to CW agents and rates of hospitalization and mortality, based on two epidemiological studies conducted and funded by DOD and VA, also cannot be adequately supported because of study weaknesses. In both studies, flawed criteria--DOD's plume model and DOD's estimation of potentially exposed troops based on this model--were used to determine exposure. This may have resulted in large-scale misclassification. Troops under the path of the plume were classified as exposed; those not under the path, as nonexposed. But troops classified as not exposed under one DOD model could be classified as exposed under another DOD model. Under non-DOD models, however, a larger number of troops could be classified as exposed.

We presented our  preliminary results to you in our testimony on June 2, 2003. My statement  today is based on our final report, entitled Gulf War Illnesses: DOD\u2019s  Conclusions about U.S. Troops\u2019 Exposure Are Unsupported, which is  being issued today.", "As you know, many of the approximately 700,000 veterans of the Persian  Gulf War have experienced undiagnosed illnesses since the war\u2019s end in  1991. Some fear they are suffering from chronic disabling conditions  because of wartime exposures to vaccines, as well as chemical warfare  agents, pesticides, and other hazardous substances with known or  suspected adverse health effects. When the issue of the possible exposure  of troops to low levels of chemical warfare agents was first raised, during  the summer of 1993, DOD and the CIA concluded that no U.S. troops were  exposed because (1) there were no forward-deployed Iraqi chemical  warfare agent munitions and (2) the plumes\u2014clouds of chemical warfare  agents\u2014from the bombing that destroyed the Iraqi chemical facilities  could not have reached the troops.", "This position was maintained until 1996, when DOD publicly disclosed that  U.S. troops destroyed a stockpile of chemical warfare agent munitions  after the Gulf War in 1991, at a forward-deployed site, Khamisiyah, in Iraq.  Consequently, DOD and the CIA conducted several analyses using  computer modeling, in an effort to estimate the number of troops that  might have been exposed to chemical warfare agents. Recognizing that  actual data on the source term\u2014such as the quantity and purity  (concentration) of the agent\u2014and the meteorological conditions\u2014such as  the wind and the weather patterns\u2014were not available, in 1996 and 1997,  DOD and the CIA conducted field-testing and modeling of the demolition  of Khamisiyah, to determine the size and path of the plume, as well as the  number of U.S. troops exposed to chemical warfare agents within the area  of the modeled plume\u2019s path. During these initial modeling efforts, DOD  also asked the Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) Lawrence Livermore  National Laboratories (LLNL) to conduct modeling. In 1997, DOD and the  CIA also combined the results of five different meteorological and  dispersion models into a composite simulation of the plume area. They  conducted additional simulations, using meteorological and dispersal  models, to estimate the path of exposure from plumes during the  bombings of sites other than Khamisiyah\u2014Al Muthanna, Muhammadiyat,  and Ukhaydir. In 2000, DOD revised its modeling estimates for the  destruction of chemical warfare agents at Khamisiyah, and estimated that  101,752 U.S. troops had potentially been exposed.", "In response to your request, we evaluated how well conclusions\u2014about  the extent of exposure of U.S. troops and the association between CW  exposure and troops\u2019 hospitalization and mortality rates\u2014are supported  by available evidence.

These models estimate both the path  of a plume and the degree of potential hazard posed by the chemical  warfare agents. Dispersion models used during the Gulf War included the  Hazard Prediction and Assessment Capability (HPAC) along with its  component, the Second-order Closure Integrated Puff (SCIPUFF) model;  the Vapor, Liquid, and Solid Tracking (VLSTRACK) model; the Non- Uniform Simple Surface Evaporation (NUSSE) model; and the  Atmospheric Dispersion by Particle-in-Cell (ADPIC) model."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Conclusion about U.S. Troops\u2019 Exposure to Chemical Warfare Agents Cannot Be Adequately Supported", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s conclusion about the extent of U.S. troops\u2019 exposure to chemical  warfare agents during and immediately after the Gulf War, based upon  DOD and CIA plume model estimates, cannot be adequately supported.  This is because of uncertainty associated with the source term data and  meteorological data. Further, the models themselves are neither  sufficiently certain nor precise to draw reasonable conclusions about the  size or path (that is, the direction) of the plumes.", "In particular, we found five reasons to question DOD\u2019s conclusion. First,  the models DOD and the CIA selected were in house models not fully  developed for analyzing long-range dispersion of chemical warfare agents  as environmental hazards. DOD and CIA officials selected several in-house  models to run plume simulations. For Khamisiyah and the other Iraqi sites  selected for examination, DOD selected the COAMPS and OMEGA  meteorological models and the HPAC/SCIPUFF and VLSTRACK dispersion  models. However, these models were not at the time fully developed for  modeling long-range environmental hazards.", "Second, the assumptions about the source term data used in the models  are inaccurate. The source term data DOD used in the modeling for sites at  Khamisiyah, as well as Al Muthanna and Muhammadiyat, contain  significant unreliable assumptions. DOD and the CIA based assumptions  on field testing, intelligence information, imagery, UNSCOM inspections,  and Iraqi declarations to UNSCOM. However, these assumptions were  based on limited, nonvalidated, and unconfirmed data concerning (1) the  nature of the Khamisiyah pit demolition, (2) meteorology, (3) agent purity,  (4) amount of agent released, and (5) other chemical warfare agent data.  In addition, DOD and the CIA excluded from their modeling efforts many  other sites and potential hazards associated with the destruction of binary  chemical weapons, vast stores of chemical warfare agent precursor  materials, and the potential release of toxic byproducts and chemical  warfare agents from other sites.", "Third, in most of the modeling performed, the plume heights were  significantly underestimated. Actual plume height would have been  significantly higher than the height DOD estimated in its modeling of  demolition operations and bombings. The plume height estimates that the  CIA provided for demolition operations at the Khamisiyah pit were 0 to  100 meters. However, neither DOD nor the CIA conducted testing to  support estimated plume height associated with the bombings of Al  Muthanna, Muhammadiyat, or Ukhaydir. According to DOD modelers,  neither plume height nor any other heat or blast effects associated with  these bombings were calculated from the models; instead, these data were  taken from DOD\u2019s Office of the Special Assistant for Gulf War Illnesses. In  addition, according to a principal Defense Threat Reduction Agency  modeler, DOD\u2019s data on plume height were inconsistent with other test  data for the types of facilities bombed.", "Fourth, postwar field testing at the U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground, in  Utah, to estimate the source term data did not realistically simulate the  actual conditions of the demolition operations at Khamisiyah or the effects  of the bombings at any of the other sites in Iraq. For field testing to be  effective, conditions have to be as close to the actual event as possible, but  these tests did not provide more definitive data for DOD and CIA\u2019s models.  The tests did not realistically simulate the conditions of the demolition of  122 mm chemical-filled rockets in Khamisiyah. The simulations took place  under conditions that were not comparable with those at Khamisiyah.  There were differences in meteorological and soil conditions; the  construction material of munitions crates; rocket construction (including  the use of concrete-filled pipes as rocket replacements to provide inert  filler to simulate larger stacks); and the number of rockets, with far fewer  rockets and, therefore, less explosive materials. In addition, in the tests,  the agent stimulant used had physical properties different from those of  the actual agent.", "Finally, there are wide divergences\u2014with regard to the size and path of  the plume and the extent to which troops were exposed\u2014among the  individual models DOD selected. The models DOD used to predict the  fallout from Khamisiyah and the other sites showed great divergence, even  with the same source term data. While the models\u2019 divergences included  plume size and paths, DOD made no effort to reconcile them. The IDA  expert panel observed that the results were so divergent that it would not  be possible to choose the most exposed areas or which U.S. troops might  potentially have been exposed. IDA therefore recommended a composite  model, which DOD adopted. However, this approach only masked  differences in individual model projections with respect to divergences in  plume size and path. In addition, DOD chose not to include in the  composite model the results of the LLNL simulation, performed at the IDA  expert panel\u2019s request. The LLNL simulation estimated a larger plume size  and different path from DOD\u2019s models. The IDA panel regarded the LLNL  model as less capable than other models because it modeled atmospheric  phenomena with less fidelity. A modeling simulation done by the Air Force  Technical Applications Center (AFTAC) also showed significant  divergences from DOD\u2019s composite model."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MOD Relied on U.S. Plume Modeling to Determine Their Troops\u2019 Exposure to Chemical Warfare Agents", "paragraphs": ["According to British officials, the MOD did not collect any source term or  meteorological data during the 1991 Persian Gulf War.

Although we  requested this information, DOD researchers failed to provide it.

In particular, the models selected were not fully  developed for projecting long-range environmental fallout, and the  assumptions used to provide the source term data were inaccurate or  flawed.
