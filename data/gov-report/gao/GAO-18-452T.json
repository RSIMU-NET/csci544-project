For the three additional requirements, 15 agencies had provided online access to government information, such as frequently requested records, 12 agencies had designated chief FOIA officers, and 5 agencies had published and updated their FOIA regulations to inform the public of their operations. Until these agencies address all of the requirements, they increase the risk that the public will lack information that ensures transparency and accountability in government operations.", "The 18 selected agencies had backlogs of varying sizes, with 4 agencies having backlogs of 1,000 or more requests during fiscal years 2012 through 2016. These 4 agencies reported using best practices identified by the Department of Justice, such as routinely reviewing metrics, as well as other methods, to help reduce their backlogs. Nevertheless, these agencies' backlogs fluctuated over the 5-year period (see figure). The 4 agencies with the largest backlogs attributed challenges in reducing their backlogs to factors such as increases in the number and complexity of FOIA requests. However, these agencies lacked plans that described how they intend to implement best practices to reduce backlogs. Until agencies develop such plans, they will likely continue to struggle to reduce backlogs to a manageable level.", "Agencies used various types of statutory exemptions to withhold information when processing FOIA requests during fiscal years 2010 to 2016.

Since 1978, we have  issued a number of reports that have addressed various aspects of  federal agencies\u2019 efforts to implement the act.", "As requested, this statement summarizes key preliminary findings based  on our draft report reviewing, among other things, federal agencies\u2019  compliance with FOIA requirements, backlogs, and use of exemptions.

We also chose the agencies to represent a range of sizes (by  number of employees)\u2014large (10,000 or more), medium (1,000 to 9,999),  and small (999 or fewer).

For this report we reviewed Justice\u2019s annual FOIA  Litigation and Compliance reports for calendar years 2008 through 2016  to identify instances in which the department had notified OSC of a  lawsuit regarding improperly withheld FOIA records. We focused our  review on these specific years because the OPEN Government Act of  2007 amended FOIA to require Justice to report on court findings.
