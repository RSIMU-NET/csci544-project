To address these objectives, GAO reviewed the TSGP risk model, fund allocation methodology and program documents, such as TSGP guidance, and interviewed DHS and transit officials, among other steps."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DHS has used a risk analysis model to allocate TSGP funding and award grants to higher-risk transit agencies, although transit agency officials have expressed concerns about changes that have occurred since the TSGP's inception, such as revised priorities. The TSGP risk model includes all three elements of risk--threat, vulnerability, and consequence--but can be strengthened by measuring variations in vulnerability. DHS has held vulnerability constant, which limits the model's overall ability to assess risk and more precisely allocate funds. Although the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) allocated about 90 percent of funding to the highest-risk agencies, lower-risk agency awards were based on other factors in addition to risk. In addition, TSA has revised the TSGP's approach, methodology and funding priorities each year since 2006. These changes have raised predictability and flexibility concerns among transit agencies because they make engaging in long-term planning difficult. DHS met the statutory timeline requirements for allocating and awarding grants, but the two agencies that manage the TSGP--TSA and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)--lack defined roles and responsibilities, and only 3 percent of the funds awarded for fiscal years 2006 through 2008 have been spent as of February 2009. There is no documentation articulating the roles and responsibilities of the agencies, and grant information has not been passed between the two agencies which affected TSA's ability to share grant status information with transit agencies. DHS met statutory deadlines for releasing grant guidance and acting upon applications, but management and resource issues have resulted in delays in approving projects and making funds available, including (1) lengthy project negotiations between transit agencies and TSA; (2) a backlog of required environmental reviews; and (3) a reported lack of personnel to conduct required reviews. As a result, according to FEMA records, as of February 2009, transit agencies have spent about $21 million of the $755 million that has been awarded for fiscal years 2006 through 2008. This spending rate is, in part, caused by agencies receiving authorization to spend grant dollars late in the grant period. Despite concerns over delays, FEMA has not communicated time frames for providing funding. In April 2004, GAO reported that timely grant awards are imperative to provide intended benefits. DHS has reported taking some actions to address delays, including shortening project approval times and hiring staff, but the effectiveness of these efforts is unknown. Although FEMA has taken initial efforts to develop measures to assess the effectiveness of its grant programs, TSA and FEMA lack a plan and related milestones for developing measures specifically for the TSGP, and thus DHS does not have the capability to measure the effectiveness of the program or its investments. Without such a plan, it will be difficult for TSA and FEMA to provide reasonable assurance that measures are being developed to assess the effectiveness of the program as intended. While FEMA is responsible for the financial controls and audits of the TSGP, it does not have a mechanism to systematically collect data and track grant projects throughout the grant process. As a result, FEMA cannot assess whether awards are timely or funds are being used effectively to reduce risk and increase transit system security"]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["American transit passengers, who take approximately 34 million trips each  weekday, rely on mass transit and passenger rail systems to provide  efficient, reliable, and safe transportation.

In an effort to  strengthen the security of the nation\u2019s mass transit and passenger rail  systems against risks associated with potential terrorist attacks, the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has awarded grant funding to the  nation\u2019s transit agencies that DHS has deemed to be of highest risk.  From  2003 to 2008, DHS provided over $1 billion in federal grant funding to U.S.  mass transit and passenger rail agencies for a variety of security activities,  including developing security plans, purchasing or upgrading security  equipment, and providing security training to transit employees. In fiscal  year 2009, DHS plans to award an additional $373 million to mass transit  and passenger rail agencies through the Transit Security Grant Program  (TSGP) to protect the traveling public from acts of terrorism, major  disasters, and other emergencies.

We also obtained grant approval data from TSA and  financial data from FEMA that allowed us to examine whether statutory  deadlines in the DHS appropriations acts were being met, as well as the  time that elapsed between award notification and grant disbursement. To  verify the reliability of the project approval dates and funding amounts  provided by TSA, we compared them to the total funding provided to each  region and found that these amounts matched. For the purposes of our  report, we concluded that TSA data on project approval dates and funding  amounts were sufficiently reliable.

During these site visits, we interviewed  transit agency grant management personnel as well as state administrative  agency personnel from nine states who were responsible for administering  the TSGP grants at the state level. We used specific criteria to select  these mass transit and passenger rail agencies, including eligibility for  grant funding, high levels of ridership, and a diversity of risk levels as  determined by TSA.

However, the risk model also uses ridership to measure  consequence, so its link to vulnerability does not add additional  information about how risk may vary across regions. Without accounting  for variations in vulnerability, the effectiveness of the risk analysis model  may be limited in that it may not fully consider important differences in  regions and transit systems that could affect their vulnerability to attack  and the risk scores may not be as precise.

Although TSA worked with each Tier I region  during the fiscal year 2008 grant cycle, TSA officials reported that some  regions did not submit enough projects that exceeded the minimum  project score required to receive funding. As a result, one Tier I region saw  a reduction in its target allocation. According to TSA officials, these  reductions occurred because they did not want to fund poor quality  projects just because funds were available in a particular region.

Unlike its  cooperative agreement process used to award funds for Tier I agencies,  DHS uses a competitive awards process for Tier II agencies and does not  negotiate the approval of security projects with the Tier II agencies as it  does with the Tier I agencies. Before fiscal year 2008, the executive  committee considered agency risk after the NRP had scored the agency  projects based on their investment justifications; however, the risk score  was not part of a standard methodology or formula for determining  funding. This process changed in fiscal year 2008 when TSA began using  Tier II agency risk scores as one part of its three-part scoring methodology  to determine project competitiveness.  Because applicants compete for  Tier II funds on a project-by-project basis, Tier II grant awards were not  solely based on transit agency risk. Rather, other factors also determined  grant funding. Specifically, our review of the NRP scores showed that  project quality was a major factor in determining if an agency received  grant funding. For example, a lower-risk agency with a high-quality  project was more likely to receive funding than a higher risk agency with a  low-quality project, based on the NRP\u2019s assessment.", "TSA reported that Tier II agencies submitted projects with proposed  investments totaling $37 million during fiscal year 2008, although DHS  initially awarded $16.9 million of the total $36 million allocated to Tier II  agencies. TSA officials reported that this occurred because many projects  were ineligible because of such things as insufficient information, lack of  live monitoring for closed-circuit television projects, or a focus on law  enforcement instead of security. Because there were not enough high- quality projects submitted to fulfill the $36 million allocation for Tier II,  according to TSA, the Secretary of Homeland Security made the decision  to recompete\u2014that is, allow agencies to resubmit projects for funding\u2014 for an additional $6 million. To accomplish this, TSA provided written  feedback to Tier II agencies that received partial funding or no funding  from the initial fiscal year 2008 grant cycle and invited them to reapply for  the $6 million. The initial and recompeted TSGP funding for fiscal year  2008 resulted in DHS awarding about $23 million to all Tier II agencies.  DHS officials stated that the decision to recompete $6 million ensured that  the fiscal year 2008 funding for Tier II agencies was equal to the amount of  funding Tier II agencies received in fiscal year 2007.  TSA officials stated  that all eligible projects recommended by the NRP were funded with the  initial $16.9 million. However, TSA officials commented that during the  recompete, there were more eligible requests than funding available  because of their efforts to provide feedback on unsuccessful applications.  Transit agencies submitted $9.1 million worth of eligible projects for the $6  million in funds, thus projects were funded based on total project scores  until the funds were exhausted.

These changes, such as  the projects that would receive priority for funding, concerned transit  agencies because they meant that the agencies had to change their  proposals in some cases. For example, results from 28 TSA BASE reviews  completed from December 2006 through January 2007 indicated that  security training was an area needing improvement at many transit  agencies and was a critical vulnerability that needed to be addressed  immediately. As a result, after DHS released the fiscal year 2007 grant  guidance in January 2007, TSA officials notified all transit stakeholders in  February 2007 that the top funding priority for fiscal year 2007 would be  changed to training for key frontline employees. TSA informed the transit  agencies that this training would be given elevated priority when the  investment justifications were evaluated for funding merit, and projects  that included training would be funded ahead of other projects. While this  change may have been necessary to adjust to a changing security  environment, the change resulted in transit agencies having less than 2  weeks to decide whether they wanted to change their grant applications  and refocus them on this priority area.

Before  fiscal year 2008, the NRP evaluated Tier II grant projects for project  quality\u2013\u2013including how those projects addressed the grant priorities. In  contrast, Tier I grant projects were determined by negotiations between  TSA and the RTSWG. However, in 2008 DHS introduced a new scoring  methodology for Tiers I and II, which was explicitly outlined in DHS\u2019s  grant guidance that year. According to TSA officials, the change in scoring  methodology was based on stakeholder feedback that DHS be more  transparent and clear about funding priorities and exactly how projects  would be prioritized and ranked.", "However, 28 of 40 transit stakeholders we interviewed (30 transit agencies  and 10 state administrative agencies) and numerous stakeholders at TSGP  after action conferences held in September and October 2008 noted that  the TSGP provides limited flexibility to pursue projects that have been  identified as transit agency security needs. Officials from one state  administrative agency said that prioritizing security projects puts forward- thinking agencies at a disadvantage because if they have already  completed projects that address TSA\u2019s highest funding priorities, then  obtaining funding for alternative projects is difficult. Transit officials from  one agency said the grant priorities provide incentives for agencies to  potentially buy things they do not want or need, and that these  technologies will eventually just sit on the shelf. TSA officials stated that  the TSGP is a limited fund that must be allocated to best maximize the use  of scarce resources based on risk. TSA officials also reported that they  receive requests in excess of available funding, and therefore cannot fund  all eligible requests, necessitating a prioritization and ranking schema and  clear guidance on allowable project types.", "Officials from five large Tier I transit agencies that have chemical  biological detection systems, or would like to install such systems,  expressed concerns that they could no longer receive funding to install  these detection systems. The TSGP listed chemical and biological  detection as an allowable expense for the grant program from fiscal years  2005 through 2007; however, TSA did not fund chemical and biological  projects during fiscal years 2007 and 2008 and listed them as an  unallowable expense for the first time in the fiscal year 2008 guidance.  TSA made this determination because its threat reports and security  assessments determined that improvised explosive devices (IED) and  improvised incendiary devices (IID) are the most common means of  attacking mass transit, and the training of frontline employees needed to  be addressed immediately. However, in fiscal year 2009 chemical and  biological detection systems became eligible, and TSA officials stated that  they may fund chemical and biological detection systems for fiscal year  2009 because some agencies have demonstrated that they can use this  technology effectively and restoring this eligibility may allow agencies to  enhance their response and recovery capabilities.", "Similar concerns over flexibility were outlined in recommendations from  the Mass Transit Security Sector Coordinating Council to the Government  Coordinating Council led by TSA in December 2007. The transit industry  members of the council were concerned about the imbalance among the  priorities listed in the fiscal year 2007 grant guidance and noted that transit  agencies are in the best position to determine the balance of funding  between capital and operating initiatives. They specifically noted that  more predictability and flexibility in implementing priorities cited in the  grant guidance is needed to allow agencies to engage in long-term planning  of security initiatives, allowing agencies to more easily fund projects on a  multiyear basis. According to TSA officials, the collaborative efforts  between TSA and eligible transit agencies in the Tier I regions, combined  with the project effectiveness groupings that cite eligible security  enhancement measures in a prioritized listing, are intended to enhance  predictability and flexibility. In an effort to improve the TSGP, TSA and  FEMA held a conference in September 2008 to obtain feedback from  transit agencies and state administrative agency officials on the fiscal year  2008 grant cycle. At that conference, transit agency stakeholders  continued to express concerns about the need for greater flexibility and  that funding decisions should be informed by the regional strategies that  they have put into place.", "For fiscal year 2009, DHS has reported changing the scoring methodology  to address transit agency concerns over limited flexibility. Specifically,  DHS added a grouping for other mitigation activities that allows some of  the project types that were previously excluded. Furthermore, DHS has  not explicitly excluded any type of project and has enabled transit  agencies to explain to DHS the priority groupings into which they believe  their project should be placed. The decision about project placement,  however, continues to lie with DHS and projects that fall outside of the  established project effectiveness groupings are given the lowest-priority  score.

For fiscal years 2007 through 2009, DHS met the  requirements to release the grant guidance within 75 days for fiscal year  2007 and 30 days for fiscal years 2008 and 2009. The appropriations acts  also set timelines for DHS to act upon the grant applications within 60  days, but until 2009, this did not include approving projects.

For  example, during fiscal year 2007, TSA did not begin approving Tier I  projects until more than 5 months after the award date. One Tier I region  did not receive project approval for its fiscal year 2007 grant projects until  November 2008, or 15 months after the award date. As such, although DHS  met the statutory deadlines for acting upon grant applications within the  time frames established in legislation, project approval was not yet  completed. In contrast, all Tier II agencies involved in the competitive  process, which evaluates all projects at once, had all of their projects  approved by TSA when the awards were announced.", "Delays in approving grant projects after awards were announced have  been attributed to TSA and the transit agencies involved in the cooperative  agreement process taking months to agree upon projects.  According to  TSGP grant guidance, the cooperative agreement process is valuable  because it provides greater flexibility and allows TSA to work directly with  transit agencies to quickly adapt to changes as situations arise during the  grant cycle. However, this cooperative process has also resulted in  significant time passing between the award and final project approval  dates. According to TSA data, during the fiscal year 2006 grant cycle, the  average project took 9.7 months to receive approval. During the initial  grant cycle in fiscal year 2007, the average project approval took 7.1  months. During the supplemental grant cycle in fiscal year 2007, the  average project approval took 5.5 months.

According to TSA officials, the  removal of this cost share requirement caused a disruption because some  transit agencies had to modify their projects, their budgets, or both, which  resulted in final project approval and disbursement delays. One state  administrative agency official in a Tier I region said that delays in funding  approval make program performance period extensions a necessity.  Further, the official stated that because some projects are complex and  involve multiple partners, delays can have a ripple effect and slow project  completion. In addition, as grant program periods are extended, it is  possible for multiple grant years to occur simultaneously, making them a  greater challenge to manage effectively. A TSA official reported that as of  late March 2009, all Tier I projects for fiscal year 2008 were approved.", "A TSA official said that TSA has made progress in managing project  approval time frames by changing some of its procedures for fiscal year  2009, but also noted that some of the delays in previous years could be  attributed to transit agency procedures as well. For example, a TSA  official noted that some transit agencies are required to have projects  approved by their boards of directors or state legislatures\u2014efforts which  contributed to the length of time between award and project approval. For  example, one state administrative agency official said that transit agencies  cannot begin projects until state legislatures approve the projects. The  official noted that this process can take time, especially if the legislature is  not in session. According to TSA, during fiscal year 2009 funds are to be  awarded directly to individual transit agencies; therefore, when DHS  announces the awards, each transit agency\u2019s funding amount must be  finalized at that time. On April 8, 2009, in conjunction with the award  announcement, DHS issued final allocation amounts for transit agencies  for fiscal year 2009.

GPD reviews projects that have no, or limited, EHP impacts, and OEHP  reviews those projects needing a more comprehensive environmental and  historical preservation review. Before April 2007, DHS\u2019s Office of Grants  and Training and TSA shared responsibility for managing the TSGP.  According to OEHP officials currently managing the EHP review process,  when FEMA assumed responsibility for administering the TSGP in April  2007, they discovered that the EHP requirements had not been fully  integrated into the TSGP and that there was a lack of institutional  knowledge among DHS\u2019s staff about how to manage the EHP process and  TSGP requirements.

According to GPD officials, the backlog created by pending EHP reviews  led to a sizable workload for GPD\u2019s limited staff. In addition, GPD officials  estimated that when transit agencies begin applying directly to FEMA for  TSGP grants in fiscal year 2009, instead of going through their state  administrative agencies, this approach will generate a fivefold increase in  TSGP applications as individual transit agencies apply rather than state  administrative agencies.

As might be expected, more recent fiscal  years showed higher unexpended balances. However, low grant  expenditures by transit agencies was commonly reported across all TSGP  grant years, as shown in figure 3, and are related to many transit agencies  receiving authorization to spend their grant dollars near the end of each 2  to 3 year grant performance period. FEMA officials reported that transit  agencies may choose to draw down their award at any time during the  performance period.", "Our analysis of TSA project approval and FEMA grant adjustment notices  (GAN) from fiscal year 2006 or release of funds memos for fiscal year 2007  showed that it could take up to 20 months for transit agencies to receive  approval to begin projects, which accounted for a significant portion of  the grant performance period. FEMA used GANs and release of funds  memos to notify the state administrative agency and the transit agency  that they may begin a project.  In fiscal year 2006, state administrative  agencies may have received more than one GAN for each project. The first  GANs were to notify the state administrative agencies to \u201cobligate and  expend\u201d the funds, which meant that they could begin the projects.  However, this did not mean that they could draw down any funding. Only  upon receipt of the \u201cobligate, expend, and draw down\u201d GAN could the  funds be withdrawn. This two-part GAN process created some confusion  among transit stakeholders and, in fiscal year 2007, FEMA clarified the  GAN process.

They also reported that they  believed the performance period needed to start when the GANs were  received, not when awards were announced. For example, during fiscal  year 2006, one Tier I transit agency was awarded $4 million for a new  integrated security response center, but the agency did not receive  approval to begin the project until June 11, 2008. As a result, unless this  transit agency receives an extension, it will have less than 10 months to  complete the project to stay within the original 30-month performance  period. A transit agency official told us that the agency requested an  extension until June 30, 2010, to complete this project, and was awaiting  FEMA\u2019s response. In addition, in December 2008, a state administrative  agency official for one state sent a request to FEMA for a 2-year extension  to the performance period for the entire state\u2019s fiscal year 2006 TSGP grant  because the \u201cdelays from the federal level have left many of these projects  without a chance of success during the performance period.\u201d", "Transit stakeholders also said that concerns about funding delays have  hampered their ability to effectively plan for and manage projects. For  example, one transit agency official said that because of delays in  receiving grant funding the agency is constantly seeking extensions, which  are often not approved for longer than 3 months. In addition, another  transit agency official stated that state procurement processes can take  additional time to complete, which can also reduce the amount of  available time to complete the project within the performance period.   FEMA officials noted that 2006 was an unusual year for the grant program  because the multiple GANs they issued to state administrative agencies  resulted in confusion among transit agencies about when projects could  begin or when they could start spending money. As a result of the delays  encountered in the fiscal year 2006 grant process, FEMA officials stated in  March 2009 that they were notifying transit agencies of one-year  extensions for all fiscal year 2006 grants that were set to end on March 31,  2009.

However, despite this role, FEMA does not have a  mechanism for systematically collecting data on the status of individual  grant projects throughout this review process, including tracking the  status of the reviews it conducts and the release of funds to transit  agencies. Although FEMA has systems to track financial information  related to all of its grant programs, these systems do not allow FEMA to  track the status of grant reviews, such as EHP reviews. As a result, GPD  staff reported that they created a spreadsheet to track this information,  including identifying when TSGP funds were released once requirements  were met. Under this tracking process, each program analyst was  responsible for maintaining accurate records in the spreadsheet. However,  TSA did not have access to it and, until February 2009, the information  was not monitored for accuracy. Further, we found inconsistencies  between FEMA\u2019s spreadsheets and data collected through FEMA\u2019s  financial systems, including the amount of funding being held pending  EHP and other reviews. For example, we found that the total amount of  funds on hold in the GPD internal spreadsheets was not equal to the hold  amounts in FEMA\u2019s financial systems. GPD officials told us that FEMA\u2019s  financial systems were the official record for the awards.", "A FEMA official reported that there are multiple information systems  involved in managing the TSGP. FEMA is in the process of implementing a  new consolidated grants management system\u2014expected to be operational  for the TSGP by October 2009. According to FEMA, the new system is to  include functions that support the application process and is expected to  be fully operational throughout DHS in 2011. Although the system will not  initially support the tracking of grant disbursements, FEMA officials  reported that their intention is to have the system support these functions  in future releases. However, FEMA officials did not have a specific date for  when these capabilities would be available. In addition, as of March 2009,  there was no mechanism for TSA to gain access to grant review or  financial information, even though TSA officials reported requesting  information regarding when funds were released to transit agencies so that  they could track this information. Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government requires agencies to ensure that pertinent  information is recorded and communicated to management and others  within the entity in a form and within a time frame that enables them to  carry out their internal control and other responsibilities. Moreover,  systematically collecting data on the status of grant projects throughout  the grant process could strengthen FEMA and TSA\u2019s ability to effectively  manage the program.", "Similarly, the GPD is responsible for the financial controls and audits of  the TSGP to ensure that funds are appropriately disbursed and used in  accordance with grant requirements. However, the agency does not have a  plan for targeting its monitoring activities related to the use of grant funds  once projects have been implemented. GPD officials said that their office  conducts on-site visits to transit agencies to collect information on the use  of grant funds, but because of a lack of staff resources, their efforts have  mostly been limited to the largest Tier I transit agencies that either have  not spent their grant funding or were not able to complete projects within  the designated grant period. GPD officials said that they also conduct  document reviews, including reviewing quarterly financial reports,  progress reports, and special conditions to release funds. Although they  reported having limited resources, GPD officials said that they were able  to conduct approximately 24 site visits during fiscal years 2006 through  2008, attend numerous RTSWG meetings, and interact with transit  agencies at conferences as part of their efforts to monitor the awards.  GPD officials also reported creating a monitoring tool for the fiscal year  2007 grant cycle to be used during on-site visits, and officials stated that  the agency plans to modify the tool each grant year based on the specific  grant requirements for that year. GPD officials also reported that the tool  has been used by GPD program analysts during their site visits.", "While GPD\u2019s monitoring tool will likely strengthen the agency\u2019s ability to  monitor grant activities, GPD lacks a plan to delineate how and when this  monitoring will take place. GPD officials acknowledged that a robust  monitoring plan needs to be implemented with processes in place to  ensure that the agency visits each transit agency at least once a year.  According to grants management best practices, monitoring grantee  performance helps ensure that grant goals are reached, and it is important  that agencies identify, prioritize and manage potential at-risk recipients.  For example, one federal agency with grant-making responsibilities has  created monitoring plans that include criteria to perform risk assessments,  which consider factors affecting a grantees ability to effectively manage  grants. This information could be used to prioritize monitoring activities  given GPD\u2019s limited personnel. In addition, in September 2006 we reported  on the value of feedback provided through performance monitoring plans  and tools such as site visits. Moreover, TSA officials stated that their  agency currently has no role in the oversight of grant expenditures, but  believed that the use of its inspectors to provide grant oversight would be  a key component of the overall approach to mass transit security. TSA\u2019s  surface transportation security inspectors, who are located throughout the  United States, interact with transit agencies for other purposes on a  regular basis, and could be used for on-site monitoring. In October 2005,  we reported that leveraging resources is vital to achieving effective  collaboration. A monitoring plan would provide GPD with a road map for  how it will carry out its monitoring activities to help ensure that it is  effectively using its limited resources. In addition, by working  collaboratively with TSA and its surface inspectors, who have security  expertise, GPD could leverage existing resources to ensure that transit  agencies are complying with security specifications set out in TSGP grant  guidance and the agencies\u2019 own investment justifications."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As terrorist attacks on transit systems overseas have made clear, even  with a variety of security precautions in place, mass transit systems that  move high volumes of passengers daily remain vulnerable to attack. Risk  management has been endorsed by the federal government as a way to  direct finite resources to those areas at greatest risk of a terrorist attack.  While DHS uses a risk-based process to allocate funding for the TSGP,  without considering possible variations in vulnerability in the risk model,  the risk scores developed through the model are not as precise as they  could be, which could affect the allocation of funds to Tier I and Tier II  agencies. In addition, articulating roles and responsibilities for managing  the TSGP could strengthen TSA and FEMA\u2019s ability to ensure that  activities, processes, and resources are aligned to achieve a common  outcome and ensure smooth coordination during the grant process.  Further, TSA\u2019s delays in approving projects and FEMA\u2019s backlog of project  reviews are contributing to delays, which negatively affect the ability of  transit agencies to complete their projects within grant performance  periods. However, TSA has made changes to the project approval process  for fiscal year 2009, which resulted in all projects being approved at the  same time as the grant award announcement. FEMA has also reported  plans to modify its approach for managing the administrative requirements  of the TSGP, including revising its environmental regulations to be more  inclusive of all the types of projects, including nondisaster homeland  security grants. While FEMA has not reported a time frame for completing  this process, establishing milestones to complete this modification could  help FEMA ensure that revisions to its environmental regulations are  conducted in a timely manner.", "We have also previously reported on the importance of performance  monitoring in grant programs. Monitoring the implementation of TSGP  grant projects is vital to ensure that transit agencies are complying with  security specifications set out in the TSGP guidance and in the agencies\u2019  own investment justifications. A monitoring plan that details how and  when monitoring will take place could improve GPD\u2019s ability to plan for  this important oversight function and help it ensure that it is effectively  using its limited resources. A monitoring plan, which includes a method  for leveraging TSA resources, would also put GPD in a better position to  monitor grant implementation by working collaboratively with TSA to  leverage the security expertise of TSA\u2019s surface transportation security  inspectors which will help FEMA address its resource limitations related  to monitoring. In addition, while FEMA\u2019s consolidated grants management  system should allow FEMA to better manage data collection, the system  being developed is not expected to allow FEMA to collect data on the  status of grant activities throughout the grant process or to provide TSA  with access to this information, both of which are vital to ensuring  effective program management. Moreover, until the system is established  and able to track TSGP grants to allow for effective oversight and  management of TSGP funds, FEMA could benefit from establishing an  interim process that tracks the necessary information and share this  information with TSA, its TSGP partner. Finally, performance measures  are fundamental to the successful management of federal programs. As we  have reported, federal programs contributing to the same or similar results  should collaborate to ensure that goals are consistent and, as appropriate,  program efforts are mutually reinforcing. Until TSA and FEMA collaborate  to develop a plan with related milestones for jointly measuring the  effectiveness of TSGP, it will be difficult for the agencies to provide  reasonable assurance that measures are being developed to ensure that  the program is achieving its stated purpose of protecting critical surface  transportation infrastructure and that accountability and effective  stewardship of public resources exist. Finally, the absence of information  on the expected time frames for making funds available to transit agencies  once projects are approved can hinder transit agency efforts to design and  implement projects within the designated performance periods of the  grant."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making seven recommendations to help strengthen the  implementation and oversight of the TSGP.", "To strengthen DHS\u2019s methodology for determining risk, we are  recommending that the Secretary of Homeland Security develop a cost- effective method for incorporating vulnerability information into future  iterations of the TSGP risk model.", "To strengthen the administration, oversight, and internal controls of the  TSGP, we are recommending that the Secretary of Homeland Security  direct TSA and FEMA to take the following four actions:    Define TSA\u2019s and FEMA\u2019s respective roles and responsibilities for  managing the TSGP in an MOU or similar document.", "Develop a cost-effective plan for monitoring the use of grant funds  once projects have been implemented, including a strategy for  leveraging resources that could allow TSA surface transportation  security inspectors to assist in monitoring the grant projects to ensure  that the projects meet the security requirements set out in TSGP  guidance.", "Develop an interim solution to systematically collect data and track  grant activities until FEMA\u2019s grants management system can perform  these functions, and ensure that both agencies have access to these  data.", "Collaborate to develop a plan and milestones for measuring the  effectiveness of the TSGP and its administration.", "In addition, we recommend that the Secretary of Homeland Security direct  FEMA to take the following actions:    Establish a time frame for revising environmental regulations to be  more inclusive of nondisaster homeland security grant programs.", "Establish and communicate time frames for making funds available to  transit agencies once FEMA receives project approvals from TSA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DHS and DOT for review and  comment.

DHS reported  that TSA and FEMA will work collaboratively to develop the MOU before  the fiscal year 2010 grant cycle and share it with external stakeholders to  ensure that the responsibilities and relationships between TSA and FEMA  are clear.", "DHS also concurred with our third recommendation that it develop a cost- effective plan for monitoring the use of grant funds and leverage TSA  surface transportation security inspectors to assist in monitoring these  projects. Specifically, DHS reported that FEMA would work toward  developing a cost-effective monitoring plan to include the use of surface  transportation security inspectors in such instances when their transit  security expertise would be appropriate for monitoring grant program  functions. Because FEMA would be utilizing TSA personnel with  numerous other responsibilities to help with this monitoring, it is  especially important that the two agencies work together to coordinate  this effort and conduct the monitoring as efficiently as possible. For  example, TSA\u2019s surface transportation security inspectors currently  monitor transit agencies through the BASE reviews and could monitor  grant implementation concurrently with those reviews.", "DHS stated that it concurred with our fourth recommendation that TSA  and FEMA develop an interim solution to systematically collect data and  track grant activities until FEMA\u2019s grants management system can perform  these functions, and ensure that both agencies have access to these data.   DHS also stated that TSA and FEMA will identify appropriate channels for  data collection and tracking as well as information sharing so that both  agencies have access to all appropriate information to ensure accurate and  consistent record keeping. In addition, DHS reported that it has taken  action to modify FEMA tracking logs and project spreadsheets to collect  additional information to track projects to improve its collection and  tracking of grant information. However, given that FEMA does not know  when the grants management system will be able to systematically collect  data and track grant activities, it is critical that FEMA develop and  implement this interim solution to collect and track key grant information  as quickly and accurately as possible.", "With regard to our fifth recommendation that TSA and FEMA collaborate  to develop a plan and milestones for measuring the effectiveness of the  TSGP and its administration, DHS stated that it concurred with the  recommendation. DHS reported that a collaborative written plan with  established goals and milestones will be designed and implemented as part  of the MOU or other formal agreement between TSA and FEMA.", "DHS concurred with our sixth recommendation that FEMA establish a  time frame for revising environmental regulations that consider  nondisaster homeland security grant programs. However, in its comments  on this recommendation, DHS stated that FEMA\u2019s environmental  regulations apply to nondisaster grants. We did not intend to suggest that  the regulations did not currently apply to nondisaster grants.  Rather, we  are recommending that FEMA establish a time frame for completing its  plans to revise regulations that are currently focused on emergency  management program issues to be more inclusive of the types of issues  associated with nondisaster grant programs. In response to this comment,  and to clarify our point, we revised the recommendation to reflect that the  environmental regulations apply to all FEMA grant programs, but that  FEMA should establish time frames for revising the regulations to be more  inclusive of nondisaster grants. DHS also stated that FEMA is currently  working with DHS to update these procedures and is targeting completion  of this effort for the end of calendar year 2009. However, DHS noted that  these efforts could be extended if delays occur because of additional time  needed to complete procedural changes.", "With regard to our seventh recommendation that FEMA establish and  communicate time frames for making funds available to transit agencies  once FEMA receives project approvals from TSA, DHS concurred.  Specifically, DHS also reported that FEMA will make every reasonable  effort to establish and communicate time frames for releasing funds to  TSGP grantees once FEMA receives approval of grant projects from TSA.   However, DHS noted that the release of funds often depends on the  responsiveness of grantees in submitting required documents and thus  FEMA would work proactively to obtain required information. DHS also  reported that FEMA would release grant funds within 3 to 5 days, if all  required EHP and budget information is received from grantees, and  appropriate clearances are provided by OEHP and the FEMA financial  analyst. However, our recommendation also intended that FEMA establish  timeframes for when its internal reviews would be completed once it  receives all of the required documents to facilitate a timely distribution of  TSGP awards. FEMA\u2019s OEHP already has time frames for completing its  EHP review process and a related performance metric to assess its  effectiveness in meeting these time frames. Establishing such time frames  for its other internal reviews and communicating those to transit agencies  could help improve transit agency efforts to implement projects within the  designated performance periods of the grant.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

We obtained the Transportation Security Administration  (TSA) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s (FEMA) risk  analysis model for the TSGP for fiscal years 2007 and 2008. We analyzed  the model for these fiscal years to determine the process by which DHS  used the model to estimate risk\u2014by incorporating threat, vulnerability,  and consequence information\u2014as well as how the model was used to  divide regions into Tier I (higher risk) and Tier II (lower risk), and make  allocations to tiers and regions and the extent to which these allocations  were tied to the region\u2019s or transit agency\u2019s share of risk. We also  interviewed officials from TSA and FEMA as well as FEMA\u2019s contractor,  Digital Sandbox, to understand what information was included in the  model and how the model was managed between the two agencies. We did  not evaluate the quality of the information or data included in the model,  but instead evaluated the model for how it incorporated the required  elements of risk. We determined the reliability of the model by discussing  methods of entering and maintaining data with agency officials. On the  basis of these discussions, and our review of the processes used to collect  the data, we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report.", "To determine the extent to which grant requirements have changed since  fiscal year 2006, we analyzed TSA\u2019s grant guidance and grant priorities for  fiscal years 2006 through 2009, and attended TSA and FEMA presentations  to transit agencies prior to the release of the grant guidance as well as  after-action conferences for the fiscal year 2008 grant cycle.  Additionally,  we interviewed TSA and FEMA officials about the TSGP grant  determination process used in fiscal years 2006, 2007, and 2008\u2013\u2013including  TSA\u2019s scoring methodology for Tier I and II and the national review panel  criteria used for Tier II\u2013\u2013and about the changes made to the process for  fiscal year 2009. We also interviewed 30 mass transit and passenger rail  operators that have applied for, received grant funding, or both to gain  their perspectives on how the grant requirements have changed since  fiscal year 2006 and the impact that these changes have had on the grant  process. The agencies we interviewed represent 75 percent of the nation\u2019s  total mass transit and passenger rail ridership based on information we  obtained from the Federal Transit Administration\u2019s National Transit  Database and the American Public Transportation Association. We  selected this nonprobability sample of transit agencies based on                (1) varying levels of ridership, (2) eligibility to receive TSGP grants,          (3) varying levels of risk (Tier I versus Tier II), (4) expert  recommendation, and (5) geographic dispersion. Because we selected a  non-probability sample of mass transit and passenger rail agencies, the  information obtained from these site visits cannot be generalized to all  transit agencies nationwide.

Additionally, we interviewed officials from FEMA\u2019s Grants  Preparedness Directorate (GPD) and the Office of Environmental and  Historical Preservation (OEHP) to determine what actions were being  taken to meet the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act.  To determine DHS\u2019s compliance with federal guidance, we compared  FEMA controls for the TSGP, including how grant monies are monitored  through FEMA\u2019s financial systems and spreadsheets, with criteria in  Standards for Internal Controls in the Federal Government. To  determine the extent to which DHS followed leading practices for  collaborating agencies, we compared plans and procedures in place  between TSA and FEMA to manage the program with criteria in our  October 2005 report.", "To determine the status of grant funding since 2006, we reviewed the  length of time between grant allocation and grant distribution.
