Government-wide, engagement has declined 4 percentage points from an estimated 67 percent in 2011 to an estimated 63 percent in 2014. This decline is attributable to several large agencies\u2014like the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security\u2014bringing down the government-wide average.

For 2006 and 2008, we recreated the  index using the EEI questions that were included in the survey during that  time period. We analyzed this information government-wide, by agency,  and for selected demographic groups. For each analysis, we determined  statistically significant changes in the EEI from 2006 to 2014. When  aggregated to the agency level, our index was almost perfectly correlated  with the OPM EEI in 2014.

With respect to  constructive performance conversations, at GAO, effective performance  management is a priority. Performance conversations\u2014including ongoing  feedback and coaching\u2014are expected to occur on a regular basis and  not just as part of the annual appraisal process. Moreover, at all levels of  the agency, supervisors are expected to create a \u201cline of sight\u201d  connecting individual performance to organizational results. Likewise,  with respect to an inclusive work environment, with involvement and  support of top management, our Human Capital Office and our Office of  Opportunity and Inclusiveness lead the agency through several  continuous efforts, including (1) communicating the importance of  diversity and inclusiveness from senior leaders, (2) linking SES/Senior  Leader performance expectations to emphasize diversity, and (3)  attracting and retaining a diverse workforce by, among other things,  recruiting at historically black colleges and universities.", "Actions taken by other agencies can also provide insights about  implementing key engagement drivers. For example, during our ongoing  work, Education\u2019s Office of the General Counsel (OGC) officials told us  that they convened an office-wide meeting with employees at all levels to  discuss the FEVS results\u2014both to identify areas in which they could  continue to build on positive trends, and also to identify opportunities for  taking constructive steps to improve in other specific areas of the EEI  scores. The focus of the conversation included steps that they could take  to enhance and strengthen communication throughout the office,  employee training and professional development, performance evaluation  processes, and employee empowerment overall; as a result, Education\u2019s  OGC management introduced additional training and professional  development opportunities and improved employee on-boarding through  a new handbook and mentoring program. Education\u2019s OGC officials said  these opportunities\u2014and the permanent, staff-driven Workforce  Improvement Team (WIT) that formed as a result\u2014have created feelings  of stronger ownership, engagement, and influence in office decision  making. Education\u2019s OGC officials said that OGC\u2019s management relies on  the WIT for feedback to evaluate the effectiveness of improvement  efforts. This strengthens two-way communication, which improves  employee engagement and organizational performance.", "In another example, National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) officials  told us that the head of the agency and its senior leaders communicate  with line employees (who are mostly in the field) through quarterly  webinar meetings. The meetings are scheduled to accommodate the field  employees\u2019 frequent travel schedule and generally start with any \u201chot  topics\u201d and continue with discussion of agency efforts to meet mission  goals.

According to some agency officials we spoke with, the  short cycle time between one annual survey and the next and the  amount of time it takes for organizational change to take effect could  be problematic. For example, because the FEVS survey cycle begins  around May and agencies receive results in September or October, it  may be late-winter or early-spring before an agency will have  designed an action plan. By this time, the next survey cycle is on the  horizon, allowing little time for agencies to analyze, interpret, and  implement their action plans. Moreover, the annual survey cycle may  not allow enough time for employees\u2019 perceptions to change before  the next cycle begins. According to agency officials we interviewed, it  can take at least few years, sometimes more, for a particular  organizational change to have an impact on employee engagement.  As a result, when examining a particular change in engagement level,  it could be unclear whether that change is due to an action  implemented the previous year or a different action implemented  several years earlier. Thus, determining what works and what does  not could be challenging.", "While acknowledging the issues with short survey cycle time, OPM  stated that agencies are increasingly using the FEVS as a  management tool to help them understand issues at all levels of an  organization and to take specific action to improve employee  engagement and performance. An annual survey such as FEVS can  help ensure that newly appointed agency officials (or a new  administration) can maintain momentum for change, as the surveys  suggest employees are expecting their voices to be heard.
