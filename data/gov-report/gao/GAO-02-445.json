In the context of the conventional battlefield, the nature and magnitude of the military BW threat has not changed materially since 1990 in terms of the number of countries suspected of developing BW capability, the types of BW agents they possess, or their ability to weaponize and deliver BW agents. In marked contrast to other mandatory DOD immunization requirements, GAO's sample survey in 2000 showed that AVIP was at that time adversely affecting the retention of trained and experienced guard and reserve pilots and aircrew members. Between September 1998 and September 2000, 16 percent of the pilots and aircrew members of the guard and reserve had (1) transferred to another unit (primarily to nonflying positions to avoid or delay receiving the anthrax shots), (2) moved to inactive status, or (3) left the military. Additionally, one in five of those still participating in or assigned to a unit in 2000 indicated their intention to leave in the near future. At the time of the survey, two-thirds of the guard and reserve pilots and aircrew members did not support DOD's mandatory AVIP or any future immunization programs planned for other BW agents. However, these negative views did not appear to indicate a general antivaccine bias. On the basis of the survey, GAO estimated that 37 percent of the guard and reserve pilots and aircrew members had received one or more anthrax shots as of September 2000. Of these recipients, 85 percent reported experiencing some type of reaction. This overall rate reported for adverse reactions following anthrax immunization was more than double the rate published in the vaccine manufacturer's product insert that was in use at the time of the survey. Respondents to the survey indicated that they had not reported most of the reactions they cited to the military chain of command through official or informal channels and that they were not reported to Food and Drug Administration's Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS). Reasons survey respondents gave for not reporting to the military chain of command included a lack of awareness of VAERS, a concern about the loss of flight status, a possibly adverse effect on military or civilian career, and a fear of ridicule."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As you requested, we address in this report the views of pilots and other aircrew members of the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve regarding the Anthrax Vaccine Immunization Program (AVIP) of the Department of Defense (DOD).

If the survey questionnaire on AVIP were administered today, views on some issues discussed in this report could be different, either negatively or positively. However, since most of the questions were, at the time, related to and report views on contemporaneous events (for example, information provided in 1999 and 2000 or information about adverse reactions experienced with inoculations given before 2000), we believe the results of the survey are still valid and useful as a measure of the AVIP program\u2019s performance. This information should be of interest to DOD and the Congress as they consider future anthrax vaccine programs.", "In December 1997, the Secretary of Defense announced a plan to inoculate U.S. forces against the potential battlefield use of anthrax as a biological warfare (BW) agent. The mandatory AVIP\u2014using the only available vaccine produced by the BioPort Corporation\u2014was officially launched in August 1998 as a high-priority commander\u2019s program. This means that unlike other mandatory vaccines routinely given to the military, AVIP received intense attention from high command levels and was subject to exceptional accountability requirements. It was intended to be compulsory for all 2.4 million DOD military service members\u2014active duty and reserve component members, including certain designated civilian and contractor personnel. DOD still regards the biological agent anthrax, a disease that is usually lethal if inhaled in sufficient quantity, as the single greatest BW threat to U.S. military forces in the battlefield.", "AVIP has been the subject of continuing controversy from its inception. Public debate has centered on the vaccine\u2019s safety and effectiveness, the extent and severity of adverse reactions experienced by vaccine recipients, and the adequacy and accuracy of the adverse reactions that have been reported. In addition, some Gulf War veterans are suffering from unexplained illnesses that they believe might have been caused by anthrax vaccinations received during the war. We have reported on many of these issues (see the list of related GAO products at the end of the report).", "DOD temporarily restricted the mandatory anthrax program in 2000 to a very small group (special mission individuals and researchers) because of limited vaccine supply resulting from the closing of the vaccine manufacturing plant. In January 2001, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) completed an approval and licensure process, allowing the manufacturing plant to resume production of the anthrax vaccine. In May 2002, DOD announced the resumption of the anthrax immunization program, limiting it to \u201cat risk\u201d troops. However, the identity of the troops receiving the vaccine will not be disclosed for security reasons.

It can infect humans; however, it occurs most commonly in warm-blooded animals (herbivores) in the agricultural regions of countries with less standardized and less effective public health programs. Human anthrax occurs only rarely in the United States from natural causes. However, the anthrax attacks in October 2001 through contaminated mail resulted in the death of five persons.", "Human infection normally results from an occupational exposure to infected animals or animal products. For example, workers may be exposed to dead animals or to products such as wool, hides, leather, or hair products (especially goat hair). There have been no reports, even now, of the disease spreading from person to person; thus, anthrax is most likely not spread in humans directly.", "Anthrax infection can occur in three forms: (1) cutaneous, usually through a cut or an abrasion; (2) gastrointestinal, by ingesting contaminated meat; and (3) inhalation, by breathing anthrax spores into the lungs. Symptoms depend on how the disease is contracted but usually appear within 7 days. The disease can be treated with antibiotics: tetracycline and doxycycline are preferred, but penicillin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, or ciprofloxacin can also be used. To be effective, treatment should be started early. The symptoms and forms of the disease are presented in table 1.", "The Secretary of the Army is the executive agent for managing AVIP. The dosing regimen or protocol for the anthrax vaccine calls for a series of six shots over 18 months. An initial series of three shots is given at 2-week intervals, followed by a series of three shots at 6-month intervals. Annual boosters are required thereafter. As of early 2001, more than 520,000 service members had received at least one dose of the vaccine. However, since late 2000, DOD has had to significantly reduce the inoculation rate because of a dwindling supply of vaccine from the sole source manufacturer.", "The original anthrax vaccine in the United States was developed by George Wright and others in the 1950s and was first produced on a large scale by the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck Sharp & Dohme. A clinical study in 1962 evaluated the safety and effectiveness of the Merck vaccine in mill workers. This study formed the basis for subsequent licensure of a modified vaccine in 1970. The Division of Biologics of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) issued the original license for anthrax vaccine to the Michigan Department of Public Health. In 1995, the facility changed its name to the Michigan Biologic Products Institute. In 1998, the facility was sold, and its name was changed to BioPort Corporation.", "Over time, FDA has cited the facility for repeated deviations from applicable manufacturing standards for the vaccine. The facility received warning letters from FDA, including one in March 1997 stating its intent to revoke the facility\u2019s license. The facility closed its plant for renovations in 1998 and since then has supported all AVIP requirements with vaccine produced and stockpiled (some from the early to the middle 1990s) before the plant closed. DOD had to restrict the mandatory anthrax program because of the shortage of anthrax vaccine.

Collectively, these individuals represented about 13,000 service members of the total fiscal year 1999 end strength of approximately 176,000, which included about 29,000 officers and 147,000 enlisted personnel. We selected a random sample in four strata, defined by whether a person was currently active or had changed military status as of March 1, 1998, and had been vaccinated or not as of February 2000.", "The overall response rate from the sample of 1,253 was 67 percent. Each response was subsequently weighted in the analysis to account statistically for all the members of the population, including those who were not selected. Because our results are based on a sample and different samples could provide different estimates, we express our confidence in the precision of our particular sample\u2019s results as a 95 percent confidence interval (for example, plus or minus 5 percentage points). We are 95 percent confident that each of the confidence intervals in this report includes the true values in the study population. Unless we note otherwise, all percentage estimates from the survey have a 95 percent confidence interval of plus or minus 5 percentage points.", "The overall survey results can be generalized to all guard and reserve pilots and aircrew personnel.

We have previously reported that the use of most biological agents would require a relatively high degree of sophistication, in terms of both expertise and equipment, to successfully cause mass casualties. Specialized knowledge would be needed to acquire the right biological agent, process it, improvise a weapon or device, and effectively disseminate it to cause mass casualties.

According to our survey, between September 1998 and September 2000, when AVIP was mandatory, about 16 percent of the guard and reserve pilots and aircrew members had transferred to another unit (primarily to nonflying positions), moved to inactive status, or left the military altogether. In addition, 18 percent of those still participating in units indicated their intention to transfer, move, or leave in the near future. About one-fifth of those who had already left did so knowingly before qualifying for military retirement.", "As shown in figure 1, we estimate that more than two-thirds, or 69 percent, of those who changed their status reported that the anthrax shot was the major influence behind their decision to do so\u2014more even than those reporting family reasons as an important factor. Of those who changed their status, 27 percent reported that anthrax immunization was the most important factor influencing their decision to leave or transfer. In addition, the general military immunization program was not an important factor in their decision to change status.", "Further, according to our survey, an estimated 44 percent of those who had already changed their military status or who were no longer in military flying status because of AVIP indicated that they probably would consider returning to a unit or to military flying status if AVIP were not mandatory.", "Our survey results also indicated that an estimated 18 percent of those who were still participating in guard and reserve units reported that they planned to leave the military or change their military status within 6 months. As shown in figure 2, when asked to indicate the most important factors for their planned decision to leave, an estimated 72 percent reported that anthrax immunizations influenced their decision from a moderate extent to a very great extent, followed by heavy unit workload, individual morale, and family reasons.", "Our survey indicated that the majority of guard and reserve pilots who had already changed their military status or who were intending to do so in the near future were experienced pilots. These were individuals who held crew qualifications of flight evaluator, flight instructor, or aircraft commander and had each accumulated an average of more than 3,000 flying hours, thus representing a trained and experienced workforce.", "Table 2 reflects the composition of the pilots and aircrew members who had already changed status and those indicating plans to do so in the near future.

We found that Air Force Reserve personnel were considerably more likely than Air National Guard personnel to report limited or no support for AVIP. Further, people who had already changed military status were a little more than twice as likely as those who had not changed status to indicate limited support for AVIP. The same ratio held true for a nonshot recipient when compared with an anthrax shot recipient.", "Overall, a large majority of the respondents\u201477 percent\u2014indicated that they would not or probably would not have taken the anthrax vaccine shots if AVIP were a voluntary program.

Fewer were satisfied with the information provided on other factors, as shown in figure 5.", "Our analysis also disclosed that reserve personnel were uniformly less satisfied with the information provided to them about AVIP than were guard personnel. Further, we found that officers were more likely than enlisted personnel to question the information on certain issues, such as the vaccine\u2019s battlefield effectiveness and its short-term and long-term safety.", "Although DOD employed a high-visibility information campaign on AVIP and took various steps to address the controversy surrounding it, we reported in October 1999\u2014about a year after the official start of AVIP\u2014 that service members were not satisfied with the information DOD had provided to them at the time.", "Subsequently, DOD expanded its communications efforts by updating the program\u2019s Internet web site, opening a toll-free anthrax information telephone line, and forming a speaker\u2019s bureau of anthrax experts.

For example, of those who visited the Web site, 20 percent were moderately to very satisfied with the completeness of the information, 19 percent were moderately to very satisfied with the information\u2019s accuracy, and 27 percent were moderately to very satisfied with its timeliness. Just 12 percent were moderately to very satisfied that the information was unbiased.", "Concerns were also expressed about the anthrax vaccine and its possible effects on certain health issues such as fertility and the risk of increased autoimmune disease.

For example, an estimated 84 percent of the personnel who had had anthrax vaccine shots between September 1998 and September 2000 reported having side effects or reactions. This rate is more than double the level cited in the vaccine product insert. Further, about 24 percent of all events were classified as systemic\u2014a level more than a hundred times higher than that estimated in the product insert. The reaction rates from our survey were also consistent with the results of two earlier DOD studies of the anthrax vaccine. In addition, we found that most events were not being reported to either official or informal DOD channels, partly because most individuals were unaware of the reporting process for documenting any such occurrences.", "According to the anthrax vaccine product insert in use at the time of our survey, a number of reactions can be expected from the anthrax vaccine. Table 4 summarizes the type and severity of adverse events reported in the product insert.", "As reflected in the table, at the time of our survey 34.2 percent of all anthrax vaccine recipients were estimated to report experiencing a reaction\u2014generally fairly mild and short lived. The vast majority, or 30 percent, of such reactions should consist of an area of redness 1 to 2 centimeters in diameter at the injection site. Moderate local reactions, consisting of increased redness and the possible appearance of persistent nodules, were expected in about 4 percent of shot recipients. A rate of only 0.2 percent for systemic reactions was anticipated. According to the insert, immunization should be discontinued when systemic reactions occur. The duration of most reactions, other than the development of a nodule, was expected to be short and to dissipate in a few days.", "According to our survey, 37 percent of guard and reserve personnel received one or more anthrax vaccine shots. Of these, 84 percent reported side effects or adverse events\u2014a rate more than double that expected or cited in the product insert. On the basis of our survey, each anthrax shot generated more than four reported events, and each respondent had received close to four shots of anthrax vaccine. Thus, the average respondent had reported experiencing about 17 reactions or events thought to be attributable to the vaccine. Figure 7 compares the estimated percentages of vaccine reactions in the product insert with the experience reported in our survey.", "We estimate that almost 44 percent of anthrax shot recipients reported experiencing minor local redness, about 24 percent experienced the enlarged redness associated with a moderate local reaction, and about 69 percent experienced the development of nodules. These data considerably exceed the levels in table 4. The rates, however, are similar and consistent with the Korea and Hawaii studies that DOD conducted after AVIP started. For example, the Hawaii study (the Tripler survey) disclosed a reaction rate for moderate to severe redness ranging from 18 percent to 32 percent for shots one through four. Our survey indicated rates ranging between 21 and 24 percent for the same shots. The Hawaii study also reported that between 64 percent and 66 percent of the vaccine recipients experienced a lump or knot\u2014our survey disclosed a range of 64 to 68 percent for the same shots.

Our survey did not include a sufficient number of women to address this issue.", "These two DOD studies found a higher incidence of systemic reactions than estimated in the product insert and also found that women experienced higher rates than men did. Our survey estimated that almost 24 percent of all the events experienced were systemic\u2014a rate more than a hundred times that expected in the product insert in effect at the time of our survey. Almost 19 percent of all reported reactions in our guard and reserve survey exceeded 7 days. The rate for local reactions lasting longer than 7 days was 17 percent and slightly greater than 23 percent for systemic reactions. The rate of event or reaction per shot appeared to be fairly consistent, with some drop-off as the shot series progressed, as shown in table 5.", "Some of these reactions could have implications for safety and effective work performance\u2014for example, conditions such as arm pain with limited motion, extreme fatigue, joint pain, and memory loss lasting more than 7 days.", "We found that most of the reactions were not reported to the military chain of command through official channels (military medical personnel), informal channels (supervisors), or FDA\u2019s VAERS. Since most individuals were not reporting their reactions to military medical personnel, their supervisors, or VAERS, the actual duration, extent, or impact on units and individuals and the ultimate resolution of reactions are unknown.", "We estimated that about 67 percent of those who experienced side effects or reactions were unaware of VAERS. As a result, about 6 percent of those who experienced a reaction reported it to this system\u2014altogether 18 individuals reported submitting VAERS reports on their own, and another 6 reported that the military submitted a report for them. Moreover, DOD had initially limited reporting anthrax vaccine events to VAERS to only reactions leading to either hospitalization or the loss of 48 hours or more of duty time. This restriction was subsequently removed. In addition, our survey estimated that about 57 percent of those who experienced an adverse reaction did not discuss it with anyone in military health care or their individual supervisors. Some 49 percent cited concern about the loss of flight status, possible adverse effects on their military or civilian careers, and the fear of ridicule as reasons for not discussing vaccination shot reactions with others. Another 49 percent indicated that the reactions they experienced were not severe enough to seek medical help or to tell their supervisors about.", "DOD continued to use data from VAERS to monitor adverse events or reactions to anthrax vaccination, even though it is a \u201cpassive\u201d surveillance system that relies on vaccine recipients or their health care providers to report adverse events after vaccination. Studies show that significantly fewer adverse events are reported under such a system when compared to an active surveillance approach in which vaccine recipients are actively monitored to identify and track any adverse reactions to a vaccine or medication. For example, we estimated that almost three-fourths of vaccinated guard and reserve personnel experienced burning in the vaccinated arm and a knot or lump in the vaccinated arm, compared with DOD\u2019s report that 0.007 percent had such reactions. In November 2001, DOD reported that after more than 2 million doses of anthrax vaccine had been administered to more than 522,000 people, only 1,685 VAERS reports were submitted for possible adverse events associated with the vaccine.

To counter this threat, DOD officially established the mandatory AVIP in August 1998 to inoculate all 2.4 million of DOD\u2019s service members, including active duty and reserve component personnel, along with some DOD civilian and contractor employees. This major undertaking involved scheduling and administering more than 14 million shots to satisfy the vaccine\u2019s initial dosage requirements of six shots per individual over an 18-month period, followed by an annual booster.", "Accordingly, DOD initiated a large, high-visibility campaign to communicate its views and to inform service members about the anthrax threat and the anthrax vaccine. Among other things, DOD established a Web site, opened a toll-free anthrax information telephone service, formed a speakers\u2019 bureau of experts, and provided briefings and other materials for installation leaders and medical personnel to use at unit and base or installation levels.", "Our findings suggest that DOD\u2019s communications efforts were largely unsuccessful in convincing most guard and reserve pilots and aircrew members that the anthrax threat was as serious as alleged or to support AVIP as an appropriate response. Overall, there was a general and pervasive degree of dissatisfaction among guard and reserve pilots and aircrew members about the completeness and accuracy of most of the information DOD provided on the anthrax vaccine and AVIP. In addition to their response to military threat, surveyed pilots and aircrew members expressed significant dissatisfaction with such key factors as the battlefield effectiveness of the anthrax vaccine, its history and past usage, its short-term and long-term safety risks, and the possible side effects from the vaccine.", "In addition, although DOD has maintained from AVIP\u2019s outset that the anthrax vaccine is very safe and causes minimally adverse effects, our survey disclosed that a significantly large number of vaccine recipients reported experiencing adverse events. Further, the results of two DOD studies on anthrax vaccine reactions\u2014both of which used active monitoring systems, as opposed to a passive system such as VAERS, for gathering information on adverse events\u2014are consistent with and support the results of our survey. The rates disclosed in the survey and the DOD studies are each significantly higher than those stated in the vaccine product insert until recently. Such marked variances from the product insert data suggest the possibility of change in the composition of the vaccine from the vaccine originally approved in 1970.", "In summary, AVIP appears to have adversely affected the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve in terms of retaining needed experienced personnel. Sixteen percent of our survey respondents either left the military or significantly reduced their level of participation, citing the anthrax immunization program as an important factor in their decision to do so. Interestingly, 45 percent of these individuals indicated that they would consider returning if AVIP were made voluntary. Further, at the time of our survey, 18 percent of those still participating indicated their intention to leave in the near future, again citing AVIP as an important factor in that decision. Unfortunately, the actual losses and expected losses as a result of this program represented some of the most experienced and highly trained individuals in these services and are people not easily replaced.

DOD further stated that our report did not address the normal or expected rates of turnover known to occur among personnel in the Air National Guard and the Air Force.", "DOD\u2019s selective use of a conclusion from the Institute of Medicine report that \u201ca separate AVA monitoring program is not necessary\u201d is misleading.

Specifically, the institute recommended that DOD (1) use VAERS data to generate hypotheses to study further, using DOD\u2019s new unified service medical reporting system; (2) regularly study those data for new trends; (3) work with the Department of Veterans Affairs to encourage participation in the Millennium Cohort study to better get a handle on all the problems associated with the Gulf War and other actions; and (4) regularly do ad hoc unit-based population monitoring of reactions to all vaccines. In addition, the Institute of Medicine report recommended that anthrax vaccine lots produced after renovations at the BioPort vaccine production facility should continue to be monitored for immunogicity and stability and that individuals receiving these lots should be monitored for possible acute or chronic events of immediate or later onset. Adoption of these recommendations would satisfy our recommendation.", "More importantly, DOD did not address two major findings from our survey: (1) some of the adverse reactions that our respondents reported persisted for more than 7 days and (2) given that a large proportion of respondents were not reporting the symptoms to VAERS or their DOD health care practitioners, we do not know whether these reactions were resolved over time. Also, active monitoring would result in a more comprehensive database for conducting specific analysis to test whether the adverse reactions lasting for more than 48 hours are occurring among older recipients, as suggested by a study conducted in the United Kingdom. In that study, older recipients of the anthrax vaccine experienced significant incapacity (inability to lift or drive), which according to the author, would be critical for some military populations, such as aviators. Further, several studies in the United States and the United Kingdom now show a relationship between anthrax vaccine and Gulf War syndrome. We recommended an active monitoring system not for the sole purpose of identifying adverse reaction rates, since FDA has already recognized much higher local and systematic reaction rates and the recent product insert has been revised accordingly, but also to proactively monitor, identify, and treat individuals experiencing adverse reactions. Our recommendation should lead to better lines of communications in the chain of command and help overcome any fear or mistrust of communicating reactions or symptoms to those responsible for medical care. In addition, since the anthrax vaccine will be offered to civilian first responders or health care workers, civilian doctors would need information on adverse reactions that can be expected to follow.DOD could be instrumental in providing information to civilian and medical doctors about how these symptoms are resolved over time and effective treatment approaches but only if an active monitoring program or the recommendations of the Institute of Medicine are fully implemented.", "With regard to our survey\u2019s findings on pilot attrition, DOD had not provided data to support its statement that there was no difference between pilot separations before and during the mandatory AVIP program by the time this report was issued. However, DOD\u2019s response uses the term \u201cseparations\u201d while our report uses the term \u201cchange of status,\u201d which is a much broader term. We reported on percentages of pilots who changed their status (for example, transferred to another unit, left the military in a \u201cseparation,\u201d or moved to inactive status) to avoid anthrax vaccine. In any event, although the overall separation rates may be the same before and after the onset of the mandatory anthrax vaccine program, it is clear that the losses among the most experienced pilots (in bases where AVIP was implemented) resulting from change of status were significant at some bases, resulting in the loss of an extremely seasoned workforce.", "As we agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution of it until 30 days from its issue date.

Spore forms are markedly resistant to heat, cold, pH, desiccation, chemicals and irradiation. Following germination at the site of infection, the bacilli can also enter the blood and lead to septicemia. Antibiotics are effective against the germinated form of Bacillus anthracis, but are not effective against the spore form of the organism.", "The disease occurs most commonly in wild and domestic animals, primarily cattle, sheep, goats and other herbivores. In humans, anthrax disease can result from contact with animal hides, leather or hair products from contaminated animals, or from other exposures to Bacillus anthracis spores. It occurs in three forms depending upon the route of infection: cutaneous anthrax, gastrointestinal anthrax and inhalation anthrax.", "Cutaneous anthrax is the most commonly reported form in humans (> 95% of all anthrax cases). It can occur when the bacterium enters a cut or abrasion on the skin, such as when handling contaminated meat, wool, hides, leather or hair products from infected animals or other contaminated materials. The symptoms of cutaneous anthrax begin with an itchy reddish-brown papule on exposed skin surfaces and may appear approximately 1\u201312 days after contact. The lesion soon develops a small vesicle. Secondary vesicles are sometimes seen. Later the vesicle ruptures and leaves a painless ulcer that typically develops a blackened eschar with surrounding swollen tissue. There are often associated systemic symptoms such as swollen glands, fever, myalgia, malaise, vomiting and headache. The case fatality rate for cutaneous anthrax is estimated to be 20 percent without antibiotic treatment.", "Gastrointestinal anthrax usually begins 1\u20137 days after ingestion of meat contaminated with anthrax spores. There is acute inflammation of the intestinal tract with nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting and fever followed by abdominal pain, vomiting of blood and bloody diarrhea.
