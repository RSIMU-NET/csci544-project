TSA's Office of Inspection (OI) used information on terrorist threats to design and implement its national covert tests and determine at which airports to conduct tests based on the likelihood of a terrorist attack. However, OI did not systematically record the causes of test failures or practices that resulted in higher pass rates for tests. Without systematically recording reasons for test failures, such as failures caused by screening equipment not working properly, as well as reasons for test passes, TSA is limited in its ability to mitigate identified vulnerabilities. OI officials stated that identifying a single cause for a test failure is difficult since failures can be caused by multiple factors. TSA recently redesigned its local covert testing program to more effectively measure the performance of passenger and baggage screening systems and identify vulnerabilities. However, it is too early to determine whether the program will meet its goals since it was only recently implemented and TSA is still analyzing the results of initial tests. While TSA has a well established covert testing program in commercial aviation, the agency does not regularly conduct covert tests in non-aviation modes of transportation. Furthermore, select domestic and foreign transportation organizations and DHS components use covert testing to identify security vulnerabilities in non-aviation settings. However, TSA lacks a systematic process for coordinating with these organizations. TSA covert tests conducted from September 2002 to June 2007 have identified vulnerabilities in the commercial aviation system at airports of all sizes, and the agency could more fully use the results of tests to mitigate identified vulnerabilities. While the specific results of these tests and the vulnerabilities they identified are classified, covert test failures can be caused by multiple factors, including screening equipment that does not detect a threat item, Transportation Security Officers (TSOs), formerly known as screeners, not properly following TSA procedures when screening passengers, or TSA screening procedures that do not provide sufficient detail to enable TSOs to identify the threat item. TSA's Administrator and senior officials are routinely briefed on covert test results and are provided with test reports that contain recommendations to address identified vulnerabilities. However, TSA lacks a systematic process to ensure that OI's recommendations are considered and that the rationale for implementing or not implementing OI's recommendations is documented. Without such a process, TSA is limited in its ability to use covert test results to strengthen aviation security. TSA officials stated that opportunities exist to improve the agency's processes in this area. In May 2008, GAO issued a classified report on TSA's covert testing program. That report contained information that was deemed either classified or sensitive. This version of the report summarizes our overall findings and recommendations while omitting classified or sensitive security information."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The March 2004 bombings of the rail system in Spain, July 2005 bombings  of London\u2019s subway system, and August 2006 alleged terror plot to bring  liquid explosives through airport security checkpoints in the United  Kingdom and detonate them on board aircraft bound for the United States,  are striking reminders that transportation systems have continued to be a  target for terrorist attack. After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks,  the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) was enacted,  creating the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and mandating  that it assume responsibility for security in all modes of transportation.  For the last 5 years, TSA has spent billions of dollars to screen airline  passengers and checked baggage and to implement regulations and  initiatives designed to strengthen the security of commercial aviation. TSA  has also taken action to strengthen the security of surface modes of  transportation, which includes mass transit and passenger rail, freight rail,  and highways. Despite varying levels of progress in these respective areas,  questions remain about the effectiveness of TSA\u2019s security programs and  procedures.", "One method that can be used to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities,  measure the effectiveness of security programs, and identify needed  changes to training procedures and technologies is undercover, or covert  testing\u2014also known as red team testing\u2014which was advocated by the  President\u2019s July 2002 National Strategy for Homeland Security to identify  security vulnerabilities in the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure and to help  prepare for terrorist attacks. Regarding aviation security, and in  accordance with requirements established in law, TSA conducts covert  testing of passenger and checked baggage screening operations, as well as  airport perimeter security and access controls, and requires that  Transportation Security Officers (TSO) who fail tests to undergo remedial  training. Prior to the creation of TSA, the Federal Aviation Administration  (FAA) was responsible for ensuring compliance with aviation screening  regulations and testing the performance of passenger and checked  baggage systems in detecting threat objects. TSA began conducting covert  testing in commercial aviation in September 2002. Covert testing is  conducted at the national level by TSA\u2019s Office of Inspection (OI) and at  the local, or individual airport level by the Office of Security Operations  (OSO)\u2014the division within TSA responsible for overseeing passenger and  checked baggage screening at airports. During these tests, undercover  inspectors attempt to pass threat objects, such as simulated explosive  devices, through airport passenger screening checkpoints and checked  baggage screening systems. Inspectors also attempt to access secure areas  of the airport undetected, such as through doorways leading to aircraft  and the airport\u2019s perimeter. The tests are designed to approximate  techniques that terrorists may use in order to identify vulnerabilities in the  people, processes, and technologies that comprise the aviation security  system. With respect to some non-aviation modes of transportation,  specifically mass transit, passenger rail, and maritime ferries, TSA has  initiated pilot programs designed to test the feasibility of implementing  screening of passengers at a centralized checkpoint, similar to the aviation  system. According to OI officials, during these pilot programs, OI  conducted covert testing to determine if they could pass threat objects  through the passenger screening procedures and equipment that was being  tested in these systems. In addition, TSA\u2019s May 2007 Transportation  System Sector Specific Plan (TS-SSP) for mass transit describes TSA\u2019s  strategy for securing mass transit and passenger rail, and encourages that  transit and rail agencies should develop covert testing exercises.", "We have previously reported on the results of TSA\u2019s national and local  aviation covert tests, both of which have identified vulnerabilities in the  aviation security system, and the results of our investigators\u2019 tests of TSA\u2019s  passenger checkpoint and checked baggage security systems, which have  also identified vulnerabilities. The Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) Office of Inspector General has also conducted its own covert  testing of airport passenger and checked baggage screening, as well as  perimeters and access controls, and has also identified vulnerabilities in  these areas, most recently in March 2007.", "In light of the security vulnerabilities that covert testing has identified and  concerns regarding the effectiveness of existing security procedures, you  asked that we review TSA\u2019s national and local covert testing programs. In  response, on May 13, 2008, we issued a classified report addressing the  following key questions: (1) What is TSA\u2019s strategy for conducting covert  testing of the transportation system, and to what extent has the agency  designed and implemented its covert tests to achieve identified goals? and  (2) What have been the results of TSA\u2019s national aviation covert tests  conducted from September 2002 to June 2007, and to what extent does  TSA use the results of these tests to mitigate security vulnerabilities in the  commercial aviation system?", "As our May 2008 report contained information that was deemed to be  either classified or sensitive, this version of the report is intended to  generally summarize our overall findings and recommendations while  omitting classified or sensitive security information about TSA\u2019s covert  testing processes and the results of TSA\u2019s covert tests conducted from  September 2002 to June 2007. As our intent in preparing this report is to  convey, in a publicly available format, the non-classified, non sensitive  results of the classified May 2008 report, we did not attempt to update the  information here to reflect changes that may have occurred since the  publication of the May 2008 report.", "To identify TSA\u2019s strategy for conducting covert testing of the  transportation system and the extent to which the agency has designed  and implemented tests to achieve its goals, we reviewed applicable laws,  regulations, policies, and procedures for national and local covert testing.  We interviewed TSA OI officials responsible for conducting national  aviation covert tests, and OSO officials responsible for local aviation  covert tests, regarding TSA\u2019s strategy for designing and implementing  these tests, including the extent to which they used threat information to  guide their efforts. We also observed OI inspectors during covert tests at  seven airports, including airports with heavy passenger traffic and those  with just a few flights per day, as well as airports with both TSOs and  contract screeners. During these covert tests, we accompanied OI  inspectors during all phases of the test including planning, testing, and  post-test reviews with TSOs and their supervisors. We interviewed TSOs  and their supervisors that were involved in covert tests at each airport  where we observed tests to discuss their experience with the national and  local covert testing programs. We also interviewed the Federal Security  Director (FSD) at each airport where we observed covert tests to obtain  their views of the testing program and the results of tests at their airports.  While these seven airports represent reasonable variations in size and  geographic locations, our observations of OI\u2019s covert tests and the  perspectives provided by TSA officials at these airports cannot be  generalized across all commercial airports. However, our observations at  the seven airports provided us with an overall understanding of how OI  conducts covert tests and useful insights provided by TSOs, their  supervisors, and FSDs at these airports. We also reviewed TSA\u2019s  procedures for screening passenger and checked baggage to determine  how these procedures are used in designing and implementing national  aviation covert tests. We interviewed OI officials and officials from TSA\u2019s  Office of Transportation Sector Network Management (TSNM), which is  responsible for developing security policies for non-aviation modes of  transportation, regarding the extent to which covert testing has been  conducted in non-aviation modes, the applicability of covert testing in  other modes, and future plans for conducting covert testing in other  modes. To understand how entities outside of TSA have used covert  testing in non-aviation modes of transportation, we interviewed officials  from DHS components and organizations that conduct covert testing,  including U.S. Customs and Border Protection, DHS Domestic Nuclear  Detection Office (DNDO), Amtrak, the United Kingdom\u2019s Department for  Transport Security (TRANSEC), and transportation industry associations,  such as the American Association of Railroads and the American Public  Transportation Association.", "To determine the results of TSA\u2019s national covert tests and the extent to  which TSA used the results of these tests to mitigate security  vulnerabilities in the aviation system, we obtained and analyzed a database  of the results of TSA\u2019s national covert tests conducted from September  2002 to June 2007. To determine how TSA gathers covert testing data, we  reviewed the data collection instruments used at the airports where we  observed covert tests, as well as other methods OI uses to gather covert  testing data and observations. We also reviewed TSA\u2019s internal controls  for collecting and maintaining the results of covert tests. We assessed the  reliability of TSA\u2019s covert testing data and the systems used to produce the  data by interviewing agency officials responsible for maintaining the  database. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our  analysis and the purposes of this report. We also interviewed OI officials  regarding how the results of covert tests are used in developing their  recommendations to TSA management. We reviewed OI reports on the  results of covert tests completed between March 2003 and June 2007 that  were submitted to TSA\u2019s Administrator and OSO to identify OI\u2019s  recommendations for mitigating the vulnerabilities identified during covert  tests. We further obtained and analyzed a summary of the actions that  OSO had taken to address OI\u2019s recommendations for mitigating  vulnerabilities made from March 2003 to June 2007. More detailed  information on our scope and methodology is contained in appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2006 to May 2008, in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Congress and the Administration have advocated the use of covert or red  team testing in all modes of transportation. Following the terrorist attacks  on September 11, 2001, on November 19, 2001, the President signed ATSA  into law, with the primary goal of strengthening the security of the nation\u2019s  commercial aviation system. ATSA created TSA within the Department of  Transportation (DOT) as the agency responsible for securing all modes of  transportation. Among other things, ATSA mandated that TSA assume  responsibility for screening passengers and their property, which includes  the hiring, training, and testing of the screening workforce. ATSA also  mandated that TSA conduct annual proficiency reviews and provide for  the operational testing of screening personnel, and that TSA provide  remedial training to any screener who fails such tests. In 2002, the  President issued The National Strategy for Homeland Security that  supports developing red team tactics in order to identify vulnerabilities in  security measures at our Nation\u2019s critical infrastructure sectors, including  the transportation sector. In 2007, TSA issued the TS-SSP that outlines its  strategy and associated security programs to secure the transportation  sector. While the TS-SSP does not address covert testing in aviation, it  does identify that mass transit and passenger rail operators should develop  covert testing exercises. Moreover, the Implementing Recommendations  of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 requires DHS to develop and  implement the National Strategy for Railroad Transportation Security,  which is to include prioritized goals, actions, objectives, policies,  mechanisms, and schedules for assessing the usefulness of covert testing  of railroad security systems. Furthermore, the explanatory statement  accompanying Division E of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008  (the DHS Appropriations Act, 2008), directs TSA to be more proactive in  red teaming for all modes of transportation. Specifically, the statement  directs approximately $6 million of TSA\u2019s appropriated funds for red team  activities to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses in airports  and air cargo facilities, as well as in transit, rail, and ferry systems.", "Prior to the creation of TSA, the Department of Transportation\u2019s Federal  Aviation Administration (FAA) monitored the performance of airport  screeners. FAA created the \u201cred team,\u201d as it came to be known, to assess  the commercial aviation industry\u2019s compliance with FAA security  requirements and to test whether U.S. aviation passenger and checked  baggage screening systems were able to detect explosives and other threat  items. TSA began its covert testing program in September 2002.

OI  officials stated that they derived their covert testing protocols and test  scenarios from prior FAA red team protocols, but updated the threat items  used and increased the difficulty of the tests. According to OI officials,  they also began conducting tests at airports on a more frequent basis than  FAA. Initially, OI conducted tests at all of the estimated 450 commercial  airports nationwide on a 3-year schedule, with the largest and busiest  airports being tested each year. TSA also began using threat information  to make tests more closely replicate tactics that may be used by terrorists.", "The number of covert tests that OI conducts during testing at a specific  airport varies by the size of the airport. The size of the OI testing teams  also varies depending upon the size of the airport being tested, the number  of tests that OI plans to conduct, and the number of passenger  checkpoints and access points to secure areas at a particular airport. OI  testing teams consist of a team leader who observes the tests and leads  post-test reviews with TSOs, and inspectors who transport threat items  through passenger checkpoints and secure airport areas and record test  results. Team leaders usually have previous federal law enforcement  experience, while inspectors often include program analysts,  administrative personnel, and other TSA personnel. Prior to testing, each  team leader briefs their team to ensure that everyone understands their  role, the type of test to be conducted, and the threat item they will be  using. For tests at passenger checkpoints and in checked baggage, OI uses  different IED configurations and places these IEDs in various areas of  each inspector\u2019s body and checked baggage to create different test  scenarios.

In  covert tests of checked baggage screening, an inspector poses as a  passenger and checks their baggage containing a simulated threat item at  the airline ticket counter. The bag is then screened by TSOs using one of  two checked baggage screening methods. At airports that have explosive  detection systems (EDS), the TSO uses these machines to screen each  bag. At airports that do not have EDS and at airports where certain  screening stations do not have EDS, such as curbside check-in stations,  the TSOs use an Explosive Trace Detection (ETD) machine to screen  checked baggage. During the ETD screening process of both carry-on and  checked baggage, TSOs attempt to detect explosives on passengers\u2019  baggage by swabbing the target area and submitting the swab into the ETD  machine for chemical analysis. If the machine detects an explosive  substance, it alarms, and produces a readout indicating the specific type of  explosive detected. The TSO is then required to resolve the alarm by  performing additional screening steps such as conducting a physical  search of the bag or conducting further ETD testing on and X-raying of  footwear. When testing EDS and ETD screening procedures, OI uses fully  assembled objects such as laptop computers, books, or packages.", "Whether using EDS or ETD, if the TSO fails to identify the threat item, the  inspectors immediately identify themselves to stop the checked baggage  from being sent for loading onto the aircraft, and the test is considered a  failure.

If the OI inspector  determines that the test failure was due to the screening equipment not  working correctly, the test is considered invalid. OI conducts two types of  checked baggage covert tests:    Opaque object: This test is designed to determine if a TSO will  identify opaque objects on the X-ray screen and conduct a physical  search of the checked bag. During these tests, OI inspectors conceal a  threat item that cannot be penetrated by the X-ray and appears on the  EDS screen as an opaque object among normal travel objects within  checked baggage.", "IED in bag: This test is designed to determine if a TSO will identify an  IED during a search of the bag and use proper ETD procedures to  identify it as a threat.

OSO considered STEA a tool  for training TSOs in detecting threat items, and issued modular bomb kits  (MBS II kits) containing simulated IEDs to be used during local testing.  During STEA tests, staff placed simulated IEDs in passenger and checked  baggage to determine if they would be detected by TSOs. Unlike OI\u2019s  national covert tests, STEA tests did not include tests of airport access  controls. TSOs that failed STEA tests were required to undergo remedial  training. In May 2005, we reported that TSA officials stated that they had  not yet begun to use data from STEA testing to identify training and  performance needs for TSOs because of difficulties in ensuring that local  covert testing was implemented consistently nationwide. For example,  because FSDs had discretion regarding the number of tests conducted,  some airports conducted STEA tests regularly, while others rarely  conducted tests. In addition, we previously reported that FSDs had  difficulty in finding enough staff to help conduct STEA tests on a  consistent basis.

Risk management, as applied in  the homeland security context, can help federal decision-makers  determine where and how to invest limited resources within and among  the various modes of transportation. In recent years, the President,  through Homeland Security Presidential Directives (HSPD), and laws such  as the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, have  provided that federal agencies with homeland security responsibilities  should apply risk-based principles to inform their decision making  regarding allocating limited resources and prioritizing security activities.  The 9/11 Commission recommended that the U.S. government should  identify and evaluate the transportation assets that need to be protected,  set risk-based priorities for defending them, select the most practical and  cost-effective ways of doing so, and then develop a plan, budget, and  funding to implement the effort. In 2002, the President issued The  National Strategy for Homeland Security that instructs the federal  government to allocate resources in a balanced way to manage risk in our  border and transportation security systems while ensuring the expedient  flow of goods, services, and people.

According to OI officials, as of March 2008, OI has not yet  conducted any tests of air cargo. In designing its covert tests, OI works  with DHS\u2019s Transportation Security Laboratory to create threat items to be  used during covert tests. OI also uses threat information to replicate  tactics that may be used by terrorists. The tactics that OI uses are all  designed to test the capabilities of passenger checkpoint and checked  baggage screening systems to identify where vulnerabilities exist. The  process OI uses to select which airports to test has evolved since covert  testing began in September 2002 to focus more on those airports  determined to be at greater risk of a terrorist attack. Initially, OI\u2019s goals  were to conduct covert tests at all commercial airports, with tests being  conducted more frequently at those airports with the largest number of  passenger boardings than smaller airports with fewer flights.

While analysts input whether the test was a pass or a fail and  inspectors observations regarding some tests, they do not systematically  capture OI\u2019s assessment of the cause of the test failure and include that  information in the database. Test failures could be caused by (1) TSOs  not properly following existing TSA screening procedures, (2) screening  procedures that are not clear to TSOs, (3) screening procedures that lack  sufficient guidance to enable TSOs to identify threat items, and   (4) screening equipment that does not work properly. Moreover, when  inspectors determine the cause of a covert test failure to be due to  screening equipment, such as the walk through metal detector, the hand- held metal detector, or ETD not alarming in response to a threat item, OI  considers these tests to be invalid. While OI officials stated that they  report instances when equipment may not be working properly to the  airport FSD and officials from the Transportation Security Laboratory,  they do not input that equipment caused the failure in the covert testing  database. TSA management may find this information useful in identifying  vulnerabilities in the aviation system that relate to screening equipment  not working properly. OI officials stated that they do not record  information on equipment failures because there is always a possibility  that the simulated threat item was not designed properly and therefore  should not have set off the alarm. Further, they stated that DHS\u2019s  Transportation Security Laboratory is responsible for ensuring that  screening equipment is working properly. However, the Laboratory does  not test screening equipment at airports in an operational environment.  Furthermore, according to OI officials, identifying a single cause for a test  failure may be difficult since covert testing failures can be caused by  multiple factors. However, in discussions with OI officials about selected  individual test results, inspectors were able in their view, in most of these  cases, to identify the cause they believed contributed most to the test  failure. According to the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, information should be recorded and communicated to  management and others in a form and within a time frame that enables  them to carry out their internal control and other responsibilities. The  Standards further call for pertinent information to be identified, captured,  and distributed in a form and time frame that permits people to perform  their duties efficiently.

However, OI  inspectors occasionally captured information of effective practices used  by TSOs to detect threat items during covert tests in the data collection  instruments used during these tests. Further, during covert tests that we  observed, OI inspectors routinely discussed with us those practices used  during certain tests that they viewed as effective, such as effective  communication between TSOs and supervisors in identifying threat items.  In 2006, OSO officials requested a TSA internal review of differences in  checkpoint screening operations at three airports to identify whether the  airports employed certain practices that contributed to their ability to  detect threat items during covert tests, among other things. Between June  and October 2006, OI\u2019s Internal Reviews Division (IRD) reviewed  passenger checkpoint covert test results for each airport, observed airport  operations, interviewed TSA personnel, and reviewed documents and  information relevant to checkpoint operations. IRD\u2019s review identified a  number of key factors that may contribute to an airport\u2019s ability to detect  threat items. While IRD conducted this one time review of effective  screening practices that may have led to higher test pass rates, OI does not  systematically collect information on those practices that may lead to test  passes. As discussed earlier in this report, Standards for Internal Control  in the Federal Government stated the need for pertinent information to be  identified and captured to permit managers to perform their duties  efficiently.

Unlike national covert  tests, the ASAP program does not use elements of a risk-based approach  to determine the location and frequency of the tests because, according to  TSA officials, in order to establish a national baseline against which TSA  can measure performance, all airports must be tested consistently and  with the same types of tests. OSO officials plan to analyze the results of  the tests and evaluate the need to revise the tests or the type of threat  items used after the first and second testing cycle and annually thereafter.

However, officials stated that performance measures  for the more difficult category of tests will not be developed because these  tests are designed to challenge the aviation security system and the pass  rates are expected to be low. Furthermore, TSA officials stated that the  results of ASAP tests will not be used to measure the performance of  individual TSOs, FSDs, or airports, but rather to measure the performance  of the passenger checkpoint and checked baggage screening system. TSA  officials stated that there will not be a sufficient number of ASAP tests to  measure individual TSO, FSD, or airport performance.

TSA also tested similar  screening procedures at several bus stations during the Bus Explosives  Screening Technology pilot in 2005. In addition, TSA has also been testing  screening equipment on ferries in the maritime mode through the Secure  Automated Inspection Lanes program. According to OI officials, during  these three pilot programs, OI conducted covert testing to determine if  they could pass threat objects through the piloted passenger screening  procedures and equipment. However, these tests were only conducted on  a trial basis during these pilot programs.

Furthermore, the  explanatory statement accompanying the Homeland Security  Appropriations Act, 2008, directed TSA to be more proactive in red  teaming for airports and air cargo facilities, as well as in transit, rail, and  ferry systems. Specifically, the statement directed approximately $6  million of TSA\u2019s appropriated amount for red team activities to identify  vulnerabilities in airports and air cargo facilities, as well as in transit, rail,  and ferry systems.

In addition, TSA provided  technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.", "Regarding our recommendation that OI document the specific causes of all  national covert testing failures related to TSOs, screening procedures, and  equipment in the covert testing database, DHS stated that TSA\u2019s Office of  Inspection (OI) plans to expand the covert testing database to all causes of  test failures. DHS further stated that the specific causes of all OI covert  testing failures are documented in data collection instruments used during  covert tests and within a comment field in the covert testing database  when the cause can be determined. However, TSA acknowledged that  covert test failures caused by screening equipment not working properly  are not recorded in the database in a systematic manner. Documenting test  failures caused by equipment should help OI better analyze the specific  causes of all national covert testing failures and assist TSA management in  identifying corrective actions to mitigate identified vulnerabilities.", "Concerning our recommendation that OI develop a process for collecting,  analyzing, and disseminating information on practices in place at those  airports that perform well during national and local covert tests in order to  assist TSA managers in improving the effectiveness of checkpoint  screening operations, DHS stated that it recognizes the value in identifying  factors that may lead to improved screening performance. TSA officials  stated that, while OI or ASAP test results can be used to establish a  national baseline for screening performance at individual airports, the  results are not statistically significant. As a result, additional assessments  would be required to provide a statistical measure for individual airports.  According to DHS, OI plans to develop a more formal process for  collecting and analyzing test results to identify best practices that may  lead to test passes. Officials stated that when specific screening practices  indicate a positive effect on screening performance, TSA plans to share  and institutionalize best practices in the form of management advisories to  appropriate TSA managers. Developing a more formal process for  collecting and analyzing test results to identify best practices that may  lead to test passes should address the intent of this recommendation.", "In response to our recommendation that TSA develop a process to  systematically coordinate with domestic and foreign transportation  organizations as the agency explores the use of covert testing in non- aviation modes of transportation to learn from their experiences, DHS  stated that it is taking a number of actions. Specifically, according to DHS,  TSNM has worked closely with transit agencies and internal TSA covert  testing experts during red team testing exercises and is currently exploring  programs in which covert testing may be used to evaluate the  effectiveness of security measures. For example, TSNM is considering  incorporating covert testing as a part of its Intermodal Security Training  and Exercise Program. While considering the use of covert testing in its  programs should help TSA evaluate the effectiveness of security measures,  it is also important that TSA establish a systematic process for  coordinating with domestic and foreign organizations that already conduct  testing in non-aviation modes of transportation to learn from their  experiences.", "DHS further stated that it plans to take action to address our  recommendation that the agency develop a systematic process to ensure  that OSO considers all recommendations made by OI as a result of covert  tests in a timely manner, and documents its rationale for either taking or  not taking action to address these recommendations. Specifically, DHS  stated that OSO is coordinating with OI to develop a directive requiring  that OI\u2019s covert testing recommendations be formally reviewed and  approved by TSA management, and OSO is establishing a database to track  all OI recommendations and determine what action, if any, has been taken  to address the recommendation. Taking these steps should address the  intent of this recommendation and help TSA to more systematically record  whether OI\u2019s covert testing recommendations have been addressed.", "Concerning our recommendation that OSO develop a process to evaluate  whether the action taken to implement OI\u2019s recommendations mitigated  the vulnerability identified during covert tests, such as using follow-up  national or local covert tests or information collected through other  methods, to determine if these actions were effective, DHS stated that  OSO established a new program to study various aspects of TSO and  screening performance in 2007 that considers recommendations  originating from OI national covert tests and ASAP tests. According to  DHS, after completing each study, recommendations resulting from this  analysis will be provided to TSA leadership for consideration. DHS further  stated that the results of ASAP tests will also likely be a focus of these  future studies. While these actions should help to address the intent of this  recommendation, it is also important that OSO assess whether the actions  taken to mitigate the vulnerabilities identified by OI\u2019s national covert tests  are effective.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days after its  issue date. At that time, we will send copies of this report to the Secretary  of Homeland Security, Assistant Secretary of DHS for the Transportation  Security Administration, and the Ranking Member of the Committee on  Homeland Security, House of Representatives, and other interested  congressional committees as appropriate. We will also make this report  available at no charge on GAO\u2019s Web site at http://www.gao.gov.", "If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me  at (202) 512-3404 or at berrickc@gao.gov.

To  assess TSA\u2019s strategy specifically in the aviation covert testing program,  we interviewed TSA Office of Inspection (OI) officials responsible for  conducting national covert tests and Office of Security Operations (OSO)  officials responsible for local covert tests regarding the extent to which  information on risks is included in the design and implementation of tests.  We also interviewed the Transportation Security Officers (TSO),  supervisors, screening managers, and Federal Security Directors (FSD)  who participated in covert tests at each airport where we observed tests to  discuss their experience with the national and local covert testing  programs. We observed OI inspectors during covert tests at seven airports  including airports with heavy passenger traffic and those with just a few  flights per day, as well as airports with both federal and contract TSOs.  During these observations, we accompanied OI inspectors during all  phases of the covert test including planning and observations, testing, and  post test reviews with TSOs, supervisors, and screening managers. While  these seven airports represent reasonable variations in size and  geographic locations, our observations of OI\u2019s covert tests and the  perspectives provided by TSA officials at these airports cannot be  generalized across all commercial airports. However, our observations at  the seven airports provided us an overall understanding of how OI conduct  covert tests and useful insights provided by TSOs, their supervisors, and  FSDs at these airports. We analyzed TSA documents including established  protocols for national and local covert testing, procedures for screening  passengers and checked baggage, and OI covert testing reports issued  from 2002 to 2007 to identify procedures for designing and implementing  TSA\u2019s covert testing program. Furthermore, to determine the extent to  which TSA met the goals of the program, we conducted a detailed analysis  of the data collection instrument and methods that OI used to collect  covert testing data for the seven airports where we observed covert tests.", "We also assessed the adequacy of TSA\u2019s internal controls for collecting  and maintaining the results of covert tests by evaluating TSA\u2019s processes  for collecting covert testing data and inputting this data into its database.  In assessing the adequacy of internal controls, we used the criteria in  GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government,  GAO/AIMD 00-21.3.1, dated November 1999. These standards, issued  pursuant to the requirements of the Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity  Act of 1982 (FMFIA), provide the overall framework for establishing and  maintaining internal control in the federal government. Also pursuant to  FMFIA, the Office of Management and Budget issued Circular A-123,  revised December 21, 2004, to provide the specific requirements for  assessing the reporting on internal controls. To assess TSA\u2019s strategy for  conducting covert tests in non-aviation modes of transportation, we  interviewed officials from TSA\u2019s Office of Transportation Sector Network  Management (TSNM) regarding the extent to which TSA has conducted  covert testing in non-aviation modes of transportation, the applicability  and potential use of covert testing in other modes, and their future plans  for conducting covert testing in other modes. To understand how other  organizations and federal agencies have used covert testing in the non- aviation arena, we interviewed officials from selected federal agencies and  organizations that conduct covert testing including Amtrak, the United  Kingdom Department for Transport Security (TRANSEC), U.S. Customs  and Border Protection (CBP), DHS Domestic Nuclear Detection Office  (DNDO), and select transportation industry associations. We reviewed the  president\u2019s National Strategy for Homeland Security and TSA\u2019s  Transportation Systems Sector Specific plan, including individual plans for  each mode of transportation, to determine the role and use of covert  testing across the transportation system. We also reviewed the fiscal year  2008 DHS appropriations legislation, enacted as Division E of the  Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, and associated committee reports  and statements to identify any funding allocated to TSA to conduct covert  testing in non-aviation modes.", "To determine the results of TSA\u2019s national covert tests and the extent to  which TSA used the results of these tests to mitigate security  vulnerabilities in the aviation system, we obtained and analyzed a database  of the results of TSA\u2019s national covert tests conducted from September  2002 to June 2007. We analyzed the test data according to airport category,  threat item, and type of test conducted between September 2002 and June  2007. We also examined trends in pass and failure rates when required  screening steps were or were not followed and examined differences in  covert test results between private and federal airports. We assessed the  reliability of TSA\u2019s covert testing data by reviewing existing information  about the data and the systems used to produce them, and by interviewing  agency officials responsible for maintaining the database. We determined  that the data were sufficiently reliable for our analysis and the purposes of  this report. TSA provided us with a copy of their covert testing database  which contained a table with one record, or entry, per test for all of the  tests conducted between 2002 and 2007. In order to accurately interpret  the data, we reviewed information provided by OI officials regarding each  of the fields recorded in the database and information about how they  enter test results into the database. We also conducted manual testing of  the data, conducting searches for missing data and outliers. To further  assess the reliability of the data, we reviewed the source documents used  to initially collect the data as well as OI\u2019s published reports. We also  interviewed OI officials regarding how the results of covert tests are used  in developing their recommendations to TSA management. We reviewed  OI reports on the results of covert tests issued between March 2003 and  June 2007 that were submitted to TSA\u2019s Administrator and OSO to identify  OI\u2019s recommendations for mitigating the vulnerabilities identified during  covert tests. We obtained and analyzed a summary of the actions that OSO  had taken to address OI\u2019s recommendations for mitigating vulnerabilities  made from March 2003 to June 2007. We also asked officials to discuss the  extent to which OSO has addressed and implemented recommendations  made by OI based on covert test results, and we analyzed information  provided by TSA regarding the status of each covert testing  recommendation made by OI from 2003 to 2007.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2006 to May 2008, in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on out audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}], "fastfact": []}
