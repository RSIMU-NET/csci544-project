To meet these objectives, GAO analyzed documents related to Basel II and interviewed various regulators and officials from banks that will be required to follow the new rules."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Rapid innovation in financial markets and advances in risk management have revealed limitations in the existing Basel I risk-based capital framework, especially for large, complex banks. U.S. banking regulators have proposed a revised regulatory capital framework that differs from the international Basel II accord in several ways, including (1) requiring adoption of the most advanced Basel II approaches and by only the largest and most internationally active banks; (2) proposing Basel IA, a simpler revision of Basel I, and retaining Basel I as options for all other banks; and (3) retaining the leverage requirement and prompt corrective action measures that exist under the current regulatory capital framework. While the new capital framework could improve banks' risk management and make regulatory capital more sensitive to underlying risks, its impact on minimum capital requirements and the actual amount of capital held by banks is uncertain. The approaches allowed under Basel II are not without risks, and realizing the benefits of these approaches while managing the related risks will depend on the adequacy of both internal and supervisory reviews. The move to Basel II has also raised competitiveness concerns between large and small U.S. banks domestically and large U.S. and foreign banks internationally. The impact of Basel II on the level of required capital is uncertain, but in response to quantitative impact study results showing large reductions in minimum required capital, U.S. regulators have proposed safeguards, such as transitional floors, that along with the existing leverage ratio would limit regulatory capital reductions during a multiyear transition period. Finally, the impact on actual capital held by banks is uncertain because banks hold capital above required minimums for both internal risk management purposes as well as to address the expectations of the market. Banks and regulators are preparing for Basel II without a final rule, but both face challenges. Bank officials said they were refining their risk management practices, but uncertainty about final requirements has made it difficult for them to proceed further. Banks also face challenges in aligning their existing systems and processes with some of the proposed requirements. While regulators plan to integrate Basel II into their current supervisory process, they face impediments. The banking regulators have differing regulatory perspectives, which has made reaching consensus on the proposed rule difficult. Banks and other stakeholders continue to face uncertainty. Among the issues that regulators have yet to resolve are how the rule will treat bank portfolios that do not meet data requirements, how they will calculate reductions in aggregate minimum regulatory capital and what they will do if the reduction exceeds a proposed 10 percent trigger, and what criteria they will use to determine the appropriate average level of required capital and cyclical variation. Increased transparency going forward could reduce ambiguity and respond to questions and concerns among banks and industry stakeholders about how the rules will be applied, their ultimate impact on capital, and the regulators' ability to oversee their implementation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For nearly a decade, federal banking regulators have been considering  revisions to risk-based capital rules that could have far-reaching  consequences for the safety, soundness, and efficiency of the U.S. banking  system. The original risk-based capital rules, known as Basel I, were  adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in 1988 and  implemented in the United States in 1989. The proposed changes, known  as Basel II, are based on an internationally adopted framework developed  by the Basel Committee. Basel II aims to align minimum capital  requirements with enhanced risk measurement techniques and to  encourage banks to develop a more disciplined approach to risk  management. In the United States, Basel II rules are intended to apply  primarily to the largest and most internationally active banking  organizations. U.S. regulators expect about 11 banking organizations (core  banks), which account for close to half of U.S. banking assets, to be  required to implement Basel II. As such, regulators must take care to  ensure that Basel II functions as intended to help preserve the safety and  soundness of the banking system and mitigate the risk of losses to the  federal deposit insurance fund.", "However, in moving toward the proposed Basel II framework, a number of  serious concerns have been raised by regulatory officials, banks,  academics, and congressional and industry stakeholders. First,  considerable uncertainty remains about the appropriate level of minimum  required capital and the potential impact of the proposed rules on  minimum required risk-based capital levels. Second, the proposed rules  depend in part on the reliability of banks\u2019 internal models, and some  observers have expressed concerns about using banks\u2019 internal models for  establishing regulatory capital requirements. Third, the increased  complexity of regulatory capital calculations undertaken by banks  heightens the challenge of effective oversight by banking regulators.  Fourth, the U.S. proposed rules differ in some respects from those of other  countries, raising concerns about possible competitive effects of different  rules between domestic and foreign banking organizations. Concerns have  also been raised about domestic competitive inequities between banks  that adopt Basel II and those that do not.", "In light of these concerns, Congress has held several oversight hearings  that have provided valuable information on regulatory objectives, actions,  and potential pitfalls throughout the ongoing rule-making process. As part  of this effort, Congress mandated that we review the implementation of  Basel II in the United States. To date, federal regulators have requested  public comment on a Basel II Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking  (ANPR) and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR). They also have  proposed additional changes, known as Basel IA, to establish simpler  revisions to the regulatory capital framework for banks not subject to  Basel II. However, regulators do not expect to issue final rules until later  in 2007. Because the rule-making process is not complete, this report can  address only certain aspects of the implementation process to date.  Specifically, this report examines the following:  1.  developments leading to the transition to Basel II,  2.  the proposed changes to the U.S. regulatory capital framework,  3.  the potential implications of Basel II\u2019s quantitative approaches and  their potential impact on required capital,  4.  banks\u2019 preparations and related challenges, and  5.  U.S. regulators\u2019 preparations and related challenges.", "To meet our objectives, we reviewed the Basel II international accord, the  U.S. proposed rules for Basel II and Basel IA, draft supervisory guidance,  and related materials. We interviewed officials at the federal bank  regulatory agencies to obtain their views. We also interviewed officials at  each of the banks that, under the proposed rule, would be required to  adopt Basel II; a sample of banks that may opt into Basel II (based in part  on size and primary regulator); a state bank regulator and an association  of state bank supervisors; two bank trade associations; and two credit  rating agencies. To understand how regulators oversee risk management  processes at core banks and how the regulators are planning to  incorporate Basel II into their examinations, we interviewed bank  examiners and reviewed examination reports. We also compared the  proposed capital requirements for different assets to demonstrate how  related capital requirements may change, depending on the business cycle  and the estimated level of risk of holding certain assets. We conducted our  work from April 2006 to January 2007 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards.

Major risks facing banking institutions include those listed in table 1.", "Changes in the banking industry and financial markets have increased the  complexity of banking risks. Banking assets have become more  concentrated among a small number of very large, complex banking  organizations that operate across a wide range of financial products and  geographic markets. Due to these organizations\u2019 scale and roles in  payment and settlement systems and in derivatives markets, a significant  weakness in any one of these entities could have severe consequences for  the safety and soundness of the banking system and broader economy. As  a result, federal banking regulators have adopted a risk-focused approach  to supervision that emphasizes continuous monitoring and assessment of  how banking organizations manage and control risks. Faced with such  risks, banks must take protective measures to ensure that they remain  solvent. For example, banks are required to maintain an allowance for  loan and lease losses to absorb estimated credit losses. Banks must also  hold capital to absorb unexpected losses. Capital is generally defined as a  firm\u2019s long-term source of funding, contributed largely by a firm\u2019s equity  stockholders and its own returns in the form of retained earnings. In  addition to absorbing losses, capital performs several other important  functions: it promotes public confidence, helps restrict excessive asset  growth, and provides protection to depositors and the federal deposit  insurance fund.", "Capital adequacy is fundamental to the safety and soundness of the  banking system, and a bank\u2019s capital position can affect its  competitiveness in several ways. Strong capital enhances a bank\u2019s access  to liquidity on favorable terms and ensures that it has the financial  flexibility to respond to market opportunities. However, holding capital  imposes costs on banks, because equity is a more costly form of financing  than debt. Capital adequacy regulation seeks to offset banks\u2019 disincentives  to hold capital, which result in part from access to federal deposit  insurance. In addition, capital adequacy requirements for large banks are  especially important because of the systemic risks these banks can pose to  the banking system. Regulators require banks to maintain certain  minimum capital requirements and generally expect banks to hold capital  above these minimums, commensurate with their risk exposure. However,  requiring banks to hold more capital may reduce the availability of bank  credit and reduce returns on equity to shareholders. In addition, capital  requirements that are too high relative to a bank\u2019s risk profile may create  an incentive for a bank to hold more high-risk assets, in order to earn a  market-determined return on capital. Banking regulators attempt to  balance safety and soundness concerns with the costs of holding higher  capital."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "U.S. Regulators Responsible for Implementing Basel II", "paragraphs": ["Four federal banking regulators supervise the nation\u2019s banks and thrifts,  and each serves as primary federal regulator over certain types of  institutions:    OCC supervises national (i.e., federally chartered) banks.

Both banks and bank holding  companies are subject to minimum leverage standards, measured as a  ratio of tier 1 capital to total assets. The minimum leverage requirement is  between 3 and 4 percent, depending on the type of institution and a  regulatory assessment of the strength of its management and controls.  Leverage ratios are a commonly used financial measure of risk. Greater  financial leverage, as measured by higher proportions of debt relative to  equity (or lower proportions of capital relative to assets), increases the  riskiness of a firm. During the 1980s, regulators became concerned that  simple capital-to-assets leverage measures required too much capital for  less risky assets and not enough for riskier assets. Another concern was  that such measures did not require capital for growing portfolios of off- balance sheet items. In response to these concerns, regulators from the  United States and other countries adopted Basel I, an international  framework for risk-based capital that required minimum risk-based capital  ratios of 4 percent for tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and 8 percent  for total capital to risk-weighted assets. By 1992, U.S. regulators had fully  implemented Basel I; and in 1996, they and supervisors from other Basel  Committee member countries amended the framework to include explicit  capital requirements for market risk from trading activity. The use of a  leverage requirement was continued after the introduction of risk-based  capital requirements as a cushion against risks not explicitly covered in  the risk-based capital requirements. The greater level of capital required  by the risk-based or leverage capital calculation is the binding overall  minimum requirement on an institution.", "Furthermore, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement  Act of 1991 created a new supervisory framework known as prompt  corrective action (PCA) that links supervisory actions closely to a bank\u2019s  capital ratios. PCA, which applies only to banks, not bank holding  companies, has become a primary regulatory influence over bank capital  levels. PCA requires regulators to take increasingly stringent forms of  corrective action against banks as their leverage and risk-based capital  ratios decline. The purpose is to ensure that timely regulatory action is  taken to address problems at financially troubled banks in order to  prevent bank failure or minimize resulting losses. There is a strong  incentive for banks to qualify as \u201cwell-capitalized,\u201d which is the highest  capital category and exceeds the minimum capital requirements, because  banks deemed less than well-capitalized have restrictions or conditions on  certain activities and may also be subject to mandatory or discretionary  supervisory actions. Regulatory officials noted that the PCA well- capitalized standards are the de facto minimum regulatory capital  requirements for banks and that virtually all banks maintain capital levels  that meet the well-capitalized criteria. As shown later in this report in  figure 4, the required capital ratios for the well-capitalized category are:  (1) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10 percent or greater, (2) a tier 1 risk- based capital ratio of 6 percent or greater, and (3) a leverage ratio of 5  percent or greater."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Transition to Basel II Has Been Driven by Limitations of Basel I and Advances in Risk Management at Large Banking Organizations", "paragraphs": ["Regulatory officials generally agree that while Basel I continues to be an  adequate capital framework for most banks, it has become increasingly  inadequate for supervising the capital adequacy of the nation\u2019s largest,  most complex banking organizations.

Regulators have sought to encourage the use  of such methods as an element of strong risk management and because  such methods may provide useful input to the supervisory process. Basel  II is intended to address the shortcomings of Basel I and further encourage  banks to develop and maintain a disciplined approach to risk management."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Basel I Is a Simple Framework with Broad Risk Categories That Is Inadequate for Large Banking Organizations", "paragraphs": ["When established internationally in 1988, Basel I represented a major step  forward in linking capital to risks taken by banking organizations,  strengthening banks\u2019 capital positions, and reducing competitive inequality  among international banks. Regulatory officials have noted that Basel I  continues to be an adequate capital framework for most banks, but its  limitations make it increasingly inadequate for the largest and most  internationally active banks. As implemented in the United States, Basel I  consists of five broad credit risk categories, or risk weights (table 2).  Banks must hold total capital equal to at least 8 percent of the total value  of their risk-weighted assets and tier 1 capital of at least 4 percent. All  assets are assigned a risk weight according to the credit risk of the obligor  and the nature of any qualifying collateral or guarantee, where relevant.  Off-balance sheet items, such as credit derivatives and loan commitments,  are converted into credit equivalent amounts and also assigned risk  weights. The risk categories are broadly intended to assign higher risk  weights to\u2014and require banks to hold more capital for\u2014higher risk  assets.", "However, Basel I\u2019s risk-weighting approach does not measure an asset\u2019s  level of risk with a high degree of accuracy, and the few broad categories  available do not adequately distinguish among assets within a category  that have varying levels of risk. For example, although commercial loans  can vary widely in their levels of credit risk, Basel I assigns the same 100  percent risk weight to all these loans. Such limitations create incentives  for banks to engage in regulatory capital arbitrage\u2014behavior in which  banks structure their activities to take advantage of limitations in the  regulatory capital framework. By doing so, banks may be able to increase  their risk exposure without making a commensurate increase in their  capital requirements. For example, because Basel I does not recognize  differences in credit quality among assets in the same category, banks may  have incentives to take on high-risk, low-quality assets within each broad  risk category. As a result, the Basel I regulatory capital measures may not  accurately reflect banks\u2019 risk profiles, which erodes the principle of risk- based capital adequacy that the Basel Accord was designed to promote.", "In addition, Basel I recognizes the important role of credit risk mitigation  activities only to a limited extent. By reducing the credit risk of banks\u2019  exposures, techniques such as the use of collateral, guarantees, and credit  derivatives play a significant role in sound risk management. However,  many of these techniques are not recognized for regulatory capital  purposes. For example, the U.S. Basel I framework recognizes collateral  and guarantees in only a limited range of cases. It does not recognize  many other forms of collateral and guarantees, such as investment grade  corporate debt securities as collateral or guarantees by externally rated  corporate entities. In addition, the Basel Committee acknowledged that  Basel I may have discouraged the development of specific forms of credit  risk mitigation by placing restrictions on both the type of hedges  acceptable for achieving capital reduction and the amount of capital relief.  As a result, regulators have indicated that Basel II should provide for a  better recognition of credit risk mitigation techniques than Basel I.", "Furthermore, Basel I does not address all major risks faced by banking  organizations, resulting in required capital that may not fully address the  entirety of banks\u2019 risk profiles. Basel I originally focused on credit risk, a  major source of risk for most banks, and was amended in 1996 to include  market risk from trading activity. However, banks face many other  significant risks\u2014including interest rate, operational, liquidity,  reputational, and strategic risks\u2014which could cause unexpected losses  for which banks should hold capital. For example, many banks have  assumed increased operational risk profiles in recent years, and at some  banks operational risk is the dominant risk. Because minimum required  capital under Basel I does not depend directly on these other types of  risks, U.S. regulators use the supervisory review process to ensure that  each bank holds capital above these minimums, at a level that is  commensurate with its entire risk profile. In recognition of Basel I\u2019s  limited risk focus, Basel II aims for a more comprehensive approach by  adding an explicit capital charge for operational risk and by using  supervisory review (already a part of U.S. regulators\u2019 practices) to address  all other risks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Basel I Does Not Reflect Financial Innovations and Risk Management Practices at Large Banking Organizations", "paragraphs": ["The rapid rate of innovation in financial markets and the growing  complexity of financial transactions have reduced the relevance of the  Basel I risk framework, especially for large banking organizations. Banks  are developing new types of financial transactions that do not fit well into  the risk weights and credit conversion factors in the current standards.  For example, there has been significant growth in securitization activity,  which banks engaged in partly as regulatory arbitrage opportunities. In  order to respond to emerging risks associated with the growth in  derivatives, securitization, and other off-balance sheet transactions,  federal regulators have amended the risk-based capital framework  numerous times since implementing Basel I in 1992. Some of these  revisions have been international efforts, while others are specific to the  United States. For example, in 1996, the United States and other Basel  Committee members adopted the Market Risk Amendment, which requires  capital for market risk exposures arising from banks\u2019 trading activities.  By contrast, federal regulators amended the U.S. framework in 2001 to  better address risk for asset securitizations. These changes, while  consistent with early proposals of Basel II, were not adopted by other  countries at the time. The finalized international Basel II accord, which  other countries are now adopting, incorporates many of these changes.", "Despite these amendments to the current framework, the simple risk- weighting approach of Basel I has not kept pace with more advanced risk  measurement approaches at large banking organizations. By the late  1990s, some large banking organizations had begun developing economic  capital models, which use quantitative methods to estimate the amount of  capital required to support various elements of an organization\u2019s risks.  Banks use economic capital models as tools to inform their management  activities, including measuring risk-adjusted performance, setting pricing  and limits on loans and other products, and allocating capital among  various business lines and risks. Economic capital models measure risks  by estimating the probability of potential losses over a specified period  and up to a defined confidence level using historical loss data. This  method has the potential for more meaningful risk measurement than the  current regulatory framework, which differentiates risk only to a limited  extent, mostly based on asset type rather than on an asset\u2019s underlying  risk characteristics. Recognizing the potential of such advanced risk  measurement techniques to inform the regulatory capital framework,  Basel II introduces \u201cadvanced approaches\u201d that share a conceptual  framework that is similar to banks\u2019 economic capital models. With these  advanced approaches, regulators aim not only to increase the risk  sensitivity of regulatory measures of risk but also to encourage the  advancement of banks\u2019 internal risk management practices.", "Although the advanced approaches of Basel II aim to more closely align  regulatory and economic capital, the two differ in significant ways,  including in their fundamental purpose, scope, and consideration of  certain assumptions. Given these differences, regulatory and economic  capital are not intended to be equivalent. Instead, regulators expect that  the systems and processes that a bank uses for regulatory capital purposes  should be consistent with those used for internal risk management  purposes. Regulatory and economic capital approaches both share a  similar objective: to relate potential losses to a bank\u2019s capital in order to  ensure it can continue to operate. However, economic capital is defined by  bank management for internal business purposes, without regard for the  external risks the bank\u2019s performance poses on the banking system or  broader economy. By contrast, regulatory capital requirements must set  standards for solvency that support the safety and soundness of the  overall banking system. In addition, while the precise definition and  measurement of economic capital can differ across banks, regulatory  capital is designed to apply consistent standards and definitions to all  banks. Economic capital also typically includes a benefit from portfolio  diversification, while the calculation of credit risk in Basel II fails to reflect  differences in diversification benefits across banks and over time. Also,  certain key assumptions may differ, such as the time horizon, confidence  level or solvency standard, and data definitions. For example, the  probability of default can be measured at a point in time (for economic  capital) or as a long-run average measured through the economic cycle  (for Basel II). Moreover, economic capital models may explicitly measure  a broader range of risks, while regulatory capital as proposed in Basel II  will explicitly measure only credit, operational, and where relevant,  market risks."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Regulators Are Proposing a Regulatory Capital Framework that Differs from the International Basel II Accord in Several Respects", "paragraphs": ["While Basel II is an international framework based on shared regulatory  objectives, it is subject to national implementation.

As detailed  later in this report, the U.S.-proposed rules include such supplemental  measures, including certain requirements that already exist in the current  U.S. regulatory capital framework.", "Basel II aims for a more comprehensive approach to addressing risks,  based on three pillars: (1) minimum capital requirements, (2) supervisory  review, and (3) market discipline in the form of increased public  disclosure. As shown in figure 1, Pillar 1 establishes several approaches  (of increasing complexity) to measuring risk. The advanced approach for  credit risk (known as the advanced internal ratings-based approach, or A- IRB) uses risk parameters determined by a bank\u2019s internal systems for  calculating minimum regulatory capital. The A-IRB will increase both the  risk sensitivity and the complexity of such calculations. Under the  advanced approach for operational risk (known as the advanced  measurement approaches or AMA), a bank is to use its internal  operational risk management systems and processes to assess its need for  capital to cover operational risk. This method provides banks with  substantial flexibility and does not prescribe specific methodologies or  assumptions, although it does specify several qualitative and quantitative  standards. Pillar 2 explicitly recognizes the role of supervisory review,  which includes assessment of capital adequacy relative to a bank\u2019s overall  risk profile and early supervisory intervention that are already part of U.S.  regulatory practice. Pillar 3 establishes disclosure requirements that aim to  inform market participants about banks\u2019 capital adequacy in a consistent  framework that enhances comparability.

The international accord identifies several broad  objectives, and reaching agreement on these goals has been an important  part of building consensus among U.S. regulators on how to proceed with  Basel II. The international accord\u2019s objectives are:    Safety and soundness. To further strengthen the soundness and stability  of the international banking system;   Consistency and competitive equity. To maintain sufficient  consistency that capital adequacy regulation will not be a significant  source of competitive inequality among internationally active banks;   Focus on risk management. To promote the adoption of stronger risk  management practices by the banking industry; and   Capital levels. To broadly maintain the aggregate level of minimum  capital requirements, while also providing incentives to adopt the more  advanced risk-sensitive approaches of the revised framework.", "However, in satisfying these goals, federal regulators have struggled to  balance incentives (in the form of permissible capital reductions) for  banks that adopt the advanced risk measurement approaches with the  objective of broadly maintaining the aggregate level of minimum required  capital. At the same time, regulators seek to ensure that any incentives for  these banks do not adversely affect the ability of other banks to compete  domestically. In addition, regulators have sought to balance efforts to  protect safety and soundness under Basel II with efforts to maintain  sufficient consistency with the international framework. In particular,  regulators must ensure that the revised U.S. regulatory capital framework  does not create excessive international competitive inequities for U.S.  banking organizations.

Regulators estimate that, according to  currently proposed criteria, 11 organizations would be required to comply  with Basel II. Together, these banks (known as core banks) hold about  $4.9 trillion in assets, or about 42 percent of total banking assets in the  United States (fig. 2).

Bank officials stated that the A-IRB approach, as proposed in  the United States, would yield little opportunity for banks to realize the  benefits of a more risk-sensitive capital framework. Officials from a few  core banks acknowledged that a standardized approach for credit risk  might not adequately address the risks facing large, complex banks.", "However, other bank officials said that they would prefer having the  option of using a standardized approach for credit risk, especially if the  U.S.-proposed rule for the advanced approach continued to exhibit certain  differences from the international accord.", "Some federal and state regulators have also noted the potential advantages  of allowing a standardized approach for credit risk.

But FDIC  officials also recognized that others have argued that only the advanced  approaches would provide an adequate incentive for strengthening risk  measurement systems at the largest banks. An association of state bank  regulators also called for consideration of the standardized approach in  the international accord, stating that it would be more risk sensitive than  the current framework and simpler to implement and supervise than the  advanced approach.

Regulators have also noted that to date, banks have not  sufficiently clarified their views on what form a standardized approach for  credit risk should take. Given that the Basel II NPR only asks a question  about a standardized approach and offers no specifics, the banking  regulators indicated that pursuant to the rule-making requirements of the  Administrative Procedure Act they would likely issue a new, targeted NPR  if they were to include the approach as an option for credit risk. This new  proposal would require a definition of the standardized approach in the  United States, its application criteria, and how long banks could opt to use  it.

In  April 2005, U.S. federal regulators announced that a quantitative impact  study (QIS-4) had estimated that Basel II could cause material reductions  in aggregate minimum required risk-based capital and significant  variations in results across institutions and portfolio types. As a result,  they delayed the time frame for issuing the Basel II NPR in order to further  analyze the results of the study. In February 2006, regulators announced  that QIS-4 had estimated reductions in minimum total risk-based capital  requirements of 15.5 percent (mean) and 26.3 percent (median), as well as  reductions in minimum tier 1 risk-based capital requirements of 22 percent  (mean) and 31 percent (median), relative to the current Basel I-based  framework. The study also estimated significant reductions in minimum  required capital for almost every portfolio category. In addition, the study  showed that similar loan products at different banks may have resulted in  very different risk-based capital requirements. However, as discussed later  in this report, regulators were unable to conclude whether the study\u2019s  estimates were an understatement or overstatement of the overall level of  minimum risk-based capital that would be required in a fully implemented  Basel II.

Regulators stated that a final rule, supplemented with  certain prudential safeguards, would allow them to more reliably observe  the impact of Basel II. Such a controlled environment would prevent  unintended capital reductions and would allow banks to submit compliant  data based on a final rule that would provide greater certainty than data  submitted under a preliminary impact study. For example, regulators  delayed the start of the first available \u201cparallel run\u201d until January 2008, a  year later than the international accord, creating challenges for banks that  operate in multiple countries.

The regime that each bank uses will be largely based on its  size and complexity. Federal regulators had initially limited the scope of  Basel II to a small number of large and/or internationally active  institutions and had planned to retain Basel I unchanged for all other  institutions, in order to reduce the regulatory burden for these banks. In  response to concerns voiced by small banks about potential competitive  inequities between them and banks adopting Basel II, regulators proposed  Basel IA. Regulatory and bank officials acknowledge that Basel IA may  help mitigate potential competitive inequities, although the extent of this  impact is still to be seen. Basel IA is a risk-weighting approach that  provides greater risk sensitivity than the current Basel I framework and is  less risk sensitive and less complex than the Basel II advanced  approaches. The Basel IA proposal discusses various modifications that  would increase the number of risk-weight categories relative to Basel I;  permit greater use of external credit ratings, if available, as an indicator of  credit risk; expand the range of eligible collateral and guarantors used to  mitigate credit risk; and use loan-to-value (LTV) ratios to determine risk  weights for most residential mortgages. Specifically, Basel IA proposes  six risk-weight categories based on LTV ratios that would replace Basel I\u2019s  single risk category for most mortgages. As a result, minimum capital  requirements for mortgages under Basel IA would be more sensitive to  risk than they would be under Basel I. As shown in figure 3, Basel I would  generally require the same amount of capital regardless of the risk level  (LTV ratio) of the mortgage, but Basel IA would generally increase  required capital for higher risk loans and decrease required capital for  lower risk loans. Nevertheless, Basel IA would not be as sensitive to credit  risk as the Basel II A-IRB approach, nor would it rely on banks\u2019 internal  models to determine minimum capital requirements. Under the Basel II A- IRB approach, risk parameter estimates take into account a wider variety  of information, such as probability of default, loss given default, and  exposure at default.", "Federal regulators have recently requested comment on whether Basel IA  might be an appropriate option for banks subject to Basel II as an  alternative to the advanced approaches. As discussed earlier, in the  September 2006 Basel II NPR regulators requested comment on whether,  and for what length of time, a standardized approach for credit risk similar  to the approach in the international accord should be provided as an  option for core banks. Subsequently, in the Basel IA NPR released in  December 2006, the regulators requested comment on whether the Basel  IA proposal or the standardized approach in the international Basel II  accord would be an appropriate credit risk measurement approach for  Basel II banking organizations and whether operational risk should be  addressed using one of the three Basel II approaches. In many respects,  the Basel IA proposal is similar to the Basel II standardized approach for  credit risk. Both approaches create several additional risk categories and  for the most part do not rely on banks\u2019 internal models for calculating risk- based capital. Unlike Basel IA, the standardized approach has only a single  risk-weight category for most mortgage loans. Compared with the  advanced approach, the standardized approach offers less risk sensitivity  but also less complexity, and it does not provide capital incentives for  large banks to further improve their risk management practices.  Regulators also asked in the Basel IA proposal how, if Basel IA is an  option for Basel II banking organizations, they can be encouraged to  enhance their risk management practices or financial disclosures if  provided options other than the advanced approaches.

Regulators have  stated that some small banks tend to hold capital well in excess of current  regulatory minimums.

Federal regulators have committed to retaining a minimum leverage  requirement for all banks, regardless of whether they use Basel II, IA, or I  to calculate their risk-based required capital. The leverage requirement, a  simple ratio of tier 1 capital to on-balance sheet assets, is a U.S.-specific  measure, while risk-based requirements are generally defined based on the  international Basel accords. U.S. regulators stated that risk-based and  leverage requirements generally serve complementary functions, in which  the leverage ratio can be viewed as offsetting potential weaknesses of the  risk-based ratios, while the risk-based ratios offset weaknesses of the  leverage ratio. Risk-based requirements are intended to be more sensitive  to assets of varying levels of risk and to address risks of off-balance sheet  activities. However, the complexity of risk-based capital calculations will  increase significantly under the advanced approaches of Basel II as these  calculations depend on banks\u2019 estimates of risks and supervisory formulas  that are based on certain assumptions. By contrast, a leverage ratio is easy  to calculate and verify. Regulatory officials also noted that the leverage  requirement can be considered to cover areas that risk-based requirements  do not currently address, such as interest rate risk, concentration risk, and  \u201cmodel risk\u201d (i.e., risk that the model assumptions or underlying data  could be unreliable).

SEC\u2019s voluntary, alternative net capital rule, approved in  2004, allows certain broker-dealers to use internally developed  mathematical models to calculate market and derivatives-related credit  risk. In order for a broker-dealer to apply the rule, its ultimate holding  company (collectively, the \u201cconsolidated supervised entity\u201d) must  calculate and report capital adequacy measures that are broadly consistent  with Basel standards and consent to groupwide supervision by SEC.

The A-IRB formulas generate a capital requirement that  depends on risk characteristics of the asset, estimated by the bank, such  as the probability of default (PD) and LGD, thus making required capital  more sensitive to the underlying risk of the asset. This improved risk  sensitivity would help ensure that banks are required to hold relatively  more capital against riskier assets more likely to generate unanticipated  credit losses and hold less required capital against less risky assets.  However, the appropriateness of the capital requirements generated by the  A-IRB approach depends on the accuracy of parameter estimates, such as  PD and LGD, which depend in part on the quality and comprehensiveness  of the historical data that underlie the estimates. For portfolios with data  that cover short time horizons or incomplete economic cycles, the capital  required under the A-IRB approach will not necessarily accurately reflect  the risk of credit losses from the asset because the more limited history  may not be representative.

For new or innovative financial products, bank officials described  a number of strategies for estimating risk parameters, including simulating  how the borrower would behave under a variety of economic conditions,  comparing the product to similar products for which the banks already  had data, using expert judgment, and making conservative adjustments to  estimates. Officials at several banks told us these sorts of products were  typically not material portions of their credit portfolio, and therefore  would not materially affect their capital requirements under Basel II.

However, the  A-IRB formulas are based on certain simplifying assumptions that provide  only limited recognition of diversification and concentration in credit risk,  among other limitations. Other criticisms include inappropriate values for  the regulator-provided asset correlations with the overall economy, and  the assumption that credit risk at a given bank is driven by a single,  economy-wide risk-factor with simplified statistical properties. More  generally, some researchers believe that the A-IRB approach does not  reflect best practices in banking but instead reflects a negotiated  compromise that attempts to balance competing goals, including improved  risk sensitivity and simplicity. In essence, the A-IRB approach is an  attempt to convert historical data on credit defaults into worst-case  scenario credit losses, assuming that this scenario can be captured by  statistical assumptions about the distribution of losses. These severe  scenarios are inherently difficult to estimate, because of their rarity, but  their magnitude will determine the level of resources banks will need to  weather similar events.

Under one possible way to implement a LDA,  a bank would use internal and external operational loss data to separately  estimate the range of possible frequencies and magnitudes of operational  losses. The bank would then combine this information with expert- designed scenarios to better anticipate very infrequent, yet very severe  operational loss events. Finally, the bank is required to incorporate  information regarding the strength of its internal controls, and risks of its  particular business environment into its estimates of potential losses.  Banks may also be able to use insurance or other risk mitigants aimed at  covering operational losses to reduce their operational risk required  capital by up to 20 percent. This approach offers a number of channels for  risk sensitivity and also provides incentives to mitigate operational risk.  First, internal operational loss data are by nature specific to individual  banks, so they are expected to reflect the types of losses that have  historically affected the bank. Second, because the AMA requires that  banks incorporate an assessment of the strength of internal controls,  expert-designed scenarios could reflect where internal controls, or lack of  them, are likely to mitigate or exacerbate potential operational losses.

For example, the operational risk capital charge will be  strongly influenced by infrequent but very large operational losses.  Because of their rarity, the magnitude and likelihood of these losses is  difficult to estimate.

In particular, OCC  has noted that because of the low credit risk associated with collateralized  mortgage lending, that Basel II may lead to substantial reductions in  credit-risk capital for residential mortgages. Because mortgage lending is  an area where the largest U.S. banks compete with smaller banks, some  regulators and smaller banks were concerned that those banks not subject  to Basel II would be at a disadvantage. Regulators proposed Basel IA in  part to mitigate potential competitive disparities between large and small  banks, and the proposal features some additional risk sensitivity for  mortgages and lower capital requirements than Basel I for some lower risk  mortgages. OCC has noted that another potential avenue for competitive  effects between smaller banks and Basel II banks is small business  lending. One study of lending to small and medium enterprises found only  relatively minor competitive effects between community banks and Basel  II banks, because community banks and large banks make different kinds  of small business loans. However, there were potentially significant  adverse competitive effects on large banks that do not adopt Basel II in the  United States. While this study is a comparison of the A-IRB approach  and Basel I, regulators state in the Basel IA NPR that they are exploring  options for an additional, lower risk-category for certain small business  loans (the equivalent to a 25 percent reduction in capital requirements for  those loans).

The  officials said they would review the changes to the banking regulators\u2019  final rule and planned to implement Basel II for investment banks in a way  that was generally consistent with the Federal Reserve\u2019s interpretation of  Basel II, as applied to financial holding companies, and would consider  changes that went beyond the Basel agreement.

First, the Basel Committee has instituted a \u201cscaling factor\u201d that  was not included in the QIS-4 results, currently 1.06, equivalent to a 6  percent increase, which would raise capital requirements for credit risk  relative to QIS-4. The U.S. regulators, who have included this increase in  the NPR, view 1.06 as a placeholder, and have stated that they will revisit  the scaling factor along with other calibration issues identified during the  parallel run and transitional floor periods. U.S. regulators have also  committed to broadly maintain the overall level of risk-based capital  requirements (i.e., capital neutrality) with some incentives for the  advanced approaches in the NPR, though they have not defined precisely  how they plan to achieve this goal. Large reductions in minimum required  capital could reduce safety and soundness because banks would generally  hold too little capital in the absence of capital regulation. Second, the  regulators have noted a number of factors that could have biased the QIS-4  estimates in either direction. For example, the limited use of downturn  LGDs, meant to capture economic losses from default in a stressed or  recessionary economic environment, might have caused required capital  to be understated during QIS-4, while the lack of incorporation of credit  risk mitigation may have overstated required capital. Officials at some  banks noted more recently that, based on their estimates, they did not  expect large deviations from their QIS-4 results\u2014with respect to the level  of total minimum capital requirements\u2014given similar economic  conditions. Finally, the greater sensitivity of the A-IRB approach to  economic conditions and the good economic environment during QIS-4  was an important factor in explaining lower estimates of required capital,  and less favorable economic conditions could produce greater required  capital.", "The QIS-4 results featured variations in capital requirements across  portfolios and also identical assets. Regulators offered several possible  explanations for this variation, but some regulatory officials believed that  the variation raised questions about the reliability of bank models for  determining regulatory capital. One result of the QIS-4 was a variation in  capital requirements for the same broad class of assets. However,  portfolios for a given type of exposure can vary significantly from bank to  bank. For example, one bank may specialize in prime credit card  borrowers, while another may specialize in less credit worthy credit card  borrowers. The former would therefore be required to hold less capital for  its credit card risks under a risk-sensitive system such as Basel II. FDIC  officials have expressed particular concern regarding variation in capital  requirements for identical assets across banks based on a test constructed  by regulators as part of the QIS-4. In a functioning capital regime, this  variation would imply different capital treatment across banks for the  same degree of risk, which, if significant, would run counter to both the  goals of capital adequacy and competitive equity. The regulators  emphasized that the QIS-4 was conducted on a \u201cbest efforts\u201d basis without  the benefit of either a definitive set of proposals or meaningful supervisory  review of the institutions\u2019 systems. Nevertheless, QIS-4 raised a number  of questions that have significantly changed the way U.S. regulators are  planning to implement Basel II."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Parallel Run, Transitional Floors and Leverage Ratio Would Help Prevent Large Declines in Required Capital during a Transition Period", "paragraphs": ["As proposed in the United States, Basel II would initially have a less  significant impact on minimum required capital because the parallel run  and transitional floors would prevent large reductions in capital  requirements during a transition. The parallel run would allow regulators  to observe how Basel II would affect minimum capital requirements; and  regulators would see how the banks\u2019 models perform, as banks would  calculate required capital under both Basel I and Basel II, while meeting  the Basel I requirement. The NPR notes that regulators plan to share  information related to banks\u2019 reported risk-based capital ratios with each  other for calibration and other analytical purposes. Banks would be  qualified to transition to Basel II only after four consecutive calendar  quarters during which the bank complies with all of the qualification  requirements to the satisfaction of its primary federal supervisor. During  at least three transitional years, permissible risk-based capital reductions  at a qualified bank would rise by 5 percent per year relative to minimum  capital requirements calculated using Basel I. Regulators have also stated  that banks under Basel II would continue to be subject to the leverage  ratio\u2014a capital requirement that is calculated as a percentage of assets,  independent of risk\u2014which could also prevent significant reductions in  required capital.", "As mentioned previously, regulatory officials have suggested a number of  advantages to the leverage ratio\u2014a common financial measure of risk\u2014 although as it is currently formulated, it also has some drawbacks. The  advantages of the leverage ratio include that it is easy to calculate and that  it can compensate for the limitations of the risk-based minimum  requirements, including coverage of only market, credit, and operational  risk, and the possibility that risks could be quantified incorrectly.  However, the leverage ratio could be the higher capital requirement for  some banks at some times, especially those with low risk profiles. This  would dampen some of the risk sensitivity of Basel II for low-risk banks  and assets, possibly leading to disincentives for banks to hold low-risk  portfolios. Furthermore, some banks were concerned that the leverage  ratio requirement, along with certain safeguards, defied the purpose of  moving to a conceptually more risk-sensitive capital allocation framework.  These banks believed that the leverage requirement and some safeguards  could prevent banks\u2019 regulatory capital levels from reflecting actual risk  levels. As a result, the banks would not benefit from the capital reductions  associated with taking on less risk, or managing it more effectively. As  seen in figure 5, the leverage capital requirement for the lowest risk  externally rated corporate exposures could exceed the Basel II credit risk  requirement, making the leverage ratio the relevant requirement. Both  figures 5 and 6 compare the minimum leverage ratio requirement (a tier 1  capital requirement) with the Basel II credit risk capital requirement (a  total capital requirement that must be met with at least half tier 1 capital,  but can also include tier 2 capital). If the figures compared only tier 1  capital, the Basel II credit risk capital requirements would be half as high,  which would mean that the leverage ratio would exceed the Basel II tier 1  capital Basel requirement for a broader range of assets, and thus be the  relevant constraint.", "OTS has noted that because of the low credit risk associated with  residential mortgage-related assets, relative to other assets held by banks,  the risk-insensitive leverage ratio may be more binding for mandatory and  opt-in thrifts, thus the proposed rule may cause these institutions to incur  much the same implementation costs as banks with riskier assets, but with  reduced benefits. Similar to the lowest risk externally rated corporate  exposures, as seen in figure 6, the leverage capital requirement for many  lower risk mortgages, such as those with a lower probability of default,  could exceed the Basel II credit risk requirement. Also, the U.S. leverage  requirement does not include off-balance sheet exposures, which include  many securitizations and derivatives, resulting in an incomplete picture of  capital adequacy. As a result, the retention of the leverage ratio under  Basel II may still provide a regulatory disincentive to hold low-risk assets  on the balance sheet.", "To supplement the results from QIS-4, some banks simulated their  portfolios under alternative economic conditions and estimated that  capital requirements for consumer and business credit exposures could  vary from 20 to 35 percent over the business cycle under Basel II, because   defaults and losses are higher in poor economic times. More generally,  some bank officials said that Basel II is more sensitive than Basel I to the  risk level of their exposures and the health of the economy in which they  were operating. However, federal regulatory officials with whom we spoke  were uncertain about how much capital requirements would or should  vary over the business cycle. FDIC officials with whom we spoke said they  believed it was undesirable for bank capital requirements to fall  substantially during expansions and rise substantially during recessions,  when bank capital may be most difficult to obtain. Because capital  requirements could vary over the business cycle, average (i.e., through the  cycle) capital could be higher or lower than Basel I, depending on how  Basel II is calibrated. In particular, if Basel II were calibrated to be capital  neutral with Basel I during good economic conditions, average capital  requirements could actually rise relative to Basel I.", "While minimum capital requirements are expected to vary over the  business cycle, actual capital held by banks could be more stable if banks  take into account more stressed economic scenarios through holding  capital above regulatory minimums. Requiring banks to hold more capital  when borrowers are more likely to default could help ensure that banks  have adequate capital when economic conditions begin to deteriorate.  However, some experts have raised concerns that this could exacerbate  already deteriorating economic conditions by discouraging banks from  lending. Regulatory officials were uncertain of whether minimum required  capital would adjust in advance of changes in economic conditions.  However, the Basel II NPR contains a stress-testing requirement in which  banks must simulate their portfolios in order to understand how economic  cycles, especially downturn conditions, affect risk-based capital  requirements. Adequate stress testing, as in calculating risk parameters,  will depend on banks gathering data from historical recessions that could  reflect future economic downturns, or adjusting existing data to reflect  more severe economic conditions. As part of Pillar 2, according to the  NPR, regulators expect that banks will manage their regulatory capital  position so that they remain at least adequately capitalized during all  phases of the economic cycle. OCC has noted that the stress-testing  requirements will help ensure that institutions anticipate cyclicality in  capital requirements, reducing the potential impact of changes in capital  requirements. In other words, bank capital would be relatively stable over  the business cycle, while the buffer between required capital and actual  capital held would fluctuate through the cycle. Several bank officials have  suggested that this scenario is consistent with banks\u2019 desire to avoid  raising additional capital during a downturn."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Impact of Basel II on Total Capital Held Is Uncertain Because Banks Hold Capital for a Variety of Reasons", "paragraphs": ["Basel II\u2019s impact on the capital actually held by banking organizations is  also uncertain, because banks hold capital for a variety of reasons,  including market forces such as meeting the expectations of  counterparties and credit rating agencies. Officials at several banks told us  that they weighed a number of factors when deciding how much capital to  hold, including both minimum and Pillar 2 regulatory requirements;  internal economic capital models; senior management decisions; and  market expectations, which are often exemplified by assessments from  credit rating agencies such as Moody\u2019s and Standard and Poor\u2019s. The  Basel Committee has identified important obligations for banks as part of  Pillar 2 supervision, specifically a process for assessing their overall  capital adequacy in relation to their risk profile and a strategy for  maintaining their capital levels. This process requires banks to  demonstrate that their internal capital targets are well founded and  consistent with their overall risk profile and current operating  environment. Banks are to assess all material risks, including both those  risks covered by Pillar 1 minimum requirements as well as other risks that  are not addressed, such as concentration, interest rate, and liquidity risks.  One rating agency expected that banks would hold a larger capital cushion  than they currently do over regulatory requirements under Basel II  because of the uncertainty about the new requirements.

The Market Risk Rule, which is  overseen by the Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC for a small number of  institutions, requires banks to use their own internal models to measure  risk. Specifically, it requires banks to measure banks\u2019 daily value-at-risk  (VAR) for covered positions\u2014that is, banks must maintain capital to cover  the risks associated with potential fluctuations in future market prices. A  bank\u2019s internal model may use any generally accepted technique to  measure VAR, but the regulation requires that the model be sophisticated  and accurate enough for the nature and size of the covered positions. To  adapt banks\u2019 internal models for regulatory purposes, banking regulators  developed minimum qualitative and quantitative requirements for all  banks subject to the market risk rule. Banks use these standards in  calculating their VAR estimate for determining their risk-based capital  ratio.", "The Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC also review banks that are subject to  the market risk capital requirements for evidence of sound risk  management, such as an institution\u2019s risk control unit that reports directly  to senior management and is independent of the business trading units.  The Market Risk Rule requires banks to conduct periodic backtesting\u2014for  example, by comparing daily VAR estimates generated by internal models  against actual daily trading results to determine how effectively the VAR  measure has identified the boundaries of losses. Banks must use the  backtesting results to adjust the multiplication factor used to determine  the bank required capital. Federal Reserve officials said that the VAR  models have performed well, and noted that no banks have had model  backtest results that have required multiplication factors higher than the  minimum prescribed in the Market Risk Rule. The officials said that such  performance was due, in large part, to the continual improvement of the  banks\u2019 VAR methodologies and other requirements of the Market Risk  Amendment, including the use of stress testing.

Although that oversight has focused on risk management  and not setting regulatory capital levels, Federal Reserve and OCC officials  said that the experience had helped prepare them for oversight of Basel II  regulatory capital models, as economic capital models and Basel II  regulatory capital models were similar. For example, as discussed earlier,  both measure risks by estimating the probability of potential losses over a  specified time period and up to a defined confidence level, using historical  loss data. According to these regulators, banks are generally using existing  economic capital systems as a starting point to create their Basel II  regulatory systems. Federal Reserve officials noted that because Basel II  would establish common system requirements for regulatory capital  purposes, in areas where banks have varying requirements for their  internal modeling systems, such as how they define default, regulators will  have greater comparability across systems. Further, some regulatory  officials noted that overseeing models to set regulatory capital levels  would involve increased regulatory scrutiny for model validation as well  as greater market discipline, because banks would be required to publicly  disclose aggregated information underlying the calculation of their risk- weighted assets.", "The Federal Reserve and OCC also have existing supervisory guidance  that describes the regulatory approaches for some aspects of their  oversight of internal models, oversight that the regulators say has helped  prepare them for oversight of models in a Basel II environment. Federal  Reserve Supervisory Letter 99-18 (SR 99-18), issued on July 1, 1999, directs  supervisors and examiners to evaluate banks\u2019 internal capital management  processes to judge whether these processes meaningfully tie the  identification, monitoring, and evaluation of risk to the determination of  the institution\u2019s capital needs. In addition, SR 99-18 requires examiners to  consider the results of sensitivity analyses and stress testing conducted by  the institution and the way these results relate to their capital plans.  According to the letter, banks must be able to demonstrate that their  capital levels are adequate to support their risk exposure, and examiners  are to review the banks\u2019 analyses. Finally, SR 99-18 directs examiners to  assess the degree to which an institution has in place, or is making  progress toward implementing, a sound internal process to assess capital  adequacy, including any risk modeling techniques used. Federal Reserve  officials noted that, although challenges continue to exist, banks in general  have made considerable strides in evaluating their internal capital  adequacy and enhancing governance and controls around the process that  produces such estimates. In some cases, work on the internal assessment  of capital adequacy has highlighted the need for institutions to focus on  fundamental risk management issues, such as risk identification, risk  measurement, and internal controls.", "Likewise, OCC Bulletin 2000-16 (2000-16) (May 30, 2000) articulates  procedures for model validation: independent review of the models\u2019  logical and conceptual soundness, comparisons with other models, and  comparison of model predictions and subsequent real-world events. OCC  officials and examiners for two large U.S. banking organizations said they  used 2000-16 to assess banks\u2019 processes for validating their economic  capital models. One examiner, for example, noted that a review using  2000-16 led to requiring a bank to improve its documentation surrounding  models it had created. According to another official, it also helped to  promote greater understanding and awareness of the need for model  validation to become an integral part of bank risk measurement and  management systems. It further promoted greater consistency in  supervisory assessments of bank model validation practices.", "OTS and FDIC officials said they also have some experience working with  models. OTS, the primary federal regulator of the remaining core Basel II  institution, has policy staff and examination experience in interest rate  risk modeling and validation processes. OTS created and maintains a Net  Portfolio Value model, which allows users to create customized interest  rate risk stress scenarios and incorporate emerging interest rate exposures  and techniques, among other things. OTS officials said this oversight had  helped OTS policy and examiner staff gain experience in overseeing the  use of models and validation processes. OTS officials also said that they  have some recent experience reviewing economic capital models and  validation for risk management purposes, though OTS\u2019s experience in this  area has not been as extensive as the Federal Reserve\u2019s or OCC\u2019s.  Although OTS has not analyzed market risk models, it will do so should  the September 2006 amendments to the Market Risk Rule be adopted as  proposed. FDIC, as noted earlier, will be involved in the Basel II  implementation process as the deposit insurer for all of the Basel II banks,  and FDIC officials said they could be the primary federal regulator for  insured subsidiaries of core Basel II banks or possible opt-in banks.

The NPR states that regulators will  evaluate banks on their advanced internal ratings based systems for rating  risk and estimating risk exposure; regulators will consider a bank\u2019s  estimates of key risk characteristics, such as probability of default and  loss given default (a process called quantification), ongoing model  validation, data management and maintenance, and oversight and control  mechanisms. As part of this evaluation, regulators said the examination  teams for each bank would develop a qualification strategy designed to  help the team better understand the design of the bank\u2019s Basel II systems,  drawing on existing supervisory tools and assessing compliance with the  forthcoming U.S. rule and supervisory guidance.

Others are concerned about potential drops in required  regulatory capital once the parallel run and transition period have been  completed. Regulatory concerns regarding possible large drops in  aggregate levels of minimum required risk-based capital were reinforced  after QIS-4 showed large reductions in minimum regulatory required  capital for credit risk using inputs from the banks\u2019 models.

Basel II represents a  fundamental shift in the regulatory capital framework by seeking to  leverage banks\u2019 risk management systems and internal models for use in  estimating risk more precisely than the broad risk buckets used under  Basel I, thereby helping to strengthen the safety and soundness of the  banking system. Effective capital adequacy regulation requires balancing  the costs to business of holding capital and the need to provide protection  to depositors and the federal deposit insurance fund.", "Given the limitations of Basel I, the goal of better aligning regulatory  capital with risks, and the use of safeguards during the parallel run and  transition period to ensure that a large drop in capital does not occur, we  support the regulators\u2019 plans to continue to finalize the Basel II rule and  proceed with the parallel run and transition period in order to determine  whether the Basel II framework can be relied on to adequately capture  risks for regulatory capital purposes. It is appropriate for the regulators to  proceed for several reasons.", "First, it will provide the regulators with critical information they currently  lack to assess the appropriateness of the Basel II framework relative to  Basel I.", "Second, the proposed rules, issued in September 2006, contain important  safeguards that will help prevent large declines in regulatory capital.

For example, the Basel II models are driven by low- frequency catastrophic events that are inherently difficult to estimate,  which creates challenges for regulators both in developing appropriate  models and supervising models developed by banks. Regulators already  face resource constraints in hiring and retaining talent that are more  binding than the resource constraints faced by the banks they regulate and  this issue is likely to become more significant under Basel II. Yet, it is a  critical point because under Basel II regulators\u2019 judgment will likely play  an increasingly important role in determining capital adequacy. We  recognize that these issues and others need to be addressed, and moving  forward is not without risks. However, as mentioned, the proposed  safeguards and retention of the leverage ratio should help mitigate  potential negative effects from moving forward while allowing the banks  and regulators to gather information to assess the appropriateness of the  Basel II framework.", "As the regulators finalize Basel II, clarification of a number of issues  would make the final rule more transparent, the impact on capital more  predictable, and the treatment of portfolios with insufficient data more  consistent. Specifically, the proposed rule is ambiguous on a number of  important issues that, if left unresolved, could continue to result in  regulatory ambiguity for banks and concerns for industry observers,  including (1) what regulators plan to do when banks have limited data  available, especially for new financial products or portfolios that lack data  on the impact of a major economic downturn, and how they will ensure  that portfolios with insufficient data are treated prudently and  consistently, such as considering options like a higher risk-weight or  substituting Basel IA or the Basel Committee\u2019s standardized approach for  these portfolios; (2) how regulators will calculate the 10-percent aggregate  reduction in minimum regulatory capital and what would happen if this is  triggered; and (3) the criteria for determining an appropriate average level  of aggregate capital and appropriate cyclical variation in regulatory  capital. Also, to address growing concerns from some large banks about  Basel II becoming an expensive compliance exercise, the regulators have  requested comments on many technical issues, as well as whether banks  should have the option of using a U.S. version of the standardized  approach. However, it is uncertain from the NPR what form a standardized  approach would take, whether it would mirror the international Basel  Accord, and how long banks would be able to use it.", "Although the regulators have been operating in accordance with the  Administrative Procedure Act in their Basel II rule-making process, the  process could benefit from increased transparency to respond to broader  questions and concerns about transitioning to Basel II in the United States.  Specifically, the differing perspectives the regulators bring to the Basel II  negotiations make it difficult for them to explicitly define the criteria they  plan to use to judge Basel II\u2019s success. This difficulty has, in turn, resulted  in considerable uncertainty about, and some opposition to, Basel II among  industry and other interested parties and stakeholders. As a result,  although the regulators have indicated that they plan to revise the  framework as needed during the transition, publicly reporting results of  the parallel runs and comparisons of Basel II and Basel I results for core  banks is particularly important given concerns about implementing Basel  II in the United States. Going forward, public reports could be used to  provide greater transparency on a number of issues and could help allay  concerns among banks and industry stakeholders about the transition to  Basel II. Issues that would benefit from greater transparency include (1)  the results of coordination and communication efforts among SEC and the  banking regulators; (2) changes to the Basel II rules during the transition  period and the safeguards, if any, that regulators believe are appropriate in  the absence of the transitional floors; and (3) updates to supervisory  guidance incorporating Basel II rule changes. Without added transparency,  the implementation will continue to generate questions and concerns  about the adequacy of the proposed framework. Moreover, regulators have  not articulated whether the safeguards will be retained at the end of the  parallel run and transition period if the new capital framework results in  significant declines in regulatory required capital or significant changes in  the regulatory approach.", "Finally, Basel II raises a number of competitiveness concerns that warrant  further study and review. First, how Basel II will impact U.S. banks\u2019  competitiveness internationally remains unknown. But this issue will  continue to be an ongoing concern, especially if the U.S. implementation  of Basel II results in higher regulatory required capital or greater  compliance costs for U.S. banks than for foreign banks. Second,  competitiveness issues also exist between U.S. institutions such as  investment banks and commercial banks. SEC, which has implemented  the Basel Accord for consolidated supervised entities, plans to revisit its  rules based on the Federal Reserve\u2019s interpretation of Basel II as applied  to financial holding companies. Finally, Basel II also raises  competitiveness concerns between large and small U.S. banks. Lower  capital requirements for some assets could provide large banks with a  competitive advantage; however, retaining the leverage ratio will help  maintain the domestic competitive landscape. Going forward, regulators  will need to monitor the ability of U.S. banks to compete internationally  and balance their competitiveness with the need to protect the public  interests. Moreover, the Basel IA NPR, as proposed, attempts to mitigate  potential competitive inequities created by Basel II between large and  small U.S. banks by leveling the playing field to some degree. However,  these competitive concerns will continue into the transition period, and it  is too soon to tell whether these concerns are justified or whether they  will be adequately addressed by Basel IA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To help reduce the uncertainty about the impact of Basel II on required  levels of regulatory capital, improve the transparency of the process, and  address the impediments regulators face in moving to Basel II, we are  making the following four recommendations.

The  banking agencies and SEC also provided technical comments that we  incorporated in the report where appropriate.", "In its comments, the Federal Reserve said it concurred with our initial  finding that Basel I is particularly inadequate for large banking  organizations and agreed with our conclusion that the regulators should  continue their efforts to finalize the U.S. Basel II capital rule and proceed  with the parallel run and transition periods. In commenting on our  conclusion that the U.S. Basel II process has lacked transparency, the  Federal Reserve commented that it and the other regulators have  attempted to be as transparent as possible in their implementation efforts,  consistent with the letter and spirit of the Administrative Procedure Act.  However, the Federal Reserve commented that it understood that the  Basel II proposals contain a considerable amount of ambiguity and that it  expects to reduce this ambiguity as it works with the other regulators to  finalize the Basel II rule. We agree that the regulators have been operating  within the parameters of the Administrative Procedure Act in their rule- making process, but they have been less transparent with regard to  broader questions and concerns about transitioning to Basel II in the  United States. Especially going forward, additional public reporting would  be useful to provide greater transparency on a number of issues and could  help allay concerns among banks and industry stakeholders about the  transition to Basel II. In addition, the Federal Reserve concurred with our  recommendations and said it will seek to implement them.", "Similarly, in its comments, OCC said it appreciated our recognition of the  limitations of Basel I for large and/or internationally active banks and  welcomed our conclusion that the regulators should finalize the rule and  proceed with the parallel run and transition period. OCC commented that  its position has been that the regulators should move forward on Basel II  with strong safeguards in place during a transition period and assess the  need for adjustments during this period before removing any safeguards.  OCC also noted that U.S. proposals leave two existing U.S. capital  safeguards in place that are not temporary\u2014the leverage ratio and the  prompt corrective action framework. OCC also said it welcomed our  recommendations, which it, along with the other regulators, will consider  as part of the overall review of comments received on the NPR. With  regard to our recommendation on whether a new NPR might be necessary  before proceeding to a final rule, OCC said it believed that will ultimately  depend on whether actual changes made to the NPR in the subsequent  version of the Basel II rule are sufficiently different so as to require  another round of notice and comment and that it was premature to make  that determination until all comments had been received and evaluated  and the regulators decide what changes to make. OCC also pointed out  that further delay could have ramifications for international competition  and said it will ensure that the rule-making process complies with the  letter and spirit of the Administrative Procedure Act.", "In their joint letter, FDIC and OTS commented that Basel II efforts to  improve the risk sensitivity of capital requirements for large, complex  banks has been rooted in the regulators\u2019 shared objectives and said that  ensuring the achievement of these shared objectives will remain of  paramount importance to the regulators\u2019 deliberations and review of  comments on the NPR. They also said that the regulators share a  commitment to maintaining a safe and sound banking industry and that  retention of the existing leverage ratio and prompt corrective action  framework, and other safeguards in the NPR, underscore that  commitment. In addition, they commented that, given the considerable  costs and complexity of the advance approach and its attendant  uncertainties and risks, FDIC and OTS noted that serious consideration  should be given to the implementation of a U.S. version of the Basel II  standardized approach as an option for all U.S. banks. Similar to OCC,  FDIC and OTS also said they will consider our recommendations as part of  the overall review of the comments received on the NPR.", "In its comments, Treasury agreed that there are a number of significant  Basel II implementation challenges and uncertainties for the large,  complex banking organizations that will be subject to Basel II  requirements and for federal banking regulators. Treasury stated its view  that the regulators needed to reach a consensus on the major requirements  of a final rule soon after the NPR comment period closes for Basel II and  IA if the United States is going to meet the January 2008 goal for Basel II  implementation. Treasury noted that further delay would add to  uncertainty and potentially create burdens for domestic and foreign banks.  Treasury also expressed concern with our recommendation to issue a new  NPR before finalizing the Basel II rule, saying that the overlapping  comment period for Basel II and Basel IA, which is similar to the  standardized approach for credit risk in the international Basel Accord,  provides commenters the ability to opine on implementation and other  issues and options. We realize that an additional NPR would further delay  the Basel II process; however, under certain circumstances an additional  NPR would be a necessary step to provide more transparency to the  process and to ensure that the final rule is comprehensive and that the  implications are fully considered. In response to comments on this  recommendation from the Federal Reserve, OCC, and the Treasury, we  have clarified the wording of our recommendation to more clearly state  the need for a new NPR if the regulators intend to issue a final rule that is  materially different from the NPR or if they intend to provide a U.S.  standardized approach.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional  committees, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Chairman of the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Comptroller of the Currency,  the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Chairman of the  Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Secretary of the Treasury.

Banks use the results of these rating systems to estimate  several risk parameters that are inputs to supervisory formulas. Figure 7  illustrates how credit risk will be calculated under the Basel II A-IRB.  Banks must first classify their assets into exposure categories and  subcategories defined by supervisors: for wholesale exposures those  subcategories are high-volatility commercial real estate and other  wholesale; for retail exposures those subcategories are residential  mortgages, qualifying revolving exposures (e.g., credit cards), and other  retail. Banks then estimate the following risk parameters, or inputs: the  probability a credit exposure will default (probability of default or PD),  the expected size of the exposure at the time of default (exposure at  default or EAD), economic losses in the event of default (loss given default  or LGD) in expected and \u201cdownturn\u201d (recession) conditions, and, for  wholesale exposures, the maturity of the exposure (M). In order to  estimate these inputs, banks must have systems for classifying and rating  their exposures as well as a data management and maintenance system.  The conceptual foundation of this proposal is that a statistical approach,  based on historical data, will provide a more appropriate measure of risk,  and capital, than a simple categorization of asset types, which does not  differentiate precisely between risks. Regulators provide a formula for  each exposure category that determines the required capital on the basis  of these inputs. If all the assumptions in the supervisory formula were  correct, the resulting capital requirement would exceed a bank\u2019s credit  losses in a given year with 99.9 percent probability. That is, credit losses at  the bank would exceed the capital requirement with a one in one thousand  chance in a given year, which could result in insolvency if the bank only  held capital equal to the minimum requirement.", "In contrast to Basel I, required capital by the A-IRB approach, as  previously described, will depend on the risk characteristics of a particular  asset rather than on broad risk weights for entire asset categories, as in  Basel I.
