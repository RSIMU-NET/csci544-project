To implement these policies, 24 agencies developed FAR supplementation. In fiscal year 2004, the 6 agencies we reviewed in depth suspended a total of 262 parties and debarred a total of 590 parties. Five agencies entered into a total of 38 administrative agreements, which permit contractors that meet certain agency-imposed requirements to remain eligible for new contracts. Agency officials said that such agreements can help improve contractor responsibility, ensure compliance through monitoring, and maintain competition. In certain circumstances, agencies can continue to do business with excluded contractors, such as when there is a compelling need for an excluded contractor's service or product. In fiscal year 2004, two of the agencies we reviewed in depth--the Air Force and the Army--issued compelling reason waivers to continue doing business with excluded parties. To help ensure excluded contractors do not unintentionally receive new contracts during the period of exclusion, the FAR requires contracting officers to consult the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS)--a governmentwide database on exclusions--and identify any competing contractors that have been suspended or debarred. However, the data in EPLS may be insufficient for this purpose. For example, as of November 2004, about 99 percent of records in EPLS for the 6 agencies we reviewed in depth did not have contractor identification numbers--a unique identifier that enables agencies to conclude confidently whether a contractor has been excluded. In the absence of these numbers, agencies use the company's name to search EPLS, which may not identify an excluded contractor if the contractor's name has changed. Further, information on administrative agreements and compelling reason determinations is not routinely shared among agencies. Such information could help agencies in their exclusion decisions and promote greater transparency and accountability."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Federal government purchases of contracted goods and services have  grown to more than $300 billion annually.

Administrative  debarments are based on the causes specified in the FAR, including  commission of offenses such as fraud, theft, bribery, or tax evasion. In  1988, the Nonprocurement Common Rule (NCR) was implemented to  provide a parallel process to the FAR for suspending and debarring parties  from receiving federal grants, loans, and other nonprocurement  transactions.

As an alternative to  exclusion, agencies sometimes enter into administrative agreements with  contractors with whom they believe there is a continuing need to do  business. These agreements can encourage changes in business practices  designed to promote contractor responsibility. In limited circumstances,  an agency may continue to do business with excluded contractors.", "The FAR requires federal agencies to conduct business only with  responsible contractors and prescribes overall suspension and debarment  policies. A suspension may be imposed only when an agency determines  that immediate action is necessary to protect the government\u2019s interests.  To initiate a suspension, an agency must have adequate evidence that the  party has committed certain civil or criminal offenses or that there is  another compelling cause affecting the contractor\u2019s present  responsibility. Generally, legal proceedings must begin within 12 months  or the suspension terminates. To initiate a debarment, an agency must  have evidence of conviction or civil judgment for certain offenses, a  preponderance of evidence that the party has committed certain offenses,  such as serious failure to perform to the terms of a contract, or any other  cause of so serious or compelling a nature that it affects the contractor\u2019s  present responsibility. The agency debarring official is responsible for  determining whether debarment is in the government\u2019s interest, and the  FAR states that the seriousness of the contractor\u2019s actions and any  remedial measures or mitigating factors should be considered. Generally,  the period of debarment should not exceed 3 years.", "Figure 3 provides a general overview of the suspension and debarment  process.", "The FAR allows agencies flexibility to supplement FAR provisions and  develop guidance based on agency needs. The 24 agencies we reviewed  had included suspension and debarment policies in FAR supplements; 21  had also adopted NCR; and 12 had developed additional guidance, such as  directives and policy memos to implement their suspension and  debarment processes (see table 1).

In addition, in September 1992, the Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition issued guidance stating that (1)  when appropriate, before action is taken on suspension, a contractor  should be informed that DOD has extremely serious concerns with the  contractor\u2019s conduct, and the contractor should be allowed to provide  information on its behalf, and (2) DOD debarring officials should  coordinate fully within DOD, and in certain cases among civilian  agencies, to determine the possible effects of the suspensions and  debarments on other organizations as well as to receive additional  information that may affect the exclusion decision.", "EPA\u2019s Acquisition Regulation, a FAR supplement, designates the roles  of various officials and clarifies EPA\u2019s suspension and debarment  procedures. An August 1993 memorandum of understanding provides  specific responsibilities for EPA\u2019s Office of Acquisition Management  and Office of Grants and Debarment in the processing of suspension  and debarment actions. In addition, EPA has established guidance on  initiating a suspension or debarment action. EPA also included a  specific section in NCR addressing EPA\u2019s statutory disqualifications  under the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts.", "GSA also supplemented the FAR with a regulation that designates the  roles of various officials and clarifies suspension and debarment  procedures.

In addition, GSA\u2019s Office of Inspector General  Operations Manual outlines responsibilities for investigating cases,  coordinating with law enforcement agencies, and making referrals to  GSA\u2019s suspension and debarment officials. In November 2002, GSA  issued an internal order concerning the requirement for legal review of  suspension and debarment decisions.", "Each of the agencies we reviewed established an organizational structure  that identifies the lead office, responsibilities, and staffing to manage their  suspension and debarment activities.

Table 2  shows specific actions reported by the six agencies we reviewed during  fiscal year 2004.", "Administrative agreements, also referred to as compliance agreements,  provide an alternative to exclusion when contractors that are being  considered for suspension or debarment have addressed the cause of the  problem through actions such as disciplining individuals, revising internal  controls, and disclosing problems to the appropriate government agency  in a timely manner. Under administrative agreements, contractors agree  to meet certain requirements and may continue to enter into contracts  with the government. Agency officials said that reaching administrative  agreements with contractors can serve the government\u2019s interest by  improving contractor responsibility, ensuring compliance through  monitoring the requirements of the agreement, and maintaining  competition among contractors. Administrative agreements can be  negotiated at any point in the suspension and debarment process, such as  when a contractor independently acknowledges a problem, but the  agencies we reviewed in depth said these agreements are most commonly  negotiated as an alternative to debarment. These agreements generally  follow a consistent format, emphasize corporate ethics programs, and are  in effect for a period of 3 years. Table 3 summarizes the key contractor  requirements included in the agreements we reviewed.", "While administrative agreements provide an alternative to exclusion,  agencies can continue to do business with excluded contractors in limited  circumstances through the use of waivers by making a determination that  there is a compelling reason to award a contract to an excluded party.  This determination requires a written explanation of the reason for doing  business with an excluded contractor, such as an urgent need for the  contractor\u2019s supplies or services, or that the contractor is the only known  source. Of the six agencies we reviewed, only the Air Force and the Army  reported that compelling reason waivers had been issued over the past 2  years. The Air Force reported that three waivers had been granted\u2014in  August and September 2003 and in August 2004\u2014to continue contracting  with the Boeing Company for launch services for military space equipment  based on national security concerns and to mitigate program schedule and  cost risks. In fiscal year 2004, the Air Force issued one waiver for sole- source reasons, and the Army issued four waivers based on urgent need.", "Suspension and debarment constitutes exclusion of all divisions or other  organizational elements of the contractor, unless the exclusion decision is  otherwise limited.

We found, however, that while the EPLS database has a field for entering  contractors\u2019 DUNS numbers, it is not a required field in the database, and  the data appear to be routinely omitted from the database. For the 6  agencies we reviewed in depth, about 99 percent of records in the EPLS  database as of November 2004 did not have DUNS contractor  identification numbers.", "To ensure that excluded contractors do not unintentionally receive new  contracts during the period of exclusion, the FAR and NCR require  contracting officers and awarding officials to consult EPLS and identify  any competing contractors that have been suspended or debarred.  Because EPLS lacks unique identifiers for most of the cases for the six  agencies we reviewed in depth, contracting officers use the competing  contractor\u2019s name to search the system to determine whether a  prospective contractor has been excluded from doing business with the  federal government. However, a contractor\u2019s name as it appears in a bid or  proposal may not be the same as in EPLS. For example, the XYZ Company  may submit bids or proposals using \u201cXYZ Company\u201d but appear as \u201cXYZ\u201d  in EPLS. Therefore, if the contracting officer searched for an exact match,  EPLS would not identify the company. Searching for partial matches  would fail to identify companies that have changed their names. According  to agency suspension and debarment officials, contracting officers have  overlooked excluded contractors when using EPLS, due in part to not  being able to match contractor names. Though agency officials could not  recall specific cases, they said that this difficulty in matching names is  more likely to occur in cases in which contractors have changed their  names.", "We too had difficulty matching names using EPLS. For example, because  of the various ways a contractor\u2019s name might be entered in the database  and because contractor names sometimes change over time, we could not  be assured that we identified all contractors that have been excluded more  than once. We also attempted to match contractors\u2019 names in EPLS and  FPDS\u2014the database containing government contracting actions\u2014to  determine whether excluded contractors had received new contracts  during a period of exclusion. Although this effort did not produce any  matches, we cannot conclude with confidence that excluded contractors  are not receiving new contracts because of the lack of consistency  regarding contractor names both between and within the databases. This  problem has been longstanding. In our 1987 report, we noted similar  difficulties in matching data from the list of excluded parties with FPDS  data. Despite our findings, the problem continues, increasing the risk that  suspended or debarred contractors will be awarded new contracts during  a period of exclusion.", "The overall reliability of reported data is also a concern. According to GSA  officials, responsibility for ensuring data reliability rests with the agencies  entering data into EPLS. GSA does not know, however, whether agencies  have tested the reliability of their EPLS data. The absence of information  on data reliability makes using the system for oversight or analysis  problematic. For example, when we attempted to use EPLS to determine  the average length of time of exclusions, we found many records with an  indefinite termination date. In some cases, parties are listed as excluded  for an indefinite period of time pending the outcome of a case. In  nonprocurement cases, parties also may be excluded for an indefinite  period of time. However, when a record is entered in EPLS without a  termination date, the system defaults to record the termination date as  indefinite. In the absence of information on data reliability, there is no way  to estimate the extent to which the entries with indefinite termination  dates reflect parties that had been excluded for an indefinite period of  time or parties for which no termination date had been entered."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ISDC Provides an Opportunity to Facilitate Sharing of Information on Administrative Agreements and Exclusion Waivers", "paragraphs": ["The Interagency Suspension and Debarment Committee (ISDC) is  responsible for coordinating policy, practices, and information sharing on  various suspension and debarment issues.

While ISDC is not a decision-making  body, it develops recommendations for the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) on interagency issues, such as determining which agency  should take the lead on a case when more than one agency does business  with a particular contractor. The ISDC reports to OMB\u2019s Office of Federal  Financial Management and has been chaired by EPA\u2019s suspension and  debarment officer since 1988.", "In its March 2002 report on interagency coordination, the ISDC  emphasized the importance of identifying a lead agency to coordinate with  other federal agencies that do business with a contractor before entering  into an administrative agreement. In our discussions with several  suspension and debarment officials they said that, in addition, sharing  information on past and current administrative agreements within the  broader community of suspension and debarment officials would also be  useful. They said that when an agency official is considering taking action  with respect to a particular contractor, it would be helpful to know  whether another agency had ever used an administrative agreement with  that contractor, what the terms of the agreement were, and whether the  contractor had complied with the agreement. That information is not  currently collected centrally nor routinely made available to all suspension  and debarment officials. Of the agencies we reviewed, only the Army has  taken initiative to share information on administrative agreements.

We found that information on compelling reason  waivers was not readily available from most agencies we reviewed. To  obtain information on compelling reason waivers, we had to reconcile the  information we collected from the DOD agencies with information we  collected from GSA for those agencies. The FAR supplement for DOD  requires DOD to provide written notice of any compelling reason waiver  determination to GSA, but we had to make repeated requests from DOD  agencies and GSA in order to obtain complete information. In our view,  accountability and transparency of the process would be enhanced were  this information routinely collected and reported by all agencies. For  example, more information on the use of waivers would allow suspension  and debarment officials to evaluate patterns in the use of waivers to  determine whether they were used more commonly in some industries  than others.

To  assess the reliability of EPLS data we (1) performed electronic testing of  the required data elements for obvious errors in accuracy and  completeness, (2) reviewed related documentation, and (3) interviewed  knowledgeable agency officials.
