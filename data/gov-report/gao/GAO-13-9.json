Cargo containers are an important instrument of global trade but also can present security concerns. CBP is responsible for administering container security programs, and its strategy for securing maritime cargo containers includes analyzing information to identify shipments that may contain terrorist weapons or other contraband. Because CBP has insufficient resources to examine every container, targeters use ATS to target which container shipments should be examined. GAO was asked to assess CBP's targeting efforts. This report addresses (1) how ATS supports CBP's targeting of maritime cargo container shipments for national security purposes and (2) the extent to which CBP assesses the effectiveness of ATS's national security targeting rules. GAO analyzed fiscal year 2011 CBP data on shipments and containers arriving at U.S. ports and containers scanned at these ports. GAO also visited six CBP units selected on the basis of the percentage of maritime shipments that were scored as high risk or medium risk for national security purposes at these locations in fiscal year 2011, among other factors. GAO also analyzed documents, such as CBP's ATS performance measures."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), employs a risk-based approach that uses the Automated Targeting System (ATS) and other tools to identify (target) maritime cargo shipments for further examination. ATS is a web-based enforcement and decision support system that includes a set of rules to assess the risk level for each arriving cargo shipment. This set of rules is referred to as the maritime national security weight set (weight set) because each rule in the set has a specific weighted value assigned to it. CBP classifies the risk scores from the weight set as low, medium, or high risk. CBP policy states that a shipment's risk score is to determine, in part, actions taken by CBP officers (targeters) at the ports. Specifically, targeters are generally required to review shipment data for all medium-risk and high-risk shipments and hold high-risk shipments for examination. The risk score, however, is not the sole factor that determines whether a targeter reviews the data for a shipment or whether CBP examines a shipment. In particular, targeters at each of the six ports GAO visited explained that they use the ATS risk score as a starting point for the targeting process but that their decisions regarding which shipments to examine are ultimately based on additional research. Targeters at the six ports GAO visited said they also use tools outside of ATS, such as web searches, to research shipments.", "CBP efforts to assess the weight set's effectiveness in identifying the risk of shipments have been limited. CBP has performance measures--represented by the percentage of shipments targeted as high risk that contain a threat and the percentage of shipments targeted as high risk that do not contain a threat--that enable CBP to determine the accuracy of the weight set, given a particular workload or examination rate. However, CBP did not assess the weight set to verify its effectiveness when implementing an updated version in early 2011. Prior to implementing the updated version of the weight set, CBP assessed the potential impact of the update on CBP's workload but did not conduct an assessment to determine whether the updated version of the weight set would be more effective in identifying high-risk shipments than the previous version or other alternatives. Assessing the potential effectiveness of alternative versions of the weight set prior to selecting one for implementation could help CBP make more informed decisions about future updates. Doing so could also provide CBP reasonable assurance that the version it selects is the most effective of the alternatives and is more effective than the previous version it replaces. Furthermore, since implementing the updated version of the weight set in early 2011, CBP has not regularly assessed the weight set to monitor its performance and to help determine when changes are needed. For example, CBP conducted the first assessment of the current version of the weight set, using the performance measures, in the summer of 2012--18 months after the weight set's implementation in early 2011. Regular assessments of the weight set's effectiveness could help CBP determine when updates are needed in a timelier manner and ensure that targeters have the best information available to make targeting decisions. Moreover, CBP has not established targets for the performance measures so that it is not clear whether a particular change in the weight set's performance is significant enough to suggest that changes are needed to improve the effectiveness of the weight set."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CBP (1) ensure that future updates to the weight set are based on assessments of its performance and (2) establish targets for performance measures and use those measures to regularly assess effectiveness of the weight set.

According to the  U.S. Department of Transportation, the majority of U.S. imports arrive by  ocean vessel, and much of that is transported in cargo containers. In  fiscal year 2011, for example, about 13.4 million cargo containers arrived  at U.S. seaports. Cargo containers are an important segment of the  global supply chain\u2014the flow of goods from manufacturers to retailers\u2014 and can present significant security concerns. Within the federal  government, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), part of the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is responsible for administering  container security and reducing the vulnerabilities associated with the  supply chain. Balancing security concerns with the need to facilitate the  free flow of commerce, part of CBP\u2019s mission, remains an ongoing  challenge for the public and private sectors alike. CBP officials believe  that the likelihood of terrorists smuggling weapons of mass destruction  (WMD) into the United States in cargo containers is relatively low;  however, the consequences of such an event could be catastrophic.", "Although there have been no known incidents of cargo containers being  used to transport WMD, ensuring the security of cargo containers remains  an important role for CBP given that criminals have exploited containers  for other illegal purposes, such as smuggling weapons, people, and illicit  substances.", "Since September 11, 2001, Congress has passed various laws to  address concerns about the security of cargo containers in the global  supply chain. The enactment of the Maritime Transportation Security Act  of 2002 called for the establishment of a program to evaluate and certify  secure systems of international intermodal transportation, including  standards and procedures for screening and evaluating cargo containers  prior to loading onto vessels and for securing and monitoring cargo while  in transit. In 2006, the Security and Accountability For Every Port Act  was enacted, which required, among other things, that pilot projects be  established at three ports to test the feasibility of scanning 100 percent of  U.S.-bound cargo containers at foreign ports. Subsequently, the  Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007  (9/11 Act) required, among other things, that by July 2012, 100 percent  of U.S.-bound cargo containers be scanned at foreign ports with both  radiation detection and nonintrusive inspection (NII) equipment before  being placed on U.S.-bound vessels. In May 2012, the Secretary of  Homeland Security authorized a 2-year extension\u2014until July 2014\u2014of  the deadline for implementing the requirement that containers not enter  the United States unless they were scanned at foreign ports prior to being  loaded on vessels.", "We reported in October 2009 that CBP faced numerous challenges in  implementing 100 percent scanning at pilot ports, and on the basis of  work we have completed since then we know that CBP has not yet  achieved 100 percent scanning. among other things, that CBP conduct a feasibility analysis of  implementing the 100 percent scanning requirement and provide the  results to Congress along with any suggestions of cost-effective  alternatives to implementing the 100 percent scanning requirement, as  appropriate. DHS stated that CBP concurred with these  recommendations, but CBP has not yet taken action to address them. In  its report to Congress in May 2012 on the planned deadline extension,  DHS stated that it recognizes the need to proceed with container security  programs in a manner that maximizes the security of maritime cargo and  facilitates its movement and reported that it plans to continue working with  other federal agencies and international partners to develop technology  and enhance risk management processes, in addition to continuing  existing programs that enhance cargo security. However, given that the  feasibility of 100 percent scanning remains in doubt and DHS and CBP  have not identified alternatives that could achieve the same goals as 100  percent scanning, uncertainty persists regarding the scope of DHS\u2019s and  CBP\u2019s existing container security programs and how these programs will  collectively affect the movement of goods between trading partners.", "GAO, Supply Chain Security: Container Security Programs Have Matured, but  Uncertainty Persists over the Future of 100 Percent Scanning, GAO-12-422T  (Washington, D.C.: Feb. 7, 2012), and Supply Chain Security: Feasibility and Cost-Benefit  Analysis Would Assist DHS and Congress in Assessing and Implementing the  Requirement to Scan 100 Percent of U.S.-Bound Containers, GAO-10-12 (Washington,  D.C.: Oct. 30, 2009).", "CBP\u2019s strategy for securing the maritime supply chain consists of  programs that intersect with key points in the supply chain. These  programs include, among other things, analyzing information to identify  shipments that may be at high risk of transporting WMD or other  contraband; working with foreign governments to examine U.S.-bound,  high-risk shipments at foreign ports; and examining U.S.-bound, high-risk  shipments that were not examined overseas upon their arrival at a  domestic port. To aid in this process, CBP uses the Automated  Targeting System (ATS), which is an intranet-based enforcement and  decision support system that compares traveler, cargo, and conveyance  information against intelligence and other enforcement data. Among other  things, ATS uses a set of rules that assess different factors in data  provided by supply chain parties, such as importers, to determine the risk  level for a shipment. CBP officers (targeters) use information in ATS to  identify (target) which shipments should be held for an examination,  which may include an NII scan or a physical inspection. Because CBP  does not scan 100 percent of U.S.-bound cargo containers, the  effectiveness of CBP\u2019s security strategy depends on CBP\u2019s ability to use  ATS, among other tools, to effectively target shipments in the supply  chain that pose the greatest security risks.", "In response to your request, we analyzed certain aspects of CBP\u2019s  maritime national security targeting efforts. Specifically, this report  addresses the following objectives:", "How does ATS support CBP\u2019s process for targeting maritime cargo  container shipments for national security purposes?", "To what extent does CBP assess the effectiveness of the national  security targeting rules in ATS?", "To address the first objective, we obtained data from CBP for each of the  115 U.S. seaports for fiscal year 2011 on the number of (1) shipments it  placed in each of three categories\u2014high risk, medium risk, and low risk\u2014 arriving at each of the ports; (2) container arrivals at these ports; and (3)  containers scanned at these ports using NII equipment. We selected and  visited six CBP units responsible for targeting at domestic ports.  Specifically, these ports were selected from among the largest ports in  the United States using the following criteria: (1) the percentage of  maritime shipments that were scored as high risk or medium risk for  national security purposes, (2) the percentage of cargo containers that  were examined using NII equipment, and (3) whether a CBP official from  the port participated in the most recent CBP conference to discuss  changes to ATS cargo targeting rules. The six targeting units we visited  were responsible for targeting efforts at 15 ports that collectively received  about 60 percent of the maritime shipments that arrived in the United  States in fiscal year 2011. As part of these site visits, we observed port  operations, including the scanning of containers. At each location, we  also interviewed CBP targeters, including those who participated in the  most recent CBP conference to discuss changes to cargo targeting rules,  and observed their use of ATS and other tools to conduct cargo targeting  activities. The results from our visits to these six targeting units cannot be  generalized to ports nationwide; however, visits to these locations allowed  us to directly observe the targeting process and provided insights into  how ATS assigns risk scores to maritime shipments and how CBP  integrates the scores into its targeting process. We synthesized the  information from these site visits to describe the targeting process and  also analyzed CBP policies and guidance, such as CBP\u2019s National  Maritime Targeting Policy and course materials from CBP\u2019s Sea Cargo  Targeting Training.

We analyzed documentation of CBP\u2019s most recent update to the  national security targeting rules, which CBP implemented in early 2011,  and the extent to which this documentation addressed effectiveness.  Specifically, we evaluated CBP\u2019s impact assessments, which provide  information on the number of shipments the updated rules would assess  as high risk, thereby affecting CBP\u2019s examination workload. In addition,  we evaluated the extent to which CBP used its methodology to assess  the current national security targeting rules and analyzed the results of  CBP\u2019s assessments. To assess the reliability of the results of CBP\u2019s  assessments, we reviewed documentation on the methodology created  for CBP by a consulting firm in 2006. We interviewed knowledgeable CBP  officials about any adjustments to this methodology since the contract  expired and CBP analysts began conducting the performance  assessments. On the basis of this information we determined that the  results of the assessments are sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our  report. To determine the extent to which CBP conducts such  assessments on a regular basis, we analyzed documentation of recent  assessments of the national security targeting rules conducted in spring  2011 and summer 2012. We compared this information with key elements  for a risk management approach and Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government. We also reviewed our prior work on risk  management practices and compared our analysis of CBP\u2019s actions and  assessments with those practices.

In  particular, through what is referred to as the 24-hour rule, CBP generally  requires vessel carriers to electronically transmit cargo manifests to CBP  24 hours before cargo is loaded onto U.S.-bound vessels at foreign  ports.

For example,  targeters at one ATU we visited said that because ATS filters information  and presents key information to the targeters, the targeters are able to  better focus their targeting efforts than before they had ATS. Those  targeters as well as the ATU supervisor at another ATU noted that, in  particular, the risk scores that the current version of the weight set  produces are helpful in balancing their targeting workload. The risk score,  however, is not the sole factor that determines whether a targeter reviews  the data for a shipment or whether the shipment is selected for a security  examination.

To conduct this research, they may use information  within ATS or other tools and information outside of ATS. On the basis of  the ATS risk score and the research conducted, targeters make a  qualitative assessment of the risk and determine whether to hold a  shipment for examination.

For example, targeters at each ATU we  visited use queries to identify shipments for review, although the set of  queries used varied at each ATU. Five of the six ATUs we visited use  queries to ensure that all shipments, regardless of risk score, are  reviewed prior to arrival. For example, targeters at one ATU run a  query for each arriving vessel to ensure that all shipments on the  vessel have been reviewed. Targeters at another ATU have a query  for each risk level (high, medium, or low) and targeters reviewing the  results of each query are to ensure that all shipments of a particular  risk level have been reviewed. In addition, targeters at five of the six  ATUs we visited said that they run additional queries of interest for  discretionary targeting after completing their assigned duties. Such  discretionary targeting could be for national security purposes or for  other efforts, such as counternarcotics. For example, targeters at one  ATU may independently create queries to identify items of interest,  such as all shipments of a particular commodity or those coming from  a particular country of origin. In addition to queries that targeters at  the ATUs run, NTC-C targeters run nationwide queries daily to identify  shipments with the potential for containing chemical, biological,  radiological, nuclear, or conventional weapons, among other things.", "Targeters\u2019 notes: ATS has a feature that allows a targeter to  annotate a shipment with the targeter\u2019s conclusion based on research  regarding whether the shipment is considered a potential threat. The  notes feature within ATS facilitates the sharing of research findings  with CBP targeters at other locations.", "Targeters\u2019 reviews: ATS also indicates whether the shipment data  have been reviewed by a targeter at the targeter\u2019s own location or at  another CBP targeting location, such as a Container Security Initiative  port or NTC-C.", "CBP targeters also use tools outside of ATS to conduct research. During  our interviews at the six domestic port ATUs we visited, targeters  explained that they use web-based and other research tools to aid in their  assessments of shipments. Such tools include web searches, which  targeters use to find general information on a company or address; a  third-party database of public and proprietary records, which targeters  use to research business names and associated information such as a  business\u2019s locations, officers, and assets (e.g., registered vehicles); and  the State Department\u2019s Consular Consolidated Database, which targeters  may use to obtain visa and passport information for foreign individuals  involved in a shipment. Targeters review and analyze all of the  information collected to make a decision as to whether a shipment should  be examined. On the basis of such research and analysis, a targeter  could select a low-risk shipment for examination. A targeter could also  determine that an examination is not necessary for a medium-risk  shipment\u2014for example, the weight set may assign a medium-risk score  to a shipment based on the data available, but the targeter could  determine through research that the score is based on a clerical error in  the data provided.", "Targeters\u2019 experience may also inform targeting decisions. For example,  targeters at ATUs may have information about recent seizures and can  look for recurring patterns to identify future shipments that may be part of  a trend of illegal shipments.

In  2005, in response to our work and an external peer review of ATS  conducted in 2005, CBP contracted with a consulting firm to develop  performance measures and a methodology to determine the effectiveness  of the weight set in identifying high-risk shipments. The resulting  performance measures and methodology, which the consulting firm  provided to CBP in April 2006, balanced targeting accuracy with  examination workload and enabled CBP to compare the weight set\u2019s  performance with the effectiveness of examinations conducted through a  random selection program.

The TPR enables CBP to determine the accuracy of the weight  set in identifying high-risk shipments. The TPR and FPR measures also  enable CBP to determine the workload or examination rate for ports  based on the results of the weight set scores. For example, a high FPR  would unnecessarily increase the workload or number of examinations at  ports because officials would be required to examine a higher number of  shipments that do not contain an actual threat. Using data from the  version of the weight set CBP was using in 2005, the consulting firm used  its methodology to conduct a performance assessment, which involved  calculating the TPR and FPR to ultimately indicate the effectiveness of  the weight set at that time. Since the contract with the firm ended in 2011,  CBP has taken on the role of assessing the effectiveness of the weight  set. In its project plan for the most recent update to the weight set  implemented in early 2011, as it had previously done, CBP planned to  assess the performance using these measures to compare the targeting  effectiveness of the weight set with other measurements.", "CBP officials stated that they face ongoing challenges with the  performance measures and the methodology by which they are  calculated. In particular, the FPR and TPR may not accurately reflect the  weight set\u2019s performance in identifying national security threats because  they rely on indirect measures given that no true security threat has been  found in a cargo container. We reported in 2006 that CBP planned to take  steps to improve the process for assessing ATS performance. Since the  most recent update to the weight set in early 2011, CBP formed working  groups and has begun taking steps to ensure that the methodology it  uses to approximate threats accurately reflects what CBP considers to be  a national security threat (to the extent possible). For example, these  working groups plan to (1) create a new definition of \u201cnational security\u201d for  the purposes of clarifying what the weight set should target and (2) revisit  the current definitions of threats in containers to provide consistency with  the new definition of national security.

Therefore, the impact assessment does not fully account for the  effectiveness of each alternative of the weight set. Although managing  resources is an element of risk management, effectiveness in reducing  risks is also an important consideration when evaluating alternatives to  manage risk.

In January 2010, the  DHS Office of Inspector General recommended that CBP enhance its  documentation efforts to ensure that each stage of the process for  analyzing and developing ATS rules is documented, and CBP concurred  with this recommendation. As part of this recommendation, the DHS  Office of Inspector General recommended documenting the rationale for  making changes to ATS rules but did not specify what types of analyses  could demonstrate or support the rationale for making changes to the  rules.

This would enable CBP to quantitatively compare  the effectiveness of the alternative versions of the weight set being  considered prior to selecting one for implementation. Doing so, in addition  to the impact assessment, would provide CBP with reasonable assurance  that the version of the weight set it selects for implementation is the most  effective of the alternatives considered after taking into account any  resource constraints. Furthermore, assessing the alternative versions of  the weight set in the future would provide CBP with better assurance that  the version it selects for implementation is more effective than the  previous version of the weight set.

For example, according to CBP\u2019s analysis, the  TPR for summer 2011 through spring 2012 shows that, among shipments  CBP found to contain a potential threat during an examination, the weight  set accurately identified 6.3 percent as high risk, meaning that the weight  set classified 93.7 percent of shipments that carried a potential threat as  either medium risk or low risk. Furthermore, the FPR for that time period  shows that, among all the arriving shipments that CBP examined during  that time that did not pose a threat, the weight set identified 3.6 percent  as high risk. However, because CBP did not establish targets for either  TPR or FPR, it is not clear whether 6.3 percent for the TPR is sufficiently  low or 3.6 percent for the FPR is sufficiently high to suggest that changes  are needed to improve the performance of the weight set.", "CBP\u2019s project plan calls for conducting periodic performance  assessments by determining recurring measures of TPR and FPR.  Furthermore, according to CBP officials, the performance assessments  are to be conducted as part of quarterly reporting responsibilities.  However, CBP did not calculate these measures at the end of each  quarter, but instead calculated them as part of a single assessment in the  summer of 2012 and divided the results into quarters. Accordingly, CBP  was not aware of the ongoing performance of the weight set from its  implementation in early 2011 through spring 2012, and CBP was  therefore unable to determine for 18 months whether the weight set was  performing at a level that could require changes or updates to improve its  effectiveness. According to CBP officials, the summer 2012 assessment  was conducted at that time in preparation for a conference to discuss  updates to the weight set planned for the fall of 2012. CBP had decided to  hold this conference before CBP conducted the assessment, meaning its  decision for when to update the weight set was not based on information  about the weight set\u2019s effectiveness from ongoing monitoring of CBP\u2019s  performance measures for the weight set.", "Ongoing monitoring is a key element of a risk management approach,  and CBP\u2019s project plan calls for such periodic performance monitoring to  determine targeting effectiveness. In addition, standard practices for  internal control indicate that (1) ongoing monitoring should occur in the  course of normal operations and can be accomplished by periodic review  of performance measures and (2) in the process of ongoing performance  monitoring, actions should include continuous comparison of performance  data against planned targets and analysis of any differences to take  corrective actions as necessary.", "CBP officials stated that personnel have not been consistently available  to conduct performance assessments since the initial contract with the  consulting firm ended in July 2011 and that resource concerns, such as  funding, the availability of subject matter experts, and the availability of  programmers may affect the timing of weight set updates. Nevertheless,  given the importance of the weight set to CBP\u2019s process for targeting  cargo containers, regular performance assessments of the weight set that  include evaluating results against established performance targets could  help CBP determine when updates are needed in a timelier manner and  help it better prioritize the resources it needs to complete the updates.Furthermore, CBP officials stated that they intend to continue adjusting  the methodology for calculating the performance measures to mitigate  data limitations and more accurately reflect the performance of the weight  set.

Although no events have occurred to date, terror-related  attacks on the supply chain could have devastating effects on the nation\u2019s  security and economic well-being, and it is imperative that CBP use the  best information and tools available to continually mitigate potential  threats and address vulnerabilities. DHS and CBP face difficulties in  achieving 100 percent scanning of cargo containers prior to loading at  foreign ports and have, instead, advocated a risk-based approach to  target and scan those cargo containers that pose the highest risk. Given  the critical role that ATS plays as part of this risk-based approach, it is  important to ensure that ATS is performing effectively.", "CBP plans to continue enhancing risk management processes, including  the use of ATS and its associated targeting rules. CBP\u2019s determination of  which containerized shipments to review or to hold for examination is  based, in part, on the risk score. Thus, updating the weight set in ATS  that calculates this risk score is important for ensuring that targeters are  using the most effective tools in making targeting decisions. CBP has  assessed workload impacts when making updates to the weight set, but it  did not fully assess the weight set\u2019s effectiveness as part of the most  recent update. As a result, CBP does not have reasonable assurance that  the implemented version is the most effective. Further, CBP did not  conduct periodic assessments as part of ongoing monitoring efforts.  Specifically, CBP did not conduct an assessment of the weight set until  18 months after CBP implemented the new weight set. We believe it is  important that CBP more regularly assess the performance of the weight  set in ATS that produces the risk scores and compare the results of this  assessment against established performance targets.

Additionally, with respect to the  recommendation regarding risk assessments, at the time, CBP had  begun taking action to implement the recommendation by conducting and  using risk assessments that incorporated discussions of potential threats  and estimates of the relative importance of assets and vulnerabilities  associated with the supply chain. We noted, though, that CBP did not  have a methodology in place to guide its staff in identifying sources of  threat information, such as agencies to contact, what approach to take in  conducting the assessment, and key elements to include that would help  ensure consistency in the preparation of threat assessments associated  with the movement of cargo shipped in containers. As a result, we further  recommended that CBP establish and document a methodology for  conducting threat assessments associated with cargo shipped in  containers to help ensure that CBP staff responsible for conducting threat  assessments consult relevant information sources, prepare threat  assessments consistently, and include key elements to effectively  communicate risk to program managers.", "In response to that recommendation, in October 2006, CBP issued a  protocol to assist its intelligence research specialists in preparing port  threat assessments in support of the Container Security Initiative. Under  this initiative, CBP places staff at foreign seaports to work with foreign  counterparts to inspect high-risk containers before they are shipped to the  United States. The October 2006 protocol included a discussion of  information sources for CBP staff to consult and the overall methodology  to follow in making the port threat assessment. CBP also distributed a  template that discussed the key elements its specialists should include  when preparing port threat assessments. In addition, CBP developed a  checklist for its specialists to use to help ensure that appropriate  information sources are consulted in making port threat assessments. To  assist in addressing threats related to global supply chain logistics and  the movement of maritime containers carrying cargo arriving in the United  States, CBP established an Office of Intelligence and Operations  Coordination in October 2007, which has since been renamed the Office  of Intelligence and Investigative Liaison. This office includes the Analysis  and Targeting Division (A&T), which is composed of program managers  with operational experience and intelligence analysts and is responsible  for conducting risk assessments of countries (known as country risk  profiles) that consider threats, vulnerabilities, and the associated criticality  of related assets from which or through which cargo is shipped to the  United States. In 2008, the A&T Division assessed risks in two primary  mission areas: (1) terrorism and weapons of mass destruction and (2)  narcotics. On the basis of these assessments, the A&T Division  developed a risk assessment methodology to rank countries according to  the level of risk associated with each mission area. The A&T Division  teams translated these rankings into scores, and program managers  integrated them into ATS. Specifically, CBP integrated the rankings for  the terrorism mission into ATS in 2008 and for the narcotics mission in  2009.

Specifically, one component of the rule update process involves  the review of the proposed rule changes by subject matter experts, and  the DHS OIG reported that CBP could improve the process by ensuring  the rationale for changes implemented or not implemented are  documented and recorded for future use. Furthermore, the DHS OIG  reported that CBP tested new rules using actual data to determine how  well the new rules are working, but the DHS OIG noted that this process  for testing and evaluating the rules, and subsequent modifications of the  new rules, was not documented.

We  reported that terrorism experts, members of the international trade  community, and CBP inspectors at the ports we visited as part of that  review characterized the ship\u2019s manifest as one of the least reliable or  useful types of information for targeting purposes. We reported that  terrorism experts, trade community representatives, and some CBP  inspectors at ports we visited told us that CBP should explore requiring  more timely electronic transmittal of additional data elements for cargo  container targeting purposes, such as stowage plans (a map of where  each container aboard a ship is stored), container movement tracking  data, and entry data. Although we did not analyze the feasibility or the  costs and benefits of these suggestions, we reported that it could be  useful for CBP to explore requiring appropriate parties in the supply  chain, such as the importer, to provide additional data elements for use in  ATS to perform more complex linkage analyses and identify potential  anomalies in the shipping documents filed. Although we did not make a  recommendation directly related to data collection because we did not  analyze the feasibility or the costs and benefits of collecting additional  data, the recommendations in our report focused generally on  incorporating key elements of recognized modeling practices, and one of  the recognized modeling practices applicable to ATS is enhancing the  sources and types of information input into ATS.

Specifically, the 10+2 rule requires importers to submit  information about the commodities being transported in a shipment and  about entities involved in the supply chain. These additional data  elements include information that we reported could be helpful in  improving targeting efforts. In particular, the rule requires stowage plans  and some elements of entry data. We reported in September 2010 that  the 10+2 rule data elements were available for identifying high-risk cargo  at that time, but that CBP had not yet updated ATS to fully incorporate the  data into its targeting criteria.
