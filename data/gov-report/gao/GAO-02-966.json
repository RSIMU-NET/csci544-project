In October 2000, the Office of Personnel Management amended regulations to require agencies to link senior executive performance with organizational goals; to appraise executive performance by balancing organizational results with customer satisfaction, employee perspective, and other areas; and to use performance results as a basis for pay, awards, and other personnel decisions. Agencies were to establish these performance management systems by their 2001 senior executive performance appraisal cycles. Because they implemented a set of balanced expectations prior to the Office of Personnel Management requirement, GAO studied the Bureau of Land Management's, Federal Highway Administration's, Internal Revenue Service's, and Veterans Benefits Administration's use of balanced expectations to manage senior executive performance in order to identify initial approaches that may be helpful to other agencies in holding senior executives accountable for results."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The agencies GAO reviewed developed an initial set of balanced expectations for senior executives to address in their individual performance plans. GAO found that these agencies are in the early stages of using a set of balanced expectations to appraise senior executive performance and there are significant opportunities to strengthen their efforts as they move forward in holding executives accountable for results. Specifically, more progress is needed in explicitly linking executive expectations for performance to organizational goals. In addition, while these agencies address partnering with customers and other stakeholders, greater emphasis should be placed in fostering the collaboration within and across organizational boundaries to achieve results. Successful organizations understand that they must often change their culture to successfully transform themselves, and such change starts with top leadership. Senior executive performance expectations to lead and facilitate change could be a critical element as agencies transform themselves."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Leading organizations have recognized that a critical success factor in  fostering a results-oriented culture is a performance management system  that creates a \u201cline of sight\u201d showing how unit and individual performance  can contribute to overall organizational goals and helping them understand  the connection between their daily activities and the organization\u2019s  success. Effective performance management systems first align  leadership\u2019s performance expectations with organizational goals and then  cascade performance expectations through all levels in the organization.  Effective systems are not merely once- or twice-yearly expectation setting  and appraisal tools, but can help the organization manage on a day-to-day  basis. Leading organizations use their performance management systems  to achieve results, accelerate change, and facilitate communication  throughout the year so that discussions about individual and organizational  performance are integrated and ongoing. Thus, an effective performance  management system can be a strategic tool for organizations to drive  internal change and achieve external results.", "We have observed that modernizing performance management systems and  linking them to agency strategic plans and desired outcomes should be a  top priority as agencies seek to transform their cultures in response to  existing and emerging challenges and opportunities. Performance  management systems in leading organizations typically seek to achieve  three key objectives. First, they strive to provide candid and constructive  feedback to help individual employees maximize their contribution and  potential in understanding and realizing the goals and objectives of the  agency. Second, they seek to provide management with the objective and  fact-based information it needs to reward top performers. Third,  performance management systems provide the necessary information and  documentation to deal with poor performers. Most federal performance  management systems fail to achieve these objectives.", "In January 2001, GAO designated strategic human capital management as a  governmentwide high-risk area. One of the key areas challenging federal  agencies is creating results-oriented organizational cultures. Many agencies  lack organizational cultures that promote high performance and  accountability, which are critical to successful organizations. To help  agency leaders effectively lead and manage their people and integrate  human capital considerations into daily decision making and the program  results they seek to achieve, we developed a strategic human capital  model. The model highlights the kinds of thinking that agencies should  apply, as well as some of the steps they can take, to make progress in  managing human capital strategically. As detailed in that model, one critical  success factor is to link unit and individual performance to organizational  goals.", "To help agencies hold senior executives accountable for organizational  results, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) amended regulations  for senior executive performance management in October 2000. These  amended regulations on governing performance appraisals for senior  executives require agencies to establish performance management systems  that (1) hold senior executives accountable for their individual and  organizational performance by linking performance management with the  results-oriented goals of the Government Performance and Results Act of  1993 (GPRA), (2) evaluate senior executive performance using measures  that balance organizational results with customer satisfaction, employee  perspectives, and any other measures agencies decide are appropriate, and  (3) use performance results as a basis for pay, awards, and other personnel  decisions. Agencies were to establish these performance management  systems by their 2001 senior executive performance appraisal cycles.", "The first objective of this report was to describe the sets of balanced  expectations selected federal agencies used to appraise senior executive  performance for organizational results, customer satisfaction, and  employee perspectives. Our second objective was to identify the initial  implementation approaches these agencies have taken to manage senior  executive performance that may be helpful to other agencies as they  implement OPM\u2019s amended regulations governing senior executive  performance management systems. We selected the Bureau of Land  Management (BLM), Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Internal  Revenue Service (IRS), and Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA)  because they used a set of balanced expectations to manage the  performance of all or a significant portion of their senior executives prior  to the OPM requirement. IRS incorporated balanced expectations into its  senior executive performance management system in response to the  Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998; the other  agencies established their systems administratively to emphasize senior  executives\u2019 accountability for organizational results and other  expectations. As appropriate, agencies developed the performance  expectations for senior executives\u2019 individual plans to meet particular  program and management objectives and agency needs. To describe  agencies\u2019 expectations for senior executive performance, we used the  categories prescribed by OPM\u2019s regulations\u2014organizational results,  customer satisfaction, and employee perspective.

In addition, to foster a  results-oriented culture in federal agencies, the Congress is considering  legislative proposals to, among other things, focus attention on the impact  poor performance can have on the effectiveness of an organization and  require agencies to have a chief human capital officer to select, develop,  and manage a productive, high-quality workforce.", "The President\u2019s Management Agenda, released in August 2001, identified  human capital as one of the five key governmentwide management  challenges currently facing the federal government. Subsequently, the  Office of Management and Budget and OPM developed criteria that  recognized the importance of creating a performance culture that appraises  and rewards employees based on their contributions to organizational  goals as a key dimension of effective human capital management.", "We developed a model of strategic human capital management to highlight  the kinds of thinking that agencies should apply, as well as some of the  steps they can take, to make progress in managing human capital  strategically. The model consists of eight critical success factors, which  are organized to correspond with four cornerstones of effective strategic  human capital management: (1) leadership, (2) strategic human capital  planning, (3) acquiring, developing, and retaining talent, and (4) results- oriented organizational cultures. Within the cornerstone of results-oriented  organizational cultures, a critical success factor is linking unit and  individual performance to organizational goals.", "One way to reinforce accountability and alignment of individual  performance expectations with organizational goals is through the use of  results-oriented performance agreements. We have reported that other  countries have begun to use their performance management systems as a  strategic tool to help achieve results. In particular, they use performance  agreements to align and cascade organizational goals to individual  performance expectations through several levels in their organizations.  They also use performance agreements to help identify the crosscutting  connections both within and between agencies and align the performance  commitments of top-level executives with broader governmentwide  priorities.", "Further, our work has shown that U.S. agencies have benefited from their  use of results-oriented performance agreements for political and senior  career executives. Although each agency developed and implemented  performance agreements that reflected its specific organizational  priorities, structures, and cultures, the performance agreements met the  following characteristics. They  strengthened alignment of results-oriented goals with daily operations,  fostered collaboration across organizational boundaries,  enhanced opportunities to discuss and routinely use performance  information to make program improvements,  provided a results-oriented basis for individual accountability, and  maintained continuity of program goals during leadership transitions.", "Prior to OPM amending its regulations on senior executive performance  management systems, BLM, FHWA, IRS, and VBA implemented systems  that used a set of balanced expectations to manage senior executive  performance.

Following the summit, Kentucky, North Carolina, and  Mississippi held subsequent state safety summits and pursued numerous  initiatives to reduce fatalities. The senior executive reported in his self- assessment for fiscal year 2001 that many states in the region have  experienced a reduction in the number of highway fatalities since the  Southern Executive Safety Summit, which is helping FHWA meet its goal of  reducing the number of highway-related fatalities by 20 percent in 10 years.", "Similarly, to address IRS\u2019s performance expectation for senior executives  to develop and execute plans to achieve organizational goals, a senior  executive who is the area director for compliance in New York has a  performance expectation in his fiscal year 2002 individual performance  plan to ensure that taxpayers affected by the events of September 11, 2001,  are treated and audited according to their circumstances, and that the  compliance guidelines and policy regarding affected taxpayers are adhered  to.

Specifically, one senior executive\u2019s workgroup scored 3.68 out of a  possible 5 for \u201chaving the materials and equipment they need to do their  work right\u201d compared to the IRS-wide score of 3.58 on the survey. To allow  senior executives and managers to benchmark externally, Gallup compares  each workgroup\u2019s results to the 50th (median) and 75th (best practices)  percentile scores from Gallup\u2019s Q-12 database.

To improve customer satisfaction, the Commissioner of  Internal Revenue set an expectation that the business units, headed by  senior executives, develop action plans based on customer survey data that  are relevant to the needs of their particular customers. IRS provided  guidance to senior executives and managers to help them understand and  interpret the customer survey data, identify areas for improvement, and  develop action plans to respond to customers\u2019 issues and concerns.", "For example, to address the customer satisfaction expectation in his fiscal  year 2002 individual performance plan, an IRS senior executive who is the  area director for compliance in Laguna Niguel, California, requires each of  his territory managers to present an action plan identifying ways to  improve low scores from customer surveys. He then rolls up these  managers\u2019 plans into a consolidated area action plan for which he is  responsible. Specifically, an expectation in his action plan is to improve  how customers are treated during collection and examination activities by  ensuring that examiners explain to customers their taxpayer rights, as well  as why they were selected for examination and what they could expect.  Further, the senior executive plans to ensure that territory managers solicit  feedback from customers on their treatment during these activities and  identify specific reasons for any customer dissatisfaction. In his midyear  self-assessment for fiscal year 2002, the senior executive stated that  substantial progress is being made in achieving the collection and  examination customer satisfaction goals.", "Similarly, to address employee perspectives, IRS requires senior executives  to hold workgroup meetings with their employees to discuss the  workgroups\u2019 Employee Satisfaction Survey results and develop action  plans to address these results. According to a senior executive in IRS\u2019s  criminal investigation unit, the workgroup meetings were beneficial  because they increased communication with employees and identified  improvements in the quality of worklife. For example, through the  workgroup meetings, employees identified the need for recruiting  supervisory special agents to even out some of the workload. Subsequently,  the senior executive set an expectation in his fiscal year 2002 individual  performance plan to ensure that the field office has a strong recruitment  program to attract viable candidates. He also has an expectation to ensure  his field offices hold timely workgroup meetings and develop and  implement action plans to address concerns identified during these  meetings.", "To reinforce the importance of follow-up action, IRS developed a Web- based database system to track workgroup issues across IRS. According to  an IRS official, the system is being upgraded to improve its usefulness for  senior executives and will allow them to track their progress in completing  the actions identified in the workgroup meetings. In addition, all employees  will be able to access summary information to help identify trends in the  data across workgroups. The system will also provide employees with the  opportunity to share best practice information on resolved workgroup  issues.", "To help meet their employee perspective performance expectations, FHWA  requires senior executives to use 360-degree feedback instruments to  solicit employee views on their leadership skills. Based on the 360-degree  feedback, senior executives are to identify action items and incorporate  them into their individual performance plans for the next fiscal year. FHWA  piloted the 360-degree feedback instrument for half its leadership team of  senior executives in fiscal year 2001 and scheduled the rest for fiscal year  2002. The 360-degree feedback process is designed to provide an executive  direct input from various sources\u2014peers, customers, and subordinates\u2014 and to compare those results to a self-evaluation and input from a  supervisor.", "While the 360-degree feedback instrument is intended for developmental  purposes to help senior executives identify areas for improvement and is  not included in the executive\u2019s performance evaluation, executives are held  accountable for taking some action with the 360-degree feedback results  and responding to the concern of their peers, customers, and subordinates.  For example, based on 360-degree feedback, a senior executive for field  services identified better communications with subordinates and increased  collaboration among colleagues as areas for improvement, and as required,  he then incorporated action items into his individual performance plan. In  fiscal year 2001, he set a performance expectation to develop a leadership  self-improvement action plan and identify appropriate improvement goals.  In his self-assessment for fiscal year 2001, he reported that he improved his  personal contact and attention to the division offices as evidenced by a 30  percent increase in visits to the divisions that year.

Specifically, agencies rated about  85 percent and 82 percent of senior executives at the highest level their  systems permit in their performance ratings in fiscal years 2000 and 2001,  respectively. Nearly all of the senior executives are rated using three- and  five-level rating systems with the majority of senior executives rated under  five-level systems. When disaggregating the data by rating system, the  percentage of senior executives that received the highest level rating under  five-level systems was approximately 77 and 75 percent in fiscal years 2000  and 2001, respectively. In the same period, the percent of senior executives  receiving the highest level rating under three-level systems was about 99  percent.", "In addition, OPM data show that, governmentwide, approximately 52  percent of senior executives received bonuses each year since fiscal year  1999. Between fiscal years 1999 and 2001, the average bonus payment  increased from about $10,200 to $12,300. OPM officials told us that they  plan to closely monitor the distribution of fiscal year 2002 performance  ratings and bonuses.", "IRS, FHWA, VBA, and BLM recognize that they are still working at  implementing effective performance management systems that make  meaningful distinctions in senior executive performance. For example, IRS  established an executive compensation plan for determining base salary,  performance bonuses, and other awards for its senior executives that is  intended to explicitly link individual performance to organizational  performance and is designed to emphasize performance. To recognize  performance across different levels of responsibilities and commitments,  IRS assigns senior executives to one of three bonus levels at the beginning  of the performance appraisal cycle. Assignments depend on the senior  executives\u2019 responsibilities and commitments in their individual  performance plans for the year, as well as the scope of their work and its  impact on IRS\u2019s overall mission and goals. For example, the Commissioner  of Internal Revenue or Deputy Commissioner assigns senior executives to  bonus level three\u2014considered to be the level with the highest  responsibilities and commitments\u2014only if they are a part of the Senior  Leadership Team. IRS restricts the number of senior executives assigned to  each bonus level for each business unit.", "In addition, for each bonus level, IRS establishes set bonus ranges by  individual summary evaluation rating, which is intended to reinforce the  link between performance and rewards. The bonus levels and  corresponding bonus amounts of base salary by summary rating are shown  in table 4.", "To help ensure realistic and consistent performance ratings, each IRS  business unit has a \u201cpoint budget\u201d for assigning performance ratings that is  the total of four points for each senior executive in the unit. After the initial  summary evaluation ratings are assigned, the senior executives\u2019 ratings are  converted into points\u2014an \u201coutstanding\u201d rating converts to six points; an  \u201cexceeded\u201d to four points, which is the baseline; a \u201cmet\u201d to two points; and  a \u201cnot met\u201d to zero points.

For fiscal year 2001, 31 percent  of the senior executives received a rating of outstanding compared to 42  percent for fiscal year 2000, 49 percent received a rating of exceeded  expectations compared to 55 percent, and 20 percent received a rating of  met expectations compared to 3 percent. In fiscal year 2001, 52 percent of  senior executives received a bonus, compared to 56 percent in fiscal year  2000. IRS officials indicated that they are still gaining experience using the  new compensation plan and will wait to establish trend data before they  evaluate the link between performance and bonus decisions.", "FHWA weights the elements it uses to appraise senior executive  performance to make meaningful distinctions among its senior executives.  These elements include (1) strategic and performance plan  accomplishments and corporate management improvements and results  and (2) job significance and complexity. The senior executives receive a  score totaling 100 points, with a maximum of 70 points for strategic and  performance plan accomplishments and corporate management  improvements and results, and a maximum of 30 points for job significance  and complexity. FHWA provides definitions for assigning points. For  example, to receive all 70 points for strategic and performance plan  accomplishments, the executive must achieve all the performance  expectations identified in the individual performance plan, including  exceptional advancement on the corporate management strategies. To  receive all 30 points for job significance and complexity, the executive must  have a position that is highly visible, with a high degree of difficulty due to  legislation, court decisions, political pressures, and other factors.
