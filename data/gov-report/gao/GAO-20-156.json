Fund balances are affected by complex interactions of factors, but the total increase was driven largely by military and civilian retirement fund balances. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects the total balance to start declining in fiscal year 2022 as decreases in Medicare and Social Security will exceed increases in military and civilian retirement balances. To offset the overall decrease, the federal government is projected to borrow more from the public.", "GAO found that 11 of 13 case studies recently received general revenue\u2014collections that are not dedicated by law for a specific purpose. For example, medical insurance premiums for Medicare Part B are set to cover 25 percent of expected costs; the remaining 75 percent are covered by general revenues.

In the federal budget, the  meaning of the term \u201ctrust fund\u201d differs significantly from its private sector  usage. In the case of federal trust funds, the federal government owns  the assets of federal trust funds, does not have a fiduciary responsibility  to trust beneficiaries, and can raise or lower future trust fund collections  and payments or change the purposes for which the collections are used  by changing existing laws. Designation as a trust fund does not in and of  itself impose a greater commitment on the government to carry out  program activities than it has to carry out other government activities.

The  dedicated taxes and fees collected from the public are deposited in the  General Fund and the General Fund disburses the fund\u2019s benefit and  other payments to the public.

Generally, these securities are  not traded in the financial markets and are able to be redeemed on  demand by the government account. The interest they earn is credited to  the fund accounts in the form of additional Treasury securities or is used  to pay current expenses or benefits. Interest earned by government  accounts on their Treasury securities is an internal transaction, made  between two accounts within the federal government, and constitutes an  expense for Treasury. Treasury must pay back the debt held by  government accounts when these accounts need to redeem their  securities to be able to make their expenditures.

If the costs exceed the savings, a separate sequestration will be  triggered.

This is greater than the  proportion of total federal spending that is mandatory. According to OMB,  during fiscal year 2018, mandatory spending made up 69.3 percent of all  federal outlays while discretionary spending accounted for the remaining  30.7 percent. Seventy-six percent of trust funds and other dedicated  funds had some mandatory budget authority (see table 6). Some funds  have a mix of mandatory and discretionary budget authority.", "In general, the collections and balances of accounts with mandatory  spending authority are available for obligation. Mandatory authority  provides some flexibility for agencies because they do not have to await  congressional action to incur obligations and make payments. For  example, the Social Security Trust Funds have mandatory budget  authority, which authorizes the program to continue to make payments to  beneficiaries during lapses in appropriations. Although programs with  mandatory authority need not go through the annual appropriations  process, they are still subject to congressional oversight. In some cases  Congress has set obligation limits in annual appropriations acts. For  example, although the Crime Victims Fund has mandatory budget  authority to obligate funds from its available balances, limits in annual  appropriations acts have often capped the amount that may be obligated  in each fiscal year. As a result, annual income has exceeded outgo and  the balance of the fund had grown to $16.6 billion at the end of fiscal year  2018.", "Designation as mandatory or discretionary budget authority determines  how budget control mechanisms are applied to the funds.

For  example, Social Security, Medicaid, and veterans\u2019 compensation are  completely exempt, and Medicare reductions are limited to 2 percent.  Exemptions and special rules lead sequestration to affect some areas of  the federal government more than others. For example, programs without  exempt status, such as the Commodity Credit Corporation Fund, bear a  greater reduction than they would if cuts were applied evenly to all  programs.", "Outgo from those trust funds and other dedicated funds that do not have  mandatory budget authority are controlled in the annual appropriations  process and count toward the annual discretionary spending limits laid  out in the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA). For example, outlays from  the Airport and Airway Trust Fund are discretionary. This means that the  outlays for capital improvements and operations of the nation\u2019s airport  and airway system, except for airport grants, count toward government- wide discretionary spending limits.", "Some trust funds and other dedicated funds have a combination of  budget authorities, which can affect balances. For example, the Harbor  Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF), which is supported through collections  of the harbor maintenance fee, has mandatory income and discretionary  outlays. Historically, HMTF income has exceeded outgo and by the end of  fiscal year 2018, the balance in the fund had grown to $9.3 billion. Any  proposed legislation to lower the fee revenues would require an offset so  as not to increase the deficit. Conversely, since the spending is subject to  the discretionary caps, any increase in spending to align with program  revenues would count toward the discretionary spending limits.", "Most spending from trust funds and other dedicated funds is mandatory  and not controlled by the annual appropriations process. We have  previously reported that the increase in mandatory spending has long- term implications for the nation\u2019s fiscal outlook overall, including the  growing federal debt. The federal government has previously enacted  fiscal rules in the form of laws that constrain fiscal policy decisions,  including BCA and PAYGO. These fiscal rules apply the same way  regardless of status as a trust fund or other dedicated fund.

For example, the USF, the National Flood Insurance Reserve  Fund, and the Tennessee Valley Authority Fund all have mandatory  budget authority, but have no entitlement authority. These programs have  the most flexibility because their income is available without further  appropriations action and their outgo is not driven by legal requirements  to individuals or governments.

We excluded financing and credit  accounts because they are non-budgetary. For the majority of these data  we used the amounts reported in OMB MAX schedule J, which is used to  produce the Status of Funds tables in the President\u2019s Budget Appendix.  While the list of accounts that report Status of Funds tables publicly in the  budget is limited to 21 accounts, a schedule J is created in OMB MAX for  all non-revolving trust funds and special funds and, for the years in our  review, for all revolving trust funds. Schedule J data are not available for  public enterprise funds, so we used guidance from OMB Circular No. A- 11 to approximate similar income, outgo, and balance data using data  fields that are reported in the Program and Financing table. The public  enterprise fund data are slightly different than the other fund types  because borrowing authority as it is reported in OMB MAX only includes  information on repayable advances and excludes information on  outstanding debt and borrowing. We asked OMB staff to review our  methodology to calculate these numbers and they agreed our approach  was methodologically sound. To assess the reliability of OMB MAX data  related to the income, outgo, and balances of trust fund and other  dedicated fund accounts, we reviewed related documentation,  interviewed knowledgeable OMB staff, and conducted electronic data  testing. We found these data reliable for our purposes.", "OMB budget data are rounded to the nearest million and do not show  funds with amounts less than $500,000. Accordingly, OMB instructs  agencies to consolidate small trust fund accounts with larger general fund  accounts so the total government-wide amounts will be complete. In  addition, OMB sometimes reports trust fund groups under a single  account rather than each individual trust fund account. Groups may  include two or more trust funds with similar purposes. The Department of  the Treasury (Treasury), on the other hand, tracks monies for each  discrete account to the penny in order to fulfill its government wide  accounting and cash management responsibilities. As such, we used  data from the Treasury Fiscal Year 2018 Combined Statement of  Receipts, Outlays, and Balances of the United States Government to  provide a complete count of these funds, including accounts with small  balances and accounts that are a part of groups. We interviewed  Treasury officials, reviewed relevant documentation, and conducted  electronic and manual testing to ensure the data were reliable for our  purposes and concluded that they were.", "To examine the extent to which federal trust funds and other dedicated  funds are supported by their dedicated collections, in addition to the data  described above, we examined thirteen case study accounts in nine  agencies.

The budget authority included in our case study selection represented  examples of both mandatory and discretionary budget authority. We also  ensured that budget authority from appropriations, borrowing authority,  contract authority, and offsetting collections were represented in at least  one case study.

OMB budget data do not  systematically identify entitlement authority. To determine which of the  largest trust funds and other dedicated funds have entitlement authority,  we analyzed the authorizing statutes for our case study accounts and 10  additional accounts with the next largest gross outlays.
