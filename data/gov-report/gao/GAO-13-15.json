Within HHS, CMS oversees Medicaid, and ACF supports state child welfare agencies that coordinate health care for foster children.", "GAO was asked to provide information on children's mental health. This report examines (1) the use of psychotropic medications and other mental health services for children in Medicaid nationwide, and related CMS initiatives; (2) HHS information on the use of psychotropic medications and other mental health services for children in foster care nationwide, and related HHS initiatives; and (3) the amount HHS has invested in research on children's mental health.", "GAO analyzed data from HHS's MEPS --a national household survey on use of medical services--from 2007 through 2009 for children covered by Medicaid and private insurance.

MEPS data also showed that children in Medicaid took antipsychotic medications (a type of psychotropic medication that can help some children but has a risk of serious side effects) at a relatively low rate--1.3 percent of children--but that the rate for children in Medicaid was over twice the rate for privately insured children, which was 0.5 percent. In addition, MEPS data showed that most children whose emotions or behavior, as reported by their parent or guardian, indicated a potential need for a mental health service did not receive any services within the same year. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and many states have initiatives under way to help ensure that children receive appropriate mental health treatments. However, CMS's ability to monitor children's receipt of mental health services is limited because CMS does not collect information from states on whether children in Medicaid have received services for which they were referred. GAO recommended in 2011 that CMS identify options for collecting such data from state Medicaid programs. Findings in this report underscore the continued importance of CMS's monitoring of children's receipt of mental health services.", "HHS's Administration for Children and Families (ACF) reported that 18 percent of foster children were taking psychotropic medications at the time they were surveyed, although utilization varied widely by the child's living arrangement. ACF also reported that 30 percent of foster children who may have needed mental health services did not receive them in the previous 12 months. HHS agencies are taking steps to promote appropriate mental health treatments for foster children, such as by sending information to states on psychotropic medication oversight practices.", "HHS's National Institutes of Health spent an estimated $1.2 billion on over 1,200 children's mental health research projects during fiscal years 2008 through 2011. Most of the funding--$956 million--was awarded by the National Institute of Mental Health, with more research projects studying psychosocial therapies than psychotropic medications. Other HHS agencies spent about $16 million combined on children's mental health research during this period.", "HHS reviewed a draft of this report and provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Children with mental health conditions are among the country\u2019s most  vulnerable populations, and there are concerns about whether they have  access to the most appropriate kind of care for their conditions. Early  detection and treatment of childhood mental health conditions can  improve a child\u2019s symptoms and reduce potentially detrimental effects on  a child, such as difficulties with relationships, dropping out of school, and  involvement with the juvenile justice system. Children with mental health  conditions, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or  depression, can be treated with psychosocial therapies (sessions with a  provider designed to reduce symptoms and improve functioning);  psychotropic medication (medications that affect mood, thought, or  behavior); or a combination of both. Many of these children, however,  lack access to the treatments they need to help them manage or  overcome their emotional or behavioral problems. In addition, child  mental health advocates, providers, and researchers have expressed  concern about the increase in the prescribing of psychotropic medications  for children, in part because there is limited evidence available regarding  short- and long-term safety and efficacy for some types of medications,  particularly for combinations of medications. Mental health experts are  especially concerned about the recent increase in prescribing of  antipsychotic medications\u2014psychotropic medications developed to treat  conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder\u2014in part because  these medications can cause very serious side effects, such as rapid  weight gain and the development of diabetes.", "Concerns about access to appropriate mental health services and the  increased prescribing of psychotropic medications may be compounded  for children in Medicaid, the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program  (CHIP), and foster care\u2014children who may be at higher risk of mental  health conditions than other children. Children in foster care, most of  whom are eligible for Medicaid, are an especially vulnerable population  because often they have been subjected to traumatic experiences  involving abuse or neglect and they may suffer from multiple, serious  mental health conditions. Although state Medicaid programs are  generally required to cover services to screen children for mental health  problems and to provide treatment for any identified conditions, we  previously reported that it can be difficult for physicians to find mental  health specialists to whom they can refer children in Medicaid.for children in Medicaid and CHIP are also related to studies that have  shown that publicly insured children are prescribed psychotropic   Concerns  medications at higher rates than privately insured children. We reported  in 2011 that children in foster care take these medications at higher rates  than other children in Medicaid, and we recommended that HHS consider  issuing guidance to state Medicaid and child welfare agencies on best  practices for monitoring psychotropic medication prescriptions for foster  children.", "Several agencies in the Department of Health and Human Services  (HHS) have responsibilities related to children\u2019s mental health. The  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) oversees, and jointly  finances with the states, the Medicaid and CHIP programs, which provide  health coverage for low-income children. State Medicaid programs are  required by federal law to provide coverage for certain health services,  which may include mental health services, for most children through the  Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT)  benefit. The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) provides  funding for and oversees states\u2019 child welfare programs, which are  responsible for monitoring and coordinating mental health services for  foster children, among other things. The Substance Abuse and Mental  Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) works to increase the quality  and availability of mental health treatments, such as by awarding grants  that support the development of community-based services for children  with mental health conditions, including children in foster care. Other HHS  agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Food and Drug  Administration (FDA), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality  (AHRQ), and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),  conduct, fund, or review research that seeks to expand the knowledge of  children\u2019s mental health conditions and treatments.", "Because of your interest in children\u2019s access to appropriate mental health  treatments, you asked us to provide information on mental health  services, including medications, for children in Medicaid, CHIP, and foster  care nationwide and on the federal investment in children\u2019s mental health  research. This report examines (1) the use of psychotropic medications  and other mental health services by children nationwide in Medicaid and  CHIP, and related CMS initiatives; (2) HHS information on the use of  psychotropic medications and other mental health services by foster  children nationwide, and related HHS initiatives; and (3) the amount HHS  has invested in research to study children\u2019s mental health conditions and  treatments.", "To examine the use of psychotropic medications and other mental health  services by children in Medicaid and CHIP, we analyzed nationwide data  from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) from 2007 through  2009. We included children ages 0 through 20 who were enrolled in  Medicaid or CHIP for at least 10 months in a calendar year, excluding  children in foster care. Because MEPS does not differentiate between  children in Medicaid and children in CHIP, we could not report on these  programs separately. For the purposes of this report, we used the term  Medicaid to refer to both Medicaid and CHIP. We analyzed MEPS data  for privately insured children as a point of comparison. Specifically, we  examined annual rates of psychotropic medication use, numbers and  types of medications taken, and utilization of office-based mental health  services, such as visits to a psychiatrist or psychologist. We also  examined receipt of mental health services by children who had a  potential mental health need. To identify children with a potential mental  health need, MEPS employs a standardized psychometric scale designed  to measure emotional and behavioral impairment. Using this scale, we  identified the percentage of children whose emotions or behavior, as  reported by their parents, indicated a potential need for mental health  services. This measure does not indicate the level of treatment a child  might require; rather, it identifies the percentage of children whose  emotions or behavior indicated a need for, at a minimum, a mental health  evaluation. Estimates using MEPS may be conservative because the  survey excludes children in institutional settings, such as psychiatric  hospitals, who are likely to be high utilizers of psychotropic medications  and mental health services. In addition, MEPS relies on self-reporting by  parents for utilization of medications and services, which may be  understated because parents may be reluctant to report such information due to the stigma that can be associated with mental health conditions.We reviewed the MEPS survey instruments and methodology and  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. (See  app. I for more information about the methodology we used to analyze  MEPS data.) We also reviewed relevant literature on children\u2019s mental  health and interviewed CMS officials and state mental health program  directors to learn about their efforts to monitor prescribing of psychotropic  medications and to increase access to mental health services among  children.", "To examine HHS information on the use of psychotropic medications and  other mental health services by foster children nationwide, we reviewed  two reports published by ACF. Both reports presented the results of the  National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-being II (NSCAW II), a  nationally representative longitudinal survey of children ages 0 through   19 who were in contact with the child welfare system. The NSCAW II  surveys occurred in multiple phases during 2008 through 2011. One  report, published in November 2011, summarized NSCAW II data  collected during phase 1, from March 2008 through September 2009.  The second ACF report was a research brief on the use of psychotropic  medication by children in contact with the child welfare system, which was  published in 2012 and used NSCAW II data collected during phase 2,  from October 2009 through January 2011. The survey collected  information on children who either lived in out-of-home foster care  placements or remained in the care of their parents or relatives. For this  report, we considered children in foster care to be those who lived in out- of-home foster care placements\u2014that is, in nonrelative foster homes\u2014 formal kin care, group homes, or residential treatment centers. We  reported ACF\u2019s estimates of foster children\u2019s use of psychotropic  medications and of receipt of mental health services by foster children.  ACF\u2019s reports identified children with a potential mental health need by  selecting children whose scores were above a certain level on one of five  standardized psychometric scales that were used in NSCAW II and were  designed to measure emotional or behavioral problems. These scales  were the Child Behavior Checklist, which is based on caregiver reports;  the Youth Self-Report; the Teacher\u2019s Report Form; the Children\u2019s  Depression Inventory; and the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children.  Questions in these scales were asked of the child, caregiver, or teacher,  depending on the scale. We reviewed ACF\u2019s report on psychotropic  medication use to examine the extent to which the children ACF identified  as having a potential mental health need received any mental health  services within the past 12 months (or since the start of the child\u2019s living  arrangement, if less than 12 months). We also interviewed officials from  ACF, AHRQ, and SAMHSA and representatives of provider organizations  and mental health and child welfare advocacy groups to obtain  information on the challenges foster children face in receiving appropriate   Finally, to examine related HHS initiatives, we  mental health treatments.reviewed HHS documents and interviewed agency officials to obtain  information about HHS\u2019s activities to help states promote appropriate use  of mental health treatments for foster children.", "To describe HHS\u2019s investment in research to study children\u2019s mental  health conditions and treatments, we requested data on research  activities and interviewed officials from selected HHS agencies that  conduct or sponsor children\u2019s mental health research: NIH, FDA, AHRQ,  and CDC. We asked each agency for a list of research projects that  were conducted internally by agency staff or conducted by external  researchers and were funded by the agency for all or part of fiscal years  2008 through 2011. We used the following inclusion and exclusion  criteria for our analysis:  Include projects that tested children, as well as projects that tested  both children and adults, such as family studies.", "Exclude research involving animals, projects that primarily studied  substance abuse or pervasive developmental disorders such as  autism, and large-scale surveys examining the prevalence of mental  health conditions or mental health service utilization.", "Exclude grants that did not specifically fund research, such as grants  supporting student training or scientific conferences.", "NIH was unable to provide an agency-wide estimate of spending on  children\u2019s mental health research projects that met our criteria. Therefore  we requested data individually from the two institutes at NIH that,  according to agency officials, sponsor and conduct most of the children\u2019s  mental health research\u2014the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)  and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health &  Human Development (NICHD). We assessed the reliability of data from  NIMH and NICHD by selecting a sample of research projects from each  to determine whether they met our criteria. When some research projects  in the NIMH sample appeared not to meet our criteria, we examined the  primary research focus identified for each project. We then systematically  excluded all projects with a primary research focus that did not appear to  meet our criteria, such as schizophrenia in adults. On the basis of our  review of the NIMH and NICHD samples, we determined that the data  were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our report. Because other  institutes and centers at NIH may also have sponsored children\u2019s mental  health research, we have likely underestimated NIH\u2019s total investment.  We also determined that data from FDA, AHRQ, and CDC were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We also spoke with officials from  HHS agencies, representatives from provider and mental health advocacy  groups, and researchers to better understand research needs in  children\u2019s mental health.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2011 to December  2012 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

For example, according to the American Academy  of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), medications used to treat  ADHD can reduce symptoms such as hyperactivity in children, as well as  improve their attention and increase their ability to get along with others.  These medications have been widely tested in children and are generally  considered safe; however, ADHD medications have also been associated  with side effects ranging from mild to serious, such as sleeplessness, loss  of appetite, tics, agitation, hallucinations, liver problems, and suicidal  thoughts.", "Research has shown that foster children take psychotropic medications at  much higher rates than other children covered by Medicaid. For example,  we previously reported that while about 5 to 10 percent of nonfoster  children in five states\u2019 Medicaid programs took a psychotropic medication  in 2008, rates among children in foster care were about 20 to   39 percent. The use of five or more medications concomitantly (that is,  at the same time), while rare, was also higher among children in foster  care. We reported that several factors may have contributed to the  higher utilization rates among foster children, such as the increased  prevalence and greater severity of mental health conditions among these  children.", "Studies have shown that rates of psychotropic medication use among all  children have increased. For example, one study found that the  percentage of children\u2019s doctor visits involving psychotropic medications  increased by 75 percent from 1996 to 2007\u2014from 6 percent to about   11 percent. Among these visits, those involving two or more  medications rose from about 14 percent to about 20 percent. Experts  have identified a number of potential factors that could account for the  increased use of psychotropic medications. For example, AACAP\u2019s  guidelines on the use of psychotropic medications for children identified  explanations such as the expanding evidence base demonstrating the  efficacy of these medications for children and the efforts of  pharmaceutical companies to market drugs to prescribers and  consumers.", "Pharmacy benefit managers are firms that administer prescription drug benefits on  behalf of health insurance plans.", "Furthermore, some studies found that the prescribing of antipsychotics  was higher among publicly insured children than among privately insured  children, and even higher among foster children. One study found that  children enrolled in Medicaid were prescribed antipsychotic medications  at over four times the rate of children with private insurance in 2004. In  addition, AHRQ funded a study of antipsychotic prescribing based on  Medicaid claims from 13 states, which found that utilization of  antipsychotics in 2007 was much higher among foster children than  among nonfoster children in Medicaid\u201412.4 percent on average versus  1.4 percent, respectively. Prescribing of antipsychotics is a concern for  CMS and state Medicaid programs not only because of safety issues, but  also because these medications are costly. They represented the single  largest drug expenditure category for Medicaid in 2007\u2014over   $2.8 billion.", "One reason for particular concern about growing use of antipsychotics  and other psychotropic medications in children is that manufacturers do  not always test medications for use in children. Manufacturers are  responsible for conducting clinical trials and demonstrating their products\u2019  safety and efficacy to FDA, which is responsible for making decisions  about whether and how medications can be marketed for children and for  ensuring that manufacturers incorporate information from pediatric clinical  trials into medication labels when required. However, because children  are a small part of the overall population and physicians can prescribe  medications off-label to children even if the medications have been tested  only in adults, manufacturers may lack economic incentives to conduct  trials with children. According to a recent analysis by FDA scientists,  fewer than half of all medications were adequately labeled for pediatric  use in 2009. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) and the  Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) address testing of medications in  children by authorizing FDA to provide incentives for or require  manufacturers to conduct pediatric studies in certain circumstances.

According to ACF,  46 percent of children investigated by child welfare services came to a  state\u2019s attention primarily because of a report of neglect, and 27 percent  had experienced physical abuse as the most serious form of recorded  maltreatment. Other children are referred when their own behaviors or  conditions are beyond the control of their families or they pose a threat to  themselves or the community. Children in foster care can experience  traumatic stress due to maltreatment experienced at home as well as the  trauma of being removed from their homes. Trauma significantly  increases the risk of mental health problems, difficulties with social  relationships and behavior, physical illness, and poor school  performance. Furthermore, child mental health experts have stated that  the traumatic stress symptoms foster children may experience are often  the same as symptoms that can indicate other mental health conditions,  which may lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatments.", "When children are taken into foster care, the state\u2019s child welfare agency  becomes responsible for determining where the child should live and  providing the child with needed supports. The agency may place the  foster child in the home of a relative, with unrelated foster parents, or in a  group home or residential treatment center, depending on the child\u2019s  needs. The agency is responsible for arranging needed services,  including mental health services. Federal officials, providers, and child  and mental health advocacy groups have identified several factors that  create challenges for foster children in receiving appropriate mental  health services. Foster children can experience frequent changes in their  living placements, which can lead to a lack of continuity in mental health  care, and new providers may not have the medical history of the patient.This lack of stability can lead to treatment disruptions and can increase  the number of medications prescribed. Coordinating mental health care  for foster children may be difficult for both the medical provider and the  case worker because multiple people are making decisions on the child\u2019s  behalf. In addition, caseworkers in child welfare agencies may have large  caseloads, making it difficult for them to ensure that foster children\u2019s  mental health needs are being met.", "As a condition of receiving federal child welfare grant funding, state child  welfare agencies must annually submit plans to ACF that, among other  things, address the mental and other health needs of foster children.

As part of their June 2012 Annual Progress and Service  Reports to ACF, states provided information on their plans for monitoring  psychotropic medication prescribing and treatment of emotional trauma  for foster children. Prior to the Child Improvement Act, many states had  already implemented policies and practices regarding prescribing  psychotropic medications for foster children, such as issuing written  guidelines for prescribers, collecting data to monitor prescribing, requiring  informed consent from relevant parties before filling a prescription, and  requiring consultation with a mental health specialist for prescriptions  exceeding certain dosage thresholds."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Children in Medicaid Took Psychotropic Medications at a Higher Rate Than Those with Private Insurance, and Most Children in Medicaid with a Potential Mental Health Need Did Not Receive Services", "paragraphs": ["On average, 6.2 percent of noninstitutionalized children in Medicaid  nationwide took psychotropic medications during a calendar year from  2007 through 2009, and 21 percent of those children took an  antipsychotic medication.

The agency also told us it plans to issue an  Informational Bulletin on children\u2019s behavioral health screening, referral,  and treatment, which it will disseminate to state Medicaid agencies and  others in early 2013.", "As required under federal law, states annually submit data to CMS on the  provision of services under EPSDT, such as the number of children  referred for additional services as a result of checkups and screenings.  These data may include referrals for mental health services for children  found to have mental health needs during screenings. We previously  reported that CMS does not impose requirements beyond this federal law  and, accordingly, does not collect information from states on whether  children received the services for which they were referred, which limits  CMS\u2019s ability to monitor whether children in Medicaid are receiving the  services they need. We recommended that CMS work with states to  identify options for collecting such information. CMS officials told us that  the agency had contracted for a study examining options for collecting  data from state Medicaid programs on EPSDT referrals; the study  concluded that states were unlikely to be able to produce accurate  information on referred services using existing data sources. The officials  also said that, as of September 2012, CMS was in the process of  identifying alternative approaches for collecting data on children\u2019s receipt  of treatment services, such as analyzing national survey data. However,  the alternatives currently under consideration would not produce the data  from all states that would enable CMS to monitor at the state level  children\u2019s receipt of treatment services for which they were referred  through Medicaid.", "States have also made efforts to increase children\u2019s access to mental  health services. Because many children receive mental health services  from nonspecialists, 28 states have programs to facilitate consultation  between primary care providers and child psychiatrists. For example,  under Washington state\u2019s Second Opinions program, psychiatrists review  Medicaid psychotropic prescriptions that exceed certain safety  thresholds\u2014such as dose or use of combinations of medications\u2014and  provide a second opinion to the prescribing physician. An evaluation of  Washington\u2019s Second Opinions program and its Partnership Access  Line\u2014the state\u2019s voluntary program for physicians seeking child  psychiatry consultations\u2014found that such consultations are cost-effective  and that they have resulted in an increase in referrals for psychosocial  therapy and a decrease in prescribing of antipsychotic medications.  Similarly, Massachusetts\u2019s program, the Massachusetts Child Psychiatry  Access Program, has been found to increase the ability of primary care  providers to treat or refer their patients with mental health needs. In a  survey of primary care providers participating in the Massachusetts  program, 63 percent reported that they were usually able to meet the  needs of their psychiatric patients, an increase from only 8 percent of  providers before they enrolled in the program.", "Some states have also begun to integrate mental health services into  primary care settings in an effort to increase access to mental health  services. For example, through the \u201cState Option to Provide Health  Homes for Enrollees with Chronic Conditions,\u201d authorized under the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, states have the option to  implement person-centered health care delivery systems, known as  health homes.render comprehensive services for individuals with chronic conditions,  must address mental health and substance abuse treatment needs.

While some children receive highly effective  mental health treatments, our findings suggest that many children,  including some in Medicaid and in foster care, may not be receiving  appropriate treatment. Our analysis of national survey data indicates that  concerns raised by providers, children\u2019s advocates, and others about  potentially inappropriate prescribing of psychotropic drugs for some  children and a lack of needed mental health services for some children  may be warranted. Antipsychotic medications are of particular concern in  light of the very serious side effects they can have for children, the limited  understanding of their long-term effects, and their high cost. Children in  Medicaid and in foster care are prescribed these medications at higher  rates than other children. Furthermore, most children in Medicaid and  many children in foster care with potential mental health needs do not  receive mental health services that could help them. Differing rates of  medication among the groups of children do not necessarily represent a  problem, because potential factors beyond the scope of this review could  help explain the differences. Nonetheless, these findings do suggest that  the recent federal and state initiatives to improve monitoring and  oversight are appropriate, and that continued assessment of the  prescribing of psychotropic medications to vulnerable populations and of  the receipt of mental health services is important. Initiatives such as  CMS\u2019s National EPSDT Improvement Workgroup and plans to help states  improve their monitoring efforts, as well as the ACF-led interagency  workgroup on the use of psychotropic medications for foster children,  have the potential to help ensure that vulnerable children in Medicaid and  foster care have access to effective mental health treatments that are  appropriate for their mental health conditions. We recommended in 2011  that CMS identify options to collect information from states on whether  children in Medicaid receive the services for which they are referred  through their EPSDT-mandated screenings and check-ups, which would  include referrals for specialty care such as mental health services. CMS  has begun to explore options to address this recommendation, but it has  not yet identified ways to systematically collect such data from state  Medicaid programs.
