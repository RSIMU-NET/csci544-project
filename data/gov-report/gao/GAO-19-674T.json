Seven of the nine agencies have taken some actions to educate and communicate to staff about their policies, consistent with the 2007 America COMPETES Act. However, the Office of Fossil Energy (FE), which follows the Department of Energy's (DOE) policy, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have not taken action.", "Providing oversight. Eight of the nine agencies have a designated official, or the equivalent, to oversee implementation of their scientific integrity policies. However, FE does not have such an official because DOE has not appointed one and currently has no plans or timeframe to do so, although DOE policy states that DOE will appoint an official for oversight.", "Monitoring and evaluating implementation. Four of the nine agencies have monitored and evaluated implementation of their scientific integrity policies, consistent with federal standards that call for such control activities. However, FE, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), NIST, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) have not undertaken such activities.", "Seven of the nine agencies have specific, documented procedures for identifying and addressing alleged violations of their scientific integrity policies. Although the details of agencies' procedures vary, they generally include the steps shown below. However, two agencies\u2014FE, following DOE's policy, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\u2014do not have documented procedures for identifying and addressing alleged violations. A 2009 presidential memo on scientific integrity states that agencies should have procedures to identify and address instances in which the scientific process or the integrity of scientific and technological information may be compromised. Without procedures, FE and NASA do not have assurance that their staff understand how to report allegations and that investigations are conducted consistently."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our report on federal agencies\u2019  establishment of scientific integrity policies.", "As you know, allegations of agency officials inappropriately influencing  science have been reported in the federal government. For example, the  Union of Concerned Scientists, in 2004 and 2008, and the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration\u2019s (NASA) Office of Inspector  General (OIG), in 2008, reported instances in which political influences or  other agency actions adversely affected the integrity of scientific  information. More recently, the Union of Concerned Scientists surveyed  federal scientists in 2018, and many respondents reported censorship of  their work, especially work related to climate change.", "In 2007, Congress passed the America Creating Opportunities to  Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science  (COMPETES) Act, which required the Office of Science and Technology  Policy (OSTP) to develop an overarching set of scientific integrity  principles. According to the act, these principles should ensure the  communication and open exchange of data and results from research  conducted by federal scientists and prevent the intentional or  unintentional suppression or distortion of such research findings. OSTP  issued guidance, most recently in 2010, to the heads of executive  departments and agencies on implementing scientific integrity policies.  OSTP\u2019s guidance states that scientific integrity is important because,  among other things, scientific and technological information is often a  significant contributor to the development of sound public policy. In  response to the 2010 guidance, 24 federal departments and agencies  developed scientific integrity policies.", "My testimony today summarizes the findings and recommendations from  our April 2019 report. Accordingly, this testimony addresses the extent to  which selected agencies (1) have scientific integrity policies that are  consistent with federal guidance, (2) have taken actions to achieve the  objectives of their scientific integrity policies, and (3) have procedures for  identifying and addressing alleged violations of their scientific integrity  policies.", "For all three objectives, we selected a nongeneralizable sample of nine  agencies\u2014seven agencies from cabinet-level departments and two  independent agencies. We selected these nine agencies because they  are civilian federal agencies that conduct scientific research, employ  federal scientists, and were among the federal agencies with the greatest  levels of funding for intramural research (i.e., research conducted by  federal agencies in their own facilities). Our findings are not generalizable  to all agencies but provide illustrative examples of these agencies\u2019  scientific integrity policies and their actions to implement those policies.  The agencies we selected are the", "Agricultural Research Service (ARS) in the U.S. Department of  Agriculture (USDA);", "Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), an independent agency;", "Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the Department of  Transportation (DOT);", "Office of Fossil Energy (FE) in the Department of Energy (DOE);", "National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS);", "NASA, an independent agency;", "National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the  Department of Commerce (Commerce);", "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in", "U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in the Department of the Interior.", "We reviewed the nine agencies\u2019 scientific integrity policies, procedures,  and related documents. Some agencies we selected do not have agency- specific scientific integrity policies or procedures because they follow  department-level policies or procedures. In those cases, we included the  department\u2019s policy and procedures in our analyses. For our reporting  purposes, we describe an agency as having a policy or procedure even in  those cases where the agency is following a department-level policy or  procedure.", "To determine the extent to which the selected agencies have policies that  are consistent with federal guidance on scientific integrity, we compared  the selected agencies\u2019 scientific integrity policies and supporting  documents to two of the four principles identified in OSTP\u2019s guidance: (1)  foundations of scientific integrity in government and (2) professional  development of government scientists and engineers. We focused on  these two principles because they most closely align with scientific  integrity issues related to political influence. To determine the extent to  which selected agencies have taken actions to achieve the objectives of  their scientific integrity policies, we compared agencies\u2019 scientific integrity  policies and actions against Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government related to communicating information to staff, providing  oversight, and monitoring and evaluating performance. To determine  the extent to which the selected agencies have procedures for identifying  and addressing alleged violations of their scientific integrity policies, we  compared the agencies\u2019 procedures to guidance on scientific integrity  policies and federal standards for internal control. Additional information  on our scope and methodology is available in our report. The work on  which this testimony is based was conducted from March 2018 to April  2019 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Selected Agencies Have Scientific Integrity Policies That Are Generally Consistent with Federal Guidance", "paragraphs": ["In our April 2019 report, we found that all nine of the selected agencies  have policies that are generally consistent with OSTP\u2019s guidance for the  principles of scientific integrity that we reviewed: foundations of scientific  integrity in government and professional development of government  scientists and engineers. OSTP\u2019s guidance describes several  components for each of these principles, which the selected agencies  addressed either (1) through their scientific integrity policies, (2) in related  policies, or (3) through related actions. For example, when addressing the  components of foundations of scientific integrity in government, NOAA\u2019s  scientific integrity policy states that the agency will ensure the free flow of  scientific information online and in other formats, consistent with privacy  and classification standards, and in keeping with other Commerce and  NOAA policies. In another example, NASA\u2019s scientific integrity policy  states that NASA facilitates the free flow of scientific and technological  information among scientists and engineers, between NASA staff and the  scientific and technical community, and between NASA employees and  the public. The policy goes on to cite additional NASA policies on  dissemination of information and public access to data.", "Similarly, we found that all nine selected agencies addressed all of the  components of the principle professional development of government  scientists and engineers. For example, EPA\u2019s policy states that the  agency encourages publication and presentation of research findings in  peer-reviewed, professional, or scholarly journals and at professional  meetings. NIST\u2019s scientific integrity policy states that the agency supports  scientists\u2019 full participation in professional or scholarly societies,  committees, task forces, and other specialized bodies of professional  societies, with proper legal review and approval. The policy goes on to  cite separate NIST guidance for staff on how to seek approval for  memberships and participation in professional organizations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "All of the Selected Agencies Took Some Action to Achieve Policy Objectives, but Opportunities Exist for Furthering Those Objectives", "paragraphs": ["We found in our April 2019 report that the nine selected agencies have  taken some actions to help achieve the objectives of their scientific  integrity policies in the three areas we reviewed\u2014communicating  information to staff, providing oversight, and monitoring and evaluating  performance.", "First, according to our analysis, seven of the nine selected agencies have  taken some actions to educate and communicate to staff about their  scientific integrity policies, and two have not. Specifically, FE and NIST  have not provided scientific integrity training for staff, according to  officials, or taken other actions to promote their scientific integrity policies  with staff. Under the 2007 America COMPETES Act, civilian agencies  that conduct scientific research are, among other things, required to  widely communicate and readily make accessible to all employees their  scientific integrity policies and procedures. According to FE and NIST  officials, the agencies made their policies available to staff on their  websites and believed no additional actions were needed. By taking  action to educate and communicate their scientific integrity policies to  staff through, for example, regular training, these agencies would have  better assurance that employees have the information, skills, and  competencies they need to help achieve agency scientific integrity  objectives. We recommended the Secretary of Energy and Director of  NIST take action to educate and communicate the agencies\u2019 polices to  staff through, for example, regular training. In DOE\u2019s written comments on  a draft of our report, reproduced in our final report, the department  explained that it will designate a scientific integrity official to be  responsible for leading and coordinating with other offices across DOE to  develop measures to educate and communicate to staff about scientific  integrity policies. In Commerce\u2019s written comments, reproduced in in our  final report, NIST identified ways it plans to provide training to its staff.", "Second, we found that eight of the nine selected agencies have  designated scientific integrity officials, or the equivalent, who are  responsible for overseeing the agencies\u2019 implementation of their scientific  integrity policies. FE, which follows DOE\u2019s policy, does not have a  scientific integrity official or the equivalent. DOE\u2019s scientific integrity policy  states that the Secretary of Energy will designate a scientific integrity  official for the department. DOE officials explained that the scientific  integrity official has not been designated because the scientific integrity  policy was implemented in January 2017, as the administration was  changing, and that the current Secretary has not yet designated a  scientific integrity official. We recommended the Secretary of Energy  should establish steps and a time frame for designating a scientific  integrity official to oversee the department\u2019s scientific integrity activities. In  DOE\u2019s written comments on a draft of our report, reproduced in our final  report, the department concurred with our recommendation and estimated  that it would address the recommendation by the end of 2019.", "Third, we found in our April 2019 report that four of the nine selected  agencies\u2014ARS, EPA, NASA, and NIH\u2014monitor and evaluate the  performance of their activities under their scientific integrity policies, or  have plans to do so. The remaining five agencies\u2014FAA, FE, NIST,  NOAA, and USGS\u2014have, for different reasons, not done so. Standards  for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management  should design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks,  which may include establishing activities to monitor performance  measures and indicators. By establishing mechanisms to effectively  monitor the implementation of their scientific integrity policies, agencies  may be better positioned to evaluate and measure whether their scientific  integrity policies are achieving their objectives and, where necessary,  improve their implementation.", "We recommended in our April 2019 report that the five agencies develop  mechanisms to regularly monitor and evaluate implementation of their  scientific integrity policies, including mechanisms to remediate identified  deficiencies and make improvements where necessary. All five agencies  agreed with our recommendation and responded as follows:  In a May 2019 letter from DOT, the department identified several  mechanisms it plans to implement by the end of March 2020.", "In DOE\u2019s written comments on a draft of our report, the department  said that its scientific integrity official will have the responsibility to  lead in developing procedures to monitor and evaluate  implementation of DOE\u2019s policy.", "In Commerce\u2019s written comments, NIST stated that, beginning in  fiscal year 2019, the agency will review implementation of its policy at  least annually and make recommendations to the Director of NIST as  to whether any improvements are needed.", "In Commerce\u2019s written comments, NOAA stated that it will identify  additional metrics for monitoring and evaluating its policy.", "The Department of the Interior\u2019s written comments stated that the  department plans to implement a biennial scientific integrity survey of  USGS employees, beginning in 2020, to gauge scientific integrity  policy awareness and effectiveness at USGS, among other things."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most of the Selected Agencies Have Procedures for Addressing Alleged Violations of Scientific Integrity Policies, but Two Do Not, Raising Questions about the Consistency of Their Investigations", "paragraphs": ["Seven of the nine selected agencies\u2014ARS, EPA, FAA, NIH, NIST,  NOAA, and USGS\u2014have specific, documented procedures for identifying  and addressing alleged violations of their scientific integrity policies.  Although the details of agencies\u2019 procedures may vary, the procedures  generally include five basic steps: (1) report allegation, (2) screen  allegation, (3) investigate allegation, (4) respond to violation, and (5)  appeal decision (see fig. 1).", "In contrast, two of the nine selected agencies\u2014FE and NASA\u2014do not  have specific, documented procedures for identifying and addressing  alleged violations of their scientific integrity policies. In March 2009, the  President issued a memorandum on scientific integrity that states that  each agency should have in place procedures to identify and address  instances in which the scientific process or the integrity of scientific and  technological information may be compromised. FE, which follows  DOE\u2019s scientific integrity policy, does not have specific procedures  because DOE has not established any. DOE and FE officials said staff  can report allegations to a supervisor, the whistleblower ombudsperson,  or the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC). Similarly, NASA officials  said employees can report allegations through their chain of command,  such as to a supervisor, for investigation on a case-by-case basis.  However, without documented procedures for identifying and addressing  alleged violations of their scientific integrity policies, DOE and NASA do  not have assurance that all staff have a clear understanding of how to  report allegations and that investigations will be conducted consistently.", "We recommended the Secretary of Energy and Administrator of NASA  develop documented procedures for identifying and addressing alleged  violations of their scientific integrity policies. In DOE\u2019s written comments  on a draft of our report, the department stated that it will be the  responsibility of the scientific integrity official to lead, and coordinate with  other elements of the department, in developing procedures for identifying  and addressing alleged violations of its scientific integrity policy and  estimated completing actions in June 2020. In written comments from  NASA, the agency stated that it will develop documented procedures for  identifying and addressing alleged violations of its policy and estimated  completion by October 2020.", "Chairwoman Stevens and Chairwoman Sherrill, Ranking Member Baird  and Ranking Member Norman, and Members of the Subcommittees, this  concludes my prepared statement.
