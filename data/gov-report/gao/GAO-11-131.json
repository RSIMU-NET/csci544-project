In August, 2010, the Secretary of Defense called for a review of DOD operations and activities to identify opportunities to decrease costs in order to free funds to support other DOD priorities. The Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans' Affairs asked GAO to determine the extent to which the European Command (EUCOM) (1) estimates and reports the total cost of DOD's installations in Europe and (2) has defined methods for evaluating posture alternatives and including the views of interagency stakeholders in its posture planning process. To address these objectives, GAO assessed DOD plans and guidance, reviewed planning efforts in EUCOM, and collected obligations data from the military services for the military construction, family housing, and operation and maintenance appropriations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD posture planning guidance does not require EUCOM to include comprehensive cost data in its theater posture plan and, as a result, DOD lacks critical information that could be used by decision makers as they deliberate posture requirements. DOD guidance requires that theater posture plans provide specific information on, and estimate the military construction costs for, installations in a combatant commander's area of responsibility. However, this guidance does not require EUCOM to report the total cost to operate and maintain installations in Europe. GAO analysis shows that of the approximately $17.2 billion obligated by the services to support installations in Europe from 2006 through 2009, approximately $13 billion (78 percent) was for operation and maintenance costs. Several factors--such as the possibility of keeping four Army brigades in Europe instead of two--could impact future costs. DOD is drafting guidance to require more comprehensive cost estimates for posture initiatives; however, these revisions will not require commanders to report costs, unrelated to posture initiatives, for DOD installations. GAO's prior work has demonstrated that comprehensive cost information is critical to support decisions on funding and affordability. Until DOD requires the combatant commands to compile and report comprehensive cost data in their posture plans, DOD and Congress will be limited in their abilities to make fully informed decisions regarding DOD's posture in Europe. EUCOM has developed an approach to compile posture requirements, but it does not have clearly defined methods for evaluating posture alternatives or routinely incorporating the views of interagency stakeholders. EUCOM has taken several steps to assign responsibilities for developing its posture plan and established an Executive Council to deliberate posture issues and work with the service component commands, but the process of developing a theater posture plan is relatively new and is not yet clearly defined and codified in command guidance. While EUCOM's steps to date have improved its ability to communicate with stakeholders and resolve conflicting views on posture issues, it has not been clearly defined and codified in command guidance. Furthermore, it does not provide for the analysis of costs and benefits, because the combatant commander has not been required to include such analysis in developing the theater posture plan. In addition, the Interagency Partnering Directorate--which was established by the EUCOM commander to improve interagency coordination within the command--has been included in the Executive Council, but EUCOM has not defined how interagency representatives can regularly participate in ongoing posture planning activities. As a result of these weaknesses in EUCOM's posture planning approach, the command is limited in its ability to consider and evaluate the cost of posture in conjunction with the strategic benefits it provides, and it may not be fully leveraging interagency perspectives as it defines future posture requirements."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD revise posture planning guidance to require comprehensive estimates of posture costs and provide for consistent analysis of posture alternatives, and that EUCOM clarify its posture planning process and methods to regularly obtain interagency perspectives.

Since that time, DOD has  adjusted its global posture plans. For example, in February, 2010, DOD  announced in the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) that it would halt a  planned move of two Army brigades out of Europe while the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization Strategic Concept is being reviewed.", "In addition, the 2010 QDR highlights the importance of periodically  assessing and tailoring global defense posture in light of continued  globalization and enduring transnational threats. In it DOD indicates that  defense posture will continuously adapt to the dynamic world  environment, and ongoing assessments of national interests, military  requirements, and the strategic environment should guide U.S. global  defense posture planning. In addition, in August 2010, amid growing  budgetary pressures, the Secretary of Defense called on military leaders to  consider the affordability of programs in developing future plans, with  particular emphasis on reducing overhead costs. The Secretary of Defense  seeks a $100 billion reduction in overhead costs over the next 5 years and  froze the size of combatant commands and required zero-based reviews of  their staffing and organizations.", "In the 2010 QDR, DOD identified global posture as consisting of (1) forces  (forward-stationed and rotationally deployed), capabilities, and  equipment; (2) overseas infrastructure and facilities; and (3) international  agreements with allies and key partners that may address issues such as  access, transit, and the framework under which U.S. military personnel  operate in a foreign country.

Those reports contain a number of  recommendations to improve DOD\u2019s management of these efforts and the  information that is made available about them to the executive branch and  congressional committees. In many cases, DOD has agreed with our  recommendations and has taken actions to implement them. A list of these  related products is included at the end of this report.", "For each of our objectives, we contacted and interviewed appropriate  officials at various offices within the Office of the Secretary of Defense;  Headquarters offices in the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force;  Headquarters, U.S. European Command; and related Army, Navy, and Air  Force service component commands. In addition, to determine the extent  to which EUCOM estimates and reports the total cost of posture in  Europe, we assessed the information included in the 2009 DOD Global  Defense Posture Report to Congress and the 2009 and 2010 EUCOM  theater posture plans. We requested and obtained data from the  Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force and their EUCOM service  component commands, on posture funding requirements and obligations  for fiscal years 2006-2015. To assess the reliability of the cost data, we  reviewed data system documentation and obtained information on internal  controls for those systems. We determined that the cost data we received  were reliable for the purposes of this report. To determine the extent to  which EUCOM has clearly defined methods for evaluating posture  alternatives and included the views of interagency stakeholders, we  reviewed management practices established by the GAO Cost Estimating  and Assessment Guide and DOD and military service guidance to inform  our audit. Additionally, we reviewed DOD and service guidance on  completing economic analyses and analyses of alternatives, and DOD  guidance on collaborating with other government agencies. We conducted  this performance audit from September 2009 through December 2010 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.

The Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force have key  roles in making decisions on where to locate their forces when they are  not otherwise employed or deployed by order of the Secretary of Defense  or assigned to a combatant command. In addition, the military  departments allocate budgetary resources to construct, maintain, and  repair buildings, structures, and utilities and to acquire the real property or  interests in real property necessary to carry out their responsibilities. All  of these entities play significant roles in preparing the detailed plans and  providing the resources that the combatant commands need to execute  operations in support of their missions and goals.", "EUCOM\u2019s area of responsibility covers all of Europe, large portions of  Asia, parts of the Middle East, and the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans.

DOD also organizes  multiple sites under a single installation. For example, the Air Force base  in Kaiserslautern, Germany is comprised of 45 sites that vary in terms of  the number of personnel, number of buildings, and square footage. This  base includes large sites like Ramstein Air Base and smaller sites like the  Breitenbach radar site. To develop common terminology for posture  planning, DOD has identified three types of installations that reflect the  large-to-small scale of DOD\u2019s enduring overseas posture-\u2014main operating  bases, forward operating sites, and cooperative security locations.", "Main operating bases are defined as overseas installations with relatively  large numbers of permanently stationed operating forces and robust  infrastructure that provide enduring family support facilities.", "DOD defines forward operating sites as scaleable installations intended for  rotational use by operating forces, rather than supporting permanently  stationed forces. Because they are scaleable, they may have a large  capacity that can be adapted to provide support for combat operations,  and therefore, DOD populations at these locations can vary greatly,  depending on how they are used at any given time.", "Cooperative security locations are overseas installations with little or no  permanent U.S. military presence, maintained with periodic service,  contractor, or host-nation support. As with forward operating sites, DOD  populations at these locations can vary greatly, depending on how they are  used at any given time.", "The number of sites located in EUCOM\u2019s area of responsibility has  decreased as the post-Cold War security environment has changed; in  1990, the Army alone had over 850 sites throughout Europe.

The Secretary of Defense then provides corresponding  strategic direction through the National Defense Strategy. Furthermore,  the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff provides guidance to the military  through the National Military Strategy. On specific matters, such as global  defense posture, DOD has developed new guidance in numerous  documents, principally the 2008 Guidance for Employment of the Force  and the 2008 Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan. The Guidance for  Employment of the Force consolidates and integrates planning guidance  related to operations and other military activities, while the Joint Strategic  Capabilities Plan implements the strategic policy direction provided in the  Guidance for the Employment of the Force and tasks combatant  commanders with developing theater campaign, contingency, and posture  plans that are consistent with the Guidance for Employment of the Force.", "The theater campaign plan translates strategic objectives to facilitate the  development of operational and contingency plans, while the theater  posture plan provides an overview of posture requirements to support  those plans and identifies major ongoing and new posture initiatives,  including current and planned military construction requirements.

These Navy officials commented that evaluations of posture at  the combatant command level could potentially lead to further  opportunities to gain greater efficiencies in posture investments made by  the military services.", "Our work has shown that decision makers should complete comparative  analysis of competing options that considers not only the life-cycle costs  but also quantifiable and unquantifiable benefits. This evaluative  information helps them make decisions about the programs they  oversee\u2014information that tells them whether, and in what important  ways, a program is working or not working, and why. In addition, DOD  and Army guidance related to economic analyses to support military  construction projects or the acquisition of real property indicates that  reasonable alternatives should be considered when contemplating such  new projects. For example, DOD Instruction 7041.3, which applies to  decisions about acquisition of real property, indicates that such analyses  should address alternatives that consider the availability of existing  facilities and the estimated costs and benefits of the alternatives, among  other factors.", "Officials from EUCOM\u2019s Strategy Implementation Branch stated that the  theater posture planning process is a new and emerging process driven by  recent changes to the Guidance for Employment of the Force and the Joint  Strategic Capabilities Plan. While they agreed with our assessment that  total posture costs should be part of any analysis of alternative courses of  action, they stated the EUCOM command staff would have to rely on the  service component commands to complete this type of analysis.

The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review  suggests that building partner capacity with efforts to improve the  collective capabilities and performance of DOD and its partners will be a  key mission area to support the objective of rebalancing the force. In  March 2010, the EUCOM commander, in written testimony provided to the  House and the Senate Armed Services Committees, indicated that building  partnership and partner capacity is the command\u2019s highest priority. DOD  recognizes that building partner capacities and developing global defense  posture require close collaboration with allies and partners abroad and  with key counterparts at home, principally the civilian departments  responsible for diplomacy and development. In addition, our prior work  demonstrates that leading organizations involve stakeholders as they  develop plans and requirements. The inclusion of stakeholders early and  often can test and provide critical feedback on the validity of the  assumptions made during a planning process.", "To enhance EUCOM\u2019s ability to coordinate with other government  agencies, the EUCOM commander established the Interagency Partnering  Directorate in October 2009. As of November 2010, the directorate was  comprised of approximately 30 staff\u20146 of whom were representatives  from the Departments of State, Energy, and Treasury; Immigration and  Customs Enforcement; Customs and Border Protection; and the Drug  Enforcement Agency. According to the Deputy Director, discussions are  underway to add representatives from the Department of Justice and the  U.S. Agency for International Development.", "Despite the priority given to building partner capacity, and the recognized  need to closely collaborate with non-DOD agencies and organizations to  plan for and conduct those missions, the Interagency Partnering  Directorate was not integral in the development of the 2010 EUCOM  Theater Posture Plan. According to a senior directorate official, the  directorate was not fully involved in the development of the theater  posture plan because the organization was relatively new, and they are  still trying to determine how this directorate can best plug into the various  planning and other functions within the command.", "Similarly, a Strategy Implementation Branch official involved in the  development of the theater posture plans commented that although  EUCOM has been successful in bringing in interagency officials to the  command, and has included the Interagency Partnering Directorate on the  Executive Council, it has not defined how the interagency representatives  can best participate in ongoing posture planning activities. According to  that Strategy Implementation Branch official, EUCOM has not defined how  it will routinely coordinate with the interagency community or how the  interagency representatives can best support ongoing posture planning  efforts. As a result, EUCOM officials involved in posture planning may not  have full visibility into the activities of non-DOD agencies and  organizations that could utilize DOD infrastructure and the interagency  community may not be fully aware of the opportunities to leverage  existing DOD facilities.", "Without guidance from the EUCOM Commander that clarifies the roles  and responsibilities of the Interagency Partnering Directorate related to  posture planning, and establishes a process through which interagency  perspectives can be routinely obtained as posture plans are developed,  EUCOM is limited in its ability to leverage DOD\u2019s interagency partners\u2019  expertise when developing its posture plans and may miss opportunities to  fully leverage its posture investments to support a whole-of-government  approach to missions and activities for building partner capacities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The nation\u2019s long-term fiscal challenges have led DOD to examine the cost  of its operations, including costs associated with its overseas network of  infrastructure and facilities. DOD and EUCOM officials are taking positive  steps to improve their posture planning efforts, but actions to date do not  fully address posture cost and interagency issues. DOD is in the process of  revising its Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan, but the draft revisions do not  require combatant commanders to include comprehensive information on  the cost to maintain existing locations, or to address the need for  analyzing the cost and benefits of posture alternatives. Without further  revisions to the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan to address this lack of  focus on the total cost of posture and analysis of alternatives, DOD\u2019s  posture planning process and reports will continue to lack complete  information on the financial commitments and funding liabilities  associated with DOD\u2019s posture, and potential opportunities to obtain  greater cost efficiencies may not be identified. In addition, since EUCOM  is taking steps to address posture matters and is developing guidance for  identifying and resolving posture issues within the command, it has an  opportunity to use this guidance to clearly define and codify a process for  how the theater posture plan is to be drafted, to establish approaches to  collect and analyze comprehensive cost information and address  affordability issues, and to regularly obtain the perspectives of relevant  agencies throughout the posture planning process. Without such guidance,  EUCOM will remain limited in its ability to analyze posture alternatives  and collaborate with interagency partners when developing its posture  requirements.

DOD\u2019s response appeared to acknowledge  that understanding the full cost of posture is an important consideration as  DOD deliberates decisions on current and future posture requirements,  and the actions it has taken or plans to take should provide a greater  understanding of DOD posture costs. However, we believe some  additional steps are warranted to fully address our recommendations.  Technical comments were provided separately and incorporated as  appropriate. The department\u2019s written comments are reprinted in  appendix III.", "DOD agreed with our recommendation that the Joint Strategic Capabilities  Plan be revised to require the combatant commanders to include the cost  of operating and maintaining existing installations and estimate the costs  of its initiatives in future theater posture plans, but its proposed actions  are not fully responsive to our recommendation. In its response, the  department stated that it recognizes that the costs associated with  operating and maintaining overseas facilities are an important  consideration in the decision-making process, and that the current draft  2011 Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan requires that theater posture plans  include operation and maintenance costs for current and planned posture  initiatives. The department also indicated that the combatant command  should include in the theater posture plan operation and maintenance  costs when they are known. In instances where operation and  maintenance costs are not known but required for oversight and decision  making, DOD stated that it will require the military services to provide the  needed data. While the proposed actions would be positive steps, the  department\u2019s plan to include operation and maintenance costs when they  are known\u2014or require additional data only when needed for decision  making\u2014could result in fragmented cost information. Therefore, we  continue to believe that DOD should revise the Joint Strategic Capabilities  Plan to require posture plans to include the cost of operating and  maintaining existing installations, even when those costs are unrelated to  a specific posture initiative.", "In response to our recommendation that the Joint Strategic Capabilities  Plan be revised to provide guidance on how the combatant commands  should analyze the costs and benefits of alternative courses of action when  considering proposed changes to posture, DOD agreed, stating that the  department uses four cost/benefit criteria in evaluating posture change  proposals and that these four criteria should be used by the combatant  commanders in analyzing alternative courses of action. Identifying the  criteria that should be used in analyzing alternative courses of action is  important, but the absence of detailed guidance within the Joint Strategic  Capabilities Plan itself on how those criteria should be applied by the  combatant commanders could lead to inconsistent application of the  criteria, making it difficult for decision makers to evaluate alternatives.   Therefore, we believe that DOD needs to take the additional step to revise  the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan to provide guidance on how the  combatant commands should apply the criteria to analyze the costs and  benefits of alternative courses of action.", "Regarding our recommendation that the EUCOM Commander define the  roles and responsibilities of the European Posture Executive Council and  European Posture Integration Team in the posture planning process and  development of the theater posture plan, DOD agreed, stating that  EUCOM\u2019s Theater Posture Plan defines the roles and responsibilities of  the Posture Executive Council and Posture Integration Team, and  provided additional specifics, which were consistent with the information  contained in our report. In addition, in response to our fifth  recommendation, DOD agreed to incorporate those roles and  responsibilities in command guidance.  Therefore, if fully implemented, we  believe DOD\u2019s actions should meet the intent of our recommendation.", "DOD agreed with our recommendation that the Secretary of Defense,  through the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, direct the EUCOM  Commander to develop a process to obtain interagency perspectives  throughout the posture planning process and development of the theater  posture plan. DOD stated that such a process currently exists and is  documented in EUCOM\u2019s Theater Posture Plan, which states that the  EUCOM Posture Executive Council coordinates with interagency partners  through the Interagency Partnering Directorate and the EUCOM Civilian  Deputy to the Commander. As discussed in this report, we acknowledge  the EUCOM initiative to establish the Interagency Partnering Directorate,  and modified the report to clarify that the EUCOM Posture Executive  Council includes the Interagency Partnering Directorate. However, as we  also point out in the report, this coordination approach was not fully  effective in the development of the 2010 Theater Posture Plan, directorate  officials were still trying to determine how best to participate in various  planning activities, and a EUCOM Strategy Implementation Branch official  believed the command has not defined how the interagency  representatives can best support ongoing posture planning efforts and  routinely coordinate with the interagency community. Therefore, we  believe that EUCOM needs to take the additional steps to establish a  process through which interagency perspectives can be routinely obtained  throughout the posture planning process, and institutionalize that  approach in the posture planning guidance that as of December 2010 was  still in draft form.", "DOD also agreed with our recommendation that the Secretary of Defense,  through the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, direct the EUCOM  Commander to issue guidance to codify the EUCOM posture planning  process. In its comments, DOD noted that the EUCOM Theater Posture  Plan and draft command directive provide roles, responsibilities, and  guidance for posture development while also identifying EUCOM-specific  procedures that enable EUCOM to complete a variety of tasks. As we  reported, we reviewed EUCOM\u2019s 2010 Theater Posture Plan as well as an  early draft of EUCOM\u2019s Directive 56-24 and found that they included  criteria for selecting posture issues that should be deliberated within the  executive council and established a process for service components to  submit posture issues to the executive council and the integration team.  However, neither document provided comprehensive guidance on the  process or steps involved in developing the theater posture plan and  EUCOM\u2019s posture requirements or a process through which interagency  perspectives can be routinely obtained.
