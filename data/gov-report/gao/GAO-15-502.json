BIA also faces staff limitations and does not have a documented process or the data needed to track its review and response times, as called for in implementation guidance for Executive Order 13604, and therefore it cannot ensure transparency in its review of energy-related documents. These shortcomings can increase costs and project development times, resulting in missed development opportunities, lost revenue, and jeopardized viability of projects. Examples are as follows:", "Missed development opportunities: According to a tribal official, BIA took 18 months to review a wind lease. According to the developer of the project, the review time caused the project to be delayed and resulted in the project losing an interconnection agreement with the local utility. Without this agreement, the project has not been able to move forward, resulting in a loss of revenue for the tribe.", "Lost revenue: According to a tribal official, BIA's review of some of its energy-related documents took as long as 8 years. In the meantime, the tribe estimates it lost more than $95 million in revenues it could have earned from tribal permitting fees, oil and gas severance taxes, and royalties.", "Jeopardized viability of projects: One lease for a proposed utility-scale wind project took BIA more than 3 years to review and approve. According to a tribal official, the long review time has contributed to uncertainty about the continued viability of the project because data used to support the economic feasibility and environmental impact of the project became too old to accurately reflect current conditions.", "Several factors have deterred tribes from seeking tribal energy resource agreements (TERA). These factors include uncertainty about some TERA regulations, costs associated with assuming activities historically conducted by federal agencies, and a complex application process.

Renewable energy comes from a variety of  sources, including wind, solar, hydroelectric power, geothermal, and  biomass. Electricity generation using renewable energy can range from  facility- and community-scale production\u2014such as rooftop solar panels or  a wind turbine to power a community center\u2014to utility-scale production of  hundreds of MWs of electricity.", "Most of this energy was produced from non-Indian resources, but Indian  energy resources hold significant potential for future development. For  example, natural gas and crude oil are found in a variety of geological  formations, including shale. Some Indian tribes and their members own  resources located in known shale plays (see fig.1).", "Development of Indian energy resources is a complex process that may  involve a range of stakeholders, including federal, tribal, and state  agencies. BIA, through its various regional and agency offices, Division of  Real Estate Services, Division of Land Titles and Records, and Division of  Natural Resources has primary authority for managing Indian energy  development (fig. 2 shows BIA regions and the number of associated  agency offices).", "Other federal agencies and offices, including BLM, IEED, and FWS, may  also have a role in the development of Indian energy resources.

To develop energy resources, developers and operators  must locate a suitable resource. To identify potential oil and gas  resources, most operators use seismic methods of exploration. For  renewable projects, developers conduct a feasibility assessment to  determine the viability of the project, including an evaluation of the market  area to determine demand for power, availability of interconnection with  the grid, and financing opportunities. During the exploration phase, a  number of permits or authorizations may be required. For example,  permitting requirements can include seismic exploration permits,  permission to survey, ROW agreements, archeological and cultural  surveys, tribal access permits, and environmental assessments.", "Preleasing. Operators must identify ownership of surface and/or  subsurface resources. BIA maintains surface and mineral ownership  records, and operators generally request a title status report from BIA\u2019s  Land Titles and Records Office to verify ownership of land and resources.  A title status report is issued after BIA examines land titles and identifies  the legal description of a tract of Indian land; current ownership, including  any applicable conditions, exceptions, restrictions, or encumbrances on  record; and whether the land or resource is in trust, restricted, or fee  status. Trust and restricted resources are held for the beneficial interest  of the tribe or an individual Indian and cannot be transferred or leased  without approval of the Secretary of the Interior, who has generally  delegated this authority to BIA. Some tribal boundaries include a  patchwork of these ownership patterns, along with parcels of land and  resources owned by the federal government, states, and counties,  intermingled together\u2014giving land ownership maps a \u201ccheckerboard\u201d  appearance (see fig. 3).", "Leasing. The operator or developer must acquire a lease for the use of  the surface and/or the right to drill for oil and gas resources. There are  several ways in which Indian oil and gas resources can be leased. For  example, oil and gas resources can be nominated for lease by operators,  the tribe, or an individual Indian owner. Then, BIA reviews nominated oil  and gas resources to determine ownership and in some cases, BLM may  assist with identifying ownership of proposed parcels. If the resources are  not already leased, BIA may advertise and conduct competitive lease  sales where operators can bid on nominated leases. BIA reviews the  bids, identifies the highest bidder, and notifies the operator whether its bid  was accepted. Tribes and individual Indians can, in some cases, lease  their own oil and gas resources. For energy development that requires  use of surface lands, leases for use of the lands are generally submitted  to BIA for review, after ownership has been determined.", "Permitting and other government actions. Multiple permits and other  approvals can be required throughout the development process, and  types of permits vary by project. For example, BLM issues drilling permits  to operators developing Indian oil and gas resources\u2014after receiving BIA  concurrence for approval of the permit. In addition, operators and  developers may have to obtain other types of permits from other federal  agencies. For example, an oil and gas operator may be required to obtain  a permit from EPA for air emissions, and a developer of a wind project  may be required to obtain a permit from FWS for unavoidable bird  deaths. Other approvals that may be needed for energy development include the granting of a ROW, which is generally obtained through BIA  approval.", "Indian tribes may also have their own set of laws and regulations  governing energy development. For instance, tribes may require  operators to enter into tribal business license agreements and tribal  employment rights ordinance agreements.", "State agencies have general authority to regulate natural resources within state  boundaries if the resources are located outside Indian country. States do not have  authority to regulate Indian resources located on Indian country unless Congress has  authorized this in a federal statute.

The official said he was aware of similar scenarios  throughout Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and Wyoming; however,  the extent of this deficiency is unknown because neither BIA nor BLM  maintains an inventory of Indian cadastral survey needs, as called for by  Interior guidance issued annually since 2008. BLM historically maintained this information in its Cadastral Automated Request System  (CARS), but a BLM official told us the system has not been fully  maintained or consistently used since 2011.
