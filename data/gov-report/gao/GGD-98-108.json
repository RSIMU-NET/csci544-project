In May 1994, Treasury\u2019s Assistant Secretary for Enforcement transferred this responsibility within the Department from the Office of Financial Enforcement to FinCEN. In September 1994, Congress passed and the President signed the Money Laundering Suppression Act (MLSA).

Criminal investigations are the responsibility of IRS\u2019 Criminal Investigation Division. Civil penalties are currently assessed by FinCEN, and the agency is to send each referral to IRS for review before any administrative or civil enforcement action is taken.", "Treasury has issued guidelines to assist regulatory agencies in determining which BSA violations warrant referral to Treasury for consideration of criminal and/or civil penalties. For example, according to the guidelines, violations customarily warranting referral include a pattern of failing to file currency transaction reports on applicable transactions.", "After receiving a referral, FinCEN\u2019s role includes evaluating the circumstances of the alleged violation and determining whether some type of civil action, including seeking the imposition of a civil monetary penalty, should be taken against the person or financial institution. Generally, FinCEN disposes of the majority of its civil penalty cases with one of three courses of action: (1) close the case without contacting the subject of the referral, (2) issue a letter of warning to the subject institution or individual, or (3) assess a civil monetary penalty. The Director, FinCEN, makes the final decisions. Civil monetary penalties generally can range from $25,000 to $100,000 per willful violation.

Regarding recent years, for example, FinCEN officials mentioned staff inexperience and personnel departures as being reasons. Further, the officials noted a change in the kinds of cases being referred to FinCEN. Specifically, the officials said the majority of cases referred to FinCEN now involve nonbank financial institutions (i.e., casinos, check cashers, and currency exchangers). According to FinCEN officials, it generally is more difficult to obtain records and documentary evidence and to reconstruct transactions for these entities than for banks.", "In addition, we believe that insufficient management attention has been a significant cause of the lengthy processing times for civil penalty cases. First, FinCEN and its predecessor, Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Enforcement, did not (1) set timeliness goals for civil penalty case processing and (2) monitor or measure performance against those goals. FinCEN officials told us that the agency has never set timeliness goals for civil penalty processing. The officials also said that any such goals would prove arbitrary since each case varies significantly based on complexity, volume of transactions, and other factors. However, those goals can be valuable performance management tools for improving overall results and can take into account the differences in cases. Moreover, goal setting and performance measurement are widely considered to be good management practices, and these practices are reflected in the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993. Implementing such practices should help FinCEN (1) better identify the key factors that determine the timeliness of processing civil penalty cases and (2) find ways to streamline the management and processing of cases to reverse the trend of increasingly lengthy processing times.", "Second, FinCEN\u2019s civil penalty tracking system, which resides on a stand-alone microcomputer, has not been an effective management tool, according to a 1990 report by Treasury\u2019s Inspector General. Generally, the tracking system has remained unchanged since 1990, even though the Inspector General reported that database improvements were needed to assist in prioritizing, managing, and controlling civil penalty cases. The Inspector General\u2019s report noted, for example, that the database was not being used to track the age of referrals and cases nor to track statute of limitation expiration dates.", "Third, as previously mentioned, according to FinCEN\u2019s data for the period January 1, 1992, through March 27, 1998, a total of 16 cases were affected by expiration of the statute of limitations. However, FinCEN did not close several of these cases until months or years after expiration of the statute of limitations.

Also, in the more recent years, the average processing times to close civil penalty cases are higher than in previous years. Among other reasons, insufficient management attention\u2014as indicated by the absence of timeliness goals and monitoring, ineffective civil penalty tracking system, and 16 cases that could not be pursued because the statute of limitations had expired\u2014contributed to lengthy processing times in recent years.

To address the timeliness issue, the Acting Director noted that FinCEN has taken or has plans to take definitive steps, such as working with OCRE staff to identify individual training needs; assigning two non-OCRE employees the tasks of analyzing open civil penalty referrals, highlighting cases that warrant immediate attention, and providing oversight to ensure that progress continues on those referrals; and developing civil penalty referral procedures that include time lines and due dates.", "The Acting Director commented that FinCEN plans to establish strict time lines for the initial assessment of civil penalty referrals, where such guidelines are practicable and predictable. Regarding the adjudicative or disposition phase of case processing, the Acting Director said that FinCEN favored more diligent management oversight (e.g., case reviews by the OCRE Assistant Director) rather than the establishment of strict or arbitrary time lines. However, to provide further management oversight, the Acting Director said that FinCEN had recently reinstated the use of quarterly reports showing the status of BSA referrals, including the number of cases received and closed during the reporting period.

Also, FinCEN noted that, to obtain a fuller perspective on the alleged BSA violation, the specialist may ask for and review relevant information that goes beyond just the specific transactions cited in the referral. That is, the specialist may review other account and transaction activity information regarding the subject institution or individual."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disposition of Cases", "paragraphs": ["On the basis of the information in the referral and that developed by OCRE, the financial enforcement specialist is to recommend a course of civil or administrative action to the Assistant Director, OCRE, who reviews and decides whether to approve the recommended action.

The officials added that financial institutions and individuals are encouraged to submit any available mitigating evidence in advance of BSA case settlement negotiations with FinCEN. Also, the officials noted that FinCEN\u2019s final disposition of a BSA case, including the dollar amount of the civil penalty, is to be determined by considering the following factors: the severity, volume, and longevity of the BSA violations; the subject\u2019s overall BSA compliance program; self discovery and acknowledgment of the BSA violations to Treasury versus external discovery and notification; cooperation with FinCEN and other applicable agencies; prompt correction of the BSA deficiencies that caused the violations; the outcomes of any prior or subsequent BSA compliance examinations; and any other valid aggravating or mitigating factors, including the subject\u2019s ability to pay the BSA penalty.", "According to FinCEN officials, due to the complex nature of BSA cases, FinCEN does not use rigid formulas to determine the appropriate BSA penalty. Rather, all such decisions are to be made on a case-by-case basis and are to reflect consideration of the factors presented above. Also, FinCEN officials noted that the agency does not set timeliness goals for processing civil penalty cases.", "According to FinCEN, if a subject refuses to settle the case, FinCEN formally assesses the maximum BSA civil monetary penalty allowed by law for the violations. The matter is then to be referred for internal legal review. Thereafter, if deemed warranted, procedures call for FinCEN to submit the matter to the Department of Justice\u2019s Civil Division to seek collection of the unpaid penalty. After FinCEN assesses a BSA civil penalty, the government has 2 years to initiate collection litigation against the subject. FinCEN officials told us that, to avoid litigation and exposure to the maximum penalty allowed by law, subjects of a BSA action are almost always amenable to settling their BSA liability with FinCEN."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Data on BSA Civil Penalty Cases", "paragraphs": ["This appendix presents various tables of BSA penalty statistics for calendar years 1985 through 1997.
