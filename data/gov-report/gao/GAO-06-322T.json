As hurricanes are currently characterized, the Corps\" standard project hurricane approximately equals a fast-moving category 3 hurricane, according to the Corps. Agreements between the Corps and four New Orleans levee districts--the local sponsors for the Lake Pontchartrain project--specify that the local sponsors are responsible for operation, maintenance, repair, replacement, and rehabilitation of the levees after construction of the project, or a project unit, is complete. Pre-Katrina, according to the Corps, most of the levees included in the Lake Pontchartrain project had been completed and turned over to the local sponsors for operations and maintenance. The Corps has authority to repair or rehabilitate completed flood control projects if (1) deficiencies are related to the original construction or (2) damage is caused by a flood and the project is active in the Corps' Rehabilitation Inspection Program. According to internal Corps regulations, federal funds cannot be used for regular operations and maintenance activities. Both local sponsors and the Corps are required to conduct regular inspections to ensure that levees are properly maintained. If the Corps finds that local sponsors are not properly maintaining the levees, internal Corps regulations outline a series of steps, such as notifying the governor or taking legal action, that the Corps can take to bring the local sponsor in to compliance. Corps inspection reports for 2001-2004 indicate that the completed portions of the Lake Pontchartrain project were maintained at an acceptable level. When levees fail or are damaged, the Corps has authority to provide a variety of emergency response actions. Specifically, the Corps is authorized to undertake emergency operations and rehabilitation activities and, if tasked by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to provide disaster response, recovery, and mitigation assistance to state and local governments, as needed.

Because of this  threat, a series of control structures, concrete flood walls, and levees was  proposed for the area along Lake Pontchartrain in the 1960s. Congress  first authorized the construction of the Lake Pontchartrain and Vicinity,  Louisiana Hurricane Protection Project in the Flood Control Act of 1965  to provide hurricane protection to areas around the lake in Orleans,  Jefferson, St. Bernard, and St. Charles Parishes. Although federally  authorized, the project was a joint federal, state, and local effort. The  Corps was responsible for project design and construction of the  approximately 125 miles of levees, with the federal government paying 70  percent of the costs, and state and local interests paying 30 percent. Each  of the four parishes protected by the project is associated with a local  levee district that is generally composed of state-appointed officials and is  considered a state entity. Specifically, Orleans Parish is associated with  the Orleans Levee District, Jefferson Parish is associated with the East  Jefferson Levee District, St. Bernard Parish is associated with the Lake  Borgne Levee District, and St. Charles Parish is associated with the  Pontchartrain Levee District.

These sponsors include the Orleans, East Jefferson, Lake  Borgne, and Pontchartrain levee districts. Although the Corps has not yet  provided us with dates on when the project units for the Lake  Pontchartrain project were completed, after Hurricane Katrina, the Corps\u2019  New Orleans District and the Department of Defense\u2019s Task Force  Guardian determined, based on three criteria, that almost the entire Lake  Pontchartrain hurricane project had been turned over to local sponsors for  ongoing OMRR&R responsibilities. The criteria used to make this  determination were (1) if the project unit was completed in accordance  with the designed level of protection specified in the project decision  document, (2) if the project unit was being operated and maintained by the  local sponsor, and (3) if the project unit had passed the annual Inspection  of Completed Works in accordance with Corps regulations. Based on this  evaluation, the task force determined that only three project units\u2014a  bridge over the 17th Street canal, a project unit in Jefferson Parish, and a  project unit in St. Charles Parish\u2014had not yet been completed and turned  over to the local sponsors. Figure 1 shows the three project units that have  not been completed and turned over to the local sponsors.", "While the assurances signed by local sponsors do not define project  completion, internal Corps regulations provide that completed projects or  completed project units will normally be turned over when all  construction, cleanup work, and testing of mechanical, electrical, and  other equipment are complete and the project is in proper condition for  the assumption of operation and maintenance by the local sponsors.  Transfer is to be accomplished through a formal notice from the Corps to  the local sponsor that includes a transfer date determined by the Corps\u2019  district engineers. According to Corps officials, the formal notice generally  is in the form of a letter to the local sponsor.", "According to internal Corps regulations, upon transfer of a completed  project to the local sponsors, the Corps may no longer expend federal  funds on construction or project improvements. If the Corps determines  that unsatisfactory conditions have developed as a result of the original  levee construction, the Corps may undertake corrective action. For  example, a Corps district official responsible for operations and  maintenance oversight told us that if settlement of a completed levee  occurs, this is not considered a design or construction flaw. Instead, this is  considered a condition that should be addressed by the local sponsors as  part of their normal operations and maintenance responsibilities.", "Local sponsors\u2019 responsibilities for OMRR&R of the completed portions of  the Lake Pontchartrain project were established through local assurances  signed by the levee districts and the Corps. For the Lake Pontchartrain  hurricane project as constructed, these assurances were signed, and  subsequently accepted by the federal government for the Orleans Levee  District on June 21, 1985; the Pontchartrain Levee District on August 7,  1987; the East Jefferson Levee District on December 21, 1987; and the Lake  Borgne Basin Levee District on December 7, 1977. The formal assurances  commit the local sponsors to, among other things, operate and maintain all  features of the project in accordance with Corps regulations. Also, in  accordance with internal Corps regulations, the Corps is required to  provide local sponsors with an operations and maintenance manual at the  time of, or at the earliest practicable date after, the transfer of OMRR&R  responsibilities from the Corps to local sponsors for a completed project  or project unit. The manual is intended to assist the responsible local  authorities in carrying out their operation and maintenance obligations.  According to Corps officials, the OMRR&R responsibilities for levees are  straightforward, and the manual that the Corps provides local sponsors is  a one-page document that outlines the requirements as described by  federal regulations. Specifically, federal regulations require local  sponsors to ensure that the structure is operating as intended and to  continuously patrol the structure during flood periods to ensure that no  conditions exist that might endanger the structure and to take immediate  steps to control any condition that might endanger it. For maintenance,  the regulations require local sponsors to ensure at all times that the  structure is serviceable in times of flood. The regulations also require  periodic inspections and maintenance measures, including the following:    promoting the growth of sod, including routine mowing of the grass and  removing drift material or wild growth from the levee (such as brush and  trees); and repairing any damage to the levee caused by erosion.", "Repair, replacement, and rehabilitation are also considered part of the  local sponsors\u2019 maintenance responsibilities, as outlined in internal Corps  regulations. Repair refers to routine activities that maintain the project in  well-kept condition; replacement refers to replacing worn-out elements;  and rehabilitation refers to activities necessary to bring a deteriorated  project back to its original condition.

Although we have not reviewed the extent to  which the Corps undertook these initiatives during the Katrina disaster,  the Corps is responsible for the following:  1.  Creating an emergency management organization. Division and  district commanders are expected to provide adequate staffing for a  readiness/emergency management organization to accomplish the  preparedness mission. In addition, divisions and districts should have  teams readily available to provide assistance under the Corps\u2019  authorities for flood emergencies and other natural disasters; execute  responsibilities and missions under the Stafford Act and the National  Response Plan; staff a Crisis Management Team, consisting of an  Emergency Manager and senior representatives from technical and  functional areas to provide guidance and direction during emergency  situations; and staff a Crisis Action Team, consisting of the personnel  necessary to operate an emergency operations center.  2.  Establishing and maintaining plans and procedures. Corps  headquarters, divisions, and districts are expected to prepare and  maintain plans for emergencies and disasters, establishing an alternate  emergency operations center, and reconstituting the district. These  operation plans should cover emergency/disaster assistance  procedures under all applicable authorities and potential mission  assignments. Each division and district should have, at a minimum, an  operation plan that provides procedures for generic disasters within  the division and district. The plan should include general topics, such  as activating, staffing, and operating the emergency operations center;  reporting requirements; notification and alert rosters; and organizing  for response to disasters. The plan should also have one or more  appendixes that specifically address the disasters most likely to impact  the division and district. Operation plans are reviewed and updated  annually to reflect administrative changes. The division/district\u2019s  generic or principal disaster operation plan is supposed to be  reviewed, revised, and republished biennially.  3.  Training personnel for response. Divisions and districts are expected  to ensure that personnel who are assigned emergency assistance  responsibilities have been properly trained.  4.  Conducting exercises. Exercises are to be conducted at least once  every two years, consistent with available funding. This requirement  may be waived if an actual emergency response was conducted during  the two-year period that was of sufficient magnitude to have  adequately trained emergency team members and other personnel.  5.  Establishing adequate command and control facilities. Divisions,  districts, and other Corps groups should provide a dedicated facility  for an emergency operations center that will be able to provide  command and control for emergency/disaster response and recovery  activities.  6.  Maintaining supplies, tools, and equipment. Divisions and districts  are expected to maintain equipment and supplies that can be readily  available for use by the emergency operations center, disaster field  offices, disaster field teams, planning response teams, and similar  entities. Equipment should be stockpiled for use during emergency  operations and exercises.  7.  Managing inspections of flood control projects.

Advance measures include the following:  1.  Technical assistance: providing technical review, advice, and  recommendations to state and local agencies before an anticipated  flood event. For example, the Corps may provide personnel to inspect  existing flood control works to identify potential problems and  solutions, evaluate conditions to determine the requirements for  additional flood control protection, and recommend the most  expedient construction methods; provide hydraulic, hydrologic, and  geotechnical analysis; and provide information readily available at  Corps districts to local entities for use in the preparation of local  evacuation and contingency flood plans.  2.  Direct assistance: providing supplies, equipment, and contracting for  the construction of temporary and permanent flood control projects.  Examples of emergency contracting work include the construction of  temporary levees; the repair, strengthening, or temporary raising of  levees or other flood control works; shore protection projects; and  removal of stream obstructions, including channel dredging of federal  projects to restore the design flow.", "Advance measures taken by the Corps are intended to supplement ongoing  or planned state and local efforts, and are designed to deal with a specific  threat.

These functions  include pre-event planning, organization, response, and recovery in order  to minimize the potential hazards to life and property. As part of this plan,  the district defines emergency organizational staffing to support  emergency operations. Selected personnel are assigned to specific teams  or offices that, in the event of a disaster, are to provide the necessary  liaison with federal, state, or local emergency management agencies; make  decisions relative to Corps\u2019 capabilities and assignments; perform  preliminary damage assessments; or accomplish specific missions.  According to the plan, a New Orleans District Emergency Operations  Center should be staffed to respond to an emergency, and the center is to  become the focal point for collecting data, analyzing situations, allocating  resources, furnishing reports to higher headquarters, and providing overall  management and control of all district activities. With the activation of the  emergency operations center, a crisis management team becomes  responsible for coordinating and directing district activities in the crisis  situation. A crisis action team is responsible for executing the activities as  directed by the crisis management team.

Similarly, the responsibilities for emergency preparedness  and response are dependent on a variety of laws and regulations.
