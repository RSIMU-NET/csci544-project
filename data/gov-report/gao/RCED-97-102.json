The agency\u2019s Plant Protection and Quarantine unit (PPQ) exercises regulatory authority to inspect agricultural imports, as well as nonagricultural products that may carry pests, largely through its Agricultural Quarantine Inspection (AQI) activities. In fiscal year 1996, APHIS allocated an estimated $151.9 million for AQI activities and had about 2,600 inspectors located at 172 land, sea, and air ports of entry. APHIS has other inspection duties, such as inspections of imported and exported live animals, that are not the subject of this report.", "APHIS is one of the three primary Federal Inspection Service (FIS) agencies responsible for monitoring the entry of cargo and passengers into the United States. The two other FIS agencies are the U.S. Customs Service in the Department of the Treasury and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) in the Department of Justice. The U.S. Customs Service is primarily concerned with collecting duties on imports, enforcing antismuggling laws, and interdicting narcotics and drugs. INS inspects foreign visitors to determine their admissibility into the United States and guards against illegal entry.", "Recent multilateral trade agreements\u2014the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the results of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\u2019s Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations (Uruguay Round)\u2014have provisions that affect APHIS\u2019 inspection activities. Both agreements contain provisions on signatories\u2019 use of sanitary and phytosanitary standards that limit the introduction of foreign pests and diseases. To prevent the standards from impeding agricultural trade, they must be based on scientific principles and risk assessment, provide a level of protection appropriate to the risk faced, and not restrict trade more than necessary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Developments Pose Challenges to Inspection Program", "paragraphs": ["APHIS\u2019 inspection workload has increased dramatically since 1990 because of growth in imports and exports, increased travel, and increased smuggling. Furthermore, policy changes have exacerbated workload demands by increasing pressure to expedite the processing of passengers and cargo into the United States.", "The workload has been directly affected by the increase in international trade and travel between fiscal years 1990 and 1995. Overall, the volume of exports and imports rose 45 percent and 52 percent, respectively, while agricultural exports and imports increased 35 percent and 31 percent, respectively. Moreover, the number of international passengers traveling to the United States increased almost 50 percent, reaching 55 million passengers in fiscal year 1995.", "Furthermore, increases in the number of ports of entry, as well as increased risk at existing ports, have expanded APHIS\u2019 workload. Along the Mexican border alone, six new border stations were approved between 1988 and 1993, while several other major facilities are scheduled for expansion. According to APHIS officials, each new port of entry requires at least five inspectors. Along the U.S.-Canadian border, changes in risks associated with passengers and cargo have created the need for increased inspections. APHIS staff at the Blaine, Washington, port told us that increased risks were responsible for an increase from 4 inspectors in 1990 to 18 in 1996.", "In addition to conducting inspections, inspectors are responsible for reviewing and issuing certificates for agricultural exports, working on temporary assignments away from their normal work location, and performing other duties, such as preventing smuggling and fumigating cargo. As exports increase, inspectors have had to issue and review a growing number of certificates for U.S. exports. Temporary duty assignments range from domestic emergency eradication of pests and diseases and foreign preclearance activities to meetings and training. Studies in California and Florida have found that the smuggling of agricultural products into the United States has grown and presents a serious pest risk. As a result of increased smuggling activity across the Canadian and Mexican borders, APHIS inspectors are performing antismuggling activities, such as working on investigations and surveillance of markets and border areas.", "Along with the greater inspection workload, inspectors face increasing pressure to expedite the flow of goods and people across U.S. borders. Responding to the growing importance of trade to the national economy and to recent trade agreements, APHIS has taken an active role in facilitating trade. Towards this end, APHIS and its FIS partners have adopted new customer service standards to move the increasing import and passenger volume through ports of entry within specific periods. For passengers, these standards call upon the agencies to clear international airline passengers within 45 minutes of arrival. Similarly, APHIS has adopted standards to schedule inspections of perishable cargo within 3 hours of being notified of its arrival. APHIS acknowledges the conflict between enforcement responsibilities and trade facilitation and is seeking an appropriate balance as guidance for the inspection program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "APHIS Changed Its Inspection Program to Address the New Challenges", "paragraphs": ["APHIS made a number of changes to its inspection program to respond to the demands of its growing workload. It shifted funds and staff away from other programs to the inspection program, broadened the range of inspection techniques, and stepped up efforts to coordinate with the other FIS agencies. In addition, to help measure the effectiveness of its inspections and to form a basis for making further improvements, APHIS recently initiated an effort to compare the rate at which restricted items are entering the United States, and the risks associated with those items, with the inspection rates at individual ports of entry. This effort is designed to determine if the current inspection program is adequately addressing the risks of harmful pests and disease entering the country and to identify which of the country\u2019s ports of entry are most vulnerable to such risks."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "APHIS Increased Resources for Inspection Activities", "paragraphs": ["APHIS has been shifting more funds into inspection activities since fiscal year 1990. Through fiscal year 1996, the budget for AQI activities rose 78 percent to $151.9 million, while APHIS\u2019 overall funding rose 20 percent. To provide this increased funding, APHIS reduced its spending for several other programs, such as the brucellosis eradication program, which fell from $59 million in 1990 to $23 million in 1996. The 1990 and 1996 farm bills also authorized the collection of and expanded access to user fees for inspections. User fees have become the principal revenue source for the AQI program, accounting for about $127 million of program revenues in fiscal year 1996. (See app. II for more detail on funding and staffing for fiscal years 1990-96.)", "Since 1990, APHIS has raised AQI staffing levels about 44 percent\u2014from 1,785 to 2,570 positions. The agency shifted positions from other programs to meet the increased workload. In addition, as a result of the 1996 farm bill\u2019s provisions allowing greater access to user fee revenues and removing a staff ceiling, APHIS is in the process of hiring about 200 new inspectors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "APHIS Expanded Use of Alternative Inspection Practices and Increased Interagency Coordination", "paragraphs": ["APHIS has taken several steps to make better use of its inspection resources. To supplement the normal practice of performing visual inspections of selected cargo and baggage, APHIS has significantly expanded the use of alternative inspection practices, such as detector dogs and x-ray equipment. APHIS increased the number of detector dog teams from 12 in 1989 to 48 in 1996. Inspectors are also periodically using inspection blitzes\u2014highly intensive inspections of baggage or cargo\u2014to augment their visual inspection of selected items. To improve its ability to select passengers for inspection, APHIS is refining the list of risk characteristics that inspectors use in selecting passenger bags for inspection. Roving inspectors currently use these selection characteristics in airports to make referrals for agricultural inspection. The agency is also studying opportunities to use roving inspectors at land border ports. Finally, APHIS is funding research on new x-ray technology that will identify air passengers\u2019 baggage containing restricted items.", "APHIS has also attempted to reduce the workload at entry ports by (1) inspecting passengers and products in the country of origin or (2) allowing lower-risk products to enter with less intensive scrutiny. Under the first effort, APHIS has staff oversee or conduct inspections to preclear products and passenger baggage in the country of origin so that inspectors at receiving U.S. ports primarily monitor these products or baggage. APHIS\u2019 International Services unit now operates cargo preclearance inspections in 29 countries and limited passenger preclearance programs in 2 countries. In addition, APHIS initiated a cargo release program along the Mexican border to reduce inspections of high-volume, low-risk commodities and allow the products to enter with less intensive scrutiny. For example, according to APHIS, the port of entry with the highest volume of agricultural imports from Mexico\u2014Nogales, Arizona\u2014had about 75 percent of its shipments in 1995 in the cargo release program.", "In addition to taking steps aimed at improving the use of its own resources, APHIS is working with the other FIS agencies\u2014Customs and INS\u2014to improve coordination. For example, several work units are working with the FIS agencies, through Port Quality Improvement Committees, to improve port operations and are cross-training FIS staff to educate them on APHIS\u2019 inspection needs. In 1996, the FIS agencies and the Department of State issued a report with recommendations for improving screening of passengers as they arrive at U.S. borders. In 1996, APHIS began providing computer equipment to 33 maritime ports and 26 airports to enable them to link up with information in Custom\u2019s databases on cargo and prior violations. APHIS is trying to improve the linkage with the cargo manifest database to overcome early problems in obtaining and reviewing cargo information. For example, APHIS is developing its Automated Targeting System, which will automatically scan Custom\u2019s cargo manifest database to identify shipments for inspection."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "APHIS Implemented Program to Determine Pest and Disease Risks at Ports", "paragraphs": ["In October 1996, APHIS began implementing the AQI Results Monitoring Program, which is intended to measure the effectiveness of its inspections nationwide and provide information on which ports of entry pose the highest risk of having harmful pests and diseases enter the country. At each port, the program will also identify risks of harmful pest and disease entry associated with various commodities, their country of origin, and their means of entry. APHIS expects the program to be in place at most ports of entry by September 1997.", "The results monitoring program uses random surveys of cargo and passengers entering the United States to estimate the rates at which restricted items are entering the country and the risks of harmful pests and diseases associated with those items. The program allows APHIS to determine whether the number of inspections performed at a given location for a given commodity adequately address the risk posed. The program replaces the traditional measure of inspection performance, the quantity of material intercepted, with new performance indicators related to risks associated with commodities entering the country.

However, at 11 of the 12 ports that we examined, inspectors were not always implementing these procedures for the (1) number of inspections that should be conducted, (2) number of samples of a shipment that should be examined, or (3) manner in which a sample should be selected. According to regional APHIS officials and internal studies, these types of problems may not be limited to the sites we visited.", "At 11 ports of entry we visited, including the 3 busiest ports in the United States, inspectors said that they are unable to examine enough vehicles or cargo containers to consider their inspection to be representative of the movement of goods, to control the flow of restricted goods, and to minimize risk of pests and disease. Several of these inspectors said that they were not confident that the frequency of inspections was adequate to manage the risks. For example:", "At the Mexican border crossing with the heaviest passenger vehicle volume in the country, a supervisory inspector said the staff were inspecting less than 0.1 percent of the passenger vehicular traffic because of the high volume of traffic and the low number of referrals from FIS officials who initially screen the vehicles. APHIS officials have set a target of inspecting about 2 percent of all passenger vehicles.", "Because of staffing shortages, one work unit along the U.S.-Mexican border can provide inspector coverage of a busy pedestrian crossing for only 8 of the 18 hours of port operations.", "As a result of a low staffing level and the numerous other duties that must be carried out at a busy U.S.-Canadian border location, an APHIS manager told us that inspectors cannot maintain a regular presence at any of the four border crossings at the port. The inspectors are available to inspect only when the other FIS agencies make referrals to APHIS.", "Problems in conducting a sufficient number of inspections were not limited to the locations we visited. An APHIS headquarters official told us the agency does not conduct any inspections at 46 northern and 6 southern ports of entry. Instead, the agency relies on the other FIS agencies to perform agricultural inspections, when needed, at these low-volume ports, although the risks are unknown.", "In addition, even for the inspections that they conduct, inspectors do not always examine the number of samples suggested by the guidance. For example, inspectors at two ports of entry told us that they were unable to inspect a large enough sample in a given cargo shipment to meet APHIS\u2019 inspection guidance. More specifically, during peak season at one high-volume port along the southern border, inspectors usually inspected one box from each shipment selected for inspection, or less than 0.5 percent of the shipment. This is far less than the 2-percent sample recommended in APHIS\u2019 guidance. At another port\u2014the second largest in the country\u2014inspectors curtailed their inspections of cut flowers, which are considered a high-risk cargo. The APHIS port director said that inspectors are able to conduct only cursory inspections during high-volume periods because the flowers are perishable and the cut flower industry has continually pressured both political representatives and APHIS to have inspections performed more quickly.", "Finally, in contrast to recommended inspection procedures, APHIS inspectors do not always select samples in a manner that ensures that the samples are representative of the shipment being inspected. APHIS\u2019 guidance emphasizes the importance of selecting representative samples and specifically cautions against \u201ctailgate inspections\u201d\u2014inspections of goods that are stored near openings and that may not be representative. A random survey of refrigerated cargo containers in Miami, conducted by APHIS and the state of Florida, documented the pitfalls of such inspections. The survey found that less than 40 percent of the pests discovered in the survey were located near the container opening. Despite the limitations associated with tailgate inspections, inspectors at five ports said they routinely use them in inspecting cargo containers. This practice extends beyond the ports we visited: A 1996 APHIS report on cargo inspection monitoring noted that many ports have resorted to tailgate inspections because of heavy trade volume.", "In addition to tailgate inspections, we found one port using another sampling practice that also reduced assurance that the samples examined represented the entire shipment. In Miami, the second busiest port in the country, we observed inspectors allowing import brokers of cut flowers to select samples for inspection. With this practice, brokers could select samples that are likely to pass inspection, which reduces the credibility of the inspection."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inspection Program Lacks a Sound Resource Allocation Method", "paragraphs": ["The staffing models that APHIS uses to allocate its inspection resources have several weaknesses that undermine the agency\u2019s ability to ensure that inspectors are deployed to areas that pose the highest risk of entry of pests or disease. The weaknesses fall in three areas. First, the staffing models rely on inaccurate inspection workload data, which could skew the models\u2019 analyses. Second, the models do not contain risk assessment information similar to that produced by the results monitoring program because APHIS has not determined how to include risk data in the model\u2019s design. This limitation restricts APHIS\u2019 ability to place inspection resources at the ports of entry with the highest risks of pest and disease introduction. Finally, the models are not used to allocate inspection resources on a national basis. Rather, they are used only to allocate resources within APHIS regions.", "APHIS\u2019 staffing models are intended to help determine the number of inspectors that should be stationed at various locations across the country. There are four separate models for calculating staffing needs at airports, land border crossings, maritime ports, and plant inspection stations. Each of the models calculates staffing needs by, in essence, multiplying various measures of workload activity (such as number of inspections, number of vehicle arrivals, and number of pest interceptions) by the time it takes to complete these activities and converting that product into an estimate of the number of inspectors needed.", "The accuracy of the workload data used in the models is key to ensuring that projected staffing needs are also accurate. However, APHIS has little assurance that the data are accurate. The inspection workload data used in the model generally comes from APHIS\u2019 Workload Accomplishment Data System (WADS). APHIS officials at all levels of the inspection program questioned the accuracy of the data in this system because of inconsistencies in the way the data were compiled at ports and reported through regional offices to APHIS headquarters. APHIS inspectors told us that some data they submitted, such as information on endangered species, was inaccurately reported or did not appear in the national WADS summaries. Officials in one region said some data were omitted because they were not useful at the national level, while inaccurate data may be due to data entry error. Furthermore, workload statistics were often estimates of activity rather than real-time information. Finally, we found that another source of inaccurate data in WADS can be traced to the poor quality of inspections. If, for example, inspectors are reporting the results of tailgate inspections rather than inspections of representative samples of cargo, WADS data on the number of interceptions could be misleading.", "A second weakness with the current staffing models is that they do not take into consideration variations in the risks of harmful pests and disease entering the country. These risks can vary by several factors, such as the commodity, country of origin, port of entry and means of entry. The results monitoring program may be able to provide this type of analyses. However, APHIS officials have not yet determined how to incorporate this information into the models. Furthermore, there are some concerns about the accuracy of the results monitoring program because it too is based, in part, upon information from the WADS.", "Finally, the potential benefits of using the staffing models are limited because they are not used to allocate inspection resources on a national level. APHIS has instructed its regions and ports to use the staffing models to help allocate staff at the regional and port levels. However, regional officials at two of the four regions told us that they use the staffing models primarily for budget development, not for allocating staff among the ports within their regions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["APHIS faces a difficult mission\u2014to ensure that tons of cargo and millions of passengers entering the United States do not bring in harmful pests or diseases.

Unfortunately, these demands have sometimes resulted in shortcutting inspection procedures, such as performing tailgate inspections and allowing brokers to choose the samples for inspection. In turn, these shortcuts have diminished the quality of inspections and reduced assurance that an APHIS-inspected shipment entering the United States contains no harmful pests or diseases.", "In view of APHIS\u2019 increasing workload, it is critical that the agency be able to allocate its limited inspection resources to the ports of entry with the highest risks of pest and disease introduction. APHIS currently does not have the management tools to do so. Specifically, the workload information in the WADS is key to staffing allocation decisions. However, APHIS officials question the accuracy of the WADS information, noting, among other things, that the system does not include all needed workload information and some of the information that it does include are estimates that may be inaccurate.", "Beyond problems with the workload information, APHIS\u2019 current staffing models do not factor into consideration variations by commodity, country of origin, and other factors for the risk of pest or disease introduction. APHIS\u2019 results monitoring program will provide important information on risk. However, APHIS officials have not yet determined how this information will be integrated into their staffing models or staffing decisions.", "Finally, APHIS has not made a commitment to using its staffing models to allocate inspection resources from a national perspective.

For example, to ensure that APHIS inspectors adhere to minimum inspection standards, APHIS said that it will provide guidance to reinforce the importance of using the best possible procedures for preventing pests from becoming established and will ensure that the inspection standards are consistent with the risk determinations conducted through the results monitoring activity. To improve the data in the WADS, APHIS plans to ensure that inspection program policies are consistently applied nationwide and that the data used in decisionmaking are accurate and reliable. To integrate a risk assessment factor into its staffing process, APHIS is developing a prototype model of staffing guidelines to integrate data from its results monitoring and risk assessments.

Primary inspection involves screening passengers, their baggage, and vehicles by questioning the passengers, reviewing their written declaration, and visually observing for referral for further examination. APHIS is refining the characteristics used in the screening process to select passengers and baggage for secondary inspection. Secondary inspection involves a more detailed questioning of the passenger and a visual examination of baggage contents, if necessary. To detect pests and contraband, AQI staff use a range of strategies, such as screening, detector dogs, and x-rays. For airline flights, APHIS has also developed a list of low-, medium-, and high-risk countries of origin to help guide the selection process in the primary inspection area."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": ["Ron E.
