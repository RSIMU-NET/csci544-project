The objectives of this report were to among other things (1) identify the federal IT O&M investments with the largest budgets, including their responsible agencies and how each investment supports its agency\u0092s mission; (2) determine the extent to which these investments have undergone OAs; and (3) assess whether the responsible agency\u0092s major IT investments are in development, mixed life cycle, or steady state. To do so, GAO focused on the 10 IT investments with the largest budgets in O&M and their responsible eight agencies, and assessed whether OAs were conducted on the investments. In addition, GAO evaluated what agencies spent on mixed, development, and O&M investments and whether agencies were using O&M funds for development activities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The 10 federal information technology (IT) operations and maintenance (O&M) investments with the largest budgets in fiscal year 2012\u0097and the eight agencies that operate them\u0097are identified by GAO in the table below.

DHS\u0092s OA addressed most factors that OMB calls for; it did not address three factors (e.g., comparing current cost and schedule against original estimates). DHS officials attributed these factors not being addressed to the department still being in the process of implementing its new OA policy. The remaining agencies did not assess their investments, which accounted for $7.4 billion in reported O&M spending. Agency officials cited several reasons for not doing so, including relying on budget submission and related management reviews that measure performance; however, OMB has noted that these are not a substitute for OAs. Until the agencies ensure their operational investments are assessed, there is a risk that they will not know whether these multibillion dollar investments fully meet intended objectives.", "For the eight agencies in this review, the majority of their 401 major IT investments were mixed life cycle (i.e., having activities and systems that are in both development and O&M) with regard to total spending and number of investments. Specifically, 193 (48 percent) of the investments were mixed investments, accounting for about $18 billion (61 percent) of planned spending. As such, successful oversight of such investments should involve a combination of conducting OAs to address operational portions of an investment and establishing IT governance and program management disciplines to manage those portions under development. GAO\u0092s experience at the agencies and this report have identified agency inconsistencies in conducting OAs and establishing the capabilities that are key to effectively managing IT investments; accordingly, GAO has made prior recommendations to strengthen agency efforts in these areas."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that the seven agencies that did not perform OAs on their large IT O&M investments do so, and that DHS ensure that its OA is complete and addresses all OMB factors.

More  specifically, we assessed whether an analysis had been performed on  each of the 10 investments during fiscal year 2012 (because it was the  last full year for completing OAs) and if so, we compared it to the OMB  guidance criteria to identify any gaps and their causes. Further, to assess  whether each of the eight agency\u2019s major IT investments are in  development, mixed life cycle, or steady state, we analyzed OMB budget  documentation on the agencies\u2019 planned spending on each IT investment  by phase (i.e., development, mixed, or steady state).

Of the $82  billion budgeted for IT, the budget provides that 26 key agencies plan to  spend the bulk of it, approximately $76 billion. Further, of the $76 billion,  over $59 billion is to be spent on O&M investments with the remainder  ($17 billion) being budgeted for development of new capabilities.

As part of this effort, OMB  issued guidance directing federal agencies to report, via the Dashboard,  the performance of their IT investments. Currently, the Dashboard  publicly displays information on the cost, schedule, and performance of  major federal IT investments at key federal agencies. In addition, the  Dashboard allows users to download exhibit 53 data, which include  information on both major and nonmajor investments. According to OMB,  these data are intended to provide a near real-time perspective of the  performance of these investments, as well as a historical perspective.  Further, the public display of these data is intended to allow OMB, other  oversight bodies, and the general public to hold the government agencies  accountable for results and progress. Since the Dashboard has been  implemented, we have reported and made recommendations to improve  the data accuracy and reliability.

For example, in addressing the factor on assessing  performance goals, DHS made efforts to consolidate software licenses  and maintenance in order to eliminate redundancy and reduce costs  associated with software licenses and maintenance. Although DHS  addressed these factors, it excluded 3 factors. Specifically, the  department did not (1) assess current costs against life-cycle costs, (2)  perform a structured schedule assessment, and (3) compare current  performance against cost baseline and estimates developed when the  investment was being planned. These factors are important because,  among other things, they provide information to agency decision makers  on whether an investment\u2019s actual annual O&M costs are as they were  planned to be and whether there is a need to examine more cost effective  approaches to meeting agency mission objectives. Table 5 shows our  analysis of DHS\u2019s assessment of its Customs and Border Protection  Infrastructure investment.", "With regard to why DHS\u2019s analyses did not address all OMB factors,  officials from the DHS Office of the Chief Information Officer (who are  responsible for overseeing the performance of OAs departmentwide)  attributed this to the department still being in the process of updating their  Management Directive 102-01 and its related guidance, which will provide  additional instructions for completing OAs. As part of this update,  department officials told us they plan to provide additional guidance on  conducting OAs for programs once they have achieved full operational  capability.

The specific reasons cited by each agency are as follows:", "DOD: Officials from DOD\u2019s Defense Information Systems Agency  stated that they did not conduct an OA for the Defense Information  Systems Network due to the fact that the investment undergoes  constant oversight through weekly meetings to review issues such as  the project status and accomplishments. Further, they said that the  program manager exercises cost, schedule, and performance  oversight using earned value management techniques. In addition,  they stated that monthly reviews of actual versus planned spending  are collected to flag any discrepancies from expected cost and  schedule objectives. While these reviews are important steps to  monitoring performance management, OMB states such ongoing  efforts to manage investment performance are not a substitute for  conducting an annual OA. According to the OMB guidance, OAs are  to be conducted for all existing IT investments to ensure that, among  other things, an investment is continuing to meet business and  customer needs and is contributing to meeting the agency\u2019s strategic  goals.", "With regard to the Next Generation Enterprise Network, officials from  the Navy who manage and oversee this investment stated an OA was  not performed due to it going through a transition from a mature  fielded system to a new service delivery model, which will become  operational in 2014. Nonetheless, OMB guidance calls for agencies to  also conduct annual analyses on all existing IT investments as part of  ensuring that such investments continue to deliver value and support  mission needs.", "DOE: Officials from the Office of the Chief Information Officer stated  that an OA was not conducted on its Consolidated Infrastructure,  Office Automation, and Telecommunications Program investment  because in the summer of 2012 they began to separate it into smaller,  more manageable pieces\u2014referred to by these agency officials as  deconsolidation\u2014 to better provide insight into the departmentwide  infrastructure. In addition, to gain further insight into the infrastructure  spending, the DOE Chief Information Officer led an in-depth analysis  in collaboration with senior IT executives, which included a commodity  IT TechStat review in the fall of 2011, and a commodity IT  PortfolioStat review in the fall of 2012. While these latter reviews are  helpful in monitoring performance, our analysis shows that they do not  fully address all 17 OMB factors. Specifically, the reviews do not  address, among other things, factors in the areas of customer  satisfaction, strategic and business results, and financial performance.  Addressing these factors is important because it provides information  to agency decision makers on whether the investment supports  customer processes and is delivering the goods and services it was  designed to deliver.", "HHS: According to officials from the department\u2019s National Institutes  of Health, the National Institutes of Health IT Infrastructure  investment, which had an annual budget of $371 million for fiscal year  2012, did not undergo an OA because this investment is an  aggregation of all the components\u2019 infrastructure and not a particular  system or set of systems suited for this kind of macro analysis. In  addition, they noted that National Institutes of Health does monitor the  operational performance of its IT infrastructure and conducts a more  strategic analysis of services within its IT infrastructure to evaluate the  operational effectiveness at a strategic level.

However,  VA has not yet determined when these analyses will be completed.", "NASA: Officials from NASA\u2019s Office of the Chief Information Officer  stated while they did not conduct a formal OA on the NASA IT  Infrastructure investment, they did review the performance of the  investment using monthly performance status reviews and bimonthly  service delivery transition status updates. The officials noted that  these reviews address financial performance, schedule,  transformation initiatives, risks, customer satisfaction, performance  metrics, and business results. According to officials, the investment  underwent a service delivery transition status update and a  performance status review in May 2012. While these NASA reviews  are essential IT management tools, they do not incorporate all 17  OMB factors.

Although OMB has established that  agencies are to use OAs to evaluate the performance of such  investments, their use by the agencies on these investments was very  limited. DHS was the only agency to perform such an assessment and in  doing so largely addressed the required OMB factors. While Treasury and  VA had planned to perform analyses, they had not done so. Further,  DOD, DOE, HHS, NASA, and SSA had not intended to perform these  analyses on their large O&M investments. This limited use of OAs is due  in part to a number of factors, including agencies relying on other types of  performance oversight reviews that can be helpful but are not intended to  be a substitute for these assessments. Until these agencies address  these shortcomings and ensure all their large O&M investments are fully  assessed, there is increased risk that these agencies will not know  whether these multibillion dollar investments fully meet intended  objectives, including whether there are more efficient ways to deliver their  intended purpose."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that the largest IT O&M investments are being adequately  analyzed, we recommend that the", "Secretary of Defense direct appropriate officials to perform OAs on  the two investments identified in this report, including ensuring the  analyses include all OMB factors;", "Secretary of Energy direct appropriate officials to perform an OA on  the investment identified in this report, including ensuring the analysis  includes all OMB factors;", "Secretary of Health and Human Services direct appropriate officials to  perform an OA on the investment identified in this report, including  ensuring the analysis includes all OMB factors;", "Secretary of Treasury direct appropriate officials to perform an OA on  the investment identified in this report, including ensuring the analysis  include all OMB factors;", "Secretary of Veterans Affairs direct appropriate officials to perform  OAs on the two investments identified in this report, including  ensuring the analyses include all OMB factors;", "NASA Administrator direct appropriate officials to perform an OA on  the investment identified in this report, including ensuring the analysis  includes all OMB factors; and", "Commissioner of Social Security direct appropriate officials to perform  an OA on the investment identified in this report, including ensuring  the analysis includes all OMB factors.", "In addition, we recommend that the Secretary of Homeland Security  direct appropriate officials to ensure the department\u2019s OA for the Customs  and Border Protection Infrastructure is complete and assesses missing  OMB factors identified in this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on a draft of this report, four agencies\u2014DHS, NASA, SSA,  and VA\u2014agreed with our recommendations; two agencies\u2014DOD and  DOE\u2014partially agreed; and two agencies\u2014HHS and Treasury\u2014had no  comments.

It also stated that since 2008, SSA has had a  process to perform OAs on investments that were solely in O&M  and that it recently expanded the process to include mixed life  cycle IT investments that have significant systems in O&M. SSA  further commented that it was in the process of performing OAs  on the SSA mixed life cycle investment identified in our report and  other similar agency investments, with the goal of completing  these analyses by September 30, 2013.

The department further agreed with our  recommendation that it perform an OA on its Defense Information  System Network investment.", "The department disagreed with our recommendation to perform  an OA on its Next Generation Enterprise Network investment  stating the investment is no longer in O&M and such investments,  per OMB policy, do not require an OA. More specifically, as noted  earlier in this report, DOD is transitioning the investment from a  mature fielded system to a new service delivery model, which will  become operational in 2014, and has moved the entire investment  back into planning and acquisition.

In addition, to determine how these 10 investments support  their agencies\u2019 missions, we reviewed OMB and agency documentation  (e.g., exhibit 300s, exhibit 53s) and interviewed agency officials.", "To determine the extent to which OAs were conducted to manage these  investments in accordance with OMB guidance, we analyzed agency  documentation and interviewed responsible agency officials to determine  whether any operational analyses had been performed on these 10  investments during fiscal year 2012 because it was the last full year for  completing OAs. In those cases where an OA had been performed, we  compared it against OMB guidance on conducting them, including the 17  factors that are to be addressed as part of such assessments, to identify  any variances. Where there were variances, we reviewed agency  documentation and interviewed agency officials responsible for the OA to  identify the cause of their occurrence. In those instances where an  analysis was not performed, we reviewed documentation and interviewed  agency officials to identify why it was not done.", "To assess whether each of the eight agency\u2019s major IT investments are in  development, mixed life cycle, or steady state, we analyzed agencies\u2019  reported spending data provided to OMB as part of the budget process to  determine what phase the majority of the investments were in and where  the majority of funds were invested (i.e., development, mixed, or steady  state). To assess the reliability of the data we analyzed, we corroborated  them by interviewing investment and other agency officials to determine  whether the OMB information we used was consistent with that reported  by the agencies; based on this assessment, we determined the data were  reliable for the purposes of this report. Further, to assess the extent to  which these and other agency IT O&M investments involve development  activities, we analyzed agency data and evaluated whether the eight  agencies were using their O&M funds for development activities (i.e.,  through the reprogramming or reallocation of funds). Specifically, we  compared what agencies planned to spend on development and O&M  with what was reported to have been spent to identify any variances that  indicated O&M funds were reprogrammed and used for development  activities. In addition, we reviewed agencies\u2019 documentation to determine  if agencies had any processes in place to manage investments  transitioning from development to O&M. Lastly, we reviewed agency  documentation and interviewed agency IT budget and investment officials  to verify whether any reprogramming occurred, its causes, and the extent  of which any reprogramming was subject to management oversight.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2012 to October  2013 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
