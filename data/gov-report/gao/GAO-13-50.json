The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 created the Medicaid Integrity Program to oversee and support state program integrity activities. CMS, the federal agency within HHS that oversees Medicaid, established the MIG to implement this new program. This report assesses (1) the MIG's use of two types of contractors to review and audit state Medicaid claims, (2) the MIG's implementation of other oversight and support activities, and (3) CMS and state reporting on the results of their program integrity activities. GAO analyzed MIG data on its contractors' audits, training program for state officials, comprehensive state reviews, and state assessments; analyzed reports that summarized the monetary returns from MIG and state program integrity activities; and interviewed MIG officials, contractors, and state program integrity officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Medicaid Integrity Group's (MIG) hiring of separate review and audit contractors for its National Medicaid Audit Program (NMAP) was inefficient and led to duplication because key functions were performed by both entities. Review contractors analyze state claims data to identify aberrant claims or billing anomalies while audit contractors conduct postpayment audits to determine if payments to providers were improper. Because both types of contractors had to assess whether payments were improper under state Medicaid policies, having separate contractors doubled states' burden in ensuring that state policies were being correctly applied. Also, poor coordination and communication between the two types of contractors resulted in duplicative data analysis. In turn, these inefficiencies added to the length of audits, which on average took almost 23 months to complete. By contrast, the average duration of six audits using a more collaborative and coordinated approach was 16 months, and the amount of identified overpayments increased significantly.", "Other MIG oversight and support activities--the free training provided to state officials through the Medicaid Integrity Institute, the evaluation of state program integrity procedures through triennial comprehensive reviews, and the collection of data from states through annual assessments--show mixed results in enhancing program integrity efforts. According to state officials, the modest expenditures on the institute result in valuable training and networking opportunities. The MIG, however, has not taken advantage of the potential for comprehensive reviews to inform the selection of states for federal audits. Although the MIG's comprehensive reviews yield considerable information about state program integrity vulnerabilities, states with serious program integrity vulnerabilities often had few NMAP audits. Furthermore, the data collected through state program integrity assessments (SPIA) duplicate data collected through comprehensive reviews and other reports, are not validated, and, even if the data were accurate, are less current than similar data from other sources.", "Reporting by the Centers for Medicaid & Medicaid Services (CMS) on the return on investment (ROI) from the activities of the MIG is inadequate. CMS's annual reports to Congress provide a limited picture of ROI for NMAP audits, which account for over half of the MIG's annual expenditures, and it is difficult to calculate an ROI with the expenditure and activity information provided. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recently announced that it will discontinue reporting a separate ROI for NMAP. In addition, CMS's ROI methodology includes a percentage of state-identified overpayments reported on the SPIA, which is questionable. To date, CMS has not published an ROI methodology. Regarding state reporting of recoveries, we found that most states were not fully reporting recoveries according to specific program integrity activities and that a sizable number appeared to underreport aggregate recoveries compared to other sources. For example, one state reported aggregate recoveries of about $195,000 over 3 years to CMS but about $36 million in its annual report to the governor for 2 of these years. The apparent gaps in state reporting of such recoveries make it difficult to determine whether states are returning the federal share of recovered overpayments. A full accounting of state and NMAP related recoveries is vital for measuring the effectiveness of efforts to reduce improper payments."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the CMS Administrator (1) eliminate duplication by merging contractor functions, (2) use comprehensive reviews to better target audits, (3) follow up with states to ensure reliable reporting of their program integrity recoveries, (4) discontinue the SPIA, and (5) reevaluate and publish its ROI methodology. In response, HHS concurred with three of GAO's recommendations and partially concurred with the need to eliminate SPIA-related duplication and to reevaluate CMS's ROI methodology.

To track the value of its program integrity activities, the  MIG developed a formula to measure return on investment (ROI),  including both direct and indirect benefits. The MIG, in conjunction with  Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services, also developed a mechanism for  states to report recoveries from fraud, waste, and abuse at a more  detailed level than previously as a part of CMS\u2019s fiscal oversight of state  Medicaid expenditures."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "NMAP Audits", "paragraphs": ["The NMAP program accounts for about half of the $75 million  appropriated annually for the Medicaid integrity program.

One contractor reviews states\u2019 paid claims data to  identify aberrant claims or billing anomalies.", "Audit function. A different audit contractor conducts targeted provider  audits to determine whether or not the provider received an  overpayment.", "As of July 2012, the MIG had two review contractors and three separate  audit contractors.", "Since its inception, the MIG has used three different approaches to  conducting NMAP audits\u2014test audits, Medicaid Statistical Information  System (MSIS) audits, and, more recently, collaborative audits. As we  noted in our June 2012 report on NMAP, the test and collaborative audits  differed from the MSIS audits in two important ways: the test and  collaborative audits (1) leveraged state expertise to identify potential audit  targets, rather than having the MIG select potential targets on the basis of  the work of its review contractors; and (2) primarily used state Medicaid  Management Information System (MMIS) data rather than MSIS data.  The MMIS is a mechanized claims-processing and information-retrieval  system maintained by individual states that generally reflects real-time  payments and adjustments of detailed claims for each health care service  provided. The MSIS audits relied on MSIS data, which contains extracts  from states\u2019 MMIS databases. Because MSIS is a subset of states\u2019 MMIS  data files, MSIS data are missing elements that can assist in audits, such  as the explanations of benefit codes and the names of providers and  beneficiaries. In addition, MSIS data are not current because of late state  submissions and the time it takes CMS\u2019s contractors to review and  validate the data.", "We recently reported that the identified overpayments from MSIS audits  were significantly lower than those identified by test and collaborative  audits.  As of February 2012, 59 of the 1,550 MSIS audits identified   $7.4 million in potential overpayments.

Finally, we also  reported that the main reason the NMAP audits were ineffective was the  use of MSIS data, which are inadequate for reviewing claims and  selecting audit targets. Further, the MSIS audits were not well  coordinated with states, duplicated state program integrity activities, and  diverted resources from states\u2019 activities. When we spoke about the MSIS  audits with 11 states, some indicated that participation in MSIS audits  diverted staff from their regular duties.", "In addition to the NMAP, the MIG has implemented three activities that  are the core of its support and oversight of state program integrity\u2014the  Medicaid Integrity Institute, comprehensive reviews, and SPIA. Less than  half of the MIG\u2019s $75 million annual budget supports these three  activities. The MIG has also developed a methodology for computing the  ROI for its activities.", "Medicaid Integrity Institute. In 2007, the MIG established the Medicaid  Integrity Institute, the first national Medicaid training program for state  program integrity officials. CMS executed an interagency agreement with  the Department of Justice to house the institute at the National Advocacy  Center, located at the University of South Carolina. At no cost to states,  the institute offers substantive training and support in a structured  learning environment. In time, the institute intends to create a  credentialing process to elevate the professional qualifications of state  Medicaid program integrity staff.", "Comprehensive reviews. In 2007, the MIG initiated triennial  comprehensive state program integrity reviews, which assess each  state\u2019s Medicaid program integrity procedures and processes. Topics  covered include program integrity organization and staffing, postpayment  review and fraud identification, investigation, and referral. The objective of  the reviews is to assess the effectiveness of states\u2019 program integrity  activities and compliance with federal program integrity laws. As of fiscal  year 2011, the MIG had reviewed all states once (as well as the District of  Columbia, and Puerto Rico) and 26 states twice.

The DRA required CMS to hire  contractors to review and audit provider claims. According to MIG  officials, they initially believed that the DRA required the use of separate  contractors but, in hindsight, concluded that these activities could have  been performed by one contractor.", "State Medicaid policies. The MIG\u2019s decision to use separate review and  audit contractors meant that both entities had to master the details of  numerous state Medicaid policies related to eligibility, benefits, and claims  processing in order to appropriately assess whether payments were  improper. Although MIG officials told us that they were sensitive to the  burden placed on states by the establishment of NMAP, the use of  separate review and audit contractors nonetheless increased states\u2019  administrative burden because both types of contractors performed the  same function and states had to review the contractors\u2019 work to ensure  that state policies were applied correctly. States provided feedback about  the samples prepared by the review contractors, which in some cases  reflected a misunderstanding of state policy. In addition, state officials  told us that they found themselves educating audit contractors about state  Medicaid policies. The MIG\u2019s two review contractors were responsible  for learning and correctly applying the policies of 22 and 28 states,  respectively, while the three audit contractors were required to master the  policies of from 8 to as many as 24 states. Officials from one state noted  that becoming fully knowledgeable about all the policies affecting state  program integrity audits could take 2 to 3 years. According to several  state officials, the lack of an in-depth knowledge of state policy  contributed to unproductive provider audits. For example, according to  one state official, the MIG and its contractors had mistakenly identified  overpayments for federally qualified health centers because they  assumed that centers should receive reduced payments for an  established patient on subsequent visits. The contractors were not aware  that these types of centers are paid on an encounter basis, which makes  the same payment for the first and follow-up visits.", "Data analysis. The use of separate review and audit contractors  increased inefficiencies in data analysis, which also led to duplication of  effort. The review contractors\u2019 primary function was using algorithms to  analyze MSIS data with the goal of identifying potential improper  payments. Audit contractors also analyzed MSIS data to learn more about  targeted providers and the services for which they billed. However, the  audit contractors duplicated certain data analyses that had already been  performed by the review contractors, such as performing their own  verification of the completeness and accuracy of MSIS data. For example,  one audit contractor reported that the presence of large numbers of  duplicate claims in the MSIS data resulted in a significant commitment of  the contractor\u2019s analytical and data management resources for 66 audit  targets that were subsequently discontinued.", "The inefficiencies of having both review and audit contractors were  exacerbated by the MIG\u2019s communication policies. All communication,  whether between review and audit contractors or between contractors  and states, went through a multistep process controlled by the MIG and,  as a result, the audit contractors could not easily communicate with the  review contractors to verify specific details of the review contractors\u2019 data  analyses. Two audit contractors\u2019 lessons-learned reports recommended  closer collaboration between audit and review contractors during the  algorithm vetting process and target selection to prevent duplicative data  analysis. In addition, the inability to communicate freely inhibited  contractors from taking full advantage of states\u2019 knowledge of their own  Medicaid policies. The HHS-OIG reported a similar finding that the MIG\u2019s  communication policy also contributed to a duplication of contractor  functions. To improve coordination and communication between the  contractors, MIG officials told us they began monthly conference calls in  mid-2011 that included both the review and audit contractors working in  the same geographic area. One audit contractor stated that the improved  communication with the review contractor has increased the efficacy of  their audits specifically related to early readmissions and hospice.", "Several of the MIG\u2019s recent changes to NMAP may reduce, but not  eliminate, duplication. Although review contractors were not initially  involved in collaborative audits, MIG officials told us that collaborative  audits were evolving and in some cases the review contractors are  conducting data analysis on state supplied MMIS data or are continuing  to analyze MSIS data in order to identify potential audit targets. However, they told us that review contractors are collaborating more  closely with states to validate any MSIS data findings using MMIS data.  Moreover, in July 2012, the MIG told us that while it planned to retain two  review contractors, it would reduce their workload overall and realign their  geographic areas of responsibility to ensure that all states are still  supported.

However, it also  incorporates a percentage of the identified overpayments reported on the  SPIA, which are self-reported and not validated.

These results appear questionable given that 5 of the 15 states  were among the 20 states with the highest Medicaid expenditures in fiscal  year 2010. Additionally, total reported recoveries for all states in fiscal  year 2010 represented only about 0.28 percent of state Medicaid  expenditures, significantly less than CMS\u2019s estimate that improper  payments accounted for about 8 percent of state Medicaid expenditures  in fiscal year 2011.", "In addition, although CMS implemented more detailed state reporting of  recovered overpayments beginning in fiscal year 2010, we found that  most states were not fully reporting recoveries by the specific type of  activity that resulted in the recovery. In fiscal year 2011, the second year  of detailed reporting of program integrity recoveries, 36 or more states  reported no recoveries for specific state-based activities that generally  produce program integrity recoveries, such as state data analysis,  provider audits, or MFCU investigations (see fig. 5).", "The underreporting of program integrity recoveries occurs despite CMS\u2019s  validation efforts. CMS\u2019s financial review protocols specify that quarterly  desk reviews must be completed for every state in every quarter, and  yearly on-site reviews must be completed for the 20 states with the  greatest Medicaid expenditures in the preceding fiscal year. On-site  review protocols explicitly instruct the reviewer to verify the reported  aggregated amount of fraud, waste, and abuse recoveries, and CMS  regional office staff may conduct on-site reviews in additional states as  appropriate. CMS staff told us that its financial review protocols  encompass hundreds of pages and that reporting of fraud, waste, and  abuse recoveries is a small portion of the items they are responsible for  validating. They commented that their limited reviews did not allow them  to know whether or not fraud, waste, and abuse recoveries were listed  elsewhere as a part of the state\u2019s quarterly expenditure reporting because  states may report recoveries as an offset to other expenditures or may  report them comingled with other credits that are not fraud, waste, or  abuse-related.", "Further, CMS staff offered several explanations for the reporting gaps we  identified, including the observation that it is not unusual for states to take  several years to come into compliance with new reporting requirements.  This delay may reflect the fact that states\u2019 accounting processes may  differ from the new instructions and states may need to change their  processes or data systems to accommodate the new reporting  requirements. CMS officials also said that states may have reported their    recoveries as an adjustment that decreased claims from prior quarters. While it is plausible that state accounting systems may differ from the  recently implemented federal reporting requirements, states have had a  long-standing requirement to report their recoveries of overpayments in  the aggregate.

In addition, CMS and states\u2019 reporting on the results of their program  integrity activities are not transparent and are incomplete. Specifically:", "The MIG\u2019s decision to hire separate review and audit contractors was  inefficient and contributed to overlap and duplication. For example,  both types of contractors were engaged in data analysis and both had  to be cognizant of state Medicaid policies, which increased the burden  on states.", "Although the MIG\u2019s comprehensive reviews yield considerable  information about state structural and data-analysis vulnerabilities,  there is no apparent connection between the reviews\u2019 findings and the  selection of states for NMAP audits. Thus, states with serious  program integrity vulnerabilities often had few NMAP audits.", "Information that the MIG collects through the SPIAs is unreliable.  Even if SPIAs were accurate, their value is unclear because similar  and more timely information is collected through other sources, such  as the comprehensive reviews.", "Computing an ROI for the entire Medicaid Integrity Program that  reflects the outcomes from all MIG expenditures is complex because it  involves measuring both direct and indirect benefits.

In its written  comments, HHS stated that CMS was currently revising its  Comprehensive Medicaid Integrity Plan covering fiscal years 2013  through 2017 in order to address the duplication and inefficiencies that we  had identified in the Medicaid Integrity Program. According to HHS, the  plan will unveil significant changes to improve the efficiency of the  agency\u2019s Medicaid integrity activities. In response to our five  recommendations, HHS concurred with three recommendations and  partially concurred with two others.", "Review and audit contractor functions. HHS said that it concurred with our  recommendation to merge the functions of its review and audit  contractors in order to eliminate duplication and use contractor resources  more efficiently. The department stated that it was evaluating options for  consolidating its contractors\u2019 work within current statutory and  procurement requirements.", "Comprehensive reviews and recovery reporting. HHS also concurred with  our recommendations to (1) use the comprehensive program integrity  reviews to better inform NMAP, and (2) increase efforts to hold states  accountable for reliably reporting program integrity recoveries as part of  their quarterly expenditure reporting. With regard to the comprehensive  reviews, HHS stated that CMS would work to improve the integration of  the knowledge gained from the comprehensive reviews to help identify  the states and program areas representing the greatest risks to the  Medicaid program, which, in turn, would influence the agency\u2019s national  audit strategy. In terms of holding states accountable, the department  indicated that it would work through its regional offices to include state  recovery reporting in the risk assessment used to select areas for  financial management reviews, which validate state reported data. In  addition, it will continue to provide the necessary training to states to help  facilitate reliable recovery reporting.", "ROI methodology and reporting. HHS partially concurred with our  recommendation to reevaluate the methodology used to calculate an ROI  for the Medicaid Integrity Program, including reporting separately on  NMAP, and to share its methodology with Congress and the states. HHS  indicated that CMS annually reevaluates the methodology and has  provided descriptions of the methodology in documents that are, or will  soon be, available to the public, such as the fiscal year 2013 annual  budget justification for CMS. We found that those descriptions were  limited and that the budget justification was less detailed than the ROI  methodology that CMS shared with us, which is summarized in table 2 of  this report. HHS also noted that CMS\u2019s methodology will become public  when our report is published. HHS said that CMS will be reviewing the  scope of what should be included in the calculation of ROI for the  Medicaid Integrity Program but it did not address our concern that taking  an additional percentage of states\u2019 own identified overpayments was  questionable. HHS did not concur that an ROI should be reported  separately for NMAP because it believes that CMS\u2019s Medicaid program  integrity investments interact with one another and NMAP ROI would be a  misleading index of the work and impact of the Medicaid Integrity  Program. We continue to believe that separately reporting an NMAP ROI  is essential to hold CMS accountable for the effective operation of those  audits, which constituted about half of CMS\u2019s annual expenditures on the  Medicaid Integrity Program.", "SPIA. HHS partially concurred with our recommendation and said that it  would suspend the annual state program integrity assessments while  taking steps to address the limitations that we had identified. HHS stated  that the triennial comprehensive state program integrity reviews alone  may not provide adequate data to inform CMS oversight. Although the  department acknowledged the reporting overlap between the SPIA and  comprehensive reviews, it stated that CMS was now working to  streamline the comprehensive review questionnaires to eliminate  duplication. HHS also indicated that CMS\u2019s forthcoming Comprehensive  Medicaid Integrity Plan would outline plans to enhance the SPIA by  refining the data collection tool, reducing the reporting time lag, and  providing for data validation and correction by CMS staff during the  triennial comprehensive reviews. We believe that CMS\u2019s efforts to  address overlap by eliminating duplicative information collected though  the comprehensive reviews does not take into account the considerable  resources that states devote to filling out the comprehensive review  questionnaires, which CMS officials have the opportunity to discuss and  verify during week-long site visits. In contrast, SPIA data are collected  through a web-based survey, which is inconsistently completed and  viewed as a burden by states. Although CMS believes the annual SPIA  data are important to its program integrity mission and plans to reduce the  current reporting time lag, it has not clearly articulated how it will or could  use this information to inform its oversight. In addition, state recoveries  and program integrity expenditures are reported to CMS on a quarterly  basis, which would provide a more reliable financial accounting of states\u2019  program integrity activities.
