Medicare pays for about 80 percent of LTCH patient care. To ensure compliance with federal quality standards, accrediting organizations (AO) and state survey agencies under contract with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) conduct routine and complaint surveys. One AO, The Joint Commission (TJC), surveys most LTCHs. In a November 2010 report, GAO compared oversight of LTCHs to that of other facilities. In this report, GAO examined the extent to which CMS collects data about LTCHs' quality of care and oversees LTCH survey activities. To do this work, GAO analyzed CMS data on the results of LTCH surveys and discussed oversight activities with both CMS and AO officials. GAO assessed the reliability of the survey data and took steps to ensure that the data presented were reliable."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["CMS collects some data on the quality of care at LTCHs, but the data are limited for several reasons. First, CMS does not have detailed data on the results of surveys conducted by TJC prior to 2009 and has limited data on current surveys because TJC did not begin submitting detailed data to CMS until July 2009. CMS does have prior year and current survey data for state-surveyed LTCHs--about 16 percent of LTCHs. In addition, current survey results in CMS's databases may be incomplete because these databases do not always accurately identify (1) the organization responsible for surveying each LTCH and (2) whether a facility is, in fact, an LTCH. As of fiscal year 2010, CMS data showed a total of 447 LTCHs, but GAO identified 18 LTCHs incorrectly categorized in one CMS database as having been surveyed by state survey agencies. GAO also found 56 LTCHs either misidentified as acute care hospitals or missing from another CMS database that contains information on LTCHs surveyed by accrediting organizations. Second, CMS does not currently collect data on quality measures--information used to evaluate how health care is delivered--from LTCHs because, unlike other types of hospitals, LTCHs are not yet required to report them. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act enacted in 2010 requires LTCHs to report quality measures by 2014. CMS's oversight of state survey agency and AO survey activities of LTCHs is limited. Two of CMS's three oversight approaches do not focus on LTCHs specifically, but on hospitals in general. First, CMS established performance measures--expectations regarding survey activities or the reporting of survey results--for survey organizations, but reports the results of its assessments for hospitals in general rather than for LTCHs specifically. Second, state survey agencies conduct surveys annually in AO-accredited hospitals--known as validation surveys--to assess the effectiveness of the AO surveys, but have not systematically included some LTCHs in the sample of hospitals subject to validation surveys. Additional validation surveys are done based on complaints. State survey agencies conducted more than 1,000 validation surveys over a 5-year period based on complaints in LTCHs that had been surveyed by TJC. CMS does not refer such complaints to TJC for investigation. As a result, TJC conducted few complaint surveys. Although CMS has instructed its regional offices to provide TJC with the results of these surveys, GAO found that these data were not always shared. CMS's third oversight approach--collection and analysis of data on the results of survey organizations' activities--has not utilized all the available data to identify problems that may require further investigation. GAO identified several potential areas where the data may assist CMS in more effectively overseeing survey activities at LTCHs, such as how effectively states triage and conduct complaint validation surveys."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CMS strengthen its oversight of LTCHs by improving available data on quality of care and by improving oversight of LTCH survey activities. HHS concurred with all of the recommendations. TJC agreed with most of them, but disagreed with the value of state oversight surveys of AO-surveyed LTCHs. We continue to believe that such surveys are an important part of CMS oversight of LTCH survey activities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Allegations about quality-of-care problems have raised questions about  the oversight of long-term care hospitals (LTCH). The more than 400  LTCHs are a small subset of the approximately 4,800 acute care,  psychiatric, and rehabilitation hospitals that also provide post-acute care  services to clinically complex individuals who have multiple acute or  chronic conditions. Medicare is the predominant payer for LTCHs.  According to a recent report prepared for the Centers for Medicare   & Medicaid Services (CMS), about 80 percent of patients admitted to  LTCHs are covered by Medicare. CMS is an agency within the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).", "As part of evaluating the quality of care provided to patients, CMS  requires all hospitals, including LTCHs, to demonstrate compliance with  federal Medicare quality standards. Compliance is assessed through   (1) routine surveys, which are unannounced, on-site inspections  conducted every 3 to 5 years, and (2) complaint surveys, which may be  conducted when a complaint is received. LTCHs are surveyed using the  same quality standards that are applied to acute care hospitals (ACH)\u2014 there are currently no additional quality standards that are specific to  LTCHs. Although LTCHs are a type of ACH, they do not necessarily  provide the full range of surgical, diagnostic, and emergency services and  may not have the same level of staffing provided in a typical ACH.  During a routine or complaint survey, surveyors may identify areas where  a quality standard is not being met and may cite a deficiency, which  demonstrates that the LTCH has failed to meet federal Medicare quality  standards. In general, LTCHs may choose who conducts their routine  surveys\u2014a state survey agency under contract with CMS or a CMS- approved accreditation organization (AO). Most LTCHs\u2014about   80 percent\u2014are surveyed by one AO, The Joint Commission (TJC). In  turn, CMS is responsible for overseeing the survey activities of both state  survey agencies and AOs, which depends on the availability of accurate  and timely information. In our November 2010 report for you, we noted  that CMS\u2019s oversight focuses on hospitals in general and not LTCHs  specifically. In this report, we examine other issues you raised.  Specifically, we examine the extent to which CMS (1) collects data about  the quality of care at LTCHs and (2) oversees survey activities at LTCHs.", "To examine the extent to which CMS collects data about the quality of  care provided at LTCHs, we analyzed data on the results of routine and  complaint surveys from CMS databases, including the number of and  most commonly cited deficiencies. For state survey agencies, we  analyzed deficiency data for surveys conducted from fiscal year 2005  through fiscal year 2010 to ensure that we had as many routine surveys  for state-surveyed LTCHs as possible. For TJC-surveyed LTCHs, we  analyzed deficiency data for surveys conducted in fiscal year 2010  because TJC did not begin submitting detailed data to CMS on the  deficiencies identified during its surveys until July 2009. We compared the  survey results for LTCHs to those for ACHs because LTCHs are a type of  ACH. We also examined CMS efforts to develop quality measures.  Quality measures are used to evaluate how health care is delivered, and  information obtained from such measures can promote accountability  among health care providers and help consumers make informed choices  about their care.", "To examine the extent to which CMS oversees survey activities at  LTCHs, we examined (1) federal statutes, as well as CMS regulations  and guidance, on state survey agency and AO survey activities;   (2) performance measures that are used to assess the activities of state  survey agencies and AOs; and (3) CMS\u2019s use of survey data to assess  the adequacy of survey processes, including the results of surveys  conducted by state survey agencies in TJC-surveyed LTCHs from fiscal  year 2005 through fiscal year 2010. To better understand the type and  quality of information that CMS and TJC share with each other, we  examined two judgmentally selected state survey agency complaint  surveys conducted at TJC-surveyed LTCHs. Criteria we used to select  these surveys included media coverage, the involvement of different CMS  regional offices, and complaint surveys that occurred both before and  after CMS issued guidance in 2008 intended to improve information  sharing between CMS and AOs. We interviewed officials at CMS  headquarters and two regional offices to obtain information on the  feedback provided to TJC on the results of these complaint surveys.  Additionally, we analyzed CMS data on the results of all types of surveys,  including the number of surveys, the number that cited serious  deficiencies, and the resources used to conduct the surveys.", "For both objectives, we reviewed documents and interviewed officials  from CMS, including officials from CMS\u2019s Office of Survey and  Certification, Division of National Systems, Office of Clinical Standards  and Quality, and seven regional offices; TJC; National Quality Forum  (NQF); Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC); and the two  LTCH associations\u2014Acute Long Term Hospital Association and National  Association of Long Term Hospitals. We excluded two of the three AOs  that survey LTCHs from our analyses\u2014the American Osteopathic  Association and Det Norske Veritas Healthcare, Inc.\u2014because,  combined, they surveyed approximately 3 percent of LTCHs in fiscal year  2010. To ensure the reliability of the data we collected, we interviewed  officials from CMS and TJC to verify completeness and accuracy of our  data and reviewed documentation related to the data collected to identify  obvious errors. We identified data limitations involving accurate  identification of the survey organization responsible for surveying each  LTCH, which we discussed with CMS and the AOs. Based on these  discussions and further analyses, we made appropriate adjustments to  ensure the reliability of the data we report on LTCH quality of care. Based  on these activities, we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable  for our purposes.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2010 through  September 2011 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.

For example, a significant subset of LTCH patients  is dependent on a ventilator for breathing and receives therapy to help  them breathe on their own. Most LTCH patients have been transferred  from intensive or critical care units of ACHs, which provide general,   short-term care for a broad range of medical conditions. LTCHs are not  evenly distributed across the nation and patients who could be treated by  LTCHs might instead receive care at ACHs, other types of hospitals, or  nursing homes. Medicare generally pays more for hospital stays in  LTCHs than in ACHs. In fiscal year 2010, Medicare paid an estimated  $4.7 billion for care provided in more than 400 LTCHs for about 138,000  discharges, which averages more than $34,000 per discharge."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Surveys, Survey Organizations, and Standards", "paragraphs": ["To assess whether LTCHs meet federal quality standards, state survey  agencies and AOs conduct two types of surveys\u2014routine and complaint.  Routine surveys are unannounced and are conducted at specific  intervals. State survey frequencies are resource driven and depend on  CMS\u2019s annual funding level for such activities. CMS\u2019s policy has been  for state survey agencies to conduct surveys every 3 to 5 years since  fiscal year 2001. In contrast, AO policy is to conduct surveys every   3 years. Complaint surveys are conducted in response to allegations of  quality problems made by families, patients, health care workers, or  others and provide survey organizations the opportunity to intervene  promptly if problems arise between routine surveys. Complaint surveys  may be conducted either by a state survey agency or an AO. However,  most complaints are filed with state survey agencies, which conduct  complaint surveys both at the LTCHs they survey as well as at AO- surveyed LTCHs. Complaint surveys focus on the specific allegations  made and surveyors generally only assess the hospital\u2019s compliance with  standards related to those allegations.", "In general, hospitals have a choice of who conducts their surveys\u2014state  survey agencies using federal Medicare standards or CMS-approved AOs  that use requirements CMS has determined to be at least equivalent to  those standards. Federal Medicare standards consist of 74 standards  that are organized under 23 conditions of participation (COP), including  categories such as Medical Staff, Infection Control, and Emergency  Services. TJC, one of three AOs approved by CMS to survey hospitals,  surveys the majority of LTCHs. TJC\u2019s standards for hospitals are  organized into 17 categories, such as Medication Management,  Leadership, and Medical Staff; each category consists of numerous  standards. Prior to the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers  Act of 2008, TJC had unique statutory deeming authority for hospitals and  did not need to apply to CMS to be recognized as a national accreditation  body for hospitals. This legislation revoked TJC\u2019s statutory deeming  authority effective July 15, 2010, and gave CMS the authority to review  and approve TJC\u2019s hospital accreditation program. As a result, in 2009,  CMS evaluated the standards and processes used by TJC to conduct  hospital surveys, including a comparison of TJC\u2019s standards to  Medicare\u2019s and a review of the qualifications of its surveyors. CMS  approved TJC\u2019s hospital accreditation program effective July 15, 2010,  through July 15, 2014.", "When surveyors find quality problems during routine and complaint  surveys, they cite either deficiencies or requirements for improvement  (RFI), depending on the survey organization.  \uf0b7  State survey agencies cite deficiencies that are characterized as  either standard- or COP-level based on the seriousness of the  deficiency. Standard-level deficiencies denote less serious quality  problems, while COP-level deficiencies are cited when the problems  are serious or systemic in nature. A serious problem is defined as a  shortcoming in a hospital\u2019s quality of services that adversely affects,  or has the potential to adversely affect, the quality of patient care.  When deficiencies are found, a hospital may be required to submit a  plan of correction, detailing how and when it will address the  deficiencies. If a hospital does not correct the deficiencies cited within  the required time frame, CMS may terminate the hospital\u2019s  participation in the Medicare program.  \uf0b7  TJC cites direct and indirect RFIs when hospitals are found to be out  of compliance with TJC\u2019s standards on routine or complaint surveys.  According to TJC, direct RFIs are cited when compliance issues are  directly tied to quality, such as untreated pain; while indirect RFIs are  cited when compliance issues are indirectly related to quality, such as  hospital leadership. A hospital that does not correct all of its RFIs may  receive conditional or preliminary denial of accreditation. A hospital  may be denied accreditation if it has exhausted all review and appeal  opportunities, failed to pay the accreditation fee, or refused to allow a  survey. CMS may subsequently terminate hospitals from Medicare  participation if they lose their accreditation.", "CMS collects information on state survey results in its On-line Survey,  Certification, and Reporting system (OSCAR). To collect data on the  results of AO surveys, CMS established its Accrediting Organization  System for Storing User Recorded Experiences (ASSURE) database in  2008.

This payment reduction applies to hospitals paid  under Medicare\u2019s inpatient prospective payment system, which covers  most types of hospitals but not LTCHs.

AO performance measures focus on their ability to provide CMS  with consistent, accurate, complete, and timely information on the  facilities they survey.

Validation surveys have consequences for both AOs and facilities. State  survey agencies conduct two types of validation surveys. The first type is  a full survey of a sample of AO-surveyed facilities, known as traditional  validation surveys. Traditional validation surveys are generally conducted  within 60 days following a routine survey conducted by an AO. CMS  selects a sample of hospitals for these surveys based on the hospital\u2019s  most recent routine survey date and available resources. While CMS  policy calls for approximately 1 percent of AO-surveyed hospitals to  receive traditional validation surveys each fiscal year, since fiscal year  2007 CMS has supplemented the funding provided to states in order to  increase the sample size to 2 percent or higher. Because of budgetary  constraints, the number has fluctuated from a 10-year high of 235 in fiscal  year 1999 to about 90 in fiscal year 2009. The second type of validation  survey is a complaint validation survey, which occurs when a state survey  agency investigates a complaint for a hospital surveyed by an AO. Unlike  traditional validation surveys that are conducted within 60 days of a  routine survey, complaint validation surveys are generally conducted  when the complaint is received. Such surveys initially focus on the  condition(s) alleged to be out of compliance. If the complaint validation  survey cites one or more COP-level deficiencies, the facility is placed  under the jurisdiction of the state survey agency. Subsequently, the state  survey agency conducts a full survey of all COPs. When all COP-level  deficiencies have been corrected, the facility again becomes the  responsibility of the AO.", "CMS submits an annual report to Congress after the end of the fiscal  year\u2014known as the CMS Financial Report\u2014that includes information on  traditional validation surveys conducted at hospitals surveyed by AOs.  Based on such surveys, CMS calculates a hospital disparity rate for each  AO. The disparity rate measures the extent to which an AO has failed to  cite one or more deficiencies during its routine survey that were later  identified by a state survey agency during a traditional validation survey. If  the validation survey results for an AO indicate a disparity rate that  reaches the threshold of 20 percent or greater, CMS is to notify the AO  that its approval to survey and accredit hospitals may be in jeopardy and  that the agency may initiate a review.", "CMS collects data on the results of state survey agency surveys in its  OSCAR database and AO surveys in its ASSURE database.

However, when we  discussed this issue with both CMS privacy and program officials, they  concluded that CMS regional offices could refer hospital complaints to  AOs for investigation or share complaint information with AOs prior to a  state complaint validation survey. TJC officials told us that they are willing  to conduct complaint surveys in response to referrals from CMS.", "CMS told us that while it had not shared actual complaints with AOs it had  increased its communication with TJC, including the results of complaint  validation surveys. For example, CMS provided its regional offices with  the e-mail address of each AO in order to provide AOs with copies of  hospital correspondence and the results of surveys conducted by state  agencies in accredited facilities. However, TJC officials told us that CMS  regional offices do not consistently provide the results of the complaint  validation surveys and sometimes the information provided is not timely.  We spoke with officials from two CMS regional offices that authorized two  state agency complaint validation surveys at TJC-surveyed LTCHs in  fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year 2009, respectively. Officials from one  regional office told us that not all of the information on the results of  complaint validation surveys was forwarded to TJC; thus, a letter might be  sent to TJC that outlined the COP-level deficiencies cited, but not the  standard-level deficiencies. TJC told us that they did not even know that  an additional complaint validation survey at this facility had been  conducted in 2009 until we informed them. Officials from the other  regional office said that they did not forward any information from the  complaint survey, including the official record of all the deficiencies  cited. TJC officials also said that information on the findings from state  complaint validation surveys could lead them to conduct their own survey  or could be used by TJC as it prepares for the facility\u2019s next survey.  Additionally, officials from the CMS regional offices we contacted told us  that state survey agencies do not review the results of an AO\u2019s most  recent routine survey prior to conducting complaint validation surveys and  therefore, may not be familiar with any deficiencies cited by TJC. Given  that complaint validation surveys may provide insights into concerns that  occur between routine surveys, information sharing between CMS  regional offices and AOs is an important aspect of effective oversight."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS Is Not Using All Available ASSURE and OSCAR Survey Data to Oversee Survey Activities at LTCHs", "paragraphs": ["CMS has not yet analyzed ASSURE survey data to oversee TJC\u2019s LTCH  survey activities or used these data in combination with OSCAR data to  identify issues that may warrant further examination and strengthen  oversight and accountability. By recognizing and adjusting for limitations  in these databases, we identified several areas where the data may assist  CMS in more effectively overseeing survey activities at LTCHs. For  example:  \uf0b7  CMS has data on the results of all surveys conducted by both state  survey agencies and TJC that could provide information on the  proportion of LTCHs and ACHs cited with COP-level deficiencies by  state survey agencies and TJC. Although CMS conducted an internal  analysis of the proportion of surveys at LTCHs and ACHs that cited  COP-level deficiencies, it used only OSCAR data, which primarily  consists of complaint surveys conducted by state survey agencies.  We did our own analysis using both ASSURE and OSCAR data and  found that the inclusion of ASSURE data influenced whether LTCHs  or ACHs had more COP-level deficiencies. See app. I for the results  of our data analysis.  \uf0b7  CMS has data on complaint validation surveys conducted in LTCHs  that could provide information on how effectively states triage and  conduct complaint surveys at TJC-surveyed LTCHs. For example, our  analysis found that a small proportion of state complaint validation  surveys cited deficiencies. Specifically, we found that about 6 percent  of the 1,224 complaint validation surveys conducted at TJC-surveyed  LTCHs between 2006 and 2010 had one or more COP-level  deficiencies and about 66 percent did not cite any deficiencies. We  also found that two state agencies conducted nearly half (40 percent)  of the complaint validation surveys, but cited almost no COP-level  deficiencies. CMS and TJC officials told us that the small proportion  of state complaint validation surveys that cite COP-level deficiencies  indicated that state survey agencies may not be adequately triaging  complaints, that is, some of these complaints may not have warranted  on-site surveys. In addition, CMS officials suggested that states may  have cited deficiencies at the standard level to avoid conducting a full  survey and may not have reviewed all standards related to the COP  alleged by the complainant to have been out of compliance.  \uf0b7  CMS has data to compare the results from routine and complaint  surveys that could provide information on the thoroughness of routine  surveys at LTCHs that also had complaint validation surveys. CMS  has not compared routine survey data for TJC-surveyed LTCHs it has  in ASSURE with complaint validation survey data it has in OSCAR.  We compared these two databases to determine if routine surveys by  TJC had missed COP-level deficiencies identified by state complaint  validation surveys. We identified 32 complaint validation surveys that  were conducted within 2 to 60 days of a TJC routine survey reported  in ASSURE. Four of the 32 surveys identified COP-level deficiencies  that were not identified on the LTCHs most recent survey by TJC.  While there may be reasonable explanations, further information could  improve CMS oversight of survey activities.  \uf0b7  CMS has data on the survey resources used during routine surveys  by state survey agencies and TJC that could provide information on  the efficiency and effectiveness of survey activities. We compared the  survey resources\u2014number of surveyors and amount of time devoted  to conducting a survey\u2014used by state surveyors and TJC for the  health portion of routine surveys at similar sized LTCHs between 2006  and 2010. We found that state surveyors spent about two times as  many hours per survey and utilized about two times more surveyors  per survey than TJC. The appropriate level of resources for an LTCH  survey is unclear and CMS, state survey agencies, and TJC may not  be in agreement.", "CMS officials told us that they are not using all available ASSURE and  OSCAR survey data because they are currently focusing on obtaining  complete and accurate information from TJC and other AOs. They told us  that they intend to more fully use the available data in the future to  oversee LTCH survey activities; however, they have not developed a plan  to do so. One CMS official also told us that in the future the agency might  consider merging the information collected in ASSURE with OSCAR,  thereby establishing one database for hospital survey data."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["LTCHs are a specialized type of ACH that care for very sick and clinically  complex patients. Most patients in LTCHs have been transferred from an  intensive care unit of another hospital because they need a continued  intense level of care for an extended period of time. Because these  patients are so vulnerable, it is important that oversight of the quality of  care delivered by LTCHs is monitored and, if shortcomings are identified,  action is promptly taken. However, our review found several limitations in  the oversight of LTCHs that are cause for concern, including weaknesses  that affect the availability of data to oversee the quality of care and the  ability of CMS to hold both state survey agencies and accrediting  organizations accountable for their survey activities.", "We found several weaknesses in the availability of data on the quality of  care in LTCHs. The results of surveys are stored in more than one  database, which affects CMS\u2019s ability to use the data to understand the  quality of care in LTCHs. For example, CMS is unable to accurately  identify all LTCHs from these databases and which entity\u2014state survey  agencies or AOs\u2014is responsible for conducting routine surveys of the  facility. The inability to accurately identify all LTCHs has implications,  particularly when CMS implements a new COP for LTCHs and when  LTCHs have to begin reporting quality measures. The fragmentation of  data across different databases also affects CMS\u2019s ability to review the  data for LTCHs specifically and ensure that the data are updated as  needed and may inhibit the sharing of data between the state survey  agencies and AOs, both of which may have surveyors in the same LTCHs  at different times, conducting different types of surveys.", "We also found weaknesses in CMS\u2019s ability to hold state survey agencies  and accrediting organizations accountable. CMS\u2019s traditional strategies  for holding these entities accountable\u2014performance measures and  validation surveys\u2014do not focus on LTCHs. Although CMS conducts  traditional validation surveys in hospitals in general as a means for  assessing the effectiveness of an AO\u2019s survey activities, CMS cannot  assure that LTCHs are systematically included in their review; when such  surveys have been conducted in LTCHs, CMS has not separated out the  LTCH surveys from surveys of all other hospitals and so is unable to  identify whether there may be areas of concern specific to AO survey  activities in LTCHs. Furthermore, CMS is not effectively using the data it  collects from surveys to review and understand the activities conducted  by state survey agencies and AOs. For example, there are differences in  the workload and resources devoted to survey activities between state  survey agencies and AOs; however, the reasons for these differences  were not clear. CMS officials said they plan to more fully use the data in  the future to oversee survey activities in LTCHs, but have not yet  developed a plan for doing so.", "CMS oversight of LTCHs is hampered by inaccurate data and ineffective  use of the data it currently collects. By increasing the use of its existing  databases and more effectively using the data it currently collects, CMS  has the opportunity to improve the accuracy of the data it has and the  effectiveness of its oversight. Unless CMS more effectively uses the data  it collects, the agency cannot provide assurances that the quality of care  in LTCHs meets federal quality standards and ensure that vulnerable  patients are not at risk."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to improve the data available on the quality of care at LTCHs, the  Administrator of CMS should take the following two actions:  1.

Explore differences in survey workload and in the resources survey  organizations devote to LTCH surveys in order to  identify areas for efficiencies, and  \uf0b7  determine whether the workload associated with complaint  validation surveys could be more equitably shared with TJC.  3.

With respect to our  recommendation to improve the accuracy of the databases that track  LTCH survey results, HHS noted that it had been working since 2007 to  identify and correct serious problems in both the AO and CMS databases  and had made significant progress. HHS acknowledged that one issue is  that LTCHs must enroll initially as acute care hospitals and are later  converted to LTCHs, which affects the identification of LTCHs in the  database. HHS outlined steps it had taken to address the fact that we  found many LTCHs identified as acute care hospitals in the ASSURE  database. HHS also said that it has begun the process of converting  ASSURE to a Web-enabled application, which would provide more  flexibility and allow it to explore methods to increase the accuracy of the  database.", "HHS also concurred with our four other recommendations. HHS said that  it intends to:  reinforce existing CMS policy on sharing information with AOs and  work with regional offices to enhance compliance,  \uf0b7  explore an option to increase its traditional validation survey sample  for hospitals, which would permit the inclusion of a stratified sample of  LTCHs annually,  \uf0b7  explore the differences in survey workload and resource allocation,  which it characterized as definitely meriting attention, while working  with regional offices to clarify the policy for triaging complaint surveys  at AO-surveyed LTCHs and for referring certain complaints to the  appropriate AO, and  review the available data to determine to what extent it can be used to  develop additional AO performance measures for evaluating quality of  care at hospitals, including LTCHs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TJC Comments", "paragraphs": ["TJC agreed that there was room for improvement in CMS\u2019s oversight of  the quality of care provided by LTCHs and of survey activities at such  hospitals and noted that CMS had already taken positive steps toward  achieving these goals. However, it questioned our conclusion that CMS  oversight of LTCHs was limited. It suggested, instead, that a more  accurate conclusion was that CMS oversight was not separated in a  focused manner from that of other hospitals. We believe that our report  appropriately acknowledged CMS\u2019s progress in collecting data from TJC  since TJC\u2019s statutory deeming authority was revoked. We found that CMS  oversight of LTCHs was limited because it was (1) focused on hospitals in  general and not LTCHs specifically and (2) not effectively using the  survey data it collected to review and understand the activities of state  survey agencies and AOs at LTCHs.", "TJC agreed with our recommendations to improve the accuracy of the  survey databases, improve information sharing, and use available data to  improve oversight. However, it disagreed with our recommendation to  conduct traditional validation surveys at a sample of LTCHs each fiscal  year and to include a LTCH-specific disparity rate in its annual financial  report to Congress. Specifically, TJC questioned the value of LTCH- specific validation surveys for several reasons:  \uf0b7  TJC questioned whether validation surveys were the most appropriate  measure of AO performance because we had previously reported that  state surveyors understate (i.e., miss) serious deficiencies on nursing  home surveys. We do not believe that these findings are directly  applicable to traditional LTCH validation surveys because the findings  cited by TJC relate to routine nursing home surveys. Moreover,  understatement, if it did exist on validation surveys, would not  diminish the fact that state surveyors have identified serious  deficiencies that AOs should have, but did not cite. We agree with  TJC that CMS should monitor complaint validation survey findings as  another indicator of AOs performance. For example, we pointed out  that state survey agencies identified condition-level deficiencies not  cited by TJC on several complaint validation surveys that were  conducted within 60 days of TJC\u2019s routine survey.  \uf0b7  TJC stated that the inclusion of a representative number of LTCHs as  part of the annual validation survey schedule would require a  significant increase in the federal budget allocated to validation  surveys. TJC said this would be necessary in order to arrive at a  statistically valid sample size that would in turn support a LTCH- specific disparity rate calculation. As we pointed out and HHS  comments noted, CMS has been conducting a small number of  traditional validation surveys at LTCHs each year\u2014approximately   1 percent of LTCHs. In addition, HHS noted that it would explore an  option to increase its traditional validation survey sample for hospitals,  thereby permitting the inclusion of a stratified sample of LTCHs each  year.", "TJC noted that it had provided CMS with information such as the  accreditation status resulting from surveys, demographic information, and  up-to-date survey schedules prior to the establishment of ASSURE in  2009 and, therefore, it was inaccurate to say that CMS has no prior  survey data on TJC-surveyed LTCHs. TJC\u2019s comments acknowledged  that the information provided to CMS prior to 2009 did not include detailed  information on the specific deficiencies identified. We added a footnote to  our report acknowledging the information that TJC did provide to CMS  before 2009 and clarified the report to make it clear that the prior survey  data we are referring to involved detailed data on the deficiencies cited.", "HHS and TJC also provided technical comments, which we incorporated  as appropriate.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.
