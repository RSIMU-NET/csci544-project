CMS estimates the revised process avoided $2.4 billion in Medicare payments to ineligible providers and suppliers from March 2011 to May 2015 and resulted in other benefits, such as more accurate provider and supplier enrollment data. In June 2015, GAO reported some inaccuracies in the enrollment data after the revised process took effect, such as potentially ineligible practice location addresses, which CMS has taken action to address.", "Since 2011, CMS has implemented some modifications to the revised screening process and made operational modifications to its revalidation efforts. For example, CMS eliminated automatic approvals of provider and supplier requests to extend the deadline for submitting enrollment information for revalidation. CMS officials stated that they plan to implement further modifications, but have not yet identified these future modifications. CMS officials said that they are waiting to see the results of the previous modifications before modifying the enrollment process further.", "CMS has set goals and conducted monitoring of the enrollment screening process, but those monitoring activities lack objectives and performance measures for assessing progress toward those goals. CMS officials said they want to assess the screening process but they are uncertain of what objectives and performance measures to establish, in part because they are concerned that some measures would be inappropriate. While there may be challenges in developing objectives and performance measures, there are opportunities to do so that would allow CMS to better monitor the enrollment screening process without setting specific targets that could create inappropriate incentives for contractors. For example, CMS could focus on developing objectives and performance measures related to its goals for enrollment screening, such as keeping enrollment information up to date. Federal internal control standards and leading practices specify defining objectives and establishing performance measures so that an agency can monitor progress toward achieving desired goals.

Medicare  regulations require that site visits be conducted for all high- and  moderate-risk providers and suppliers. Those conducting the site visits  determine whether the reported practice locations are operational and  meet requirements such as specified hours of operation. In addition to  these site visits, high-risk providers and suppliers also are subject to a  fingerprint-based criminal background check. In the course of this  screening, MACs may request additional information from the prospective  provider or supplier.

In addition, providers and  suppliers periodically are required to resubmit enrollment information to  the MAC to update their enrollment records. The MAC revalidates the  provider\u2019s or supplier\u2019s enrollment record using the enrollment screening  process, to determine whether the provider or supplier remains eligible to  bill Medicare.

For  example, MAC officials said that there were challenges revalidating  enrollment information for providers and suppliers with multiple billing  locations during the first program-wide revalidation effort, which led to  deactivations of some otherwise eligible providers and suppliers.  According to officials at one MAC we interviewed, this could have  occurred, for example, if the provider\u2019s or supplier\u2019s address information  in PECOS was not accurate and a revalidation letter was not sent to each  billing location or if the revalidation notice did not reach the correct office  personnel handling the requests for enrollment information for  revalidation.", "We and the HHS Office of the Inspector General have also found some  issues with PECOS data since the revised process took effect. In June  2015, we reported that a review of PECOS data as of early 2013 found  that an estimated 23,400 of 105,234 practice location addresses in  PECOS were potentially ineligible,  for example because they were vacant  addresses. CMS concurred with our recommendations to incorporate  flags into its software to help identify potentially questionable practice  location addresses and to collect additional license information. In  January 2016, CMS replaced the current PECOS address verification  software used during the enrollment screening process for new  applications with software that, according to CMS, will better detect  potentially ineligible addresses. In April 2016, the HHS Office of the  Inspector General reported that PECOS did not contain the reasons for  enrollment application submissions\u2014for example, whether a new  enrollment application or an application submitted in response to a  revalidation request\u2014for 54,903 of 479,115 applications submitted from  March 25, 2012, through March 24, 2013.

CMS officials stated that the MACs now use these  reports to help ensure that providers and suppliers continue to meet  CMS\u2019s enrollment requirements after they have been enrolled. The MACs  do so by identifying those providers and suppliers that no longer meet  licensure requirements or that now have certain criminal convictions, and  deactivating or revoking their enrollment records. Before implementing  the reports, MACs did not receive routine reporting to use for checking  licensure and criminal convictions of enrolled providers and suppliers, and  CMS officials said they did not know whether the MACs were conducting  such reviews regularly.

Table 6 includes examples of modifications CMS  has made to methods used to screen providers and suppliers under the  revised enrollment screening process put into effect in 2011.", "CMS has also made a number of operational modifications to the  enrollment screening process used to revalidate existing providers and  suppliers since 2011. These modifications include some that CMS  officials said are intended to encourage providers to be more responsive  to revalidation requests, such as establishing revalidation due dates that  are posted online 6 months in advance and eliminating automatic  approvals of provider and supplier requests for deadline extensions.  Others are modifications that help the MACs better manage and  streamline their operations, CMS officials said, such as eliminating the  requirement for MACs to send CMS bi-monthly revalidation data, as MAC  officials told us that CMS can pull that data directly from PECOS. CMS  also began giving the MACs the lists of providers to contact for  revalidation further in advance of the required mailing date than CMS did  during the first program-wide revalidation cycle.

Performance measures focus on whether a program  has achieved measurable standards. They allow agencies to monitor and  report program accomplishments on an ongoing basis. CMS officials  stated that while they want to assess the screening process, they are  uncertain of what performance measures to establish in part because  they are concerned that some measures would be inappropriate. For  example, CMS officials stated that while they review the number of  deactivations and revocations, it would not be appropriate to have targets  for deactivating or revoking a predetermined number of providers or  suppliers. This is consistent with our previous work in which CMS officials  stated that setting such targets could create incentives that could  potentially jeopardize the quality of contractors\u2019 work.

On the basis of this review, we determined  that the PECOS data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report, and we accounted for any limitation in these data during our  analyses, such as removing certain outcomes from our analysis of initial  enrollment applications and removing enrollment records that did not  have a risk category assigned in PECOS from our analysis of the  percentages of deactivated and revoked enrollment records in each risk  category.", "To determine the number of enrollment records and enrollment  applications to which CMS applied the revised enrollment screening  process during the time period we reviewed, we analyzed PECOS data to  identify which one of three distinct groups each enrollment record  belonged. Specifically, we identified (1) the number of new enrollment  application decisions made, (2) the number of enrollment records with a  change in enrollment status, for example, from approved to deactivated,  and (3) the number of approved enrollment records as of March 25, 2011,  that did not have an enrollment status change during the time period.  Each enrollment record could only fall in to a single group and we  excluded from our analysis deactivated or revoked enrollment records  that did not have an enrollment status change during the time period  since CMS would not have applied the enrollment screening process to  these enrollment records.", "To determine the number of approved, denied, and rejected new  enrollment applications during the time period we reviewed, we analyzed  PECOS data to calculate the number of enrollment applications by  outcome. For the denied and rejected new enrollment applications, we  analyzed the PECOS recorded reasons for the denial or rejection and  calculated the number of denials and rejections by recorded reason and  by provider and supplier risk category during that time period. CMS  officials reported that there could be multiple reasons for a denial or  rejection, but due to PECOS system limitations, the Medicare  Administrative Contractors (MAC) responsible for enrolling providers and  suppliers can only record one reason. In addition, the reason codes that  can be recorded in PECOS changed during the time frame covered by  our analysis.", "To determine the number of existing enrollment records deactivated or  revoked during the time period we reviewed, we analyzed PECOS data to  identify enrollment record statuses that changed to deactivated or  revoked during the time period. We identified both the total number of  status changes, as well as the number of unique enrollment records  deactivated or revoked. The total number of deactivations or revocations  is greater than the number of unique enrollment records deactivated or  revoked because a provider\u2019s or supplier\u2019s enrollment record could have  been deactivated or revoked more than once during that time. For  enrollment records with deactivated or revoked statuses, we analyzed the  PECOS recorded reason for the deactivation or revocation and calculated  the number of deactivations and revocations by recorded reason and by  provider and supplier risk category during that time period. As with new  enrollment application decisions, the reason codes that can be recorded  in PECOS for existing enrollment records changed during the time period  of our analysis.", "To determine the number of enrollment records associated with providers  and suppliers eligible to bill Medicare during the time period we reviewed,  we analyzed PECOS data to calculate the total number of approved  enrollment records on March 25, 2011, and on December 31, 2015."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Examples of Operational Modifications to Revalidation", "paragraphs": ["The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has made  operational modifications to revalidation since 2011.
