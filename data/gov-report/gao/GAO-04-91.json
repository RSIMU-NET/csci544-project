However, a growing concentration of industry assets in large credit unions creates the need for greater risk management on the part of NCUA. The question of who benefits from credit unions' services has also been widely debated. While it has been generally accepted that credit unions have a historical emphasis on serving people of modest means, our analysis of limited available data suggested that credit unions served a slightly lower proportion of low- and moderate-income households than banks. CUMAA and subsequent NCUA regulations enabled federally chartered credit unions to expand their membership, serve larger geographic areas, and add underserved areas. According to NCUA officials, these changes were necessary to maintain the competitiveness of the federal charter with respect to state-chartered credit unions. While NCUA has stated its commitment to ensuring that credit unions provide financial services to all segments of society, NCUA has not developed indicators to determine if credit union services have reached the underserved. In response to the growing concentration of industry assets and increased services offered by credit unions, NCUA recently adopted a risk-focused examination and supervision program but still faces a number of challenges, including lack of access to third-party vendors that are providing more services to credit unions. Further, credit unions are not subject to internal control and attestation reporting requirements applicable to banks and thrifts. GAO also found that the insurance fund's rate structure does not reflect risks that individual credit unions pose to the fund, and NCUA's estimation of fund losses is based on broad historical analysis rather than a current risk profile of insured institutions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Credit unions have historically occupied a unique niche among depository  institutions. Credit unions are not-for-profit, member-owned cooperatives  that are exempt from paying federal income taxes on their earnings. Unlike  banks, credit unions are subject to limits on their membership because  members must have a \u201ccommon bond\u201d\u2014for example, working for the same  employer or living in the same community. However, over the years, these  membership requirements have loosened considerably and credit unions  have received expanded powers, which have raised questions about the  extent that credit unions remain unique and serve a different population  than banks. We last conducted a comprehensive review of the credit union  industry, including the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), in  1991. Since that time, the credit union industry has experienced  substantial growth and expansion of activities. In addition, recent  legislative and regulatory changes have blurred some distinctions between  credit unions and other depository institutions\u2014banks and thrifts. For  example, the 1998 Credit Union Membership Access Act (CUMAA)  expanded the definition of common bond and provided for reforms  intended to strengthen the safety and soundness of credit unions, including  instituting procedures for prompt corrective action (PCA) when credit  unions\u2019 capital levels fall below a certain threshold.", "In 2002, there were about 10,000 credit unions with approximately 82  million members. Credit unions, like banks and thrifts, are chartered by  both the federal government and state governments, also referred to as the  dual-chartering system. NCUA has oversight authority for federally  chartered credit unions and requires its credit unions to obtain federal  share (deposit) insurance for their members\u2019 deposits from the National  Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF). This fund, administered by  NCUA, also provides share insurance to most state-chartered credit unions.  Some states permit their credit unions to purchase private share insurance  as an alternative to federal insurance.", "In light of the evolution of the credit union industry and the passage of  CUMAA, you asked us to review a variety of issues involving the credit  union industry and NCUA. In response, we provided your staff information  on how NCUA responded to recommendations made in our 1991 report and  conducted preliminary research on the industry and NCUA. After  discussing this information with your staff, we agreed that the objectives of  this study were to evaluate (1) the financial condition of the credit union  industry; (2) the extent to which credit unions \u201cmake more available to  people of small means credit for provident purposes\u201d; (3) the impact, if  any, of CUMAA on credit union field of membership requirements for  federally chartered credit unions; (4) how NCUA\u2019s examination and  supervision processes have changed in response to changes in the industry;  (5) the financial condition of NCUSIF; and (6) the risks associated with the  use of private share insurance. You also asked us to review issues  associated with corporate credit unions, which we plan to address in a  separate report.", "To evaluate the financial condition of the credit union industry we  performed quantitative analyses on credit union call report data for 1992\u2013  2002. Since NCUA lacked readily available data to assess the extent to  which credit unions serve people of low and moderate incomes, we  analyzed data from the 2001 Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances  (SCF) to identify the characteristics of credit union members. This survey  is the only comprehensive source of publicly available data on financial  institutions and consumer demographics that we could identify that is  national in scope. We also analyzed 2001 mortgage data from the Home  Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) database, which allowed us to categorize  the income levels of households receiving mortgages from credit unions  and banks, and reviewed other industry studies. To determine how CUMAA  affected field of membership requirements for federally chartered credit  unions, we analyzed NCUA regulations and obtained data on field of  membership trends from NCUA. In addition, we surveyed state regulators  to obtain information about their chartering provisions, particularly for  credit unions serving geographic areas. To determine how NCUA\u2019s  examination and supervision process has changed, we reviewed NCUA  documentation on its risk-focused program and conducted structured  interviews of NCUA regional directors and examiners, as well as selected  state credit union supervisors. We also analyzed NCUA data on examiner  resources provided to states and progress in implementing PCA. To  determine the financial condition of NCUSIF, we obtained and analyzed  key financial data about the fund from NCUA\u2019s annual audited financial  statements for 1991\u20132002. Finally, to assess the risks associated with the  use of private share insurance, we identified and analyzed relevant federal  and state statutes and regulations and surveyed the 50 state credit union  regulators to determine which states permitted private share insurance. In  addition, we conducted interviews with state supervisors from states  where credit unions are permitted to choose private insurance\u2014Alabama,  California, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Nevada, and Ohio. We also  interviewed and obtained relevant documentation from representatives of  American Share Insurance (ASI)\u2014the remaining provider of private share  insurance.

Credit unions are member-owned  cooperatives run by boards elected by their members. They do not issue  capital stock; rather, they are not-for-profit entities that build capital by  retaining earnings. However, like banks and thrifts, credit unions have  either federal or state charters. Federal charters have been available since  1934 when the Federal Credit Union Act was passed. States have their own  chartering requirements. As of December 2002, the federal government  chartered about 60 percent of the nearly 10,000 credit unions, and about 40  percent were chartered by their respective states. Both federally and state- chartered credit unions are exempt from federal income taxes, with  federally chartered and most state-chartered credit unions also exempt  from state income and franchise taxes.", "Another distinguishing feature of credit unions is that they may serve only  an identifiable group of people with a common bond. A common bond is  the characteristic that distinguishes a particular group from the general  public. For example, a group of people with a common profession or living  in the same community could share a common bond. Over the years,  common-bond requirements at the state and federal levels have become  less restrictive, permitting credit unions consisting of more than one group  having a common bond to form \u201cmultiple-bond\u201d credit unions. The term  \u201cfield of membership\u201d is used to describe all the people, including  organizations, that a credit union is permitted to accept for membership. As  previously noted, the loosening of common-bond restrictions, as well as  expanded powers, have brought credit unions into more direct competition  with other depository institutions, such as banks. In addition, credit unions  can offer members additional services made available by third-party  vendors and by certain profit-making entities with which they are  associated, referred to as credit union service organizations (CUSO).", "CUMAA was the last statute that enacted major provisions affecting,  among other things, how federally chartered credit unions could define  their fields of membership and how federally insured credit unions  demonstrate the safety and soundness of their operations. In February  1998, the Supreme Court ruled that NCUA lacked authority to permit  federal credit unions to serve multiple membership groups. In response,  CUMAA authorized multiple-group chartering, subject to limitations NCUA  must consider when granting charters. Also, the act limited new  community charter applications to well-defined \u201clocal\u201d communities.  Moreover, CUMAA placed several additional restrictions on federally  insured credit unions. It tightened audit requirements, established PCA  requirements when capital standards were not met, and placed a cap on the  percentage of funds that a credit union could expend for member business  loans.", "NCUA has oversight responsibility for federally chartered credit unions and  has issued regulations that, among other things, guide their field of  membership and the scope of services they can offer. NCUA also has  responsibility for overseeing the safety and soundness of federally insured  credit unions through examinations and off-site monitoring. In addition,  NCUA administers NCUSIF, which provides primary share (deposit)  insurance for 98 percent of the nation\u2019s credit unions.NCUA, in its role as  administrator of NCUSIF, is responsible for overseeing federally insured,  state-chartered credit unions to ensure that they pose no risk to NCUSIF.", "State governments have responsibility for regulating state-chartered credit  unions. State regulators oversee the safety and soundness of state- chartered credit unions; although, as mentioned above, NCUA also has  responsibility for ensuring that state-chartered credit unions that are  federally insured pose no risk to NCUSIF. States set their own rules  regarding field of membership and the services credit unions can provide.  In addition, some states allow the credit unions in their states the option of  obtaining private primary share insurance. Currently, 212 credit unions in  eight states have primary share insurance from a private company, ASI,  located in Ohio. Primary share insurance for these privately insured credit  unions covers up to $250,000."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Condition of the Credit Union Industry Has Improved Since 1991", "paragraphs": ["Between 1992 and 2002, the capital ratios of federally insured credit unions  improved and remained higher than those of other depository institutions.

To provide context, in terms of dollar amounts, credit  unions had $175 billion in consumer loans while peer group banks and  thrifts had $190 billion in consumer loans.

Modeled on the federal examination procedures for large  banks, the state regulators apply lending and service tests to assess  whether credit unions are meeting the needs of the communities they have  set out to serve, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.  Massachusetts established its examination procedures in 1982, and  Connecticut in 2001.All credit unions in Massachusetts are subject to  these examinations, including those whose field of membership is  community-based. In contrast, in Connecticut, only state-chartered credit  unions serving communities with more than $10 million in assets are  subject to the examination. According to a Connecticut state official, the  Connecticut legislature established its examination due to an increasing  trend of multiple-bond credit unions to convert to community-chartered  bonds, and the $10-million threshold was chosen because the legislature  believed credit unions of that size would normally have the personnel and  technological resources to appropriately identify and serve their market.

For example, in 1999, the year after CUMAA, 13  credit unions added 16 underserved areas to their membership. In 2002, 223  credit unions added about 424 underserved areas. Further, the size of these  communities can be substantial.

While this  consultative approach helped NCUA, it still faces a number of challenges  that create additional opportunities for NCUA to leverage off the  experience of the other depository institution regulators. These challenges  include ensuring that examiners have sufficient expertise in areas such as  information systems, monitoring the risks posed by expansion into  nontraditional credit union activities such as business lending, and  monitoring the risks posed to the federal deposit (share) insurance fund by  institutions for which states are the primary regulator. Moreover, unlike  other depository institution regulators, NCUA currently lacks authority to  inspect third-party vendors, which credit unions increasingly rely on to  provide services such as electronic banking. Further, credit unions are not  subject to the internal control reporting requirements that banks and thrifts  are subject to under FDICIA. NCUA adopted prompt corrective action, a  system of supervisory actions tied to the capital levels of an institution, in  August 2000, as required by CUMAA; few actions have been taken to date  due to a generally favorable economic climate for credit unions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Changes in the Credit Union Industry Prompted NCUA to Revise Its Approach to Examination and Supervision", "paragraphs": ["The credit union industry has undergone a variety of changes that  prompted NCUA to revise its approach to examining and supervising credit  unions. As described earlier, the credit union industry is consolidating, and  more industry assets are concentrated in larger credit unions, those with  assets in excess of $100 million. For example, in December 1992, credit  unions with over $100 million in assets held 52 percent of total industry  assets, but by December 2002, they held 75 percent of total industry assets.  Furthermore, credit unions are providing more complex electronic services  such as Internet account access and on-line loan applications to meet the  demands of their members. Thirty-five percent of the industry offered  financial services through the Internet as of December 2002; however, the  rate increased to over 90 percent for larger credit unions. In addition, the  composition of credit union assets has changed over time, with credit  unions engaging in more real estate loans (see fig. 11). For example, the  number of first mortgage loans about doubled from 589,000 loans as of  December 1992 to 1.2 million loans as of December 2002. During this same  period, the amount of first mortgage loans more than tripled from $29  billion to $101 billion. From 1992 to 2002, the percentage of real estate  loans to total assets grew from 19 percent to 26 percent, a greater rate of  growth than that of consumer loans over the same time period. The longer- term real estate loans introduced a greater level of interest rate risk than  that introduced through the shorter-term consumer loans credit unions  traditionally made.", "As a result of these changes, NCUA found that its old approach of  reviewing the entire operation of credit unions and conducting extensive  transaction testing no longer sufficed, particularly for larger credit unions,  because of the number of transactions in which they engaged and the  variety of products and services they tended to provide. In contrast, under  the risk-focused approach, NCUA examiners are expected to identify those  activities that pose the highest risk to a credit union and to concentrate  their efforts on those activities. For example, as credit unions engage in  more complex electronic services, examiners are to focus their efforts on  reviewing information systems and technology to ensure that credit unions  have sufficient controls in place to manage operations risk.In addition, as  credit unions engage in more real estate lending, examiners are to focus on  ensuring that these credit unions have sophisticated asset-liability  management models in place to properly manage interest rate risk. When  transaction testing is used under the risk-focused approach, it is used to  validate the effectiveness of internal control and other risk-management  systems. Further, the risk-focused approach places more emphasis on  preplanning and off-site monitoring of credit union activities, which helps  ensure that once examiners arrive on site, they already will have identified  those areas of the greatest risk in a credit union and where to focus their  resources.", "To compliment the risk-focused approach and allow NCUA to better  allocate its resources, the agency adopted a risk-based examination  program in July 2001. This program eliminates the requirement to perform  annual examinations on low-risk credit unions, replacing annual exams  with two examinations in a 3-year period."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NCUA Took Various Steps to Ensure Successful Implementation of the Risk- focused Program", "paragraphs": ["NCUA consulted with its Office of Corporate Credit Unions to inquire  about their experiences with their risk-focused program that was  implemented in 1998. As a result of this consultation, NCUA incorporated a  greater level of examiner judgment in its risk-focused approach,  specifically allowing examiners to determine the appropriate level of on- site versus off-site supervision. For example, if an examiner discovered a  problem during off-site monitoring of a credit union, the examiner might  adjust the schedule of the on-site examination to directly address the  problem. In addition, in recognition that examiners would be required to  assess the future risks that credit unions might be undertaking, NCUA,  after consulting with its Office of Corporate Credit Unions, required that  examiners review information beyond the financial statements. For  example, under the risk-focused program, examiners might analyze due  diligence reviews by management for new and existing products and  services, internal controls, and measurements of actual performance  against forecasted results, to determine what future risks a particular  credit union might be undertaking.", "NCUA\u2019s consultations with FDIC and its review of two FDIC Inspector  General reports prompted NCUA to develop programs to address  challenges that FDIC experienced in implementing its risk-focused  program. For example, according to NCUA, FDIC did not conduct much  training for its examiners prior to implementing its risk-focused program.  NCUA, on the other hand, held training for all examiners, including state  examiners, and once the risk-focused program was implemented, NCUA  also provided additional training to help examiners assess risks more  effectively. NCUA\u2019s review of the FDIC Inspector General reports found  that some FDIC examiners resisted the move to the risk-focused program.  NCUA\u2019s response was to develop a quality control program to ensure that  examiners and supervisors were adopting the risk-focused approach and  that documentation was completed consistently across NCUA\u2019s regions.  Under the quality control program, NCUA officials reviewed a sample of  examinations from each region for scope, conciseness of reports,  appropriateness of completed work papers and application of risk-focused  concepts. NCUA\u2019s development of the quality control program was timely  and appropriate, because we found some NCUA examiners and state  supervisors were reluctant to move to the risk-focused program. The  examiners and supervisors were concerned that they would be blamed if a  credit union later had a problem in an area they had not initially identified  as high-risk.", "NCUA\u2019s consultations with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency  (OCC) enabled NCUA to consider a different approach to improve its  oversight of large credit unions under the risk-focused program. OCC had  implemented a large bank program in recognition of the need for an  alternative approach to oversight of large and sophisticated banks. NCUA  likewise found the need for an alternative approach to oversight of large  credit unions because its examiners traditionally examined a large number  of small credit unions and very few larger ones and, thus, had been unable  to gain sufficient comfort and expertise in examining the larger, more  complex institutions. As a result of consultations with OCC, NCUA  implemented its Large Credit Union Pilot Program in January 2003 to,  among other things, develop a core of examiners with experience  overseeing these larger credit unions. Under this program, NCUA has also  experimented with different examination approaches, including targeted  examinations, which focus on certain aspects of credit union operations  such as the loans, investments, or asset-liability management. NCUA  officials told us that they received some preliminary feedback from credit  unions that found the pilot to be beneficial. However, because the pilot  ended recently, NCUA officials stressed that it was too early to tell how  effective this program will be in helping NCUA improve its examinations of  large credit unions.", "In recognition that the risk-focused program was a significant departure  from NCUA\u2019s old approach to examination and supervision, NCUA also  sought feedback from the industry on the risk-focused program by  developing a survey for credit unions to complete once they had gone  through their first risk-focused examination. NCUA reported that it had  received preliminary results from the survey that indicated that the risk- focused program has been well received. Specifically, NCUA received the  highest marks for examiners\u2019 courteous and professional conduct, effective  overall examination process, and effective communication with  management and officials throughout the examination. Officials from some  of the large credit unions we interviewed were pleased with the program  because they felt that the examination was focused on the high-risk areas  that credit union officials needed to monitor. Likewise, examiners with  whom we spoke told us that adopting a risk-focused approach had made a  bigger difference in their oversight activities at the larger credit unions  because they could focus their resources on the high-risk areas of these  institutions. In contrast, the examiners relied on the old approach of  extensive transaction testing at the smaller credit unions that lacked  sufficient resources to implement robust internal control structures and  tended to limit their activities to the basic or traditional services offered by  credit unions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NCUA Has Further Opportunities to Leverage the Experiences of Other Regulators to Address Existing Challenges", "paragraphs": ["NCUA faces a number of challenges in implementing its risk-focused  approach that create additional opportunities for it to leverage the  experiences of the other regulators that have been using risk-focused  programs for several years.

NCUA officials recognize that, similar to banks, a minimum net  worth ratio based on total assets (tangible equity for banks and thrifts)  would still be needed for those institutions that are critically  undercapitalized. For most credit unions, risk-based assets are less than  total assets; therefore, a given amount of capital would have a higher net  worth ratio if risk-based assets were used. While there may be some merit  in using risk-based assets, credit unions have been subject to PCA  programs for a short time, and the advantages and disadvantages of the  current programs are not yet evident.", "Finally, some NCUA officials raised the concern that PCA has led to more  liquidations of problem credit unions. In the past, NCUA sought merger  partners for problem credit unions. However, NCUA officials told us that it  was more difficult to find merger partners because stronger credit unions  were concerned that their net worth ratio would be lowered by merging  with problem credit unions, thereby putting them closer to the 7.0 percent  net worth ratio that triggers PCA. As a result, the cost of mergers has  increased under PCA because NCUA would have to provide greater  incentives to a potential partner, and that has forced the agency to liquidate  credit unions to a greater extent than prior to PCA. While the initial costs of  liquidations appear to be high, the purpose of PCA is to reduce the  likelihood of regulatory forbearance and protect the federal deposit (share)  insurance funds through early resolution of problem institutions; thus, in  the long run, the overall costs to NCUSIF should be less because of PCA."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "NCUSIF\u2019s Financial Condition Appears Satisfactory, but Methodologies for Overhead Transfer Rate, Insurance Pricing, and Estimated Loss Reserve Need Improvement", "paragraphs": ["NCUSIF appears to be in satisfactory financial condition.

Federally chartered credit unions are assessed an  annual fee by the Operating Fund based on the credit union\u2019s asset size as  of the prior December 31. The fee is designed to cover the costs of  providing administration and service, as well as regulatory examinations to  the Federal Credit Union System. NCUA\u2019s board reviews the fee structure  annually. The overhead transfer from NCUSIF for administrative services  provides a substantial portion of funding for the Operating Fund. The  annual rate for the overhead transfer is set by NCUA\u2019s board based on  periodic surveys of NCUA staff time spent on insurance-related activities  compared with noninsurance-related, or regulatory, activities. An amount  of overhead or administrative expense is transferred to NCUSIF in  proportion to staff time spent on insurance-related activities. The overhead  transfer is intended to account for NCUA staff being responsible for both  insurance and supervisory-related activities.", "Between 1986 and 2000, the transfer rate was 50 percent, which, according  to NCUA management, was based on surveys that indicated staff time was  equally split between insurance and regulatory activities.

For 2001, NCUA\u2019s Board of  Directors increased the overhead transfer rate to 67 percent on the basis  that Operating Fund staff had increased their insurance-related activities.

The lack of a  clear separation of the insurance and supervisory functions had also been  the focus of a recommendation in our 1991 report (still unimplemented)  that NCUA should establish separate supervision and insurance offices.The 2001 recommendations from NCUA\u2019s financial audit firm included  improvements in communication with staff on the survey process and  results, frequency and timing of the survey, methods of survey distribution,  and updated documentation of survey definitions and purpose. The  auditors also noted that individuals were allocating time after the fact,  when recollection may have been faulty, rather than tracking their time  concurrently as would be possible if provided the survey and guidelines  prior to an assignment. Additionally, the auditors reported that, to provide  reliable results, the survey should cover a greater period of time. The  limited period used could significantly skew the resulting proportion of  activities devoted to insurance versus regulatory activities. The auditor\u2019s  recommendations indicated that the survey\u2019s lack of consistency and  reliability may have resulted in a misallocation of overhead expenses  between the operating and insurance funds. Any misallocation would affect  NCUSIF\u2019s financial condition because any increase in the overhead transfer  rate results in a decrease of NCUSIF\u2019s net income. Misallocations also can  significantly affect the financial results of the Operating Fund. In addition  to the auditor\u2019s findings, some federally insured, state-chartered credit  unions and trade groups have expressed concerns about NCUA\u2019s  calculation of its overhead transfer rate. Primarily, they say that NCUA has  not clearly defined insurance and regulatory functions, and its  methodology for determining the overhead transfer rate is not transparent  or understandable to participating credit unions.", "According to NCUA\u2019s management, NCUA has begun implementing  Deloitte & Touche\u2019s recommendations. For example, selected field  examiners are now completing surveys in a timely manner for periods  covering a full year. However, headquarters staff are not required to  complete the surveys as management asserts the split of their time mirrors  that of field examiners.

Although FDIC had implemented a version of risk-based pricing in 1993,  FDIC has continued to study options for improving deposit insurance  funding. FDIC\u2019s suggestions for improvement were issued in a 2001 report  that noted the cost of insurance, regardless of type (property, casualty, or  life), in the private sector is priced based upon the risk assumed by the  insurer.

Since  passage of FDICIA in 1991, deposit insurance for banks and thrifts are  adjusted for some risk, and since December 31, 2000, private-sector  insurance for credit union shares has been adjusted for risk. (See  appendix X for additional information on accounting for insurance.) While  BIF and SAIF are adjusted for some risk, FDIC has made additional  proposals for enhancing the risk-based nature of its insurance pricing. For  instance, the current BIF and SAIF funding does not require a fast-growing  institution to pay premiums if it is well capitalized and CAMEL-rated 1 or 2.  As a result, FDIC has proposed that the pricing structure for BIF and SAIF  be amended so that fast-growing institutions would be required to pay  premiums.", "NCUSIF is the only share or deposit insurer that has not adopted a risk- based insurance structure. Therefore, some credit unions could be  overpaying while others could be underpaying if their current rates were  compared to their risk profiles\u2014with the cost of insurance not being  equitable based on the level of risk posed to NCUSIF by individual credit  unions. In contrast, FDIC\u2019s BIF and SAIF and ASI currently operate on a  risk-based capitalization structure. Depository institutions insured by BIF  and SAIF pay a premium twice a year based upon their capital levels and  supervisory ratings, with institutions with the lowest capital levels and  worst supervisory ratings paying higher premiums. ASI\u2019s insurance fund  requires its insured credit unions to maintain deposits between 1.0 and 1.3  percent of their insured shares. The amount for each credit union is  determined based upon its supervisory rating, with lower-rated credit  unions maintaining higher deposits.", "The risk-based structure has certain advantages. First, by varying pricing  according to risk, more of the burden is distributed to those members that  put an insurance fund at greater risk of loss. Second, risk-based pricing  provides an incentive for member owners and managers of credit unions to  control their risk. Finally, risk-based pricing helps regulators focus on  higher-risk credit unions by enabling them to allocate their insurance  activities in proportion to the price charged. During our review, members  of NCUA\u2019s management told us that they believe that risk-based pricing  would adversely affect small credit unions and suggested that an option  would be to add risk-based pricing only for credit unions over a certain  size.

The 15-year analysis  encompassed an economic period of dramatic losses, which management  contends may be cyclical and indicative of future exposure, although not  necessarily indicative of current economic conditions.

This methodology essentially assigns a probability of failure of  either zero or 100 percent to each individual credit union considered to be  troubled. By not considering specific historical failure rates and loss rates  in its methodology, NCUA is using an over-simplified estimation method. As  a result, NCUA may not be achieving the best estimate of probable losses.  Therefore, NCUA may be over or underestimating its probable losses  because it does not apply more targeted and specific loss rates to currently  identified problem institutions, but instead, makes a determination that  essentially selects from two probabilities: zero or 100-percent probability  of failure.", "From 2000 to 2002, the amount of insured shares in problem credit unions  doubled, going from $1.5 billion insured shares in 2000 to nearly $3 billion  insured shares in 2002.

At the same time, the estimated loss  reserve, which is intended to cover actual losses, has been declining since  1994.

This determination is based on  the scheduled closing date for the institution, the classification of the  institution as \u201ccritically undercapitalized,\u201d or identification of the  institution as an imminent failure. The remaining four risk groups are based  on federal and state supervisory ratings and the institutions\u2019 projected  capitalization levels.

Also on a quarterly basis, FDIC\u2019s Financial  Risk Committee (FRC), an interdivisional committee, meets to discuss and  determine the appropriate projected failure rates to be applied to each of  the four remaining risk-based groups. The projected failure rate for each  risk-based group is multiplied by the assets of each institution in that  group, which results in expected failed assets. Expected failed assets are  then multiplied by an expected loss experience rate, the product of which  results in the loss estimate for anticipated failures. The projected failure  rates for the remaining four risk-based groups are based on historical  failure rates for those categories. However, FRC has the responsibility for  determining if the historical failure rates for each group are appropriate  given the current and expected condition of the industry and may adjust  failure rates, if necessary. The expected loss experience rates have been  based on asset size and reflect FDIC\u2019s historical loss experience for banks  of different sizes.

In contrast, as of  December 2002, there were 9,688 federally insured credit unions with about  81 million members and shares totaling $483 billion.", "Through a survey of 50 state regulators and related follow-on discussions  with the regulators, we identified nine additional states that could permit  credit unions to purchase private share insurance.Figure 17 illustrates  the states that permit or could permit private share insurance as of March  2003 and the number of privately insured credit unions as of December  2002.", "The number of privately insured credit unions and private share insurers  has declined significantly since 1990. In 1990, 1,462 credit unions in 23  states purchased private share insurance from 10 different nonfederal,  private insurers, with shares at these credit unions totaling $18.6 billion.  Between 1990 and 2002, the amount of privately insured shares decreased  42 percent to about $10.8 billion. Shortly after the failure of Rhode Island  Share and Depositors Indemnity Corporation (RISDIC), a private share  insurer in Rhode Island in 1991, almost half of all privately insured credit  unions converted to federal share insurance voluntarily or by state mandate.As a result of the conversions from private to federal share  insurance, most private share insurers have gone out of business due to the  loss of their membership since 1990; only one company, ASI, currently  offers private primary share insurance.", "In states that currently permit private share insurance, a comparable  number of credit unions have converted from federal to private share  insurance and from private to federal share insurance since 1990\u201431 and  26, respectively. Most of the conversions from federal to private share  insurance (26 of 31) occurred since 1997. According to management at  many privately insured credit unions, they converted to private share  insurance to obtain higher coverage and avoid federal rules and regulation.  Additionally, management at these credit unions noted that they were  satisfied with the service they received from the private share insurer and  all but one planned to remain privately insured. According to NCUA\u2014in  states that currently permit private share insurance\u2014since 1990, 26 credit  unions converted from private to federal share insurance; the majority did  so in the early 1990s, following the RISDIC failure and widespread concern  over the safety and soundness of private share insurance.Most of the 26  credit unions planned to continue to purchase federal share insurance  either because they were reasonably satisfied or because they viewed  having their share insurance backed by the federal government as a benefit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Risks Exist at Remaining Private Share Insurer, but Certain Factors Help to Mitigate Concerns", "paragraphs": ["Although the use of private share insurance has declined, we found two  aspects of the remaining private insurer that raise potential safety and  soundness concerns. First, ASI faces a concentration of risk in a few large  credit unions and certain states. Second, ASI has limited borrowing  capacity and could find it difficult to cover catastrophic losses under  extreme economic conditions because it does not have the backing of any  governmental agency, its lines of credit are limited in the aggregate as to  the amount and available collateral, and it has no reinsurance for its  primary share insurance. To help mitigate these risks, ASI has taken steps  to increase its monitoring of its largest credit unions and is using other  strategies to limit its risks. In addition, as a regulated entity, state regulation  of ASI and the credit unions it insures provides some additional assurance  that ASI and the credit unions operate in a safe and sound manner."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Risks of Remaining Private Insurer Concentrated in a Few Credit Unions and States", "paragraphs": ["ASI is chartered in Ohio statute as a credit union share guaranty  corporation. As specified in Ohio statute, the purpose of such a  corporation includes guaranteeing payment of all or a part of a  participating credit union share account. Although ASI is commonly  referred to as a provider of insurance, it is not subject to all of Ohio\u2019s  insurance laws. For example, ASI is not subject to Ohio\u2019s insurance law  that limits the risk exposure of an insurance company. Specifically, while  Ohio insurance companies are subject to a \u201cmaximum single risk\u201d  requirement\u2014\u201cno insured institution\u2019s coverage should comprise more  than 20 percent of the admitted assets, or three times the average risk or 1  percent of insured shares, whichever is greater\u201d\u2014Ohio has not imposed  this requirement on ASI. Although ASI is not subject to this requirement,  we found that ASI exceeded this concentration limit. For example, one  credit union made up about 25 percent of ASI\u2019s total insured shares, as of  December 2002. In contrast, the largest federally insured credit union  accounted for only 3 percent of NCUSIF\u2019s total insured shares. Other  concentration risks exist; for example, we found that 45 percent of ASI\u2019s  total insured shares were located in one state (California). Further, all of  ASI\u2019s insured credit unions were located in only eight states, with almost  half being located in one state (Ohio), which represents 14 percent of all  ASI-insured shares. In contrast, 14.3 percent of federally insured credit  union shares were located in one state (California). The credit unions that  NCUSIF insures are located in 50 states and the District of Columbia, with  the largest percentage (8 percent) of credit unions located in one state  (Pennsylvania), which represents about 4 percent of NCUSIF\u2019s insured  shares.", "While we remain concerned about ASI\u2019s concentration of risks, ASI  employs a number of risk-management strategies\u2014intended to mitigate its  risk exposure in individual institutions\u2014including being selective about  which credit unions it insures, conducting regular on- and off-site  monitoring of all its insured institutions, implementing a partially adjusted,  risk-based insurance pricing policy, and establishing a 30-day termination  policy. More specifically, ASI employs the following risk-management  strategies:", "To qualify for primary share insurance with ASI, a credit union must  meet ASI\u2019s insurance eligibility criteria, which include an analysis of the  financial performance of the credit union over a 3-year period and an  evaluation of the institution\u2019s operating policies. For example, to qualify  for ASI coverage, a credit union\u2019s fixed assets must be limited to 5  percent of the institution\u2019s total assets or the amount permitted by its  supervisory authority, whichever is greater, and credit unions must  maintain a minimum net capital-to-asset ratio of 4 percent of total  assets. In contrast, federal PCA requirements compel federally insured  credit unions to maintain a minimum capital to assets ratio of 7 percent  of total assets. The credit union also must submit its investment, asset- liability management, and loan policies for ASI\u2019s review. In addition, ASI  obtains and reviews the most recent reports from the credit union\u2019s  regulator and certified public accountant (CPA) or supervisory  committee. Between 1994 and July 2003, ASI denied share insurance  coverage to eight credit unions while approving coverage for 31 credit  unions.", "ASI also regularly monitors all credit unions it insures. ASI routinely  conducts off-site monitoring and conducts on-site examinations of  privately insured credit unions at least once every 3 years. It also  reviews state examination reports for the credit unions it insures and  imposes strict audit requirements. For example, ASI requires an annual  CPA audit for credit unions with $20 million or more in assets, while  NCUA only requires the annual CPA audit for credit unions with more  than $500 million in assets. Further, after insuring a large credit union,  ASI implemented a special monitoring plan for its largest credit unions  in light of its increased risk exposure. For larger credit unions (those  with more than 10 percent of ASI\u2019s total insured shares or the top 5  credit unions in asset size), ASI increased its monitoring by conducting  semiannual, on-site examinations, as well as monthly and quarterly off- site monitoring, which included a review of the credit unions\u2019 most  recent audits (monthly) and financial information (quarterly). ASI also  annually reviews the audited financial statements of these large credit  unions. In January 2003, five credit unions with about 40 percent of ASI\u2019s  total insured assets qualified for this special monitoring.ASI also  began a monitoring strategy intended to increase its oversight of smaller  credit unions, due in part to experiencing larger-than-expected losses at   a small credit union in 2002. ASI determined that 98 smaller credit  unions qualified for increased monitoring, with shares from the largest  of these smaller credit unions totaling about $23 million.", "ASI also has implemented a partially adjusted, risk-based insurance  pricing policy, which produces an incentive for the institutions insured  by ASI to obtain a better CAMEL rating, which in turn lowers the risk to  ASI\u2019s insurance fund. Like NCUSIF, ASI\u2019s insurance fund is deposit- based; that is, ASI requires credit unions it insures to deposit a specified  amount with ASI.As of December 2002, these deposits with ASI  totaled $112 million. Unlike NCUSIF, ASI\u2019s insurance fund is partially  adjusted for risk, which acts as a positive, risk-management strategy to  mitigate against losses. Specifically, a credit union with a higher, or  worse, CAMEL rating is required to deposit more into ASI\u2019s insurance  fund. Conversely, NCUA requires federally insured credit unions to  deposit 1.0 percent of insured shares into NCUSIF regardless of their  CAMEL ratings. According to ASI, it also has the contractual ability to  reassess all member credit unions up to 3 percent of their total assets to  raise additional funds to cover catastrophic loss.", "ASI\u2019s credit union termination policy provides another risk-mitigating  strategy that ASI can use to manage its risk exposure to an individual  credit union. ASI\u2019s insurance contract identifies several circumstances  that would enable ASI to terminate insurance coverage. For example,  ASI may terminate a credit union\u2019s insurance with 30 days notice to the  credit union and its state regulator, if the credit union fails to comply  with ASI requirements to remedy any unsafe or unsound conditions or  remedy an audit qualification in a timely manner. According to ASI  management, it has not terminated a credit union\u2019s share insurance,  although ASI has used its termination policy as leverage to force  changes at a credit union.", "When its largest insured credit union applied for primary share insurance,  ASI undertook an assessment of its financial and underwriting  considerations for insuring this institution. ASI had previously provided  excess share insurance to the credit union and was familiar with its  financial condition. ASI\u2019s independent actuaries determined that the ASI  fund could withstand losses sustained during adverse economic conditions  for up to 5 years, with or without insuring this large credit union.  Ultimately, ASI\u2019s assessment concluded that the credit union\u2019s financial  condition was strong and, although it would increase ASI\u2019s concentration  of risks, insuring the credit union would have a favorable financial impact  on ASI. According to regulators from the Ohio Department of Commerce,  Division of Financial Institutions (Ohio Division of Financial Institutions),  they did not take exception to ASI insuring the large credit union and had  reviewed ASI\u2019s underwriting assessment and asked to be updated  periodically."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Remaining Private Insurer Has Limited Borrowing Capacity and May Find It Difficult to Cover Losses from Its Largest Insured Credit Unions under Extreme Economic Conditions", "paragraphs": ["Unlike federal share insurance, which is backed by the full faith and credit  of the United States, ASI\u2019s insurance fund is not backed by any government  entity. Therefore, losses on member deposits in excess of available cash,  investments, and other assets of ASI-insured institutions would only be  covered up to ASI\u2019s available resources and its secured lines of credit,  which serve as a back-up source of funds. According to ASI documents, the  terms of ASI\u2019s secured lines of credit required collateralization between 80  and 115 percent of current market value of the U.S. government or agency  securities ASI holds. As a result, ASI\u2019s borrowing capacity is essentially  limited to the securities it holds. ASI officials also explained that due to the  high cost of reinsurance, it has not purchased reinsurance on its primary  share insurance, although it has reinsurance for its excess share insurance.", "ASI has not had large losses since 1975. ASI has expended funds for 118  claims and its loss experience\u2014from the credit unions that have made  claims\u2014has averaged 3.95 percent of the total assets of these credit unions.  If ASI\u2019s historical loss average of 3.95 percent was tested and proved true  for a failure at the largest credit union ASI insured, as of December 2002,  the loss amount would be about $119 million. While this would be a  major loss, ASI would most likely be able to sustain this loss. ASI\u2019s  historical loss rate is nearly 60 percent less than the loss rate experienced  by NCUSIF for the same period. However, under more stressful conditions,  ASI could have difficulty fulfilling its obligations. For example, ASI\u2019s five  largest credit unions represent nearly 40 percent of insured shares, for  which a collective loss at 3.95 percent of the assets of these credit unions  would exceed ASI\u2019s equity by approximately $30 million. According to ASI,  it could raise additional funds to cover catastrophic loss by reassessing all  member credit unions up to 3 percent of their total assets, which excluding  the top five credit unions, would generate approximately $214 million of  additional capital, while maintaining minimum capital levels at 4 percent of  total assets. Further, by Ohio statute, the Superintendent of the Division of  Financial Institutions can order ASI to reassess its insured credit unions up  to the full amount of their capital, which, excluding the top five credit  unions, would generate approximately $794 million of funds for ASI with  which to pay claims. This recapitalization process is generally similar to  that required of NCUSIF before accessing its Treasury line of credit.  However, if ASI reassessed its member credit unions during a catastrophic  failure, it would further negatively affect these credit unions at a time that  they were already facing stressful economic conditions.", "State Oversight of ASI and the  Credit Unions It Insures Provides  provides some additional assurance that ASI and privately insured credit  Additional Assurance unions operate in a safe and sound manner. As a share guaranty  State regulation of ASI and the privately insured credit unions it insures  corporation, ASI is subject to state oversight and regulation in those states  where ASI insures credit unions. ASI was chartered in Ohio statute, with  the Ohio Division of Financial Institutions and the Ohio Department of  Insurance dually regulating it. ASI is licensed by the Ohio Superintendent  of Insurance and is subject to routine oversight by that department and  Ohio\u2019s Superintendent of Credit Unions. The Ohio Division of Financial  Institutions conducts annual assessments of ASI, which evaluate ASI\u2019s  underwriting and monitoring procedures, financial soundness, and  compliance with Ohio laws. Under Ohio law, its Department of Insurance  also is required to examine ASI at least once every 5 years. The last Ohio  Department of Insurance exam of ASI was completed in March 1999, which  covered January 1995 through December 1997. When we met with Ohio  officials in June 2003, they told us that the Ohio Department of Insurance  planned to examine ASI in the third quarter of calendar year 2003. ASI is  also required to submit annual audited financial statements, including  management\u2019s attestation, and quarterly unaudited financial statements to  Ohio insurance and credit union regulators. Ohio law also requires ASI to  provide copies of written communication with regulatory significance to  Ohio regulators, obtain the opinion of an actuary attesting to the adequacy  of loss reserves established, and apply annually for a license to do business  in Ohio. In our discussions with officials from the Ohio Division of  Financial Institutions and the Ohio Department of Insurance, we found  that, to date, ASI has complied with all requirements and regulations, and  no regulators have taken corrective actions against ASI or limited ASI\u2019s  ability to do business in Ohio.", "Generally, state financial regulators have taken the primary lead for  monitoring ASI\u2019s actions, while state insurance regulators were not as  involved in overseeing ASI\u2019s operations. All states where ASI insures credit  unions have, at some point, formally certified ASI to conduct business in  that state. Ohio and Maryland have certified ASI in the past year\u2014as  required by governing statutes in those states. Regarding the other states in  which ASI operates, while they have not formally recertified ASI, Ohio\u2019s  annual examination process of ASI involves regulators from most states.  State credit union regulators from Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, and Nevada  commonly participate in this assessment; according to ASI officials, their  acceptance of the final examination report infers that they approve of ASI\u2019s  continuing operation in their respective states. State credit union  regulators from California and Alabama, however, have not participated in  the annual on-site assessment of ASI. Regarding monitoring efforts by state  insurance regulators, according to ASI, the Ohio Department of Insurance  is the only state insurance department that imposes requirements and  insurance regulators from Idaho, Illinois, and Nevada only request  information.", "Most state credit union regulators with whom we met told us they had  regular communication with ASI about the credit unions ASI insured. ASI  officials reported that they commonly conducted joint, on-site exams of  credit unions with state regulators. State credit union regulators imposed  safety and soundness standards and carried out examinations of state- chartered credit unions in a way similar to how the federal government  oversees federally insured credit unions. According to state regulators,  state regulations, standards, and examinations apply to all state-chartered  credit unions, regardless of their insurance status (whether federal, private,  or noninsured). State credit union regulators reported that they had  adopted NCUA\u2019s examination program, and their examiners had received  training from NCUA. However, as previously discussed, some state officials  with whom we met indicated that they faced challenges related to oversight  of their credit unions; for example, some states lacked examiner resources  and had high examiner turnover.", "Additionally, privately insured credit unions\u2014as compared with federally  insured credit unions\u2014are not subject to identical requirements and  regulations. For example, while federally insured, state-chartered credit  unions are subject to PCA\u2014as discussed earlier, privately insured, state- chartered credit unions are not subject to these federally mandated  supervisory actions. Although, as a matter of practice, many state  regulators reported that they have the authority to impose capital  requirements on privately insured credit unions and could take action  when a credit union\u2019s capital levels are not safe and sound. However, state  officials in California, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Nevada said that  their states required privately insured credit unions to maintain specified  reserve levels, which were codified in statute or regulation. Additionally,  Alabama requires credit unions seeking private insurance to meet certain  capital levels.", "While some states had specific requirements for credit unions seeking to  purchase private share insurance, many states regulators reported that  they have the authority to \u201cnot approve\u201d the conversion of credit unions to  private share insurance. Alabama, Illinois, and Ohio have written guidelines  for credit unions seeking to purchase private share insurance and  regulators reported that they have the authority to \u201cnot approve\u201d a credit  union\u2019s purchase of private insurance. The other five states that permitted  private share insurance do not have written guidelines for credit unions  seeking to purchase private share insurance, but Idaho, Indiana, and  Nevada state regulators also noted that they have the authority to \u201cnot  approve\u201d a credit union\u2019s purchase of private share insurance.", "Moreover, NCUA supervised the conversions of federally insured credit  unions to private share insurance. Specifically, NCUA has imposed  notification requirements on federally insured credit unions seeking to  convert to private share insurance and requires an affirmative vote of a  majority of the credit union members on the conversion from federal to  private share insurance. NCUA has required these credit unions to notify  their members, in a disclosure, that if the conversion were approved, the  federal government would not insure shares. We reviewed six recent  conversions to private share insurance, and found that, prior to NCUA\u2019s  termination of the credit union\u2019s federal share insurance, these credit  unions, including the large credit union that recently converted to ASI, had  generally complied with NCUA\u2019s notification requirements for conversion."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Members of Many Privately Insured Credit Unions Are Not Receiving Required Disclosures about the Lack of Federal Share Insurance", "paragraphs": ["Although actions taken by ASI and some state regulators provide some  assurances that ASI is operating in a safe and sound manner, ASI\u2019s  concentration risks and limited borrowing capacity raise concerns that  under stressful economic conditions it may not be able to fulfill its responsibilities to its membership. Congress determined that it was important for members of privately insured credit unions to be informed  that their deposits in such institutions were not federally insured.  Specifically, among other things, section 43 of the Federal Deposit  Insurance Act requires depository institutions lacking federal deposit  insurance, which includes privately insured credit unions, to conspicuously  disclose to their membership that deposits at these institutions are (1) not  federally insured and (2) if the institution fails, the federal government  does not guarantee that depositors will get back their money. These  institutions are required to conspicuously disclose this information on  periodic statements of account, signature cards, and passbooks, and on  certificates of deposit, or instruments evidencing a deposit (deposit slips).  These institutions are also required to conspicuously disclose that the  institution is not federally insured at places where deposits are normally  received (lobbies) and in advertising (brochures and newsletters).", "The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is responsible for enforcing  compliance with section 43. However, FTC has never taken action to  enforce these requirements, and has sought and obtained in its  appropriations authority a prohibition against spending appropriated funds  to carry out these provisions. We recently reported that because of a lack of  federal enforcement of this section, many privately insured credit unions  did not always make required disclosures. We conducted unannounced  site visits to 57 locations of privately insured credit unions (49 main and 8  branch locations) in five states\u2014Alabama, California, Illinois, Indiana, and  Ohio and found that 37 percent of the locations we visited did not  conspicuously post signage in the lobby of the credit union. During these  site visits, we also obtained other available credit union materials  (brochures, membership agreements, signature cards, deposit slips, and  newsletters) that did not include language to notify consumers that the  credit union was not federally insured\u2014as required by section 43. Overall,  134 of the 227 pieces of materials we obtained from 57 credit union  locations\u2014or 59 percent\u2014did not include specified language. As part of  our review, we also reviewed 78 Web sites of privately insured credit  unions and found that many Web sites were not fully compliant with  section 43 disclosure requirements. For example, 39 of the 78 sites  reviewed had not included language to notify consumers that the credit  union was not federally insured.", "Our primary concern, resulting from the lack of enforcement of section 43  provisions, was the possibility that members of privately insured, state- chartered credit unions might not be adequately informed that their  deposits are not federally insured and should their institution fail, the  federal government does not guarantee that they will get their money back.  The fact that many privately insured credit unions we visited did not  conspicuously disclose this information raised concerns that the  congressional interest in this regard was not being fully satisfied. In our  August 2003 report, we concluded that FTC was the best among candidates  to enforce and implement section 43 and provided suggestions on how to  provide additional flexibility to FTC to enforce section 43 disclosure  requirements. The House Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee on  Commerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies, is currently  considering adding language in FTC\u2019s 2004 appropriations bill that would  require FTC to enforce and implement section 43 disclosure provisions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The financial condition of the credit union industry has improved since  1991. Between 1992 and 2002, changes in the industry have resulted in two  distinct groups of credit unions\u2014smaller credit unions providing their  members with basic banking services and larger credit unions that seek to  provide their members with a full range of financial services similar to  other depository institutions. These larger credit unions control a larger  percent of industry assets than they did in 1991. This concentration of  industry assets creates the need for greater risk management on the part of  credit union management and NCUA with respect to monitoring and  controlling risks to the federal share insurance fund.", "Among the more significant changes that have occurred in the credit union  industry over the past two decades have been the weakening or blurring of  the common bond that traditionally existed between credit union  members. The movement toward geographic-based fields of membership,  and other expansions of the common-bond restrictions in conjunction with  expanded lines of financial services, have made credit unions more  competitive with banks. These changes have raised questions about the  extent to which credit unions are fulfilling their perceived historic mission  of serving individuals of modest means. However, no comprehensive data  are available to determine the income characteristics of those who receive  credit unions services, especially with respect to consumer loans and other  financial services. Available data, such as that provided by the SCF and  HMDA, provide some indication that credit unions serve low- and  moderate-income households but not to the same extent as banks. If credit  unions, as indicated by NCUA and the credit union industry, place a special  emphasis on serving low- and moderate-income households, more  extensive data would be needed to support this conclusion. These data  would need to include information on the distribution of consumer loans  because smaller credit unions are more likely to make consumer than  mortgage loans. Lack of data especially impairs NCUA\u2019s ability to  determine if credit unions that have adopted underserved areas are  reaching the households in the communities most in need of financial  services.", "As the industry has changed and larger credit unions have become more  like banks in the services they have provided, NCUA has adopted a  supervisory and examination approach that more closely parallels that of  the other depository institution regulators. While it is too soon to  determine whether the risk-focused approach being implemented by NCUA  will allow it to more effectively monitor and control the risks being  assumed by credit unions, our work suggests that further opportunities  exist for NCUA to further leverage off the approaches and experiences of  the other federal depository institution regulators. For example, as NCUA  is addressing challenges in implementation of its risk-focused program, it  has the opportunity to use forums such as the FFIEC to learn how other  depository institution regulators dealt with similar challenges in  implementing their risk-focused programs. Also, NCUA might gain an  evaluation of an institution\u2019s internal controls, comparable to other  depository institution regulators, if credit unions were required, like banks  and thrifts, to provide management evaluations of internal controls and  their auditor\u2019s assessments of such evaluations. Finally, NCUA could gain  better oversight of third-party vendors if it had the same ability to examine  the activities of third-party vendors as do other depository institution  regulators.", "As of December 2002, NCUSIF\u2019s financial condition appeared satisfactory  based on its fund-equity ratio and positive net income. However, it is not  clear whether or to what extent NCUSIF\u2019s recent decline in net income will  continue. Improvements in NCUA\u2019s processes for determining the overhead  transfer rate, pricing, and estimated losses could help to promote future  financial stability by providing more accurate information for financial  management. As currently determined by NCUA, the overhead transfer rate  may not have accurately reflected the actual time spent by NCUA staff on  insurance-related activities. Recent fluctuations are the result of  adjustments being made because of surveys that had not been conducted  regularly or over sufficient periods of time. In addition, NCUSIF\u2019s pricing  for federal share insurance coverage does not reflect the risk that an  individual credit union poses to the fund. Moreover, the process used by  NCUA to estimated losses to the insurance fund\u2014the fund\u2019s most  significant liability and management estimate\u2014has been based on overly  broad historical analysis. The risk-based pricing structure that is the norm  across the insurance industry and, for loss estimates, the more detailed,  risk-based historical analysis used by FDIC in insuring banks and thrifts  may provide useful lessons for NCUA in improving its management of  insurance for credit unions.", "While systemic risks that might be created by private share insurance  appear to have decreased since 1990, the recent conversion of a large credit  union from federal to private share insurance has introduced new  concerns. Because the remaining private insurer\u2019s (ASI) insured shares are  overly concentrated in one large credit union and in certain states, and  because it does not have the backing of any governmental entity and it has  limited borrowing capacity, ASI may have a limited ability to absorb  catastrophic losses. This raises questions about the ability of ASI, under  severe economic conditions, to fulfill its obligations if its largest credit  unions were to fail. Given this risk, we believe it is important that the  members of privately insured credit unions are made aware that their  shares are not federally insured. As we previously reported, since no  federal entity currently enforces compliance with federal disclosure  requirements for privately insured credit unions, and with the high level of  noncompliance that we found in on-site visits to privately insured credit  unions, we believe that members of privately insured credit unions might  not be adequately informed that their shares are not federally insured. As a  result, we have previously recommended that Congress consider providing  additional flexibility to FTC to ensure compliance with the federal  disclosure requirements.", "Recommendations for \t To promote NCUA\u2019s ability to meet its goal of assisting credit unions in  Executive Action  safely providing financial services to all segments of society, to enable more consistent federal oversight of financial institutions, and to enhance  share insurance management (for example, improving allocation costs,  providing insurance according to risk, and improving the loss estimation  process), we recommend that the Chairman of the National Credit Union  Administration use tangible indicators, other than \u201cpotential membership,\u201d to determine  whether credit unions have provided greater access to credit union  services in underserved areas; consult with other regulators through FFIEC more consistently about  risk-focused programs to learn how these regulators have dealt with  past challenges (for example, training of information technology  specialists); continuously improve the process for and documentation of the  overhead transfer rate by consistently calculating and applying those  rates, updating the rates annually, and completing the survey with full  representation; evaluate options for implementing risk-based insurance pricing. In its  evaluation, the NCUA Chairman should consider the potential impact of  risk-based insurance pricing to the ability of credit unions to provide  services to various constituencies; and evaluate options for stratifying the industry by risk profile and applying  probable failure rates and loss rates, based in part on historical data, for  each risk profile category when estimating future losses from  institutions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matters for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["Should Congress be concerned that federally insured credit unions,  especially those serving geographical areas, are not adequately serving low- and moderate-income households, Congress may wish to consider  requiring NCUA to obtain data on the proportion of mortgage and  consumer loans provided to low- and moderate-income households within  each federally insured credit union\u2019s field of membership and obtain  descriptions of services specifically targeted to low- and moderate-income  households.", "To ensure the safety and soundness of the credit union industry, Congress  may wish to consider making credit unions with assets of $500 million or  more subject to the FDICIA requirement that management and external  auditors report on the internal control structure and procedures for  financial reporting, as well as compliance with designated safety and  soundness laws.", "To improve oversight of third-party vendors, Congress may wish to  consider granting NCUA legislative authority to examine third-party  vendors that provide services to credit unions and are not examined  through FFIEC."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Chairman of the  National Credit Union Administration and the President and Chief  Executive Officer of American Share Insurance.

NCUA also  agreed with our recommendation to consult with other regulators through  FFIEC more consistently to leverage the knowledge and experience the  other regulators have gained in administering risk-focused programs.  NCUA stated that it plans to continue its coordination with its FFIEC  counterparts as it makes ongoing improvements to its approach to  supervising federally insured credit unions.", "NCUA also concurred with our matter for congressional consideration that  credit unions with assets of $500 million or more should provide annual  management reports assessing the effectiveness of their internal controls  over financial reporting and their external auditor\u2019s attestation to  management\u2019s assertions. NCUA stated that it is providing guidance for  credit unions on the principles of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that will, among  other things, strongly encourage large credit unions to voluntarily provide  this reporting on internal controls. However, NCUA believed that  legislation was not necessary because NCUA has the authority to  implement regulations requiring credit unions to provide these reports  should it become necessary. While we acknowledge NCUA\u2019s authority to  issue regulations on this issue, we note that regulations can be changed  unilaterally by the agency, whereas legislation is binding unless changed by  Congress. Our intent in developing this matter for congressional  consideration was to ensure parity between credit unions, banks, and  thrifts with regard to internal control reporting requirements; therefore, we  have left this as a matter for congressional consideration in our report.", "NCUA also indicated that it did not oppose our recommendation that it be  given statutory authority to examine third-party vendors that provide  services to credit unions and are not examined through FFIEC, provided  that appropriate discretion was extended to the agency in the allocation of  agency resources and evaluation of risk parameters in using this authority.  NCUA stated that given that many of these third-party vendors service  numerous credit unions, a failure of a vendor poses systemic risk issues.  However, NCUA suggested that it be changed to a matter for congressional  consideration because it was a statutory issue rather than one involving the  use of existing NCUA regulatory authority. We agreed with NCUA\u2019s  assessment and have modified the report accordingly.", "NCUA concurred with the report\u2019s recommendation to make improvements  to the process for determining the overhead transfer rate and indicated that  management is in the process of improving the methodology for calculating  this rate. NCUA also concurred in part with our report\u2019s conclusion that the  NCUSIF loss reserve methodology warrants study, in order to further refine  NCUSIF\u2019s estimates. Regarding our recommendation that NCUA study  options for improving its estimates of future insurance losses, NCUA stated  that it is awaiting the receipt of recommendations that FDIC received on  revising its insurance process, and NCUA will review the details of the  revised FDIC process and how to integrate those practices within NCUA\u2019s  system.", "In its response, NCUA proposed an alternative to risk-based insurance  pricing by using the adoption of a PCA approach where required net worth  levels would be tied to an institution\u2019s risk profile. While NCUA\u2019s proposal  may be one option to consider, we continue to recommend that NCUA  evaluate and study various options for achieving a risk-based pricing of  insurance to fairly distribute risk, provide incentives for member credit  unions to control their risk, and focus regulators on higher-risk credit  unions. While it is possible that the option suggested by NCUA would  achieve the objectives, we believe that NCUA should study the costs,  benefits, and risks associated with various options in order to determine  the most effective and cost-beneficial means of achieving a risk-based  system of insurance.", "NCUA disagreed with our recommendation that it should use indicators,  other than \u201cpotential membership,\u201d to determine whether credit unions  have provided greater access to credit union services in underserved areas.  NCUA officials stated that they believe that their data indicated that credit  unions have reached out to underserved communities; implementation of  this recommendation could result in significant and unnecessary data  collection; and Congress has not imposed CRA-like requirements on credit  unions in the past. We agree that federally chartered credit unions have  added underserved areas in record numbers, increasing the numbers of  potential members in these areas, and that membership growth in credit  unions with underserved areas has been greater than for credit unions  overall. However, this information does not indicate whether underserved  individuals or households have received greater access to services (for  example, by using check-cashing services, opening no-fee checking  accounts, or receiving loans) as a result of these field of membership  expansions. Further, while we agree that documenting service to the  underserved would result in additional administrative requirements, the  magnitude and scale of this effort does not necessarily require imposition  of CRA as implemented for banks and thrifts, and could result in  information benefitting future credit union expansion efforts. At a  minimum, it would be useful to know whether membership growth in  credit unions that have added underserved areas has come from the  underserved areas themselves and the extent to which those census tracts  within these areas have been identified as low- or moderate-income. This  type of information, collected uniformly by a federal agency like NCUA,  could serve as first step towards documenting the extent to which credit  unions have reached for members outside of their traditional membership  base. Finally, without this information, it will be difficult for NCUA or  others that are interested to determine whether credit unions have  extended services of any kind to underserved individuals as authorized in  CUMAA.", "Finally, NCUA also concurred with the report\u2019s identification of possible  systemic risk that could be associated with private share insurance that  lacks the full faith and credit backing of a state or the federal government.  NCUA believed that the asset concentration, limited borrowing capacity,  and the lack of any reinsurance of the private insurer present unique  challenges for the eight state supervisory authorities where private  insurance exists today.", "In commenting on the private share insurance section of a draft of this  report, ASI stated that we failed to adequately assess the private share  insurance industry. In summary, as discussed below, ASI raised objections  to the report statements that ASI\u2019s risks are concentrated in a few large  credit unions and a few states; ASI has limited ability to absorb large losses  because it does not have the backing of any governmental agency; and  ASI\u2019s lines of credit are limited in the aggregate as to amount and available  collateral. In response, we considered ASI\u2019s positions and materials  provided, including ASI\u2019s actuarial assumptions and ASI\u2019s past  performance, and believe our report addresses these issues correctly as  originally presented.", "First, in regard to ASI\u2019s concentration risks, ASI stated that the inclusion of  a single large, high-quality credit union provided financial resources that  improved, not diminished, the financial integrity of ASI. Our report  acknowledges this fact. However, our report also notes that this credit  union made up about 25 percent of ASI\u2019s total insured shares, and that ASI\u2019s  five largest credit unions represent nearly 40 percent of ASI\u2019s insured  shares, as of December 2002. While not disputing that the large credit union  would improve ASI\u2019s current financial position, we continue to believe that  this level of concentration in a few credit unions, under adverse economic  conditions, could expose ASI to a potentially high level of losses. ASI also  stated that ASI\u2019s coverage and the geographic distribution of ASI\u2019s insured  credit unions is a matter of state law. The report points out this fact, and we  acknowledge that it limits ASI\u2019s ability to diversify its risks. However, the  fact remains that ASI\u2019s risks are currently concentrated in eight states.", "Second, in response to our report\u2019s assessment of ASI\u2019s limited ability to  absorb catastrophic losses, ASI noted \u201cits sound private deposit insurance  program builds on a solid foundation of careful underwriting, continuous  risk management and the financial backing of its mutual member credit  unions, capable of absorbing large (catastrophic) losses.\u201d In addition, ASI  noted that over its 29-year history, it has paid over 110 claims on failed  credit unions, and that no member of an ASI-insured credit union has ever  lost money. ASI also noted that it could assess its member credit unions up  to 3 percent of their total assets in order to obtain more capital. We  acknowledge these facts in this report; however, our point remains that ASI  has limited borrowing capacity and, under stressful economic conditions,  may have difficulty securing funds from others to meet its obligations. ASI  also objected to the report\u2019s comparison of private share insurance to the  federal insurance program. As the last remaining private share insurer, ASI  has no peer on which to base a comparison and the only alternative to  private share insurance for credit unions is NCUSIF.", "Third, ASI commented that the draft report incorrectly views the  company\u2019s lines of credit as a source of capital. ASI noted that their lines of  credit are solely in place to provide emergency liquidity. We do not disagree  with ASI\u2019s statement. When incorporating ASI\u2019s previously received  technical comments, we clarified in the report that losses on member  deposits, in excess of available cash, investments, and other assets of ASI- insured institutions, would only be covered up to ASI\u2019s available resources  and its secured lines of credit, which serve as a back-up source of funds.  Further, the report notes that ASI\u2019s lines of credit required collaterization  between 80 and 115 percent of current market value of the U.S. government  or agency securities ASI holds. As a result, ASI\u2019s borrowing capacity is  essentially limited to the securities it holds and therefore, in a time of  stressful economic conditions, ASI may have difficulty maintaining its own  liquidity if its insured credit unions were failing and unable to meet the  withdrawal requests of depositors.", "Lastly, ASI supported our previous conclusion that FTC is the appropriate  agency for monitoring and defining private share insurance consumer  disclosure requirements and believed that privately insured credit unions  would benefit from FTC\u2019s enforcement of such provisions. In our  concluding discussions with ASI officials, they emphasized that they were  undertaking efforts to educate their member credit unions on the required  consumer disclosures and taking steps, in conjunction with state credit  union leagues, to ensure compliance.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

NCUA requires federally insured credit unions to submit a quarterly  call report, which contains information on the financial condition and  operations of the institution. Using the call reports, we calculated  descriptive statistics and key financial ratios and determined trends in  financial performance. NCUA provided us with a copy of the electronic  Form 5300 database for our analysis. The database contained year-end  information for December 1992\u2013December 2002. We reviewed NCUA  established procedures for verifying the accuracy of the Form 5300  database and found that the data that forms this database are verified on an  annual basis, either during each credit union\u2019s examination, or through off- site supervision. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of this report. In addition we received a database of  regulatory ratings (CAMEL) from NCUA for 1992\u20132002, on which we (1)  reviewed the data by performing electronic testing of required data  elements, (2) reviewed existing information about the data and the system  that produced them, and (3) interviewed agency officials knowledgeable  about the data. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of this report.", "In addition to using call report data for credit unions, we also used data  collected by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council  (FFIEC) and Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) to compare the financial  condition of and services offered by credit unions with those of other  depository institutions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation (FDIC). We used call report (reporting forms FFIEC 031 and  FFIEC 041 for banks and OTS Form 1313 for thrifts) data obtained from  FDIC\u2019s Statistics on Depository Institutions Web site, which contains  consolidated bank and thrift data stored on FDIC\u2019s Research Information  System database. To assess the reliability of these data, we randomly  cross-checked selected data obtained from this Web site with selected  individual call reports and compared our calculations with aggregate  figures provided by FDIC. Given the context of the analyses, we  determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  our report. For broad, industrywide comparisons with banks involving  industry concentration and capital ratios, we used total assets and equity  capital data for all FDIC-insured institutions, excluding insured branches of  foreign-chartered banks. In order to determine bank and thrift institutions  for our more detailed review, we constructed five peer groups in terms of  institution size as measured by total assets, reported as of December 31,  2002. See table 3 for the definitions we used to create peer groups.", "We specified the maximum total assets of $18 billion by rounding up the  total assets of the largest credit union in our database as of December 31,  2002, to the nearest billion dollars. We also classified bank and thrift  institutions as to whether they emphasized credit card or mortgage loans;  this was done by determining if a given bank had (1) a total loans to total  assets ratio of at least 0.5 and (2) either a credit card loans to total loans  ratio of at least 0.5 or a mortgage loans to total loans ratio of at least 0.5.  The call report data that we used for our financial condition and services  analyses consisted of information on total assets and total loans, as well as  more specific loan holdings data (for example, consumer loans and real  estate loans).

We analyzed 2001 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act  (HMDA) data, the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2001 Survey of Consumer Finances  (SCF), NCUA program literature, and statistical reports of industry trade  and consumer groups. To present our findings, we relied on the combined  message of all these studies and data sources because we found no single  source that contained data on the incomes of credit union and other  depository institution consumers. To compare the income characteristics  of households and neighborhoods that obtain mortgages from credit unions  and banks, we used four income categories\u2014-low, moderate, middle, and  upper\u2014used by financial regulators as part of the Community  Reinvestment Act (CRA) exams. See table 4 for definitions.", "We analyzed loan application records (LAR) from the HMDA database to  compare the proportion of mortgage loans made by credit unions and peer  group banks with households and communities with various income levels.  We used 2001 HMDA data, the most recent data set available from the  Federal Reserve Bank at the time of our review. For the purposes of  comparing credit union lending with that of banks, we included only those  banks with assets of $16 billion or less on December 31, 2001, which was  the size of the largest credit union in 2001, rounded up to the nearest  billion. In addition, we excluded lending institutions that only made  mortgages. Our HMDA analysis included records from 4,195 peer group  banks. We obtained the asset size and total membership for credit unions  reporting to HMDA from NCUA's 2001 call report database and obtained  the asset size of other lenders (to identify the peer group banks) from the  HMDA Lender File, which contains data on the characteristics of  institutions reporting to HMDA, supplied to us by the Federal Reserve.", "Our HMDA analysis did not include all credit unions and banks because  only institutions that meet HMDA\u2019s reporting criteria, such as having a  certain amount of assets, must report their mortgage loans to HMDA. For  example, in 2001, depository institutions with more than $31 million in  assets as of December 31, 2000, were required to report loans to HMDA.  Largely because of this criterion, most credit unions\u201486 percent\u2014were  not required to report mortgage loans to HMDA and, thus, were excluded  from our analysis. However, we believe our analysis is still of value  because, in 2001, reporting credit unions held about 70 percent of credit  union assets and included 62 percent of credit unions\u2019 members.", "For our analysis, we only analyzed LARs for originated loans for the  purchase of one-to-four family homes that served as the purchaser\u2019s  primary dwelling. Our analysis included about 71,000 loans reported by  credit unions and about 807,000 loans reported by peer group banks. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report by performing electronic testing of the required data elements,  reviewing existing information about the data and the system that  produced them, and interviewing agency officials knowledgeable about the  data. We did not independently verify the accuracy of the contents of the  LARs reported to the HMDA database or the accompanying lender file.", "After selecting the records, we determined what proportion of credit union  and bank loans were made to purchasers with low, moderate, middle, and  upper incomes. To do so, we categorized the purchaser's gross annual  income, as identified on the LAR, into one of four income categories based  on the median family income of the MSA in which the purchased home was  located. We did this by matching the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)  on the HMDA LAR with the appropriate Department of Housing and Urban  Development (HUD)-estimated 2001 median family income. We used SAS  version 8.02 version, which is a computer-based data analysis and reporting  software application, to perform all of these analyses. We did not analyze  about 16 percent of the credit union and bank LARs because they did not  contain a MSA. While it is possible that this information was simply not  recorded, lenders must only report MSAs for properties located in MSAs  where their institution has a home or branch office.", "In addition, we determined what proportion of credit union and bank loans  were made for the purchase of properties in census tracts by the median  family income of the census tract. The Federal Reserve Board, in  categorizing each census tract level, used the four income categories used  by the financial regulators (low, moderate, middle, and upper) and used  definitions corresponding to the ones identified in table 4. Because the  median income of each census tract is labeled within HMDA, we did not  have to determine the income category ourselves. We did not analyze about  16 percent of the credit union and bank LARs because they did not contain  a census tract. While it is possible that this information was simply not  recorded, lenders are not responsible for identifying census tract  information if the property is located in a county with less than 30,000  people or if the property was located in an area that did not have census  tracts for the 1990 census.", "Finally, we analyzed the race and ethnicity data in HMDA to compare the  lending records of credit unions and banks whose loans met our criteria. As  noted in appendix VI, about 15 percent of records for credit unions lacked  race and ethnicity data and 6 percent of records for banks. While it is  possible that this information was simply not recorded, applicants filing  loan applications by mail or by telephone are not obligated to provide this  information.", "We also analyzed the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2001 SCF, a triennial survey of U.S.  households sponsored by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve  System with the cooperation of Treasury, and reviewed secondary sources  to identify the characteristics of credit union members. We analyzed the  SCF because it is a respected source of publicly available data on financial  institution and consumer demographics that is nationally representative  and because it was the only comprehensive source of publicly available  data with information on financial institutions and consumer demographics  that we could identify. We analyzed the SCF to develop statistics on the  income, race, age, and education of credit union members and bank  customers. Because some customers use both credit unions and banks, we  performed our income analysis based on the assumption that households  can be divided into four user categories\u2014those who use credit unions only,  those who primarily use credit unions, those who use banks only, and those  who primarily use banks. Dr. Jinkook Lee of Ohio State University  developed these categories.

The credit union locations  were selected based on a convenience sample using state and city location  coupled with random selection of main or branch locations within each  city. About 90 percent of the locations we visited were the main institution  rather than a branch institution.

Although  neither these site visits, nor the findings they produced, render a  statistically valid sample of all possible main and branch locations of  privately insured credit unions necessary in order to determine the \u201cextent\u201d  of compliance, we believe that what we found is robust enough, both in the  aggregate and within each state, to raise concern about lack of disclosure  in privately insured credit unions. During each site visit, using a systematic  check sheet, we noted whether or not the credit union had conspicuously  displayed the fact that the institution was not federally insured (on signs or  stickers, for example).", "In addition, from these same 57 sites visited, we collected a total of 227  credit union documents that we analyzed for disclosure compliance.

In addition, a well-capitalized credit union whose earnings are  depleted may be permitted to pay dividends from its regular reserve  provided that such payment would not cause the credit union to fall below  the adequately capitalized level. Secondly, to account for the inability of  credit unions to issue capital stock, the final rule relies on the Net Worth  Restoration Plan, which must be submitted by credit unions classified as  undercapitalized or lower. Finally, to recognize that credit unions\u2019 boards  of directors consist primarily of volunteers, the rule exempts credit unions  that are near to being adequately capitalized from the discretionary  supervisory action authorizing NCUA to order a new election of the board  of directors.", "NCUA reported that the final rule established discretionary supervisory  actions that are essentially comparable to section 38 of FDIA, which  specifies \u201cdiscretionary safeguards\u201d for other depository institutions.

NCUA\u2019s rationale for these exclusions was that, unlike banks,  credit unions cannot sell stock to raise capital and are not controlled by  holding companies.", "NCUA departed from FDIA discretionary safeguards in fashioning three of  the discretionary supervisory actions: (1) dismissals of senior officers or  directors, (2) exemption of officers from discretionary supervisory actions,  and (3) ordering a new election of the boards of directors. NCUA reported  that the discretionary supervisory action for director dismissals departs  significantly from its FDIA counterpart. The FDIA safeguard protects from  dismissal of officials with office tenures of 180 days or less, when an  institution becomes undercapitalized. In contrast, NCUA contends that  such a \u201csafe harbor\u201d is unnecessary for credit unions. Moreover, NCUA  field experience supports the view that short-tenured officers can be as  responsible as others for rapidly declining net worth.", "With regard to exempting officers from discretionary supervisory actions,  NCUA provides conditional relief to credit unions in contrast to the FDIA.  For example, the report notes that FDIA allows 11 discretionary safeguards  to be imposed on undercapitalized institutions. On the other hand, NCUA\u2019s  comparable discretionary supervisory actions can be imposed against  undercapitalized credit unions in the first tier of that category only when  they fail to comply with any of CUMAA\u2019s four mandatory supervisory  actions or fail to implement an approved Net Worth Restoration Plan.NCUA\u2019s rationale for granting relief from the relevant discretionary  supervisory actions is to avoid treating credit unions that are just short of  adequately capitalized as harshly as those that are almost significantly  undercapitalized.", "NCUA\u2019s report states that it modified the discretionary supervisory action  ordering a new election of the board of directors. Specifically, NCUA  excludes undercapitalized credit unions from this requirement but applies  it to significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized credit  unions.

In general, the report describes NCUA\u2019s comprehensive  approach to evaluating a credit union\u2019s individual risk exposure. It explains  the RBNW requirement that applies to complex credit unions. The RBNW  requirement takes into account whether credit unions classified as  adequately capitalized provide adequate protection against risks posed by  contingent liabilities, among other risks. According to the RBNW report,  NCUA\u2019s approach (1) targets credit unions that carry an above-average  level of exposure to material risk, (2) allows an alternative method to  calculate the amount of net worth needed to remain adequately capitalized  or well-capitalized, and (3) makes available a risk mitigation credit to  reflect quantitative evidence of risk mitigation.", "NCUA reported that its final rule targets credit unions that have higher  material risk levels, thus warranting an extra measure of capital to protect  them and NCUSIF from losses. As noted previously, credit unions do not  issue stocks that create shareholder equity. Without shareholder equity to  absorb losses, the RBNW requirement serves to mitigate most forms of risk  in a complex credit union\u2019s portfolio. Specifically, the RBNW measures the  risk level of on- and off-balance sheet items in the credit union\u2019s \u201crisk  portfolios.\u201d The requirement applies only if a credit union\u2019s total assets at  the end of a quarter exceed $10 million, and its RBNW requirement under  the standard calculation exceeds 6 percent. The $10 million asset floor  eliminates the burden on credit unions that are unlikely to impose a  material risk.", "NCUA uses two methods to determine whether a complex credit union  meets its RBNW requirement. Under the \u201cstandard calculation,\u201d each of  eight risk portfolios is multiplied by one or more corresponding risk  weightings to produce eight \u201cstandard components.\u201d The sum of the eight  standard components yields the RBNW requirement that the credit union\u2019s  net worth ratio must meet for it to remain either adequately capitalized or  well-capitalized. If the RBNW requirement is not met, the credit union falls  into the undercapitalized net worth category. NCUA allows a credit union  that does not meet its RBNW requirement under the standard calculation to  substitute for any of the three standard components, a corresponding  \u201calternative component\u201d that may reduce the RBNW requirement. The  alternative components recognize finer increments of risk in real estate  loans, member business loans, and investments.", "Finally, in reporting on the RBNW requirement, NCUA recognized that  credit unions, which failed under the standard calculation and with the  alternative components, nonetheless might individually be able to mitigate  material risk. In such instances, a risk mitigation credit is available to credit  unions that succeed in demonstrating mitigation of interest rate or  credit risk.If approved, a risk mitigation credit will reduce the RBNW  requirement a credit union must satisfy to remain classified as adequately  capitalized or above."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Accounting for Share Insurance", "paragraphs": ["The National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) capitalizes its  insurance fund differently than the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  (FDIC) capitalizes the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) and the Savings  Association Insurance Fund (SAIF). For NCUSIF, a cash deposit in the fund  equal to 1 percent of insured shares, adjusted at least annually, must remain  on deposit with the fund for the period a credit union remains federally  insured. This deposit is treated as an asset on the credit union\u2019s financial  statements, and as part of equity on NCUSIF\u2019s financial statements in an  account entitled \u201cInsured credit unions\u2019 accumulated contributions.\u201d If a  credit union leaves federal insurance, for example to become privately  insured, the deposit with NCUSIF is refunded. However, if the National  Credit Union Administration\u2019s (NCUA) board assesses additional premiums  in order to maintain the minimum required equity ratio, the premiums are  treated as an operating expense on the credit unions\u2019 financial statements  and would not be refunded. Since 2000, NCUA has not made any  distributions to contributing credit unions because the fund did not exceed  the NCUA board\u2019s specific operating level. And, between 1990 and 2002,  federally insured credit unions were assessed premiums only in 1991 and  1992, when the fund\u2019s equity declined below the mandated minimum  normal o rcent of insured shares. 1.20 pep erating l evel ofHowever, unlike federally insured credit unions, federally insured banks  and thrifts operate exclusively under a premium-based insurance system.  This system requires banks and thrifts to remit a premium payment of a  specified percent of their balance of insured deposits twice a year to FDIC  to obtain federal deposit insurance. Each bank or thrift treats the premium  as an expense in its financial statements, while FDIC recognizes the  premium as income in its financial statements. If a bank or thrift elects to  not continue its federal deposit insurance, its premiums are, unlike the  NCUSIF insurance deposit, nonrefundable. or 3) and a supervisory subgroup (A, B, or C).This resulted in the best- rated institutions being categorized as 1-A and the worst institutions as 3-C.  These categorizations result in a range of premium costs, with the best- rated institutions paying the lowest premium and the worst-rated  institutions paying the highest premium.", "In August 2000, FDIC issued a report that discussed the current deposit  insurance system, including the existence of two separate funds, an  insurance pricing system that may provide inappropriate incentives for risk  and growth, and issues of fairness and equitable insurance coverage, and  offered possible solutions. The report warned that this system might  require banks to fund insurance losses when they can least afford it.  Solutions offered in the report included (1) merging BIF and SAIF, (2)  improving the pricing of insurance premiums through a number of options,  and (3) setting a \u201csoft\u201d target for the reserve ratio, which would allow the  deposit insurance fund balances to grow during favorable economic  periods, thereby smoothing premium costs over a longer period of time.

ASI is currently  authorized  in  nine  states  and  insuring  credit  unions  in  eight  nationally,  and  is  limited  to  insuring  only  state- chartered  credit  unions  in  those  states  in  which  the  company  is  authorized  to  do  business.  In  its  current  states  of  operation,  the  company  insures  212  credit  unions,  comprising  $10.8  billion  in  insured  shares.  What  the  Study  Section fails to report is that these credit unions represent 19% of all 1,095 state-chartered credit unions within that  limited  market,  and  13.67%  of  the  $80  billion in  shares  in  those  same  1,095  credit  unions.  Clearly,  private  share  insurance is more significant to those affected states than the Study Section\u2019s 2% statistic infers.", "The Study Section also reports that 45% of all shares insured by ASI are in credit unions chartered in California, as  compared to 14.7% for the NCUSIF. These facts can be misleading given that ASI has a  limited  market, and the  NCUSIF operates in all 50 states. An entirely different, but more comparable, result is achieved when one isolates  the relative risk in these eight states only. Under an assumption that both entities are limited to doing business in  just the eight ASI states, ASI\u2019s 45% concentration in California looks significantly less daunting when compared to  55% for the NCUSIF. This should offer evidence that when placed on equal footing, the relative risk concentration  variances are reduced materially.", "While eight states represent a limited market, they do not necessarily represent a geographic concentration risk, as  inferred by the Study Section.

First, a state must have a  state statute that allows for an option in share insurance. According to the Study Section, a total of approximately  20 state statutes currently allow for the share insurance option for their state-chartered credit unions. Based on this  data, ASI is operating in about 40%-50% of the available markets. Furthermore, the actual power to approve such  coverage,  when  permitted  by  statute,  is  generally  resident  with  the  specific  state\u2019s  credit  union  supervisory  authority. So, as a private company, to do business in any state requires that three basic conditions exist: (1) credit  union demand; (2) a permissible statute; and, (3) regulatory acceptance of the option.", "Based on these legislative and regulatory barriers, we take exception to the GAO constantly using the federal share  insurer, the NCUSIF, as a benchmark in evaluating a private company\u2019s geographic concentration risk. Due to the  agency\u2019s federal franchise, none of the above conditions need be present for the NCUSIF to do business in a state.", "The business of insuring credit union member deposits is a business of risk assumption. Accordingly, the type of  risk  one  assumes  drives  the  cost  of  the  program  and  the  risk  of  ultimate  loss  to  the  fund.  ASI  has  been  very  selective in assuming the risk it underwrites, and does a thorough job of monitoring and field examining its insured  institutions  on  a  recurring  basis  as  reported  in  the  Study  Section.  In  addition,  the  Study  Section  reports  that  the  company  has  denied  insurance  coverage  to  certain  credit  unions  representing  inordinate  risk  to  the  fund,  and  conversely has approved many that satisfy the company\u2019s Risk Eligibility Standards. Of the 29 credit unions that  have converted to private share insurance during the past decade, all were at the time, and are now, safe and sound  credit unions, and all strictly complied with the federal requirements to convert insurance. These were not problem  credit unions fleeing federal supervision. Included in these federal requirements is a mail ballot vote of the credit  union\u2019s entire membership.", "Risk in a Few Large Credit Unions  The Study Section reports that ASI has one insured institution that represents approximately 25% of its total insured  shares,  and  that  its  \u201cTop  Five\u201d  credit  unions  represent  40%  of  total  insured  shares.  The  first  statistic  compares  unfavorably  to  the  NCUSIF\u2019s  reported  concentration  risk  in  a  single  institution  of  3%,  to  which  we  take  no  exception. The risk of a single institution, however, has been significantly misrepresented in the Study Section.

Second,  ASI\u2019s  independent  actuaries  evaluated  the  adequacy  of  ASI\u2019s  capital  prior  to,  and  following,  the  underwriting  of  this  credit  union,  and  determined that ASI would continue to have a sufficiently high probability of sustaining runs even with this credit  union  in  its  insurance  fund.  Lastly,  the  federal  insurer  and  state  regulator  both  approved  of  the  credit  union\u2019s  insurance conversion, but only after the credit union took a full mail ballot vote of its almost 200,000 members and  agreed to satisfy all the requirements of consumer disclosure under FDICIA.", "With regard to the risk concentrated in a few large credit unions, the Study Section fails to report the concentration  risk in what would be the equivalent of the NCUSIF\u2019s \u201cTop Five\u201d federally insured credit unions. Proportionately,  this would equate to the NCUSIF\u2019s top 230 federally insured credit unions.

In the cooperative spirit of the credit union movement, private share insurance was designed  to  be  a  credit  union-owned  and  credit  union-operated  private  fund.  Nor  was  it  ever  the  intent  of  the  framers  of  private share insurance for it to operate without supervision, or financial capacity. Accordingly, various state laws  were proactively sought and passed to permit the private share insurance option, subject to admission standards and  required approvals. Private share insurance was designed to provide credit unions with a comparable \u2013 not identical  --  alternative  means  for  protecting  member  share  accounts.  Accordingly,  a  government  backing  for  private  share  insurance was never  anticipated, and to use the lack  of such a guarantee as  a criticism of private share insurance  does not take into account its legislative intent, past performance or founding principles.", "To  our  knowledge,  no  private  insurance  company,  licensed  by  individual  states,  has  a  guarantee  from  the  federal  government. Further, no private insurance company in the U.S. would be able to meet the \u201cdeep pockets\u201d test of the  federal or state governments inferred in the Study Section.

In  over  29  years,  ASI\u2019s  loss  ratio  has  been  significantly below that of its federal counterpart, and ASI has never had a year with an operating loss, nor has it  ever had to seek any form of recapitalization from its member credit unions to bolster the fund due to losses.", "The  reality  is  that  a  sound  deposit  insurance  program,  built  upon  a  solid  foundation  of  careful  underwriting,  continuous  risk  management  and  the  financial  backing  of  its  mutual  member  credit  unions,  can  exist  as  long  as  consideration is given to an actuarial analysis of the capital adequacy of the program in terms of sufficiently high  probabilities  (over  90%)  of  being  able  to  withstand  runs  and  multiple  runs  on  the  system.   This  is  a  common  analysis that is accepted in the insurance industry for various kinds of low frequency, high-severity risk programs  and  is  the  foundation  that  the  ASI  insurance  program  is  built  upon.

The  committed  lines  ensure liquidity of ASI\u2019s invested funds; i.e., they provide a mechanism for ASI to quickly generate cash to meet  liquidity needs, without having to liquidate the portfolio.  Resources available for funding losses are not the same as  resources  available  for  providing  liquidity.  Lines  of  credit  are  not  intended  to  be  a  source  for  funding  insurance  losses. In fact, banks would not provide a loan for such a purpose.
