FEMA has taken some actions, including issuing additional guidance and  developing specific training, among other things, to improve Public  Assistance implementation in Puerto Rico and the USVI. However, it is  too soon to assess their effectiveness in addressing these issues.", "Clarity of Guidance. In March 2019, we reported that officials from  FEMA, COR3, and municipalities said they experienced initial challenges  with the recovery process, including concerns about lack of experience  and knowledge of the alternative procedures; and concerns about  missing, incomplete, or conflicting guidance from FEMA on the alternative  procedures. In addition, in our June 2019 testimony statement we  continued to report on these challenges and preliminary observations  from our ongoing work indicate that these challenges continue. For  example, officials from Puerto Rico\u2019s government agencies told us they  did not feel they had sufficient guidance on the FEMA Public Assistance  program and where they did, written and verbal FEMA guidance was  inconsistent or conflicting. For instance, officials from one agency  expressed their desire for more FEMA guidance communicated in writing  as FEMA officials would frequently interpret existing guidance differently.  Similarly, officials from two agencies described situations where they had  initially been directed to follow one interpretation of a policy, only to be  directed to follow a different, conflicting interpretation in the subsequent  months. Puerto Rico agency officials also stated that the lack of sufficient  instruction led to a \u201cback and forth\u201d with FEMA for clarifications, which led  to delays in the phases of project development. For example, officials  from one Puerto Rico government agency stated that conflicting verbal  instructions from several FEMA officials contributed to delays in opening  the bidding process for recovery-related contracts. FEMA officials in  Puerto Rico stated that the agency has developed specific guidance for  disaster recovery in Puerto Rico and that there are various ways, such as  in-person meetings, where officials from Puerto Rico can obtain  clarification. FEMA officials also reported that they developed additional  training for new FEMA employees. We are continuing to examine this  issue as part of our ongoing review of Puerto Rico\u2019s recovery.", "FEMA\u2019s new delivery model in Puerto Rico. In May 2019, FEMA\u2019s  Federal Disaster Recovery Coordinator for Puerto Rico announced that  FEMA was transitioning to using the new Public Assistance program  delivery model in Puerto Rico beginning on June 3, 2019. Among other  things, the implementation of the new delivery model establishes a new  Consolidated Resource Center in Puerto Rico to support grant  development for disaster recovery across all recovery sectors and  geographic branches. Following the hurricanes, FEMA implemented a  program delivery model developed specifically for Puerto Rico which  included, among other things, a sector-based approach which  coordinated recovery resources across the federal interagency, private  sector, and nongovernmental organizations to identify and complete  proposed work. According to FEMA officials, the decision to transition  from the initial delivery model to the new delivery model in Puerto Rico  was due to improvements made since its nationwide deployment in 2017.  In response, COR3 officials raised concerns about the scope of the  changes and potential challenges with the amount of time and resources  needed to transition to the new delivery model.", "The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. We reported in June 2019 that in  both Puerto Rico and the USVI, FEMA and local officials have reported  challenges with the implementation of the flexibilities authorized by  section 20601 of the Bipartisan Budget Act. This section of the Act  allows for the provision of assistance under the Public Assistance  alternative procedures to restore disaster-damaged facilities or systems  that provide critical services\u2014such as medical and educational facilities\u2014 to an industry standard without regard to pre-disaster condition. Officials from Puerto Rico\u2019s central government stated that they disagreed with  FEMA\u2019s interpretation of the types of damages covered by section 20601  of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. In response, FEMA officials in  Puerto Rico stated they held several briefings with Puerto Rico\u2019s central  recovery office to explain FEMA\u2019s interpretation of the section. In  addition, FEMA officials in the USVI told us that initially, they had difficulty  obtaining clarification from FEMA headquarters regarding how to  implement key components of section 20601 of the Act. Further, USVI  officials stated that at times, the appropriate process for implementing  components of the Act was not clear and that ensuring program  participants understood its key components was difficult. However, FEMA  officials in the USVI stated that they continue to move forward with  developing alternative procedures projects. USVI officials also told us that  FEMA had been responsive and helpful in identifying its options for using  the new flexibilities the Act provides.", "Developing Fixed-Cost Estimates. Preliminary observations from our  ongoing work indicate that as of May 2019, FEMA had obligated funding  for four alternative procedures program projects in Puerto Rico and two  projects in the USVI. FEMA officials in Puerto Rico and the USVI stated  that the ongoing development of a \u201ccost factor\u201d for use in the fixed-cost  estimating process has slowed the pace of FEMA obligations for  permanent work projects. Specifically, these factors are intended to  ensure that the costs associated with implementing projects in Puerto  Rico and the USVI are sufficiently captured when developing the fixed- cost estimates for alternative procedures projects. Since incorporating the  cost factor into the fixed-cost estimating process will increase the amount  of funding obligated for any given permanent work project, FEMA officials  explained that Puerto Rico and the USVI have an incentive to delay the  obligation of individual projects until this factor is finalized. For example,  FEMA officials in the USVI told us in May 2019 that obligations for  permanent work projects in the territory were mostly on hold until the  USVI-specific cost factor was finalized. As of June 2019, the cost factors  for use in both Puerto Rico and the USVI had not yet been finalized.", "According to FEMA guidance, the Puerto Rico-specific cost factor is being  developed by a third-party center of excellence comprising personnel  selected by FEMA and Puerto Rico, through COR3. In March 2019, we  reported that while FEMA had identified and chosen personnel, COR3  had not yet finalized its hiring of personnel to staff the center of  excellence, which resulted in delaying the cost estimation process.  Through our ongoing work we learned that, as of June 2019, COR3 had  identified and hired personnel to staff the center; however, FEMA and  COR3 have not come to agreement on a cost estimation approach.  Further, according to FEMA officials, no timeline has been established for  the completion of the center of excellence\u2019s standard operating  procedures for developing fixed-cost estimates for permanent work  projects in Puerto Rico.", "In addition, according to FEMA officials, the USVI-specific factor is being  developed by an independent contractor. FEMA officials told us that  territorial officials disagreed with the initial cost factors this contractor  proposed and contended the factors were insufficient in accurately  capturing the unique circumstances that influence construction costs in  the territory, such as the limited availability of local resources and the  need to import materials and labor. As of June 2019, these officials told  us the contractor was developing a third and final cost factor for potential  incorporation into the fixed-cost estimation process in the USVI. Despite  these delays, FEMA officials in the USVI stated that they continue to work  with territorial officials to develop alternative procedures projects in the  territory. They added that once the cost factor is finalized and  incorporated into FEMA\u2019s fixed-cost estimating process, FEMA and the  USVI will be well positioned to quickly finalize these projects and obligate  funding. However, we reported in June 2019 that the territory plans to  take a cautious approach in pursuing permanent work projects using the  Public Assistance alternative procedures program. Specifically, USVI  officials we interviewed told us that developing fixed-cost estimates for  alternative procedures projects that accurately incorporate the future  impact of inflation and increases in materials and labor costs for certain  projects was difficult. Further, these officials stated that since the territory  is financially responsible for any costs that exceed these fixed-cost  estimates, the USVI plans to pursue alternative procedures projects that  do not include high levels of complexity or uncertainty to reduce the risk  of cost overruns, especially given its already difficult financial situation.", "As established in FEMA guidance, Puerto Rico\u2019s deadline for finalizing  fixed-cost estimates for permanent work projects using the alternative  procedures\u2014and the Bipartisan Budget Act, as applicable\u2014is October  2019. Since Puerto Rico must use the alternative procedures for all  large permanent work, all fixed-cost estimates for Public Assistance  program permanent work projects in Puerto Rico must be finalized by this  date, or, according to FEMA officials, Puerto Rico must request that  FEMA extend this deadline on a project-by-project basis. In contrast, the  USVI has the flexibility to pursue either the alternative procedures or the  standard procedures on a project-by-project basis. As the USVI\u2019s  deadline for finalizing these projects is in March 2020, it is too early  gauge the extent to which the alternative procedures will play a role in the  USVI\u2019s long-term recovery strategy.", "We will continue to evaluate these identified challenges and any efforts to  address them, as well as other aspects of recovery efforts in the USVI  and Puerto Rico, and plan to report our findings in late 2019 and early  2020, respectively.", "Thank you, Chairman Payne, Ranking Member King, and Members of the  Subcommittee.
