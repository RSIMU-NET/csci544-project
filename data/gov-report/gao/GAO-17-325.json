With the exception of ICE, these agencies are also required to record in their case management systems whether the crime took place in Indian country. ICE officials explained that the agency does not record this information because, unlike BIA and the FBI, ICE is not generally involved in criminal investigations in Indian country. Typically, ICE would only conduct an investigation in Indian country if specifically invited by a tribe to do so. Further, with the exception of BIA, these agencies do not require their agents or attorneys to collect or record Native American status of victims in their cases due to concerns about victim privacy and lack of relevance of the victim's race to the substance of the investigation or prosecution.", "The Departments of Justice (DOJ), Health and Human Services (HHS), and Homeland Security (DHS) administered at least 50 grant programs from fiscal years 2013 through 2016 that could help address Native American human trafficking. For example, 21 of these grant programs, which were administered by DOJ and HHS, could be used to provide services to Native American human trafficking victims. However, the total number of Native American victims who received services under these grant programs is unknown. HHS is developing a data collection tool that grantees can use to report information on human trafficking victims served, including Native American status of victims. DOJ's Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) requires grantees to report Native American status of victims served, but not by type of crime. DOJ's Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) do not require grantees to collect and report Native American status of victims served. However, in fiscal year 2017, OVC began providing recipients of human trafficking-specific grant programs the option to report the race or Native American status of victims served. While Native American status may not generally be a factor for determining whether a victim can receive services, it may be a factor for determining how best to assist this particular demographic. According to the 2013-2017 Federal Strategic Action Plan on Services for Victims of Human Trafficking in the United States, expanding human trafficking data collection and research efforts for Native Americans and other vulnerable populations is an area for improvement for the federal government. Additionally, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that quality information should be used to achieve objectives based on relevant data from reliable sources.

HHS expects to pilot test  these uniform data elements and make them available for public  comment in fiscal year 2017, after which HHS may make revisions,  submit the revised tool to the Office of Management and Budget for  review, and then make the tool available to grantees.", "According to OVC and OJJDP officials, they do not require grantees to  collect and report victims\u2019 Native American status because it is generally  not an eligibility requirement for receiving victim services. They also  raised concerns about whether including the victims\u2019 race or Native  American status in grant reports, which could be made available to the  public, could compromise the victims\u2019 confidentiality. According to  OJJDP, its grantees are required to submit descriptive demographic data  for youth victims served, and those data are included in OJJDP\u2019s  performance measurement system. However, this system does not  include data on the Native American status of youth victims served;  rather, grantees identify whether or not they provided services to any  Native American youth victims during the reporting period. According to  OVC, beginning in fiscal year 2017, OVC provided an optional category in  the Trafficking Information Management System (TIMS) to allow grantees  of human trafficking-specific grant programs\u2014that is, grant programs  funded by the Trafficking Victims Protection Act\u2014to report the race or  Native American status of victims served. However, OVC does not  require grantees to report the race of human trafficking victims because  race is not a performance measure for OVC grantees. Also, OVC officials  stated that in communities with few members of a particular race, if  grantees have just one victim of that race in their data, people may  correctly guess the identity of that victim. Similarly, OVW noted the  importance of balancing the need for monitoring data with the provision of  timely, accessible, and confidential services.  OVW officials stated that  OVW maintains this balance by collecting an aggregate number of Native  American victims served during each 6-month reporting period rather than  collecting this information for each type of victimization\u2014including sex  trafficking\u2014which OVW officials believe could jeopardize victim  confidentiality, especially in rural tribal communities. We understand the  importance of maintaining victim confidentiality, in which case for  grantees concerned that reporting the number of Native American human  trafficking victims served could reveal the identity of those victims, OVC,  OJJDP, and OVW could consider exempting them from any such  reporting requirement on a case-by-case basis.", "Also, while Native American status is generally not a factor for  determining whether a victim can receive services or relevant for current  performance measures, it may be a factor for determining how best to  assist this particular demographic. According to the 2013-2017 Federal  Strategic Action Plan on Services for Victims of Human Trafficking in the  United States, expanding human trafficking data collection and research  efforts for vulnerable populations, which include Native Americans, is an  area for improvement for the federal government. The plan also states  that vulnerable populations, including Native Americans, are often under- identified as victims, which leads to unreliable statistics. The plan states  that the federal government acknowledges that it currently does not have  enough information on human trafficking and service provision to Native  Americans and other vulnerable populations to begin making  recommendations on evidence-based practices to the field. It goes on to  state that vulnerable populations require more attention and focus so that  responses to human trafficking are effective and federal agencies are  committed to spending the time and resources to learn more. The plan  establishes goals to provide and improve services to vulnerable  populations.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that  quality information should be used to achieve objectives based on  relevant data from reliable sources. Agencies are expected to identify  the information requirements needed to meet their objectives and on a  timely basis obtain the relevant data based on the requirements. Without  collecting data on the Native American status of victims served, federal  agencies will not know the extent to which they are achieving  government-wide strategic goals to provide and improve services to  vulnerable populations, including Native American crime victims.", "In addition, awareness about whether a victim of human trafficking is  Native American can be helpful to ensure culturally appropriate practices  are made available in the healing and recovery process. HHS\u2019  Administration for Native Americans reported that there is a need for  culturally relevant and trauma-informed approaches when assisting  victims. For example, using women\u2019s circles and other culturally  appropriate practices have proven helpful in the healing process for  Native American victims. According to a Trafficking in Indian Country brief  released by the National Congress for American Indians, many Native  American human trafficking victims felt they owed their survival to Native  cultural practices and most wished for Native healing approaches to be  integrated with mainstream services."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Native Americans experience several risk factors that make them  vulnerable to becoming victims of human trafficking. Federal agencies  responsible for addressing human trafficking have acknowledged that  Native Americans are a vulnerable population and have set agency and  government-wide goals to help ensure public safety in Indian country and  protect Native Americans from human trafficking and other crimes.  Federal agencies that have the authority to investigate and prosecute  human trafficking crimes in Indian country generally record in their case  management systems whether the crime took place in Indian country.  They do not always record the Native American status of victims,  however, because that information may not generally be relevant to the  case or it may have the potential to identify particular victims. Native  American status may have relevance with respect to the provision of  services, nonetheless. While victim confidentiality must be protected  accordingly, the absence of data collection by granting agencies  regarding the Native American status of human trafficking victims served  hinders their ability to determine whether their victim assistance goals are  being met. It may also make it difficult to determine where to focus their  efforts on providing culturally appropriate services that have been shown  to aid in the healing and restoration of Native American victims of crime."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that DOJ is contributing to efforts to improve data  collection and service provision to Native Americans, we recommend that:  the Director of OVW require grantees to report the number of human  trafficking victims served using grant funding, and, as appropriate, the  Native American status of those victims; and  the Assistant Attorney General for OJP direct OVC and OJJDP to  require their grantees to report the number of human trafficking  victims served using grant funding, and, as appropriate, the Native  American status of those victims."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a copy of our report to HHS, DHS, DOI, and DOJ for review  and comment. DHS and DOI stated that they did not have any comments  on our report. HHS and DOJ provided technical comments, which we  incorporated as appropriate. DOJ also provided written comments, which  are reproduced in appendix III.", "DOJ partially agreed with our recommendations. In its comments, DOJ  indicated a willingness to implement the first part of the  recommendations, which is to require grantees to report the number of  human trafficking victims served with grant funding. However, DOJ  disagreed with the second part of the recommendations, which is to  require grantees to report the Native American status of those victims. As  we stated in our report, OVC currently requires its grantees to report the  number of human trafficking victims served through the Trafficking  Information Management System (TIMS). According to DOJ, OJJDP  could require grantees for its human trafficking-related grant programs to  report the number of human trafficking victims served through OJJDP\u2019s  Data Collection and Technical Assistance Tool (DCTAT). Similarly, DOJ  stated that OVW will begin asking grantees to include the number of sex  trafficking victims served in their grantee progress reports.", "However, DOJ identified several reasons why OVC, OJJDP, and OVW  should not require grantees to report the Native American status of  human trafficking victims served, including concerns about overburdening  grantees, having a chilling effect on the delivery of services, and victim  confidentiality. With respect to overburdening grantees, DOJ stated that it  would be hard to justify collecting Native American status solely for  victims of human trafficking and not for victims of others types of crime.  Therefore, according to DOJ, implementing our recommendation would  lead the components to collect demographic information for all types of  victimizations, thereby greatly increasing the burden on service providers.", "We believe that collecting demographic information on victims of all types  of crimes could be very informative; however, our recommendation is that  DOJ collect demographic data specific to its human trafficking programs,  as appropriate. DOJ has identified combating human trafficking as a  priority for the department, and the Federal Strategic Action Plan on  Services for Victims of Human Trafficking in the United States identifies  Native Americans as a vulnerable population. Therefore, we believe that  collecting additional information specifically on Native American human  trafficking victims is justifiable. In addition, based on preliminary results of  a survey we conducted as part of a related review, it appears that some  of the DOJ- and HHS-funded victim service providers do collect  information on the Native American status of victims served by type of  victimization. We surveyed 315 victim service providers that received  funding from either DOJ or HHS in fiscal year 2015; 162 of the providers  responded. Of the 162, 67 reported that they provided services to at least  one human trafficking victim, and 58 were able to tell us whether any of  the human trafficking victims they served were Native American; 9 were  not able to tell us.", "Concerning the potential chilling effect on service delivery, according to  DOJ, asking victims about their race could cause confusion, fear, or make  the individual  less likely to engage in services. Therefore, DOJ is opposed  to requiring victims to disclose their race, but acknowledged that if victims  voluntarily disclose this information, grantees could include victims\u2019 race  when reporting to DOJ. Similarly, with respect to victim confidentiality,  DOJ stated that collecting Native American status by type of victimization  creates a much greater\u2014and unnecessary\u2014risk that a particular victim  could be publicly identified, especially in rural tribal communities. Also,  according to DOJ, OVW grantees are statutorily prohibited from reporting  a victim\u2019s personally identifying  information to OVW for grant monitoring  purposes. It is not our position that victims should be required to disclose  their race in order to receive services, and that certainly was not the intent  of our recommendation. However, we do think there are situations where  it may be appropriate to ask the victim about their race. We also  understand that there may be instances where reporting the Native  American status of human trafficking victims could, on its own, or in  conjunction with other information, identify individual  victims. As we stated  in our report, the components could exempt grantees from reporting  Native American status on a case-by-case basis if such instances arise.  To help ensure that our recommendation is not interpreted to mean that  DOJ must require human trafficking victims to disclose their Native  American status or that grantees must report Native American status,  even if doing so significantly increases the risk that the victim could be  identified, we modified our recommendation. Specifically, we clarified that  agencies should require grantees to report the Native American status of  human trafficking victims \u201cas appropriate.\u201d", "DOJ identified other reasons why requiring grantees to report the Native  American status of human trafficking victims was not necessary. One  benefit to collecting this information that we cited in our report is that DOJ  would be able to help ensure that Native American victims are receiving  culturally appropriate services. However, DOJ stated that OVC and OVW  already use grantee progress reports to monitor whether grantees are  providing culturally appropriate services and to identify promising  practices for doing so. Further, DOJ stated that it funds training and  technical assistance for grantees on providing culturally appropriate  services to Native Americans. We are encouraged by DOJ\u2019s efforts  related to ensuring that Native Americans are receiving culturally- appropriate services, and we think having information on which of their  grantees are serving Native American victims, and how many victims  there are, could enhance their efforts.", "Finally, DOJ stated that the utility of the data that grantees would report  on Native American status of human trafficking victims would be limited  because it would not be statistically relevant. Specifically, grantee data  would not identify all Native American human trafficking victims, but just  those served with DOJ funding. DOJ said that efforts underway by the  Bureau of Justice Statistics and the National Institute of Justice would  produce more meaningful data. We recognize that grantee data cannot  be used to determine the prevalence of human trafficking of Native  Americans nationwide. That was never the intent of the recommendation,  especially considering the challenges that DOJ and others have  previously identified with respect to estimating prevalence of human  trafficking, in general. Rather, we recognized that the federal strategic  action plan articulated a need for more information on Native American  victims of human trafficking, and collecting information on the extent to  which DOJ funding is being used to provide services to this population is  an incremental step towards bridging this information gap.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

From fiscal years 2012 through 2015, the National  Institute of Justice (NIJ) awarded Trafficking in Persons grants to San  Diego State University, Abt Associates, Inc. and Northeastern University  for this purpose.

The Labor Trafficking among Migrant Workers in  North Carolina project sought to identify indicators that could be used by  state and local law enforcement as signals that labor trafficking may be  taking place in their communities. The goals of the study were to: (1)  document the characteristics and indicators of labor trafficking, including  component crimes, collateral crimes, and other community impacts; and  (2) provide law enforcement with actionable knowledge to help identify  labor trafficking. Researchers interviewed 380 farmworkers, who were  attending migrant worker and Hispanic/Latino festivals or living at farm  labor camps, and collected data on demographic characteristics (age,  sex, race/ethnicity), citizenship and language spoken at home,  unemployment and agricultural business patterns, crime, communicable  disease, and pregnancy and infant mortality. According to researchers,  these data allowed them to develop a comprehensive description of  farmworkers who are being exploited and may be in labor trafficking  situations. The study was completed in August 2013.", "The second San Diego State University project, Looking for a Hidden  Population: Trafficking of Migrant Laborers in San Diego County, applied  respondent-driven sampling and unique access to migrant communities in  San Diego County, California, to produce valid estimates on the scope of  labor trafficking activities in one of the largest Spanish-speaking  immigrant destinations.   The study found that 30 percent of  undocumented migrant laborers were victims of trafficking, 55 percent  were victims of other abuses, and about half of these victimization  experiences occurred within the past 12 months. The study found that the  rate of trafficking violations varied markedly across business sectors that  typically hire unauthorized migrant workers. The construction and  janitorial services sector had the most reported trafficking violations and  labor abuses across these business sectors.", "The third project, Sex Trafficking in Tijuana, Mexico, involved in-depth  interviews with semi-structured and open-ended questions, field  observations, and conversations with major players in the prostitution  business, law enforcement and advocacy groups. The main emphasis in  the recruitment of participants in the project was to maximize the range  and variety of the search for discernable patterns of trafficking activities  and the operation of the sex industry in Tijuana. According to  documentation from the study, although hundreds of interviews were  conducted with a wide variety of individuals, the study does not intend to  produce statistical estimates about the scope of sex trafficking activities  or any other aspect of the sex industry in Tijuana. The identified cases of  sex trafficking happening in Tijuana were limited to individual pimps (male  and female) who were adept at seeking out women in vulnerable  situations and controlling them through emotional manipulation, social  isolation, and/or violence.", "In 2015, NIJ also awarded a Trafficking in Persons grant to Abt  Associates. The purpose of Abt\u2019s research project, Advancing Human  Trafficking Prevalence Estimation, is to develop a methodology to  calculate prevalence of human trafficking. Abt has selected county-level  sites to test a methodology that, if successful, could be used to estimate  human trafficking at the city, state, or national level. Further, according to  Abt, if targeted appropriately or conducted on a large enough scale, the methodology could be used to estimate human trafficking of Native  Americans or in Indian country. Abt researcher told us they plan to use a  screening tool developed by the Vera Institute of Justice to determine  how many individuals who are in jails, shelters, or have recently visited  emergency rooms are human trafficking victims (i.e., potentially unknown  human trafficking victims). Then they plan to compare this number to the  known human trafficking victims to see if this approach identifies  additional victims. Abt is currently in the first year of a 3-year plan.", "The Abt researcher noted that to accurately measure the prevalence of  human trafficking in Indian country using a similar methodology, a study  must oversample the Native American population. Based on the small  sampling size being used to test the current methodology, Abt told us the  current study can likely report the number of Native Americans and the  number of human trafficking victims on its test sites, but would not be able  to generalize results from this study to the entire Native American  population.", "Northeastern University\u2019s research project, Capturing Human Trafficking  Victimization through Crime Reporting is a 3-year study to test a multiple  system list estimation methodology to estimate the prevalence of human  trafficking in three sites, which are expected to be selected by mid- October 2016.

Any differences or  similarities across the data would help determine whether victims are  being captured in multiple areas (systems) and the results could be used  to develop prevalence estimates for the tests sites.
