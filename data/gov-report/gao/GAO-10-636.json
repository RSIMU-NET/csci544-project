The U.S. Air Force, which is responsible for GPS acquisition, is in the process of modernizing the system. Last year GAO reported that it was uncertain whether the Air Force could acquire new satellites in time to maintain GPS service without interruption. GAO was asked to assess (1) the status of Air Force efforts to develop and deliver new GPS satellites, the availability of the GPS constellation, and the potential impacts on users if the constellation availability diminishes below its committed level of performance; (2) efforts to acquire the GPS ground control and user equipment necessary to leverage GPS satellite capabilities; (3) the GPS interagency requirements process; and (4) coordination of GPS efforts with the international PNT community. To do this, GAO analyzed program documentation and Air Force data on the GPS constellation, and interviewed officials from DOD and other agencies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force continues to face challenges to launching its IIF and IIIA satellites as scheduled. The first IIF satellite was launched in May 2010--a delay of 6 additional months for an overall delay of almost 3 1/2 years--and the program faces risks that could affect subsequent IIF satellites and launches. GPS IIIA appears to be on schedule and the Air Force continues to implement an approach intended to overcome the problems experienced with the IIF program. However, the IIIA schedule remains ambitious and could be affected by risks such as the program's dependence on a ground system that will not be completed until after the first IIIA launch. The GPS constellation availability has improved, but in the longer term, a delay in the launch of the GPS IIIA satellites could still reduce the size of the constellation to fewer than 24 operational satellites--the number that the U.S. government commits to--which might not meet the needs of some GPS users. Multiyear delays in the development of GPS ground control systems are extensive. In addition, although the Air Force has taken steps to enable quicker procurement of military GPS user equipment, there are significant challenges to its implementation. This has had a significant impact on DOD as all three GPS segments--space, ground control, and user equipment--must be in place to take advantage of new capabilities, such as improved resistance to jamming and greater accuracy. DOD has taken some steps to better coordinate all GPS segments. These steps involve laying out criteria and establishing visibility over a spectrum of procurement efforts. But they do not go as far as GAO recommended last year in terms of establishing a single authority responsible for ensuring that all GPS segments are synchronized to the maximum extent practicable. Such an authority is warranted given the extent of delays, problems with synchronizing all GPS segments, and importance of new capabilities to military operations. As a result, GAO reiterates the need to implement its prior recommendation. The GPS interagency requirements process, which is co-chaired by officials from DOD and DOT, remains relatively untested and civil agencies continue to find the process confusing. This year GAO found that a lack of comprehensive guidance on the GPS interagency requirements process is a key source of this confusion and has contributed to other problems, such as disagreement about and inconsistent implementation of the process. In addition, GAO found that the interagency requirements process relies on individual agencies to identify their own requirements rather than identifying PNT needs across agencies. The Department of State continues to be engaged internationally in pursuit of civil signal interoperability and military signal compatibility, and has not identified any new concerns in these efforts since GAO's 2009 report. Challenges remain for the United States in ensuring that GPS is compatible with other new, potentially competing global space-based PNT systems."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Transportation (DOT) develop comprehensive guidance for the GPS interagency requirements process.

We reported that it was uncertain whether the Air Force  would be able to acquire new satellites in time to maintain current GPS  service without interruption, and that some military operations and some  civilian users could be adversely affected. In addition, we reported that  military users faced a potential delay in utilizing new GPS capabilities  because of poor synchronization of the development of the satellites with  development of the ground control and user equipment. We also reported  that DOD and civil agencies involved in ensuring that GPS can serve  communities beyond the military took prudent steps to manage GPS  requirements and coordinate among the many organizations involved with  GPS, but we identified challenges in ensuring that civilian requirements  can be met.

Furthermore, we specified that the appointee should have the  authority to ensure that all GPS segments are synchronized to the  maximum extent practicable. DOD concurred with this recommendation.  In concurring with our recommendation, DOD asserted that the Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Networks and Information Integration has  authority and responsibility for all aspects of GPS, and that the Air Force  is the single acquisition agent responsible for synchronizing GPS  segments. In addition, after our 2009 report, DOD created the Space and  Intelligence Office within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology and Logistics to ensure that all three segments of  GPS stay synchronized in the development and acquisition processes.  However, that office does not have authority over all user equipment. We  also recommended that if weaknesses are found the Secretaries of  Defense and Transportation should address civil agency concerns for  developing requirements, improve collaboration and decision making, and  strengthen civil agency participation.

Over  time, GPS has become vital to military operations and a ubiquitous  infrastructure underpinning major sections of the economy, including  telecommunications, electrical power distribution, banking and finance,  transportation, environmental and natural resources management,  agriculture, and emergency services. GPS is used by all branches of the  military to guide troop movements, integrate logistics support, enable  components underlying battlespace situational awareness, and  synchronize communications networks. In addition, U.S. and allied  munitions are guided to their targets by GPS signals and GPS is used to  locate military personnel in distress.", "Civil agencies, commercial firms, and individuals use GPS and GPS  augmentations to accurately navigate from one point to another.  Commercial firms use GPS and GPS augmentations to route their vehicles,  as do maritime industries and mass transit systems. In addition to  navigation, civil departments and agencies and commercial firms use GPS  and GPS augmentations to provide high-accuracy, three-dimensional  positioning information in real time for use in surveying and mapping and  other location-based services. The aviation community worldwide uses  GPS and GPS augmentations to increase the safety and efficiency of flight.  GPS and GPS augmentations are also used by the agricultural community  for precision farming, including farm planning, field mapping, soil  sampling, tractor guidance, and crop scouting; the natural resources  management community uses GPS for wildfire management and  firefighting, pesticide and herbicide control, and watershed and other  natural resources asset management. GPS is increasingly important to  earth observation, which includes operational roles in weather prediction,  the measurement of sea level change, monitoring of ocean circulation, and  mitigation of hazards caused by earthquakes and volcanoes.

Moreover in recent years, because  numerous satellites have exceeded their design life, the constellation has  grown to 31 active satellites of various generations. However, DOD  predicts that over the next several years many of the older satellites in the  constellation will reach the end of their operational life faster than they  will be replenished, thus decreasing the size of the constellation from its  current level, reducing satellite availability, and potentially reducing the  accuracy of the GPS service.", "The GPS ground control segment comprises the Master Control Station at  Schriever Air Force Base, Colorado; the Alternate Master Control Station  at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California; 6 dedicated monitor stations; 10  National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency monitoring stations; and 4 ground  antennas with uplink capabilities.

The GPS Wing  attributes recent launch delays to launch vehicle and pad availability  issues, but the late discovery of some technical issues also contributed to  the launch delay. According to the GPS Wing, the technical issues were a  result of inadequate oversight of the contractor earlier in the acquisition.  To prevent an even longer launch delay, the program shipped the second  IIF satellite to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and conducted extensive  system-level end-to-end tests.

Only after the first satellite of a new generation, like IIF,  has been launched and months of on-orbit tests have been conducted can  a thorough understanding of its performance be obtained. Previously, the  GPS Wing had planned to mitigate the risk of potential IIF performance  issues by launching some satellites of the prior generation, the IIR-Ms,  after the first IIF launch. Space programs in the past have used this  practice to reduce risk in case there were on-orbit problems with the new  generation of satellites. However, when the delivery of the IIF satellites  was continually delayed, the Air Force launched the remaining IIR-M  satellites to eliminate the Air Force\u2019s dependence on the launch vehicle  that was used for previous generations of GPS satellites.", "Two GPS Wing officials expressed concern that the GPS program is now  in a riskier position than it has been for many years because it does not  have any IIR-M satellites in inventory and ready to launch. In fact, the  current IIF production and launch schedules indicate that there is little  margin to address any potential on-orbit performance issues. Within little  over a year after the first IIF launch, three additional IIF satellites are  scheduled to launch and six\u2014half of all IIF satellites\u2014are scheduled to  have completed production.

Until  recently, the Air Force made use of four launch facilities on the East Coast  and three on the West Coast to launch its national security space satellites.  However, the Air Force now plans to launch most national security  satellites, including the GPS IIF and IIIA, using one of two Evolved  Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) rocket types\u2014Delta IV or Atlas V.  EELV launches are conducted from two launch facilities on the East Coast  and two on the West Coast. With this transition to relying on the EELV, the  Air Force has reduced its launch facilities from seven to four. The East  Coast launch facilities are in greatest demand, particularly the Atlas V\u2019s  facility SLC-41. Not only does the Air Force plan to launch several high- priority satellites, including four IIF satellites, from that facility over the  next 2 fiscal years, but NASA also plans to use it for the launch of two  extremely time-sensitive missions within that same time period. However,  historically no more than four satellites have been launched from the SLC- 41 facility in a single year, yet eight launches are planned for that facility in  fiscal year 2011. Air Force officials stated that they are taking steps to  improve their capability to launch more satellites per year on the EELV  than in the past.", "The Air Force has acknowledged that it will be challenged to achieve its  desired launch plans in the near future and is taking some steps to address  this challenge. For example, the Air Force designed the GPS IIF satellites  to be dual integrated\u2014meaning they can fly on either the Delta IV or Atlas  V launch vehicle\u2014which gives the Air Force more flexibility than if it had  relied on only one type of launch vehicle. The GPS program in particular  plans to request funding to study the possibility of launching GPS satellites  on the West Coast, which has the potential of offering a broader array of  launch options. However, some of the potential solutions to these launch  challenges, such as launching GPS satellites from the West Coast, are long- term solutions.

To avoid repeating past problems, the program  was taking measures to maintain stable requirements, use mature  technologies, and provide more contractor oversight. However, we also  reported that the Air Force would be challenged to deliver IIIA on time  because its satellite development schedule was optimistic given the  program\u2019s late start, past trends in space acquisitions, and challenges  facing the new contractor. For example, the GPS IIIA schedule from  contract award to first satellite launch is 72 months. We found that that  time period was 3 years shorter than the schedule the Air Force had  achieved under its IIF program as well as shorter than most other major  space programs we have reviewed. Furthermore, we questioned the  reliability of the GPS IIIA schedule because we found that it did not fully  meet best practices.", "Since our prior report, we found that the GPS IIIA program appears to  have furthered its implementation of the \u201cback to basics\u201d approach to  avoid repeating the mistakes of GPS IIF and that it has passed a key design  milestone. More specifically, the program has maintained stable  requirements, has used mature technologies, and is providing more  oversight than under the IIF program. There have not been any changes to  the program to meet increased or accelerated technical specifications,  system performance, or requirements. All critical technologies were  reported to be mature at program start. The program held multiple levels  of preliminary design reviews to ensure that the system was ready to  proceed into detailed design. The preliminary design reviews were  completed in May 2009, and the program completed its critical design  review in August 2010. Furthermore, GPS Wing officials stated that they  are requiring that the contractor follow military standards and  specifications and that the contractor and subcontractors use earned value  management.", "Since our last review, the GPS program has also made improvements to its  integrated master schedule. The success of any program depends in part  on having a reliable schedule and we found the GPS IIIA schedule to be  highly integrated and of high quality. In our recent analysis of the IIIA  schedule, we found that processes are in place to ensure that all activities  are captured, are of reasonable duration, and are assigned resources. Our  analysis also shows that in general the program office updates the  schedule on a regular basis and logical relationships are used to determine  important dates. However, our analysis also revealed instances of  unreasonably high total float. Total float represents the amount of time an  activity can slip before it affects the project finish date and is directly  related to the logical sequencing of activities. High levels of float may  interfere with management\u2019s ability to properly align resources to ensure  that critical activities are not delayed. We also found that schedule risk  analysis is performed periodically on the schedule, but some risks may not  be captured in the overall risk analysis because of issues at the individual  project schedule level. Appendix II discusses our examination of the prime  contractor\u2019s schedule management process against best practices criteria  in more detail.", "Despite these efforts to develop a stable and successful program, the GPS  IIIA program faces challenges to launching its satellites on schedule. First,  the 72-month time period from contract award to first satellite launch is 3- \u00bd years shorter than the schedule achieved for the GPS IIF program.  Though the GPS IIIA program has adopted practices that should enable it  to deliver in a quicker time frame than the GPS IIF program, the inherent  complexities associated with the design and integration phases that have  yet to be completed will make it difficult to beat the prior schedule by that  order of magnitude. More specifically, the IIIA program is not simply  replicating the IIF program in terms of design and production. The  program is using a satellite bus, which although it has flown on many  satellites in the past, has not yet been used in medium-earth orbit, an orbit  that requires different control software and production processes, such as  a higher level of radiation hardening. The contractor will add a new signal,  L1C, to the satellite that has not been included on previous GPS satellites  and will also increase the power of the military signal that has been used  on previous satellites. These types of changes can increase the time it  takes to complete the program because some level of discovery will need  to be completed during design and integration and unanticipated technical  problems that arise during these phases can have reverberating effects.", "Second, the time period from contract award to first satellite launch in the  IIIA schedule appears to be compressed compared to what the program  had previously estimated. DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2004 funding request reported  a schedule with 84 months from contract award to first satellite launch,  but contract award took place 3 years later than had been planned while  the first IIIA launch was only pushed back by 2 years, leaving that time  period a year shorter than previously planned\u2014a considerable amount of  time given that requirements were not substantially changed to  accommodate the schedule change.", "Third, according to GPS Wing officials, the program is trying to improve  the quality of the satellites by requiring that the contractor follow military  standards and specifications. This action is a positive step; however, using  this more rigorous approach is likely to pose challenges to meeting the  IIIA schedule. GPS Wing officials stated that GPS IIIA is currently the only  major space system acquisition that is requiring the use of military  standards and specifications and it is shouldering much of the burden of  transitioning to these more rigorous standards. Officials report that some  of the standards and specifications are out of date and familiarity with  these standards has been lost. Updating the standards and specifications  along with developing and implementing the necessary training and testing  to apply them takes time and creates cost pressure.", "Lastly, it should be noted that no major satellite program undertaken by  DOD in the past decade has met its schedule goals. The GPS IIIA program  itself has done more than many programs in the past decade to position  itself to meet its dates, but there are still actions that need to be taken  across DOD to enable space programs to meet their schedule goals. As we  testified in March 2010, these include strengthening the space acquisition  workforce, clarifying lines of accountability and authority, and lengthening  program manager tenures, among others.", "An additional challenge to launching the IIIA satellites on time is the GPS  IIIA program\u2019s dependence on a ground control system that is currently in  development. More specifically, the first block of the ground system,  called the Next Generation Control Segment, or OCX, is scheduled to be  operational in fourth quarter fiscal year 2015, over 1 year after the launch  of the first GPS IIIA satellite. GPS Wing officials stated that a complete  system-level test cannot be conducted until OCX is available at which  point GPS IIIA can become part of the operational constellation and be set  \u201chealthy.\u201d They also stated that they would prefer not to launch a second  GPS IIIA satellite until the first IIIA satellite is set healthy, meaning until  OCX is available, only one GPS IIIA satellite should be launched. Yet the  planned launch dates for the GPS IIIA satellites reflect a rapid series of  IIIA launches with five launches taking place within 2 years after the first  IIIA launch. If OCX is late, as some Air Force satellite ground control  systems have been, several IIIA satellites may not be launched as currently  scheduled. In October 2009, we reported that three of eight ground control  systems were lagging significantly behind their satellite counterparts. Of  the five that were not behind, some were still experiencing schedule  delays; however, their satellite counterparts were also experiencing  delays."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current GPS Constellation Availability Improves, but a Delay in GPS III Could Affect GPS Constellation Performance", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that the GPS constellation can provide PNT information to GPS  users located anywhere on the earth at almost any time of day, the  performance standards for both (1) the standard positioning service  provided to civil and commercial GPS users and (2) the precise positioning  service provided to military GPS users commit the U.S. government to at  least a 95 percent probability of maintaining a constellation of 24  operational GPS satellites. Last year, we reported that the estimated long- term probability of maintaining a constellation of at least 24 operational  satellites would fall below 95 percent during fiscal year 2010 and would  remain below 95 percent until the end of fiscal year 2014, at times falling  to about 80 percent. We also reported that if a 2-year delay were to occur  to the launch of the first and subsequent GPS III satellites, the U.S.  government would be at a much greater risk of failing to meet this  commitment.", "The availability of the constellation has shown considerable improvement  since last year; the Air Force now predicts that the probability of  maintaining a constellation of at least 24 operational satellites will remain  above 95 percent for the foreseeable future\u2014through at least 2025, the  date that the final GPS III satellite is expected to become operational.  However, the long-term impact of a delay to GPS III could still reduce the  guaranteed size of the constellation to fewer than 24 satellites, which  might not meet the needs of some GPS users. According to the Air Force,  the impact of such a delay could be mitigated somewhat by shutting off a  second payload on GPS satellites to save power and thereby extend the  lives of aging satellites.

The Air Force\u2019s  analysis is used to generate a reliability function for each satellite\u2014that is,  the probability that the satellite will still be operational as a function of its  time on orbit. Each satellite\u2019s reliability function is modeled as the product  of two cumulative probability distributions\u2014one that accounts for the  wear out of life-limiting components and one that accounts for random  failures. Individual satellite reliability functions can be combined with a  launch schedule and launch success probabilities to predict the  constellation availability\u2014that is, the predicted size of the constellation as  a function of time.

In particular,  because the reliability functions associated with new (unlaunched)  generations of GPS satellites are based solely on engineering and design  analysis, instead of on-orbit performance data, the actual reliability of  these satellites may be very different, and reliability functions may need to  be modified once on-orbit performance data become available. For  example, while the IIA satellites were designed to last 7.5 years on  average, they have actually lasted more than twice as long, and the  Aerospace Corporation has had to adjust the reliability functions of these  satellites to account for this difference. Moreover, satellite operators work  to develop innovative operational tactics to maximize the useful life of  each GPS satellite. An official with the 2nd Space Operations Squadron,  which operates and maintains the GPS constellation, noted that a healthy  tension exists between the acquisitions community, which tends to be  conservative in estimating the lifetimes of the things it acquires, and the  operations community, which continues to evolve new techniques and  procedures for getting more life out of old systems. Nevertheless, the Air  Force appears to have a mature process in place to develop, certify, and  routinely update satellite reliability functions, and we have found no  evidence to suggest that this process is biased toward overly conservative  estimates of satellite lifetimes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Near-Term Constellation Availability Has Shown Considerable Improvement Since Last Year", "paragraphs": ["Last year, we reported that because there were 31 operational GPS  satellites of various generations, the near-term probability of maintaining a  constellation of at least 24 operational satellites would remain well above  95 percent for a brief period of time, but because older satellites were  predicted to fail faster than they were scheduled to be replaced, we  reported that the constellation would, in all likelihood, decrease in size.  We noted that the probability of maintaining a constellation of 24  operational satellites would fall to below 95 percent in fiscal year 2009,  and to as low as 80 percent before recovering near the end of fiscal year  2014.

These satellites could be reactivated if there were an  unexpectedly large number of satellite failures in the near future.  However, the maximum size of the current constellation is limited to 31  operational satellites because of limitations of the current ground system,  and none of these residual satellites is expected to continue operating  beyond the end of fiscal year 2013. Consequently, while including these  satellites in our analysis would further increase the probability of  maintaining a 31-satellite constellation for the next few years, these  residual satellites would have little or no impact on the size of the  constellation beyond fiscal year 2013.", "Our updated analysis also assumes that GPS-IIR-M-20\u2014otherwise known  as satellite vehicle number 49 (SVN-49)\u2014will remain operational.

The  satellite remains unhealthy because of a small but permanent signal  anomaly that could adversely affect GPS user equipment if it were  activated without putting mitigation measures in place. This anomaly  resulted from unexpected complications following the integration of a  demonstration payload onto the satellite\u2014a payload that broadcasts the  third civil signal. The Air Force is examining several options to mitigate  the impact of this anomaly, but no solution that would work for all GPS  users has been identified.

The effects of this power loss  can be mitigated somewhat by actively managing satellite subsystems\u2014 shutting them down when they are not needed\u2014thereby reducing the  satellite\u2019s overall consumption of power. The Air Force currently employs  this approach\u2014referred to as current management\u2014to extend the life of  GPS satellites. According to the Air Force, it would also be possible to  significantly reduce a satellite\u2019s consumption of power and further extend  the life of its PNT mission by shutting off a second payload on a GPS  satellite once the satellite could not generate enough power to support  both the missions.

However, the constellation availability analysis that employs power  management does not address whether the constellation is satisfying the  missions supported by the second payload. Moreover, according to Air  Force Space Command officials, power management should not be used  as the basis for official constellation availability analysis, given the  uncertainties associated with predicting a satellite\u2019s actual power usage.

The Air Force is working on a mitigation  strategy that calls for development of a separate effort to launch and  control the first IIIA satellite.

We also found that diffuse leadership was a  contributing factor, given that there was no single authority responsible  for synchronizing procurements and fielding of user equipment. More  specifically, while the Air Force was responsible for developing the  satellite and ground segments for GPS, the military services were  individually responsible for procuring user equipment for the weapon  systems they owned and operated. As such, there were separate budget,  management, oversight, and leadership structures over the space, ground  control, and user equipment segments. While there were valid reasons to  segment procurement responsibility, DOD and GAO studies have  consistently found that DOD has lacked the tools necessary to coordinate  these procurements and ensure that they are synchronized to the extent  that warfighters can take advantage of M-code and other new capabilities  available to them through GPS satellites.", "Since our 2009 report, the Air Force has taken steps to enable quicker  procurements of user equipment, but there are still significant challenges  to its implementation. First, the Air Force intends to follow an acquisition  approach that will enable the military services to contract separately with  commercial GPS providers rather than develop entirely new, customized  user equipment systems. To support this approach, the Air Force plans to  develop a common module, which commercial providers could use, along  with interface control documents, to produce their equipment. The Air  Force\u2019s current expectation is that it will issue requests for proposals in  February 2011, formally initiate the military user equipment acquisition  program in fiscal year 2012, and begin production in fiscal year 2015.

The  third contractor is facing technical problems, the cause of which has not  yet been identified, and the Air Force is uncertain as to when this  contractor will deliver its receiver card. Even after the cards are  developed and delivered, they still need to go through independent  security and technology testing to demonstrate that the technologies are  mature, which can take 9 months to a year. Moreover, since there is still  no program of record for the military GPS user equipment, it is difficult to  forecast when enough military GPS user equipment will be in place to  utilize the M-code capabilities operationally.", "Third, some steps have been taken to better coordinate procurements of  user equipment. Specifically, in January 2010, the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics held its  first annual GPS enterprise review. The purpose of this review, which will  be held again in the fall of 2010, is to review the status of the GPS  acquisition programs at one time and provide more visibility into how the  GPS acquisitions and capabilities fit together. In addition, DOD recently  created the Space and Intelligence Office within the Office of the Under  Secretary for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics to ensure that all three  segments of GPS stay synchronized in the development and acquisition  processes. DOD has also documented GPS synchronization as one of its  goals for the next 15 years in its March 2010 Net-Centric Portfolio Strategic  Plan, used in part to identify areas requiring additional focus. More  specifically, DOD plans to ensure synchronized development and fielding  of GPS space, ground control, and user equipment segments to support  delivery of advanced capabilities. This includes fielding user equipment to  all designated users starting in 2014 and almost completing fielding by full  operational capability of the GPS III satellite constellation. In DOD\u2019s  netcentric plan, M-code initial operational capability is defined as having  18 M-code satellites on orbit, having the control segment able to command  and upload M-code capabilities to the satellites, and having enough  military GPS user equipment in place across DOD to utilize M-code  capabilities operationally. Furthermore, the Air Force has made significant  changes to the definition of initial operational capability, which now takes  into account all three GPS segments rather than only the satellite segment.", "DOD has taken some steps to coordinate GPS segments, but it is not likely  that these will be sufficient to ensure that all GPS segments are  synchronized to the maximum extent practicable, which we recommended  last year.

This has resulted in confusion about next steps for agencies that  have submitted requirements and it may also have contributed to  inconsistent implementation of the process.", "Approval requirements. There is limited information in the guidance on  what formal approvals are required, how they are to be documented, and  few details as to when and how these approvals relate to one another. As a  result, civil agency officials have indicated that they find it difficult to  know when a requirement has been approved to move to the next step in  the process or whether it has received final approval. In the case of SLR, in  2007, IFOR released a memo recommending that SLR be included in the  GPS III capability development document. However, after some concerns  about SLR were identified within DOD that approval was de facto  rescinded. SLR is again pending IFOR review and approval. Similarly,  there appears to be some confusion about the ultimate fate of some  requirements that have already been included in a capability development  document. For example, some of the aviation-related requirements were  included in the GPS III capability development document for later  increments of GPS III, which are important to meeting the needs of FAA\u2019s  Next Generation Air Transportation System program, a satellite-based air  traffic management system that is under development and is expected to  increase the safety and enhance the capacity of the air transport system.  However, some DOD officials report that this capability development  document will be treated as the one for GPS IIIA and that requirements  not included on GPS IIIA will have to be submitted through JCIDS again  on the capability development documents for either the GPS IIIB or GPS  IIIC.", "Phases of the process. The guidance lacks details about specific phases of  the interagency requirements process, which may have contributed to  inconsistent implementation. For example, the guidance regarding the  initial step in the interagency requirements process states, among other  things, that civil agencies are to internally identify and validate their  requirements. However, the requirement for L1C never went through this  phase of the process. Instead, the request resulted from an international  agreement and was submitted by the White House. In addition, expertise  and experience with requirements and their identification and validation  processes vary greatly across government agencies. DOT and DOD  officials report that some agencies have documented, disciplined  requirements processes. However, while other agencies represent vital  GPS applications and users, they have limited experience with  requirements processes because they do not typically acquire systems to  fulfill their missions. Although it may not be realistic to expect civil  agencies to have requirements processes that are as rigorous as DOD\u2019s,  more detailed guidance on expectations regarding standards for  identification and validation of requirements could help ensure that there  is more consistency in the first stage of the process.", "Lastly, the guidance does not include criteria for funding decisions beyond  indicating that sponsoring agencies must pay for their requirements. More  specifically, the lack of details in guidance regarding the required timing of  funding commitments has caused confusion. The process for considering  civil GPS requirements is intended to maintain fiscal discipline by ensuring  that only critical needs are funded and developed. Our past work has  shown that requirement add-ons cause cost and schedule growth.  Guidance requires that the agency proposing the requirement pay the costs  associated with adding it to the GPS satellites, thereby forcing agencies to  separate their wants from needs. IFOR has requested that sponsoring  agencies commit to fund a requirement when the requirement proposal is  submitted. For example, IFOR requested that the Coast Guard provide a  funding commitment for DASS before the requirement enters the JCIDS  process. However, information regarding when a funding commitment is  required is not included in guidance on the interagency requirements  process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Approach to Identify Civil Requirements Does Not Identify PNT Needs Across Agencies", "paragraphs": ["The interagency requirements process relies on individual agencies to  identify their own requirements but does not identify PNT needs across  civil agencies. For example, the DASS requirement is a secondary mission  requirement to support a search and rescue system rather than a  performance requirement specific to PNT. While such requirements may  fulfill important needs, they do not reflect civil community requirements  for PNT capabilities. Yet there are considerable challenges to identifying  needs across agencies. For example, civil agencies have different roles,  missions, and priorities ranging from providing leadership related to food,  agriculture, and natural resources to providing the safest, most efficient  aerospace system in the world. The civil PNT Executive Committee Co- chair pointed out that most civil agencies have not identified PNT  requirements for their agencies, which poses a considerable challenge to  identifying these requirements across agencies. These challenges have  resulted in an approach that is agency specific and not coordinated rather  than a coordinated national approach to identifying PNT needs.", "While there is no standardized process for identifying requirements across  civil agencies, we found that two efforts under way are attempting to  contribute to the development of a coordinated national approach to  identifying PNT requirements. First, DOT officials stated that they are  working with civil agencies to identify PNT requirements that represent  their stakeholder needs with respect to accuracy, availability, coverage,  and integrity. This information would serve as input for the 2010 Federal  Radionavigation Plan, a document that reflects official U.S.  radionavigation policy, which covers radionavigation systems, including  GPS.

Additionally, State Department officials  reported that they believe they lack dedicated technical expertise to  monitor international activities. State Department officials stated that they  would like DOD and civil agencies to dedicate funding and staff positions  to international activities accompanied by a sustained level of senior  management support and understanding of the importance of these  activities. Furthermore, U.S. firms had raised a concern to the Department  of Commerce about the lack of information from the European  Commission relating to the process for obtaining licenses to sell  equipment that is compatible with Galileo, a space-based global navigation  satellite system being developed by the European Union. However,  according to the executive agreement with the European Community,  subject to applicable export controls, the United States and the European  Community are to make sufficient information publicly available to ensure  equal opportunity for persons who seek to use these signals, manufacture  equipment to use these signals, or provide value-added services that use  these signals.", "State Department officials said that they had no new issues or concerns to  add to what we reported in April 2009.

However, according to State Department officials,  in spring 2010, the European Commission helped address the first two of  these concerns when it published an updated technical document that  includes information on the process for licensing intellectual property  rights related to Galileo. State Department officials said that the U.S.  government is seeking additional clarification on Galileo\u2019s newly  established intellectual property licensing scheme, which if it is obtained,  should address the first concern.

While DOD has strengthened acquisition practices for  GPS and made concerted efforts to maximize the life of GPS satellites, it  still faces many of the same challenges we identified last year, as well as  new ones we identified this year. For example, the GPS IIIA program has  complex and difficult work ahead as it undertakes assembly, integration,  and test efforts, and its schedule may leave little margin to address  challenges that may arise. Such issues could affect the Air Force\u2019s ability  to launch satellites on time, which in turn may affect future GPS  constellation availability. Furthermore, because of continued delays with  ground control systems and the challenges the Air Force is encountering  with enabling quicker procurement of military GPS user equipment, new  capabilities may not be delivered to the warfighters when DOD needs  them. To better align key decisions and capability deliveries, DOD is now  looking more broadly across the GPS enterprise. However, it remains to be  seen whether these actions go far enough to synchronize all GPS segments  to the maximum extent practicable. For example, while DOD\u2019s new Space  and Intelligence Office will help ensure that the development and  acquisition of all GPS segments are synchronized, this office does not have  authority over all military user equipment development. Consequently, we  reiterate our recommendation from our April 2009 report that the  Secretary of Defense appoint a single authority to oversee the  development of GPS, including DOD space, ground control, and user  equipment assets, to ensure that the program is well executed and  resourced and that potential disruptions are minimized. Furthermore, we  specified that the appointee should have the authority to ensure that all  GPS segments are synchronized to the maximum extent practicable, and  should coordinate with the existing PNT infrastructure to assess and  minimize potential service disruptions should the satellite constellation  decrease in size for an extended period of time. Regarding the GPS  interagency requirements process, there is still a great deal of confusion  about how civil agencies should submit and pay for their requirements.

To assess the risks that a delay in the acquisition  and fielding of GPS III satellites could result in the U.S. government failing  to meet its commitment to a 95 percent probability of maintaining a  constellation of 24 operational GPS satellites, we obtained information  from the Air Force predicting the reliability of 79 GPS satellites\u2014each of  the 32 operational (on-orbit) satellites, 44 future GPS satellites, and 3  residual satellites\u2014as a function of their time on orbit. Each satellite\u2019s  total reliability function defines the probability that the satellite will still  be operational (or in sufficient working order to be made operational) at a  given time in the future. This reliability function is generated from the  product of two cumulative reliability functions\u2014a wear out reliability  function governed by the cumulative normal distribution and a random  reliability function governed by the cumulative Weibull distribution. The  reliability function for a specific satellite is defined by a set of four  parameters\u2014two that define the cumulative normal distribution and two  that define the cumulative Weibull distribution.", "Obtained two sets of reliability parameters for each of the 79 satellites.", "One set of parameters describes the reliability of the satellites based on  the \u201ccurrent management\u201d approach\u2014the Air Force\u2019s efforts to actively  manage satellite subsystems to reduce a satellite\u2019s overall consumption of  power.

For each of the 44  unlaunched satellites, we also obtained a parameter defining its  probability of successful launch and its scheduled launch date. The 44  unlaunched satellites include 12 IIF satellites, 8 IIIA satellites, 8 IIIB  satellites, and 16 IIIC satellites; launch of the final IIIC satellite is  scheduled for July 2025.

We conducted several runs of our simulation\u2014each run  consisting of 10,000 trials\u2014and generated curves depicting the predicted  size of the GPS constellation at the 95 percent confidence level as a  function of time. During last year\u2019s review, we compared the results for a  24-satellite constellation with a similar Monte Carlo simulation that the  Aerospace Corporation had performed for the Air Force, and confirmed  that our simulation produced results that are very similar. We compared  our results with the results for the predicted size of the GPS constellation  over time (at the 95 percent confidence level) that we had calculated last  year using the GPS reliability data and launch schedule approved in March  2009.

The review period for the 5 schedules was from May 2008 to  July 2009.", "A well-defined schedule helps to identify the amount of human capital and  fiscal resources that are needed to execute the program, and thus is an  important contribution to a reliable cost estimate. Our research has  identified a range of best practices associated with effective schedule  estimating. These practices are as follows:    Capturing all activities: The schedule should reflect all activities (steps,  events, outcomes, etc.) as defined in the program\u2019s work breakdown  structure, including activities to be performed by both the government and  its contractors.", "Sequencing all activities: The schedule should be planned so that it can  meet the program\u2019s critical dates. To meet this objective, activities need to  be logically sequenced in the order that they are to be carried out. In  particular, activities that must finish prior to the start of other activities  (i.e., predecessor activities) and activities that cannot begin until other  activities are completed (i.e., successor activities) should be identified. By  doing so, interdependencies among activities that collectively lead to the  accomplishment of events or milestones can be established and used as a  basis for guiding work and measuring progress.", "Assigning resources to all activities: The schedule should realistically  reflect what resources (i.e., labor, material, and overhead) are needed to  do the work, whether all required resources will be available when they  are needed, and whether any funding or time constraints exist.", "Establishing the duration of all activities: The schedule should reflect how  long each activity will take to execute. In determining the duration of each  activity, the same rationale, data, and assumptions used for cost  estimating should be used for schedule estimating. Further, these  durations should be as short as possible and they should have specific  start and end dates. Excessively long periods needed to execute an activity  should prompt further decomposition of the activity so that shorter  execution durations will result.  Integrating schedule activities horizontally and vertically: The schedule  should be horizontally integrated, meaning that it should link the products  and outcomes associated with already sequenced activities. These links  are commonly referred to as handoffs and serve to verify that activities are  arranged in the right order to achieve aggregated products or outcomes.  The schedule should also be vertically integrated, meaning that  traceability exists among varying levels of activities and supporting tasks  and subtasks. Such mapping or alignment among levels enables different  groups to work to the same master schedule.", "Establishing the critical path for all activities: Using scheduling software  the critical path\u2014the longest duration path through the sequenced list of  activities\u2014should be identified. The establishment of a program\u2019s critical  path is necessary for examining the effects of any activity slipping along  this path. Potential problems that may occur on or near the critical path  should also be identified and reflected in the scheduling of time for high- risk activities.   Identifying float between activities: The schedule should identify float\u2014 the time that a predecessor activity can slip before the delay affects  successor activities\u2014so that schedule flexibility can be determined. As a  general rule, activities along the critical path have the least amount of  float.", "Conducting a schedule risk analysis: A schedule risk analysis uses a good  critical path method schedule and data about project schedule risks as  well as Monte Carlo simulation (statistical) techniques to predict the level  of confidence in meeting a program\u2019s completion date, the amount of time  needed for a level of confidence, and the identification of high-priority  risks. This analysis focuses not only on critical path activities but also on  other schedule paths that may become critical. A schedule/cost risk  assessment recognizes the interrelationship between schedule and cost  and captures the risk that schedule durations and cost estimates may vary  because of, among other things, limited data, optimistic estimating,  technical challenges, lack of qualified personnel, and other external  factors. As a result, the baseline schedule should include a buffer or a  reserve of extra time. Schedule reserve for contingencies should be  calculated by performing a schedule risk analysis. As a general rule, the  reserve should be held by the project manager and applied as needed to  those activities that take longer than scheduled because of the identified  risks. Reserves of time should not be apportioned in advance to any  specific activity since the risks that will actually occur and the magnitude  of their impact is not known.", "Updating the schedule using logic and durations to determine the dates:  The schedule should use logic and durations in order to reflect realistic  start and completion dates for program activities. The schedule should be  continually monitored to determine when forecasted completion dates  differ from the planned dates, which can be used to determine whether  schedule variances will affect downstream work. Maintaining the integrity  of the schedule logic is not only necessary to reflect true status, but is also  required before conducting a schedule risk analysis. The schedule should  avoid logic overrides and artificial constraint dates that are chosen to  create a certain result on paper. To ensure that the schedule is properly  updated, individuals trained in critical path method scheduling should be  responsible for updating the schedule.", "Table 5 presents the findings for the five project schedules for each best  practice, along with an overall score for the integrated master schedule on  each best practice.
