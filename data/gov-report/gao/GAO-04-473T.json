Perhaps the foremost challenge facing government decision makers  this year was ensuring the security of the American people. By  providing professional, objective, and nonpartisan information and  analyses, we helped inform the Congress and the executive branch  agencies on key security issues, such as the nature and scope of threats  confronting the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons facilities, its information  systems, and all areas of its transportation infrastructure, as well as the  challenges involved in creating the Department of Homeland Security.  Our work was also driven by changing demographic trends, which led  us to focus on such areas as the quality of care in the nation\u2019s nursing  homes and the risks to the government\u2019s single-employer pension  insurance program.

For example, in fiscal year 2003, as in other years, the  challenges that most urgently engaged the attention of the Congress  helped define our priorities. Our work on issues such as the nation\u2019s  ongoing battle against terrorism, Social Security and Medicare reform, the  implementation of major education legislation, human capital  transformations at selected federal agencies, and the security of key  government information systems all helped congressional members and  their staffs to develop new federal policies and programs and oversee  ongoing ones. Moreover, the Congress and the executive agencies took a  wide range of actions in fiscal year 2003 to improve government  operations, reduce costs, or better target budget authority based on GAO\u2019s  analyses and recommendations. In fiscal year 2003, GAO served the  Congress and the American people by helping to  identify steps to reduce improper payments and credit card fraud in  government programs; restructure government and improve its processes and systems to  maximize homeland security;   prepare the financial markets to continue operations if terrorism    update and strengthen government auditing standards;  improve the administration of Medicare as it undergoes reform;   encourage and help guide federal agency transformations;    contribute to congressional oversight of the federal income tax system;  identify human capital reforms needed at the Department of Defense,  the Department of Homeland Security, and other federal agencies; raise the visibility of long-term financial commitments and imbalances  in the federal budget; reduce security risks to information systems supporting the nation\u2019s  critical infrastructures;   oversee programs to protect the health and safety of today\u2019s workers;    ensure the accountability of federal agencies through audits and    serve as a model for other federal agencies by modernizing our  approaches to managing and compensating our people.", "To ensure that we are well positioned to meet the Congress\u2019s future needs,  we update our 6-year strategic plan every 2 years, consulting extensively  during the update with our clients in the Congress and with other experts  (see app. I for our strategic plan framework).", "The following table summarizes selected performance measures and  targets for fiscal years 1999 through 2005.

State has taken  steps to adjust its policies and regulations concerning the screening of  visa applicants and its staffing and training for consular officers.", "Enhancing quality of care in nursing homes. In a series of reports and  testimonies since 1998, we found that, too often, residents of nursing  homes were being harmed and that programs to oversee nursing home  quality of care at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services were  not fully effective in identifying and reducing such problems. In 2003,  we found a decline in the proportion of nursing homes that harmed  residents but made additional recommendations to further improve  care.", "Making key contributions to homeland security.

The Congress directed that the  first 3 years of savings be used to reduce USPS\u2019s debt and hold postage  rates steady until fiscal 2006.", "We also helped to promote sound agency and governmentwide  management by    Encouraging and helping guide agency transformations. We highlighted  federal entities whose missions and ways of doing business require  modernized approaches, including the Postal Service and the Coast  Guard. Among congressional actions taken to deal with modernization  issues, the House Committee on Government Reform established a  special panel on postal reform and oversight to work with the  President\u2019s Commission on the Postal Service on recommendations for  comprehensive postal reform. Our recommendations to the Coast  Guard led to better reporting by the Coast Guard and laid the  foundation for key revisions the agency intended to make to its  strategic plan.", "Helping to advance major information technology modernizations. Our  work has helped to strengthen the management of the complex  multibillion-dollar information technology modernization program at  the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to improve operations, promote  better service, and reduce costs.

Our  requested fiscal year 2005 budget authority includes about $480 million in  direct appropriations and authority to use $6 million in estimated revenue  from reimbursable audit work and rental income.", "To achieve our strategic goals and objectives for serving the Congress, we  must ensure that we have the appropriate human capital, fiscal, and other  resources to carry out our responsibilities. Our fiscal year 2005 request  would enable us to sustain needed investments to maximize the  productivity of our workforce and to continue addressing key  management challenges: human capital, and information and physical  security. We will continue to take steps to \u201clead by example\u201d within the  federal government in these and other critical management areas.", "If the Congress wishes for GAO to conduct technology assessments, we  are also requesting $545,000 to obtain four additional FTEs and contract  assistance and expertise to establish a baseline technology assessment  capability. This funding level would allow us to conduct one assessment  annually and avoid an adverse impact on other high priority congressional  work."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Remarks", "paragraphs": ["We are grateful to the Congress for providing support and resources that  have helped us in our quest to be a world class professional services  organization. The funding we received in fiscal year 2004 is allowing us to  conduct work that addressed many difficult issues confronting the nation.  By providing professional, objective, and nonpartisan information and  analyses, we help inform the Congress and executive branch agencies on  key issues, and covered programs that continue to involve billions of  dollars and touch millions of lives.", "I am proud of the outstanding contributions made by GAO employees as  they work to serve the Congress and the American people. In keeping with  my strong belief that the federal government needs to exercise fiscal  discipline, our budget request for fiscal year 2005 is modest, but would  maintain our ability to provide first class, effective, and efficient support  to the Congress and the nation to meet 21st century challenges in these  critical times.", "This concludes my statement.

Analyses performed by GAO and  OPM culminated in the enactment of this law that reduces USPS\u2019s pension costs by an average of $3 billion per year over the next 5  years. The Congress directed that the first 3 years of savings be used to reduce USPS\u2019s debt and hold postage rates steady until  fiscal 2006.", "Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002, Public Law 107-289.

Our analysis of the U.S. visa-issuing process showed that the  Department of State\u2019s visa operations were more focused on preventing illegal immigrants from obtaining nonimmigrant visas than on  detecting potential terrorists. We recommended that State reassess its policies, consular staffing procedures, and training program.  State has taken steps to adjust its policies and regulations concerning the screening of visa applicants and its staffing and training for  consular officers.", "Enhancing Quality of Care in Nursing Homes. In a series of reports and testimonies since 1998, we found that, too often, residents  of nursing homes were being harmed and that programs to oversee nursing home quality of care at the Centers for Medicare and  Medicaid Services were not fully effective in identifying and reducing such problems. In 2003, we found a decline in the proportion of  nursing homes that harmed residents but made additional recommendations to further improve care.", "Making Key Contributions to Homeland Security. Drawing upon an extensive body of completed and ongoing work, we identified  specific vulnerabilities and areas for improvement to protect aviation and surface transportation, chemical facilities, sea and land  ports, financial markets, and radioactive sealed sources.

DOD has taken steps to notify state and local responders who may have purchased defective  suits. Also, DOD has taken action to restrict chemical-biological suits to DOD use only\u2014an action that should eliminate the national  security risk associated with sales of these sensitive military items. Lastly, DOD has suspended sales of the equipment in question  pending the results of a risk assessment.", "GAO Efforts That Helped to Change Laws and/or Regulations  Protecting the Retirement Security of Workers. We alerted the Congress to potential dangers threatening the pensions of millions  of American workers and retirees.

A comprehensive approach is needed  to mitigate or eliminate the risks.", "Improving Mutual Fund Disclosures. To improve investor awareness of mutual fund fees and to increase price competition among  funds, we identified alternatives for regulators to increase the usefulness of fee information disclosed to investors.

We highlighted federal entities whose missions and ways of doing  business require modernized approaches, including the Postal Service, and the Coast Guard. Among congressional actions taken to  deal with modernization issues, the House Committee on Government Reform established a special panel on postal reform and  oversight to work with the President\u2019s Commission on the Postal Service on recommendations for comprehensive postal reform. We  also reported this year on the Coast Guard\u2019s ability to effectively carry out critical elements of its mission, including its homeland  security responsibilities. We recommended that the Coast Guard develop a blueprint for targeting its resources to its various mission  responsibilities and a better reporting mechanism for informing the Congress on its effectiveness. Our recommendations led to better  reporting by the Coast Guard and laid the foundation for key revisions the agency intended to make to its strategic plan.", "Helping DOD Recognize and Address Business Modernization Challenges. Several times we have reported and testified on the  challenges DOD faces in trying to successfully modernize about 2,300 business systems, and we made a series of recommendations  aimed at establishing the modernization management capabilities needed to be successful in transforming the department. DOD has  implemented some key architecture management capabilities, such as assigning a chief architect and creating a program office, as  well as issuing the first version of its business enterprise architecture in May 2003. In addition, DOD has revised its system  acquisition guidance. By implementing our recommendations, DOD is increasing the likelihood that its systems investments will  support effective and efficient business operations and provide for timely and reliable information for decision making.", "Helping to Advance Major Information Technology Modernizations. Our work has helped to strengthen the management of the  complex, multibillion-dollar information technology modernization program at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to improve  operations, promote better service, and reduce costs.

Our work examining purchasing and property  management practices at FAA identified several weaknesses in the specific controls and overall control environment that allowed  millions of dollars of improper and wasteful purchases to occur. Such weaknesses also contributed to many instances of property  items not being recorded in FAA\u2019s property management system, which allowed hundreds of lost or missing property items to go  undetected.

Our publication of the Government Auditing Standards in June 2003 provides a  framework for audits of federal programs and monies. This comes at a time of urgent need for integrity in the auditing profession and  for transparency and accountability in the management of scarce resources in the government sector.
