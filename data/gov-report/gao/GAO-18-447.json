While there have been upgrades to the system, the age  of the equipment and high pace of operations create risks that the Army  attempts to mitigate through maintenance. This maintenance, designed to  extend the life of the system until at least 2048, includes restoring  equipment returning from combat back to pre-deployment condition  (\u201creset\u201d) and comprehensively overhauling (\u201crecapitalization\u201d) a portion of  the equipment annually. However, the current global threat environment  has the potential to further increase demands for the Patriot system and  result in additional maintenance requirements.

We selected these years to identify any trends in the  timeliness and quality of the maintenance activities and because this was  the most recent data available. We assessed the reliability of these data  by reviewing available documentation and interviewing officials, among  other things. We found the data to be sufficiently reliable for our  purposes, to include reporting on battalion-specific reset timeliness and  the time spent by the depot on correcting quality defects identified during  internal inspections. We compared the data on reset timeliness against  Army policy. We also interviewed cognizant Army personnel involved in  the planning and conduct of Patriot reset and recapitalization, as well as  officials from two Patriot battalions and their higher headquarters that  recently underwent reset to identify challenges, if any, with respect to  reset timeliness, such as equipment transfer delays and any effects on  training.

Each battalion is organized into groups known as fire units, along with a  headquarters and headquarters battery. Each battalion is controlled by its  own command and control station and can manage up to six fire units,  although a battalion is typically deployed with four. A fire unit is made up  of four basic components: (1) a ground-based radar to detect and track  targets; (2) launchers; (3) interceptor missiles; and (4) a command,  control, and communication station. Overall, a fire unit\u2019s equipment  includes eleven unique major end items, including the radar, the  launchers, and an electric power plant, among other items.

The reset process seeks to return Patriot equipment to a pre-deployment  condition in order to prevent Patriot units from having to spend home  station training funds to keep their equipment functional after returning  from operations in austere environments for extended periods.", "The Army also relies heavily on recapitalization to restore Patriot  equipment. A longer and more intensive process than reset,  recapitalization seeks to restore equipment to what the Army considers a  \u201clike-new\u201d condition, and according to Army guidance is a \u201cnear zero time  or zero mile\u201d maintenance process. The recapitalization process seeks  to add life to the system, and it provides an opportunity for the Army to  make incremental modernization upgrades, such as the insertion of new  software, technology insertions, or replacing obsolete parts. For example,  the Army is upgrading the Patriot system to prepare for its integration into  the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System.", "As the Army fields this modernized command and control system, the  Patriot equipment undergoing recapitalization will also change, but the  Army plans to continue recapitalization to support the Patriot system\u2019s  mission through 2048. Specifically, the Army expects that the transition to  the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System will allow  it to replace current command and control elements. However, remaining  end items, such as launchers, would continue to require recapitalization  through the full life of the system to 2048. If the Integrated Air and Missile  Defense Battle Command System, which is currently planned for initial  fielding in 2022, is delayed, program and depot officials expect that they  can continue to recapitalize current Patriot equipment as long as needed  to support the Army\u2019s long-term goal. However, Army officials noted that  delays could require mitigation actions, such as the need to continue  repairing parts that the Army would otherwise have replaced.", "Aside from the degree of work performed, the recapitalization and reset  processes differ in several other key ways. For instance, the Army  generally provides units undergoing recapitalization with another set of  Patriot equipment in a one-for-one exchange. In contrast, units  undergoing reset receive the same set of equipment back after work is  completed and are not provided other equipment while the unit\u2019s  equipment undergoes reset at the depot. Additionally, the target length for  each process differs; the Army aims to recapitalize one battalion\u2019s worth  of equipment each year, while reset work is expected to be completed in  180 days to meet the timelines of the Army\u2019s process to prepare units for  potential deployment.

This regulation establishes phases through which a unit passes as it  prepares for a potential deployment. The first of these, the reset phase,  begins when a majority of the unit\u2019s personnel have returned from  deployment and must last a minimum of 180 days. At the conclusion of  the 180 days, the unit enters the train/ready phase, at which point it may  be deployed again, and needs to have its equipment back in order to do  so. Because of this standard, the Army must return a unit\u2019s equipment  from reset within 180 days from the start of the unit\u2019s reset phase. From  fiscal years 2014 through 2017, the Army reset seven battalions and for  six of these battalions the Army did not return all of the units\u2019 equipment  within 180 days. Two of these battalions\u2014the 2-43 Air Defense Artillery  and 4-3 Air Defense Artillery\u2014experienced delays that were deliberately  planned. Specifically, Army officials told us that the installation of system  upgrades for these battalions extended the overall reset timeline by 60  days. One official stated that this was requested and approved, and  explained that if the upgrades had been installed separately after  equipment had been reset, it would have taken 4 months to conduct the  work. However, as shown in figure 2, of the remaining five Patriot units  that completed reset during the period we reviewed, only one received all  of its returned equipment within 180 days.", "Patriot battalion officials we interviewed told us that delays in the receipt  of reset equipment forced them to modify their scheduling and execution  of required collective training. For example, one battalion commander we  spoke with said that without equipment his battalion could not effectively  train for some collective tasks, such as exercises that require moving the  system. Additionally, leadership from two battalions we spoke with told us  that the late return of reset equipment compressed the training time  available for them to conduct field exercises. This can create  unnecessary challenges in meeting Army training requirements as units  progress through the Army\u2019s process for building ready units. Specifically,  according to the Army\u2019s force generation guidance, a unit is expected to  be ready to redeploy on day 181 after returning from its last deployment  to its home station. As one battalion commander described, the  collective-level training that units conduct during these shortened  windows is \u201csufficient, but not optimal.\u201d", "Patriot units have utilized a series of actions to mitigate the impact of  delays in equipment receipt after maintenance, but such mitigation  actions are sometimes not feasible or optimal. For example, Patriot unit  officials told us that the Army shares equipment between battalions that  are collocated on the same installation, but at different points in the  readiness building timeline. Specifically, when one battalion turns in  equipment for reset, certain pieces of equipment from another battalion  on the same installation, if available, might be borrowed to conduct  training. Battalion officials noted, however, that this measure may not  always be feasible. Leadership from two Patriot battalions, for example,  cited instances where their units were unable to train during their reset  periods and could not borrow equipment from other battalions located on  the same installation because those battalions were deployed. In addition,  units use simulators to conduct individual-level training to give personnel  experience with new system upgrades, though Patriot brigade officials  noted this is a stopgap measure while units are without equipment and  does not allow for collective training. Lastly, Patriot units can\u2014once  delayed equipment arrives or via borrowing equipment\u2014conduct some  collective training for extended hours (i.e. during evenings) each day  while at their home station, but a battalion official noted that doing so is  also not optimal for unit morale.", "Battalion commanders we spoke with told us that their units were  sufficiently trained and ready to deploy, despite the delays in the return of  the equipment to the units. However, a memorandum from a brigade  commander noted that given the high pace of operations, it is important  that units receive their equipment in a timely manner to enable them to  complete training for their next deployment, as delays can create a  notable impact on crew and collective training. The late return of reset  equipment could therefore have a detrimental impact on units\u2019 ability to  conduct training to meet assigned missions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Army Has Identified Factors Affecting Maintenance Timeliness", "paragraphs": ["The Army has identified several factors affecting the timeliness of Patriot  maintenance as shown in table 2.", "Some of the factors affecting timeliness, as identified by Army officials,  are directly within the control of Letterkenny, where reset is conducted,  and some are not. Specifically, Army officials stated that U.S.  Transportation Command and the Defense Logistics Agency also have  responsibilities related to some of the factors that can affect timeliness,  such as the transport of equipment and availability of parts, respectively.  These factors are discussed in more detail below.", "Preventive maintenance. According to Army officials and Army  documentation, the unit leadership of some deployed Patriot  battalions do not emphasize preventive maintenance. As a result,  equipment may not be properly maintained to Army standards and  can create additional work tasks for depot personnel when they  receive it, such as conducting additional or more detailed inspections.", "Unexpected damage. Army officials cited some instances where  equipment sent to the depot arrives in worse than expected condition,  either due to damage incurred during transport or because unit  personnel did not accurately report the condition of the equipment  prior to turning it in. For example, in December 2017 Letterkenny  officials documented that a battalion\u2019s missile launcher was returned  to the depot with unexpected severe corrosion on power cables, and  certain equipment items, such as generators, were completely  inoperable. Officials cited another instance where a radar was  pressure-washed prior to its return to the depot, causing extensive  damage. These kinds of unexpected conditions result in greater repair  work than anticipated for depot employees.", "Supply chain challenges. Officials at Letterkenny told us that their  forecasts for parts orders have not been consistently met via Army  and Department of Defense supply chain processes, but that the  depot was taking steps to improve its own forecasting. An official  also noted that problems can arise if sole-source suppliers for critical  parts go out of business, or if they have to order parts that are no  longer regularly produced by vendors due to obsolescence. Patriot  program office officials provided an example of a radio that is part of  the Patriot system and is no longer in production, and noted that the  program office was working with Army headquarters officials to  identify a solution.", "The Army uses a series of measures to mitigate parts availability issues,  such as having the depot utilize its own equipment to fabricate some  items on short notice (see fig. 3) and, according to Army officials, by  taking parts from incoming equipment and using them for equipment  nearing completion of maintenance. Additionally, in July 2017, the depot  received permission to purchase critical \u201clong-lead\u201d parts for specific  Patriot items in advance of anticipated need, although, according to  officials, as a general rule and practice, the depot is not allowed to  purchase items without funding in place. Letterkenny officials told us  that in cases where they are unable to acquire critical parts, or lack the  funds to do so, delays can occur.", "Depot quality controls. Time spent remedying maintenance errors and  quality defects\u2014such as incorrect assemblies, defective parts, or  improper painting during depot operations\u2014may contribute to the  depot\u2019s timeliness challenges. Army officials stressed that the  Patriot system is complex, and certain maintenance tasks can be  challenging because it can be difficult to isolate equipment faults. For  example, the Patriot radar system is composed of thousands of  elements (see fig. 4), which, according to officials, requires extensive  testing to ensure that each element is operational. Depot officials told  us that their processes are designed to ensure that finished products  meet operational standards, and that doing so sometimes takes  longer than expected. Letterkenny uses a series of metrics and  reporting methods, such as internal tracking of defects and surveys  and reports from customers, to monitor, document, and correct quality  defects during the Patriot maintenance process to ensure that any  maintenance errors or defects are identified before the equipment is  returned to units.", "However, quality defects that may affect timeliness can still arise. Each  fiscal year Letterkenny establishes a target for hours spent at the depot  correcting quality defects that arise during maintenance, which are then  tracked and used as indicators of the overall quality of the maintenance  process. As tracked by the depot, the monthly time spent correcting  quality defects varied, when averaged across each year. Specifically, the  average in fiscal year 2015 was below the depot\u2019s set target, but the  averages in fiscal years 2014, 2016, and 2017 exceeded the targets. For  example, the time spent correcting quality defects ranged from 846 hours  a month in fiscal year 2016 to 1,242 hours a month in fiscal year 2017,  above those years\u2019 monthly target of 800 hours.", "Equipment transportation. Transportation time is included in the 180- day policy for returning equipment from reset to Patriot units, and it  often takes a significant amount of time before equipment is  transported to the depot from theater. As such, according to Army  documentation, the depot can be left with only 120 days to complete  reset work before it has to return equipment back to units if it is to  meet the 180-day policy. According to Army documentation, to  mitigate this issue the Army airlifts a number of critical Patriot  equipment items, such as radars, from theater to the depot so that  reset work can begin earlier on these items. Additionally, unit officials  and a program official involved in planning for the Army\u2019s reset  process noted that equipment items are sent back from the depot as  soon as reset work is completed; the depot does not wait until the  entire unit equipment set is complete. However, as shown previously  in figure 2, these kinds of mitigation actions with respect to  transportation have not been sufficient in ensuring that units receive  all of their equipment back within the 180 days allowed by policy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Army Monitors Factors Affecting Maintenance Timeliness, but Has Not Conducted an Analysis of Their Relative Importance", "paragraphs": ["Although the Army monitors the factors that have affected maintenance  timeliness, it has not conducted an analysis to identify their relative  importance.

Moreover, based on our  discussions with different stakeholders associated with the sustainment of  the Patriot system, there are different perceptions as to the degree to  which the various factors contributed to delays in completing maintenance  and returning reset equipment to units. For example, during our meetings,  depot officials indicated that supply chain issues were the primary  timeliness challenge. In contrast, a senior program office official and unit  officials emphasized the importance of transportation of equipment and its  effects on timeliness. In addition, Letterkenny and Army stakeholders told  us that while they work to identify and correct issues as they arise through  the processes described above, their efforts to remedy these issues are  conducted in isolation from one another and not compiled and compared  to enable the Army to identify their relative importance in terms of each  factor\u2019s effect on timeliness.", "Although aware of the challenges of returning equipment to units in a  timely manner, the Army has not comprehensively analyzed the relative  importance of the various factors identified above that affect Patriot  maintenance timeliness.

Although not required by Army regulation, one means of doing this is  through conducting comprehensive analysis, such as comparing the  relative importance of factors affecting performance in order to target  improvement efforts.", "A comprehensive analysis to identify the relative importance of factors  could better position the Army to fully understand current and historic  issues affecting its ability to complete Patriot equipment maintenance in a  timely manner.

While the Army  would prefer to recapitalize Patriot equipment every 10 years, the Army  has reviewed two options for recapitalizing Patriot equipment more  frequently and determined that these options are not feasible. According  to Army documentation, the Army plans to continue sustaining and  upgrading Patriot equipment to meet its long-term goal\u2014which is to keep  the system viable through 2048\u2014by, for example, improving system  reliability and enhancing its warfighting capabilities. The Army considers  recapitalization a key program to achieve this goal. Specifically, in its  2014 readiness assessment of the Patriot force, the Army concluded that  recapitalization is the single most important program with respect to  keeping Patriot equipment viable and sustainable. Officials from multiple  Army organizations also told us that the age of the Patriot system makes  replacement of expendable and aged components and insertion of new  technology during recapitalization important to Patriot sustainment,  readiness, and its ability to meet emerging threats.", "While the Army has emphasized the importance of recapitalization in  achieving its long-term goals for the Patriot system, the Army is not  planning to adjust its recapitalization pace in the near term, as of March  2018. According to Army documentation, recapitalizing equipment every  10 years would maintain the equipment at the Army\u2019s desired condition.  However, the Army\u2019s near-term schedule for recapitalization in fiscal  years 2018 through 2022 and its long-term notional schedule for  recapitalization of Patriot equipment through fiscal year 2031 both outline  cycling one battalion per year through recapitalization. With 15 Patriot  battalions, the pace of one battalion per year does not restore the  equipment to its desired condition every 10 years.", "According to Army Patriot officials, there are two main options for the  Army to increase the pace of recapitalization, but each of these options  poses challenges. These two options are:", "Reduce the amount of equipment available for ongoing commitments  and recapitalize it at the depot. Officials told us that one way the Army  could increase the pace of recapitalization would be to reduce the  amount of equipment available for ongoing commitments, but that this  is not feasible given the current high pace of operations. Further, the  Army does not anticipate that operational requirements will lessen  under the projected security environment. The near-term schedule  assumes that ongoing operational commitments will not change and is  designed to synchronize recapitalization with currently scheduled  operational deployments and training. Army officials responsible for  coordinating the near-term schedule told us that the near-term  schedule has little flexibility given the Army\u2019s limited force structure of  15 battalions, and program and depot officials stated that if the Army  were to recapitalize more than one battalion per year, the pool of  battalions available to meet these current commitments would  decrease.", "Procure additional equipment to provide to units turning in equipment  for recapitalization. Army officials said that the Army could buy extra  equipment to provide to additional units turning in their equipment for  recapitalization if the Army wanted to accelerate the recapitalization  pace. At the current pace of recapitalization, the Army has sufficient  quantities of major equipment items to ensure that as a Patriot  battalion turns in equipment for recapitalization it receives recently  recapitalized equipment back on a one-to-one basis and thus is  generally not without equipment. This process prevents removing  Patriot battalions from operational rotations during the recapitalization  period. However, officials stated that if the Army were to adjust the  pace to recapitalize more than the current one battalion per year, it  would require buying more equipment to ensure that any additional  units undergoing recapitalization would not be left without equipment.  Army documents indicate that the Army has assessed whether to  acquire additional equipment to enable an accelerated pace of  recapitalization. However, an official with responsibility for the Patriot  capability and senior Army headquarters officials with responsibility for  Patriot resourcing and planning told us that the Army instead has  prioritized developing a replacement for the Patriot radar. This  replacement radar is expected to address capability needs related to  radar reliability and range to better defend against advanced threats.  Army documentation indicates that this replacement radar is expected  to reach initial operational capability in fiscal year 2025.", "If the Army decided to reduce the amount of equipment available for  ongoing commitments or buy more equipment, then the Army would also  need to make additional investments in depot resources to support  accelerating the pace of recapitalization. According to Army documents  and officials we interviewed, these include personnel, facilities, and  equipment. However, there are a number of challenges related to putting  these resources in place.", "Personnel. Army documentation shows and depot officials stated that  they would likely hire contractors to meet workload demands and the  depot could add shifts if the Army decided to adjust the pace of  recapitalization to what it considers an optimal pace. Depot officials  also told us they would try to hire contractors with some Patriot  experience and place them alongside more experienced personnel in  order to preserve work quality, as they have done in response to  previous surges in reset work. However, the Army recognizes that  Letterkenny faces challenges in expanding its workforce due to a  limited pool of available workers in the area around the depot.", "Developing skilled Patriot maintenance personnel is also difficult. An  Army study of the organic industrial base found that 11 of the 15 most  critical personnel positions at Letterkenny are directly associated with  Patriot maintenance and officials noted that, due to the complexity of  the system, it can take up to 5 years for Patriot maintenance  personnel to become proficient.", "Facilities and equipment. Depot officials stated that if the Army  decided to adjust the pace of recapitalization to what it considers  optimal, they would likely need to review, among other things, the  tools, equipment, and facilities needed to support such an adjustment,  as well as supply availability. They also told us that Letterkenny  already has proposed expanding its facilities to meet projected future  work, and the depot has planned for the plant equipment it will need to  continue maintaining the Patriot system as upgrades are incorporated.  However, they noted that it takes a full year to recapitalize the Patriot  radar, including 3 months of testing, and that Letterkenny has one of  only two radar test sites. Given the time required and the single test  site, if the Army wanted to recapitalize more than one battalion a year,  program officials stated that current conditions probably would not  support doing so.", "Continuing the current pace of recapitalization could introduce other  challenges in meeting the Army\u2019s long-term goals for the Patriot system,  and Army officials stated they are aware of these challenges. Specifically,  Army documentation shows, and Army officials told us, that the current  pace is not optimal and that it could introduce the possibility of equipment  failure as specific items remain in use past the Army\u2019s desired timeframe  for recapitalizing equipment every 10 years. Additionally, depot officials  told us that their biggest concern with continuing recapitalization at its  current pace is that there may be increased costs to conduct  recapitalization due to the system\u2019s increasing age. As an example, they  stated that there may be increased corrosion issues, adding that they  have already seen a significant deterioration in the condition of some  trailers. Also, the Army\u2019s decision to continue recapitalizing equipment  every 15 years instead of every 10 years provides fewer opportunities to  conduct modernization, which is often done in conjunction with  recapitalization. Program officials stated that modernizing the system is  important because upgrades reduce the number of items that can fail,  thereby making field maintenance easier. Moreover, officials from one  Patriot brigade stated that their main concern with respect to Patriot is  that additional operational commitments could potentially slow  modernization progress and affect the Army\u2019s capability to meet threats,  particularly since the capabilities and sophistication of enemy threats  continue to increase.", "The Army has reviewed its options and the associated challenges related  to increasing the pace of recapitalization and has decided the best path  forward based on its review is to continue recapitalizing Patriot battalion  equipment sets once every 15 years. However, this pace of  recapitalization includes some risk\u2014as identified by Army officials\u2014and  will likely create challenges in meeting the Army\u2019s long-term goals for the  system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Maintaining good equipment condition is particularly important given the  current high pace of operations for Patriot units, as well as the potential  for a further increase in operational requirements. However, the Army\u2019s  reset process has often delivered equipment to units late, affecting units\u2019  ability to schedule and execute training as they prepare for their next  mission. The Army is aware of the challenges in completing maintenance  and returning reset equipment to units, and has identified several factors  that contribute to delays, but has not analyzed how much each of the  factors contribute to delays.

This included  analysis of, among other things, documents describing the processes for  Patriot battalion equipment transfers to and from Letterkenny Army Depot  (Letterkenny), depot activities to recapitalize and reset equipment, and  testing to ensure the equipment\u2019s proper operation. We also reviewed,  among other documents, Army guidance on Patriot equipment status  reporting, reset, materiel maintenance, and on ensuring the quality of  Army programs; as well as planning schedules and documents on  backorders and critical items. We evaluated the Army\u2019s processes to  identify and correct factors causing any reset delays against Army  guidance on program performance improvement.", "Additionally, we analyzed data provided by the Army on Patriot equipment  fully mission capable rates and the timeliness of Army Patriot reset  activities from fiscal years 2014 through 2017\u2014the most recent data  available\u2014to identify any trends. Specifically, we analyzed Patriot unit  fully mission capable data as recorded by Army Aviation and Missile  Command G-3 (Readiness) based on data submitted by Patriot  operational units. We analyzed it to corroborate statements regarding  equipment readiness and the quality of maintenance work made by  program and operational unit officials and to compare against the Army\u2019s  goal for fully mission capable rates. To determine depot timeliness, we  analyzed aggregate monthly data provided by the Army on Letterkenny\u2019s  timeliness in completing Patriot maintenance activities against  performance schedules. We also analyzed Patriot battalion-specific Army  data on reset timeliness in order to determine the frequency with which  Letterkenny met the reset timeliness policy. Finally, we reviewed Army  data on the time spent re-working and re-inspecting equipment with  quality deficiencies found during internal inspections at Letterkenny in  order to inform our assessment of the potential effects of addressing  quality deficiencies on depot timeliness.", "We assessed the reliability of these data by reviewing available system  documentation, such as user manuals and data dictionaries for each of the automated information systems from which the respective data were  drawn. We manually checked the data for obvious errors and missing or  outlier values. We administered data reliability questionnaires to officials  familiar with the data systems and assessed their responses and answers  to follow-up questions, and we interviewed cognizant officials about their  data management practices and use of the data. Based on these steps,  we found these data to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes, to include  providing fiscal years 2014 through 2017 Patriot equipment fully mission  capable rates, battalion-specific reset timeliness, and the time spent by  the depot on correcting quality defects identified during internal  inspections.", "To describe the Army\u2019s plans for supporting the long-term viability of the  Patriot system through recapitalization and any challenges associated  with its plans, we analyzed Army regulations, guidance, and planning  documents, as well as Army studies. These included, among others, the  Army\u2019s recapitalization management policy; Army documents proposing  and approving a recapitalization program for Patriot; Army studies of its  depot workforce, worldwide Patriot equipment readiness, and Patriot  operational demands in relation to available assets; and Army guidance  on materiel maintenance and useful equipment life.
