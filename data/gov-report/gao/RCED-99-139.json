Some of these support activities and costs are site-specific in nature, such as supervising cleanup contractors, performing laboratory analysis, and compelling private parties to perform cleanups for which they are responsible. Other support activities and costs are non-site-specific, such as management and administrative activities and expenses for rent and computer services.

In our 1998 report on contractor cleanup spending, we reported that for remedial action cleanups managed by EPA, about 71 percent of the costs charged by cleanup contractors was for the subcontractors who physically performed the cleanups\u2014such as earthmoving and constructing treatment facilities. The remaining 29 percent went to the prime contractors for professional work, such as construction management and engineering services, and associated travel, overhead, and administrative costs and fees.", "For the purpose of this report, contractor cleanup work includes all Superfund spending for the study, design, and implementation of cleanups. The remaining Superfund spending is classified as cleanup support, which includes both site-specific and non-site-specific support.

These improvements introduced over 100 categories to account for the activities that are paid for with Superfund money. Some of the categories capture activities that are site-specific, such as monitoring and supervising cleanups conducted by private parties, while other categories capture activities that are more administrative, such as maintaining automated data processing systems.", "We found that Superfund spending is not evenly distributed among all the activity categories.

Given the concentration of non-site-specific spending under these three categories, we conducted a detailed analysis of 1 year\u2019s (fiscal 1997) non-site-specific spending under these three administrative categories for three EPA regions and the three headquarters offices that had the highest amount of Superfund spending\u2014the Office of Administration and Resources Management, the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, and the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response.", "For the three regions, most of the non-site-specific spending was on personnel items\u2014such as management, administrative, and secretarial support\u2014and general support activities, such as financial management, facility management, public affairs, and contract management. We found that some of this spending represented cost allocations to the Superfund program, while other spending was more directly related to specific program activities. For example, in all three regions we found that some of the non-site-specific costs had been allocated to the Superfund program for its share of expenses, such as the regional administrator\u2019s management, clerical, and administrative costs, regional motor pool expenses, and computer equipment and service costs. We also identified a few instances in which non-site-specific expenditures were more directly related to implementing cleanups, such as expenditures on annual physical examinations for staff who conduct field work at hazardous waste sites.", "Among the headquarters units, the Office of Administration and Resources Management had non-site-specific Superfund expenditures for items such as rent, information management, and facilities operations and maintenance. The Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance had non-site-specific expenditures for items such as overall program direction; policy development; and budgetary, financial and administrative support. This Office also incurred expenses for criminal investigations and for activities such as field sampling and laboratory and forensic analyses in support of criminal cases. These expenses were recorded as non-site-specific to protect the confidentiality of ongoing criminal investigations. The Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response had non-site-specific expenditures for personnel functions, such as developing national strategy programs, technical policies, regulations and guidelines, and for providing program leadership for such activities as community involvement, program planning and analysis, contract management, information management, and human and organizational services.

While not identical to the categories we used in our analyses, Energy\u2019s functional cost categories are similar. In essence, Energy\u2019s system compares the share of costs in the different categories among the agency\u2019s operating units. If a unit\u2019s costs in any given category vary significantly from the other operating units\u2019, those costs are further analyzed to determine whether the differences are appropriate or whether they indicate areas for improvement. Department of Energy financial officials stated that the functional cost reporting system has resulted in support costs receiving increased attention by management and has been a helpful tool that has contributed to support costs declining faster than other costs\u2014from 45 to 43 percent of total costs between fiscal years 1994 and 1997."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Detailed analyses of expenditure trends over time and among regions and headquarters units can be a valuable tool in identifying potential cost savings.

We do not believe that our categorization of Superfund costs leads to this impression. In fact, the first paragraph of the report explicitly states that EPA undertakes a number of activities, both site-specific and non-site-specific, that support cleanups, including supervising cleanup contractors, compelling private parties to perform cleanups, and performing management and administrative activities. Furthermore, the body of the report provides numerous examples of the purposes served by both site-specific and non-site-specific spending. We believe that these examples demonstrate that many of the site-specific and non-site-specific support activities contribute to the achievement of cleanups.", "The purpose of our analyses was to disaggregate Superfund expenditures to provide more detailed information on the specific functions served by this spending. This analytic method can be used (and is being used by the Department of Energy) to identify cost category differences among operating units that can lead to potential cost savings. Our report does not attempt to define or determine which expenditures are \u201ccleanup activities,\u201d but rather to describe the purposes for which Superfund money has been expended. According to EPA, cleanup response spending includes \u201clab analysis, engineering and technical analyses, project manager salaries, State/Tribal activities, community involvement activities, and oversight of responsible parties and many other activities necessary to achieve cleanups.\u201d We agree that these activities support the cleanup of sites, as stated in this report. However, when these support costs are aggregated into the larger category of cleanup response, it is unclear what share of these costs are for work related to specific sites, as opposed to general program expenditures.", "EPA also stated that our analyses failed to recognize Superfund appropriations used by other federal agencies. In fact, our analyses included Superfund expenditures by other federal agencies, and these expenditures were included under our site-specific and non-site-specific spending categories, as appropriate. The only substantial expenditures excluded from our review were made by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, because these expenditures are made directly by that agency and are not reported in EPA\u2019s Superfund accounting system. EPA further stated that our analyses did not account for the expenditures private parties make to clean up Superfund sites that are the result of EPA\u2019s enforcement expenditures. We did not analyze private parties\u2019 expenditures to clean up hazardous waste sites because our focus was on federal Superfund expenditures. However, as part of our work for this assignment, we found that more than half of EPA\u2019s fiscal year 1997 enforcement expenditures was for management and administrative activities.", "Notwithstanding EPA\u2019s concerns as discussed above, the agency agreed to consider analyzing Superfund spending in terms of site-specific and non-site-specific obligations and expenditures, as we recommended.

Using the IFMS information, we classified the cleanup support activities into spending for site-specific support and non-site-specific support for these fiscal years. We confirmed this classification with Office of Comptroller officials. In order to give a complete representation of cleanup support activities, we made one adjustment to the analyses included in our prior reports. Specifically, we included the costs for EPA personnel who supervise the cleanup contractors into the category for site-specific support. In our two prior reports, we had included these personnel in the contractor cleanup work category as EPA\u2019s accounting system does. This change has the effect of reducing the percentage of contractor cleanup work by about 1 percent from the level we had previously reported.", "To determine what activities were carried out with EPA\u2019s cleanup support spending, particularly its non-site-specific spending, we used the IFMS information. We categorized the spending by EPA\u2019s budget action codes, which provided general activity descriptions for Superfund spending under the more than 100 action codes. To obtain more specific information for EPA\u2019s non-site-specific spending, we selected three regional offices\u2014Philadelphia, Chicago, and Kansas City\u2014for sampling. Among EPA\u2019s regions, the first two had the highest non-site-specific spending and the third had the lowest, based on fiscal year 1997 data, which was the most recent information for which we had a breakdown of total support spending at the time we made our selection. We also selected the three EPA headquarters units\u2014the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response, the Office of Administration and Resources Management, and the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance\u2014with the highest levels of Superfund spending. We interviewed cognizant officials from the three regional offices and three headquarters units about the particular activities conducted under the various budget action codes for the non-site-specific spending, and obtained greater detail on the uses of this spending.", "In a 1995 report on the IFMS, we found instances of inaccurate and incomplete data in the system. While we did not consider these instances to be representative of the overall integrity of the IFMS data, we recommended that EPA conduct statistical testing of the data, which EPA has done. During the course of our current review, officials of EPA\u2019s Office of Inspector General told us that in their opinion the IFMS has not led to any material misstatements in EPA\u2019s 1996 and 1997 annual financial statements and that they believed that the IFMS information was reliable for the purposes of our review.
