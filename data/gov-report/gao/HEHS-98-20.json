The H-2A nonimmigrant guestworker program provides a way for U.S. agricultural employers to import nonimmigrant foreign workers to perform seasonal agricultural work on a temporary basis when domestic workers are unavailable. During fiscal year 1996, agricultural employers used the H-2A program to import about 15,000 workers, less than 1 percent of the agricultural field labor force.", "The Congress asked whether the H-2A guestworker program could provide a sufficient supply of agricultural workers if a significant farm labor shortage occurred. As a result, the 1996 law, included in the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, 1997, directed us to review various aspects of the H-2A program. These issues are included in two general objectives: (1) the likelihood of a widespread agricultural labor shortage and its impact on the need for nonimmigrant guestworkers and (2) the H-2A program\u2019s ability to meet the needs of agricultural employers while protecting domestic and foreign agricultural workers, both now and if a significant number of nonimmigrant guestworkers is needed in the future. (See app. I for a list of primary congressional contacts in addition to the report addressees and app. II for a detailed listing of the questions agreed upon in discussions.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Throughout the 20th century, the Congress has authorized numerous programs to allow U.S. agricultural employers to use foreign temporary guestworkers in the event of a domestic labor shortage. For example, during World War I, the Congress authorized a temporary farm labor program to replace workers who were in the military; that program admitted almost 77,000 Mexicans to the United States. During a similar labor shortage created by World War II, the Congress authorized a program to bring Mexican guestworkers, called \u201cbraceros,\u201d to the United States. The Bracero program operated under a series of legislative authorizations from 1942 to 1964, bringing in between 4 million and 5 million workers for the nation\u2019s farms, primarily in the western United States. While the Bracero program was still in effect, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (P.L. 82-144) authorized a guestworker program that included agricultural workers, which is known as \u201cH-2\u201d after the section of the law. Similar in structure to the Bracero program, the H-2 program was enacted as a permanent program and was primarily used by agricultural employers in the east to contract with Caribbean workers.", "The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) divided the H-2 program into two visa categories: the H-2A program for agricultural employers and the H-2B program for nonagricultural employers. The H-2A program allows employers to bring in foreign workers to \u201cperform agricultural labor or services . . . of a temporary or seasonal nature.\u201d The purpose of the H-2A program is to ensure agricultural employers an adequate labor supply while also protecting the jobs, as well as the wages and working conditions, of domestic farmworkers. Under the program, agricultural employers who anticipate a shortage of domestic workers can request nonimmigrant foreign workers. The Department of Justice authorizes the State Department to issue nonimmigrant visas for H-2A workers only after the Department of Labor certifies that a labor shortage exists and that the wages and working conditions of U.S. workers similarly employed will not be adversely affected by the use of guestworkers. USDA conducts surveys and acts in an advisory role to Labor in Labor\u2019s determination of the minimum wage rates to be paid by employers of H-2A workers\u2014the so-called \u201cadverse effect wage rate\u201d\u2014which are designed to mitigate any adverse effect the employment of these workers may have on domestic workers similarly employed.", "Federal agencies are responsible for protecting both H-2A and domestic farmworkers from being exploited by agricultural employers. Labor\u2019s Wage and Hour Division (WHD), which is part of the Employment Standards Administration (ESA), is responsible for ensuring that agricultural employers comply with the contractual obligations that apply to H-2A workers, including wages, benefits, and working conditions. Since agricultural employers must offer at least the same working conditions to willing domestic workers, WHD must also ensure compliance for domestic workers employed in \u201ccorresponding employment.\u201d", "WHD also enforces additional protections afforded to domestic farmworkers by the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (MSPA), which establishes basic protections for domestic migrant and seasonal farmworkers regarding wages, housing, and transportation. MSPA requires that employers notify prospective workers of the wages and working conditions before they are hired. MSPA also requires that housing provided for workers must meet certain minimum standards for health and safety, and that vehicles in which workers are transported meet certain standards for safety.", "Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is generally responsible for regulating workplace safety and health, including the establishment of mandatory standards for temporary labor camps and for permanent migrant farmworker housing constructed on April 3, 1980, or later. OSHA issued a national field sanitation standard in 1987 that required agricultural employers to provide field laborers, at no cost, drinking water, toilets, and handwashing facilities. In those states that operate their own safety and health programs under federal OSHA approval, and which have decided to retain enforcement authority over field sanitation, the state OSHA office enforces provisions of the field sanitation standard. In February 1997, Labor transferred responsibility for enforcing the field sanitation standard in states without state safety and health programs from OSHA to WHD.", "The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), in addition to admitting qualified guestworkers under the H-2A program, is responsible for protecting domestic workers by ensuring that (1) foreign workers do not enter the United States illegally and (2) U.S. employers do not hire illegal workers. Within INS, border management is largely the responsibility of the Border Patrol and Investigations, while special agents throughout the country are responsible for identifying, apprehending, and expelling illegal workers, and for sanctioning employers who knowingly hire foreign workers who are not authorized to work in this country.", "With the passage of IRCA in 1986, it became illegal for employers to knowingly hire people who are not authorized to work in the United States. All employees hired after November 6, 1986, regardless of citizenship, are required to show employers certain documents to establish both identity and employment eligibility. Employers, in turn, must verify the identity and employment eligibility of everyone they hire. Employers may not, however, discriminate against individuals on the basis of national origin or citizenship. INS\u2019s Worksite Enforcement program enforces this provision. INS investigations special agents and Border Patrol officers investigate employers, inspect eligibility verification, determine the nature and degree of compliance, remove unauthorized aliens from the worksite, and can sanction employers who knowingly hire aliens unauthorized to work.", "IRCA also established the Commission on Agricultural Workers to study the effects of the act on the agricultural industry, with special emphasis on perishable crop production. The Commission was also asked to review a number of more specific questions regarding IRCA\u2019s impact, including the adequacy of the supply of agricultural labor in the United States, whether certain geographic regions need special programs or provisions to meet their needs for agricultural labor, and the extent to which the labor difficulties experienced by agricultural employers are related to the lack of modern labor-management techniques. The Commission in its 1992 report concluded that no new supplementary foreign worker programs were warranted at that time. However, it also urged the continuation of adequate monitoring and analysis of the farm labor market to facilitate quick action if future shortages develop. Labor conducts the National Agricultural Workers Survey (NAWS) annually, which collects detailed information on the characteristics and work patterns of agricultural workers, including job history data used to estimate fluctuations in farm labor supply.", "The Immigration Act of 1990 mandated the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform to examine and make recommendations regarding the implementation and impact of U.S. immigration policy. In 1995, the Commission on Immigration Reform found a considerable oversupply of farmworkers throughout the country, with heavy unemployment even during peak harvest periods. As of September 1997, the Commission found that the agricultural labor market had not changed significantly. The Commission concluded that any new agricultural guestworker programs, particularly \u201cthose that seek to revisit the Bracero program,\u201d are not needed, concluding that such programs expand rural poverty, and \u201care incompatible with the values of democratic societies worldwide.\u201d", "Although neither the Commission on Agricultural Workers nor the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform recommended new programs, considerable congressional interest in farm labor issues continues. For example, in March 1996, the House rejected legislation that would have moved the H-2A program from Labor to the Justice Department and replaced the H-2A program\u2019s certification requirements with provisions permitting agricultural employers to attest or state that a labor shortage existed in their area and that employing temporary foreign guestworkers would not adversely affect domestic workers. This legislation would also have modified the program\u2019s housing provisions and withheld portions of guestworkers\u2019 wages to be paid upon the workers\u2019 return to the country of origin. The House also rejected another amendment that would have transferred the H-2A program to Justice, in addition to shortening filing and recruitment times and capping the program at 100,000 workers. Similar legislation has been submitted in both houses of the current Congress, but no action had been taken as of December 31, 1997."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To address the objectives of this review, we collected documents and interviewed officials from the Departments of Labor, Justice, State, and Agriculture (USDA) and the Commission on Immigration Reform.

However, the lack of evidence of a widespread farm labor shortage does not preclude the potential for, or existence of, localized shortages particular to specific crops or geographic areas. Many grower advocates, USDA officials, and farm labor experts told us that a large proportion of the current agricultural labor supply is composed of workers who are not authorized for employment, leaving many agricultural employers vulnerable to potential labor shortfalls in the event of a concentrated or targeted INS enforcement effort. Many individual growers we interviewed concurred with this assessment, expressing concerns about the prospect of localized shortages resulting from intensified INS enforcement activities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Limited Data Make Measurement of Labor Shortages Difficult", "paragraphs": ["The limited data available make it difficult to directly measure a market imbalance such as a farm labor shortage. For example, it has been suggested that the analysis of job vacancy data could help identify those occupations where shortages exist, but the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) no longer collects this information. Although Labor\u2019s Employment Service does collect information on the number of workers seeking and obtaining employment in agriculture through referrals at individual state employment services, an agency official estimates that such activity accounts for less than 5 percent of all job placements in agricultural field work nationally. Regardless, job vacancy data alone would be insufficient to determine whether a labor shortage existed; they would need to be considered in conjunction with other labor market indicators.", "Other labor market indicators are consistent with the view that a widespread national farm labor shortage does not currently exist. For example, experts agree that sustained high unemployment rates generally signify that surplus labor is available and that persistently low unemployment rates can indicate a labor shortage. Although unemployment rates are available for states and counties, BLS does not construct unemployment rates for the agricultural industry for counties or all states, or for occupations such as agricultural field worker, so this connection in agriculture cannot be verified directly. In any case, employers could have difficulties filling positions for a particular occupation even when a high unemployment rate exists.", "Rapidly rising hourly wages are also consistent with a labor shortage, and some hourly and piece-rate wage data are available for agricultural field workers from USDA and other sources. However, rising hourly wage rates may not always signify a labor shortage if, for example, workers are paid by piece rate, as is fairly common in the production of fruits, vegetables, and horticulture."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ample Supplies of Farm Labor Appear to Be Available in Most Areas", "paragraphs": ["Most farm labor experts, government officials, and grower and labor advocates we interviewed agreed with our conclusion that agricultural employers in most of the United States have had adequate supplies of labor for many years and continue to do so. Our analysis is based on (1) the large number of illegal immigrant farmworkers granted amnesty in the 1980s, (2) persistently high unemployment rates in key agricultural areas, (3) state and federal designations of agricultural areas as labor surplus areas, (4) stagnant or declining wage rates as adjusted for inflation, and (5) continued investments by growers in agricultural production.", "Farmworker amnesty provisions in IRCA resulted in the legalization of large numbers of foreign farmworkers, ensuring agricultural employers adequate supplies of farm labor during the mid-to late 1980s. Beginning in June, 1987, the Special Agricultural Worker (SAW) provisions of IRCA permitted foreign farmworkers with 90 or more days of qualifying work in agriculture to apply for legal status. The SAW program received nearly 1.3 million applications during its first 18 months of operation, over half of them in California alone, resulting in the legalization of a significant portion of the U.S. agricultural labor supply. Available data suggest that SAW workers have made up a significant, albeit declining, proportion of the U.S. agricultural labor market since the late 1980s, falling from 33 percent of all farmworkers in fiscal year 1989 to 19 percent in fiscal year 1995.", "Many agricultural areas have exhibited persistently high rates of unemployment over the last few years, suggesting that existing labor supplies were and continue to be more than adequate to meet agricultural employers\u2019 needs. Our analysis of recent annual and monthly unemployment rates of 20 agricultural counties\u2014those that contain large amounts of fruit, tree nut, and vegetable production in dollar value\u2014is consistent with this view. Of these 20 counties, 13 maintained annual double digit unemployment rates throughout 1994 through 1996. (For more detailed information, see table III.1.) As of June 1997, 11 counties exhibited monthly unemployment rates double the national average of 5.2 percent and 15 of the 20 counties displayed rates at least 2 percentage points higher than the national rate. Only two of the counties had unemployment rates below the June 1997 national average.", "State responses to changes mandated by the recently enacted federal welfare reform legislation also suggest that many agricultural areas may currently be experiencing farm labor surpluses rather than shortages. Section 6(o) of the Food Stamp Act, as added by section 824 of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, provides that an individual is ineligible for the program if during the preceding 36-month period, he or she received benefits for 3 months while not working or participating in a work program for at least 20 hours per week. However, in an effort not to penalize food stamp recipients who reside in areas with limited employment opportunities, the Secretary of Agriculture may waive these provisions for any group of individuals in a requesting state if the Secretary determines that the area in which the individual resides is essentially a labor surplus area\u2014has an unemployment rate of over 10 percent or does not have sufficient numbers of jobs to provide employment for the individuals. As of late July 1997, 42 states had applied for and received waivers from the Secretary of Agriculture for counties and other jurisdictions, including many agricultural areas. All of the 20 agricultural counties we analyzed received at least partial waivers from USDA, and 18 received waivers covering their entire counties. (For more detailed information, see table III.2.)", "Cities, counties, and other jurisdictions also can be designated annually by Labor\u2019s Employment Service as \u201clabor surplus areas.\u201d A labor surplus area must have an average unemployment rate at least 20 percent above the average national unemployment rate during the previous 2 calendar years or a rate of 10 percent or more during the previous 2 calendar years. Labor may also designate an area as surplus if it had unemployment rates of at least 7.1 percent for each of the 3 most recent months or projected unemployment of at least 7.1 percent for each of the next 12 months or has documentation that this has already occurred. Such designation confers preference in bidding on federal procurement contracts for firms that will locate contract work in those areas. As of August 1997, Labor had designated all of 13 and parts of 5 others of the 20 agricultural counties we analyzed as labor surplus areas. (See table III.2.)", "Some experts cite evidence that agricultural wage rates adjusted for inflation (real wage rates) have declined in recent years, a trend that is also more indicative of a labor surplus than a labor shortage. Our analysis of agricultural wage data shows declining real wage rates. Since the late 1980s, annual average hourly wages for agricultural workers have been flat or have declined in real terms (see table III.3), and real annual average hourly wage rates for piece workers fell. (See table III.4.) Declining or flat real wages also occurred as total employment in agriculture fell by 6 percent between 1986 and 1997 or, as shown in table III.5, 15.9 percent for total peak employment between 1987 and 1997, which also suggests the presence of farm labor surpluses rather than shortages.", "One expert also noted that growers appear to continue to be investing in new farm production that will not bring returns for a number of years, suggesting a long-term confidence that agricultural labor would be available. Consistent with this belief, between 1989 and 1995, the last year for which data were available, acreage for fruits and tree nuts, vegetables, and nurseries (the more labor-intensive agricultural commodities) has increased by over 30 percent, with the dollar value of production and total production tonnage also rising by 52 percent and 30 percent, respectively.

Both growers and labor advocates described current difficulties in obtaining workers and concerns about future difficulties in certain areas. For example, both growers and farm labor advocates agreed that it was increasingly difficult to get domestic labor to work in some kinds of tobacco harvesting, although they disagreed on the cause of this development. Similarly, regional Labor officials suggested that it was likely that the geographic inaccessibility of some particularly remote agricultural areas such as in Nevada contribute to a longtime difficulty that they believed growers in those areas have had in obtaining domestic workers. Some growers, grower advocates, and USDA officials also expressed concern that the large number of workers not authorized to work left themselves or agricultural employers in their areas vulnerable to INS enforcement actions that could prove financially devastating to farm operations.", "Opinions differ regarding solutions to localized labor shortages. Farm labor advocates and some government officials said that the supply of domestic labor is generally sufficient to meet the needs of U.S. agriculture. For example, some of them suggested that the implementation of the work requirements of the recent welfare reform legislation could serve as a potential source of labor for agricultural employers in some areas of the country. In other areas, they believed, many workers with farm labor experience could be drawn back to agricultural employment with fairly modest wage increases that would have little effect on consumer prices or U.S. agricultural competitiveness. Some employers we interviewed, however, stated that it is unlikely that many former welfare recipients would have the ability to be suitable farmworkers, particularly single mothers with young children requiring day care. Transportation from urban population centers to rural worksites was also cited as an impediment.

To have enough personnel to conduct an operation, INS must often secure the assistance of other law enforcement agencies.

Most agricultural worksites are located in rural areas, often at great distances from the field offices of the enforcement agencies, making the logistics of agricultural enforcement more time-consuming and costly than those conducted at more urban nonagricultural worksites. In one district, agents said that they were discouraged by agency management from pursuing worksite enforcement investigations that would involve travel costs and were instead encouraged to pursue cases in the local metropolitan area.", "INS officers face a judicial requirement that can also complicate enforcement efforts at agricultural workplaces. Current law requires INS officers to have either the employer\u2019s permission or a search warrant before entering a farm or other outdoor agricultural operation to interrogate a person about his or her right to be in the United States.

In response to this directive, INS established the Employment Verification Pilot (EVP), a voluntary test program that allows participating employers to verify electronically the employment eligibility of newly hired noncitizen workers. Currently, over 1,000 employers nationwide participate in EVP. Although well received by participating employers, the limitation of EVP to noncitizen workers, rather than all workers, leaves open a door to fraud by unauthorized employees who claim falsely to be U.S. citizens on the Employment Eligibility Verification form (Form I-9). The next generation of verification pilot programs attempts to close this door by verifying all new hires. In August 1997, INS and the Social Security Administration (SSA) began the Joint Employment Verification Pilot (JEVP) program among a small group of employers in the Chicago area. JEVP involves an initial verification inquiry to SSA regarding all newly hired employees with, if necessary, a referral to INS for additional verification. The JEVP approach is also being used in the Basic Pilot currently being implemented by INS and SSA in the five states with the highest estimated population of unauthorized aliens (California, Texas, New York, Florida, and Illinois).

Such a card would permit quicker and more accurate identification of job applicants and employees who are unauthorized to work.

SSA recently issued Report to Congress on Options for Enhancing the Social Security Card (SSA Pub.

While several H-2A employers told us that positive recruitment was a waste of time and money because no domestic workers were willing to accept the work, non-H-2A employers joined others in asking why one agricultural employer would be unable to find a single domestic worker, while a neighboring employer could find all he or she needed.", "Federal and state Labor officials expressed concern that the increasing role of agricultural employer associations in accessing the H-2A program for individual employers may pose problems for positive recruitment. The number of workers requested by associations has grown from 4,800 in 1994 to 12,300 in 1997, over 55 percent of the 21,701 workers requested, and the number of associations that filed applications has grown from 7 to 9. In filing an H-2A application, an association may file in one of three ways: as an agent, a sole employer, or a joint employer. In a joint employer relationship, ETA grants the certification to both the association and its specified employer members, and the association assumes the liabilities and obligations of an employer. Associations make it easier for smaller employers to access the H-2A program in that they normally prepare and file the appropriate Labor and INS forms covering individual employers, advertise for domestic workers, and, in some cases, recruit the foreign H-2A workers. Such a relationship also increases flexibility in that associations are allowed to transfer workers among individual growers as the workload dictates. However, officials in both federal and state agencies told us that when associations represent employers from a large geographic area (for example, an entire state), domestic workers may be less likely to accept job offers for H-2A openings and, if hired, exhibit high turnover.", "Several explanations have been suggested for the failure of those who are referred to the association to accept or stay at work. One possible reason is that the job description may not accurately reflect the actual work involved, and the worker is unable or unwilling to perform the work required. Another reason may be that, unlike most individual agricultural employers, a joint employer association may offer jobs at a worksite far from the worker\u2019s home, and the worker may be unable to accept the job because of the need for transportation and housing. Although current law requires that employers provide transportation and housing for workers recruited through the Interstate Clearance System, the law does not require that these be provided for locally recruited workers unless they are not reasonably able to return to their residence within the same day. Labor generally considers a reasonable commute to be as much as 60 miles, which may be difficult for those domestic farmworkers who do not own cars. Employers using workers recruited by associations can cover a large geographic area, such as an entire state. Labor\u2019s Office of Inspector General has undertaken a review of H-2A positive recruitment provisions and expects to issue a report in the spring of 1998.", "Although explanations for the lack of success of positive recruitment with associations are largely anecdotal rather than empirical, our analysis did confirm that a significant number of domestic workers refused work. Of the 220 domestic workers who applied to one major H-2A employer in 1996, almost 70 percent refused employment or did not show up for work. This employer was an association that filed \u201cmaster job orders\u201d with ETA, allowing it to place workers all over a large state. SESA officials in one state told us that they had recently obtained commitments from associations to place domestically recruited workers at worksites close to their homes. However, it is unclear how such commitments will be monitored and enforced."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Multiple Factors Make the Three-Quarter Guarantee Hard to Enforce", "paragraphs": ["Under the H-2A program\u2019s three-quarter wage guarantee, an employer must offer each worker employment for at least three-fourths of the workdays in the work contract period, including any extensions. If the employer provides less employment, the employer must pay the amount the worker would have earned had the worker been employed the guaranteed number of days. This provision is intended to ensure that domestic and foreign farmworkers who are recruited and often travel from distant locations to work in the United States do not actually end up earning substantially less than they were led to believe they would earn through the initial job offer, and to encourage H-2A employers to accurately estimate both their labor force needs and the duration of employment they can offer so as to limit their potential wage liabilities. Hence, employers will make honest assessments of both the number of workers needed and the amount of time that they will be employed, and prospective workers will have some guarantee about the total wages and duration of employment to expect.", "It is difficult to determine the extent to which the three-quarter guarantee is being complied with or violated. Agency officials and worker advocates report that H-2A workers are unlikely to complain about worker protection violations, including the three-quarter guarantee, because they fear that they will lose their jobs or will not be accepted by the employer or association for future employment. H-2A workers we spoke with raised this concern. For example, in 1997, ranchers employing sheepherders failed to pay them the proper wages under the three-quarter guarantee, but no complaint had been filed with WHD. WHD only became aware of the situation when one of the sheepherders was assaulted and a local newspaper publicized the attack. The employers admitted that they failed to pay the appropriate wages to their sheepherder employees. In another example, Employment Standards Administration (ESA) officials told us they were aware that some employers may have brought in Jamaican H-2A workers without paying them wages in compliance with the three-quarter guarantee, but said they were too understaffed to investigate the matter. According to an ESA official, in fiscal year 1996, the agency received no complaints from workers employed by H-2A employers. ESA data from that year showed that most investigations\u201493 percent\u2014were targeted by ESA or triggered by complaints from SESAs; only 7 percent were triggered by complaints from third parties, such as Legal Services.", "The three-quarter guarantee is particularly difficult to enforce because the provision is only applicable at the end of the contract period. Because H-2A workers must leave the country within 10 days of the end of the contract, there is only a small window of opportunity to interview the workers in the United States. Regional and district WHD officials said they could not monitor the application of the three-quarter guarantee effectively because they cannot interview workers after they return to Mexico to confirm their work hours and earnings. Similarly, it is hard to prove retaliation against workers who complain about such violations because there is no way to obtain and corroborate information.", "These enforcement difficulties also create an incentive for less scrupulous employers to request contract periods longer than necessary: if workers leave the worksite before the contract period ends, the employer is not obligated to pay the three-quarter guarantee or their transportation home. If this occurs, however, it is almost impossible to determine if these workers have left the country or are taking jobs from domestic workers. Data from a major employer showed that almost 40 percent of their H-2A workers (1,763 workers) left prior to the end of the contract, losing their right to both the three-quarters guarantee and transportation home. This development raises concerns about whether the employer accurately estimated the ending date of need. Discussions with H-2A program officials suggest that, at least with associations, contract periods have been lengthening in duration in recent years. More importantly, the three-quarter guarantee does not provide incentives for the employer to ensure that the workers stay through the end of the contract period."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "H-2A Workers Do Not Receive Same Guarantee for Wages Provided to Domestic Workers", "paragraphs": ["Migrant and seasonal farmworker regulations provide a guarantee of first-week wages for domestic workers recruited through the Interstate Clearance System.

The H-2A program\u2019s equivalent treatment provision, sometimes referred to as \u201cdisparate\u201d treatment, requires that the employer provide the same minimum wages, benefits, and working conditions to H-2A workers that are provided to domestic workers employed in \u201ccorresponding employment.\u201d However, officials at the state and federal levels do not apply this provision to foreign workers, even though they joined worker advocates in expressing concern about the community impact when foreign workers arrived in their areas without work or money to support themselves.

WHD has authority and responsibility for conducting investigations and inspections regarding matters such as the payment of required wages, transportation, and housing; reporting violations to ETA; and invoking penalties, such as recovery of unpaid wages, assessment of civil monetary penalties, and seeking injunctive relief against the employer. ETA officials told us that they try to coordinate with WHD but that they have never denied certification for labor law violations, although they typically use the authority as leverage in obtaining voluntary compliance.

However, officials from the federal agencies all agreed that any massive (for example, a 10-fold increase to 150,000 per year), sustained national increase in the demand for agricultural guestworkers could not be effectively processed without additional resources. Labor and State officials also emphasized that the additional staff necessary to process large, sustained workload increases would have to be added over the course of a year, given the need to train and relocate personnel. In contrast, SESA officials stated that, in general, additional resources would not be required because the steps that they take to recruit workers are not significantly more resource intensive to meet the demands from a few employers as for many.", "Discussions with officials at State, Labor, and USDA noted that the administration is aware of the potential problems facing agricultural employers and the processing agencies if the H-2A program was faced with a major, sustained workload increase. Officials from Labor, INS, USDA, and State have met in the administration\u2019s Domestic Policy Council to discuss the potential for significant increases in the demand for H-2A guestworkers to occur and to develop an appropriate response, if necessary.

Although a large percentage of farmworkers are not legally authorized to work in the United States, INS\u2019 current enforcement efforts are unlikely to cause a major disruption in U.S. agricultural production or generate a major increase in the demand for H-2A workers. The H-2A program currently provides guestworkers for the small percentage of agricultural employers who request them on either a regular or emergency basis. Labor and INS deny or disapprove applications from few agricultural employers, State denies visas to few prospective guestworkers, and INS detains few of these workers at the border. However, the potential for localized labor shortages for a specific crop or on a geographic basis remains.", "Although it successfully provides workers to employers who request them, the H-2A program requires employers to interact with multiple agencies at different levels of government, a process that can seem very confusing and difficult to navigate. No centralized source of information exists that clearly explains the entire H-2A application and labor procurement process. Labor\u2019s handbook gives information about provisions that are no longer applicable, is not user-friendly, and includes little information about the processes at INS and State.", "This perspective also extends to Labor\u2019s oversight of the program. Labor currently collects limited data to facilitate oversight of the program\u2019s day-to-day operations. Labor was generally unable to determine the extent to which its regional offices were in compliance with statutory and regulatory deadlines governing the H-2A program. Our review, however, found significant noncompliance with these mandated deadlines.", "Our work suggests that some procedural changes could improve the program\u2019s ability to meet the needs of agricultural employers. Processing times under the current program are unnecessarily extended as a result of the requirement that INS approve all non-Caribbean Labor certifications before transmitting the request for workers to the State Department. Because H-2A visa petitions are unlike those in any other category in that they rarely identify individual workers, INS is in the position of merely \u201crubber stamping\u201d the work of others, burdening the employer with unnecessary paperwork and fees and adding as much as 2 to 3 weeks to the entire H-2A application process. Delegating INS\u2019 role of authorizing approval of H-2A visa petitions to Labor could reduce the bureaucratic maze of rules and paperwork that agricultural employers now face. This transfer would need to be accompanied by revisions in regulations, such as accommodating visa extensions where no new Labor certification is required and ensuring that appeals procedures are changed to ensure employers\u2019 right to due process.", "Such a transfer could also significantly reduce total application processing time. Many agricultural employers have reported that the current requirement of filing an application at least 60 days before the date of need is difficult given the uncertainties inherent in agricultural production. A shorter period could eliminate some of this uncertainty. Delegating INS\u2019 approval role in the H-2A program could reduce total application processing times by 2 weeks. This would permit Labor to modify to 45 days the existing administrative requirement that applications be submitted at least 60 days before the date of need. However, to ensure that agricultural employers have sufficient time to positively recruit for domestic workers, obtain inspections of farmworker housing, and show proof of workers\u2019 compensation coverage, it will also be necessary for the Congress to modify to 7 days the statutory requirement that applications be approved 20 days before the date of need. Without modifying this requirement, employers will not have sufficient time to meet their duties as required by the program and domestic workers will not have ample opportunity to compete for agricultural employment.", "Obtaining workers through the current H-2A program requires agricultural employers to interact with multiple agencies at different levels of government. Given the often time-critical needs of agricultural employers, the multiplicity of agencies can seem confusing and seem difficult to access. Current written information that Labor provides to prospective employers is incomplete, hard to understand, and in some instances, outdated. These weaknesses contribute to a general perception that the program is too complex to be accessed by employers who may require its services.", "We also identified several weaknesses regarding the protections afforded to both domestic and foreign workers. In general, Labor\u2019s WHD is the primary agency for the enforcement of existing H-2A contracts and other labor standard provisions, while ETA administers the H-2A program, working with state job services and agricultural employers to facilitate the application process. However, under current law, ETA exercises Labor\u2019s authority to suspend an employer\u2019s participation in the H-2A program if this employer has committed a serious labor standard or contract violation and WHD, when conducting an enforcement action, must request that ETA consider using this authority. Given the overall separation of program functions between WHD and ETA, the fact that suspension authority resides with ETA seems incongruent. We believe, and Labor officials agreed, that consolidating this suspension authority in WHD would permit ETA to concentrate more effectively on the H-2A program\u2019s crucial administrative duties and possibly increase the effectiveness of WHD enforcement.", "We found another weakness in the equivalent treatment provision of the H-2A program, commonly referred to as the \u201cdisparate\u201d treatment provision. This provision generally requires that the employer provide equal treatment to domestic and foreign workers in terms of opportunities, wages, benefits, and working conditions. For example, if an employer hires H-2A workers at a particular wage, that wage is the minimum that must be paid to any domestic workers performing the same work for that employer. However, we found that while current Labor regulations guarantee wages for the first week of work to domestic workers who are referred to agricultural employers through the Interstate Clearance System of Labor\u2019s Employment Service, even if they are unable to work during that period, comparable wage protection is not afforded to foreign workers. This disparity appears inconsistent with Labor\u2019s general application of the H-2A equivalent treatment provision and could cause needless personal hardship for some foreign workers.", "Our review also raised concerns about other existing protections afforded to workers under the H-2A program. Current program provisions requiring that H-2A workers receive wages at least equal to three-quarters of the contract period were implemented to protect foreign workers from exploitation and provide some certainty to both workers and employers so that workers will know how much work to expect, and employers can limit their potential wage liabilities. On one hand, the few complaints registered about this provision suggest compliance. But some H-2A workers may be unaware of their rights or how to exercise them in the United States. Furthermore, our findings concerning the increasing length in the average contract period for H-2A workers and indications that a significant number of H-2A workers may be separating from employment before the end of the contract period, invalidating the guarantee, also suggests that this protection may not always work as intended and that some employers could \u201cgame\u201d the system to avoid paying wages and transportation they owe to H-2A workers.", "One solution to this vulnerability is to apply the three-quarter guarantee incrementally to shorter periods of time throughout the duration of the contract. For example, requiring that workers receive either three-quarters of the full-time wage rate or the wages for the actual hours worked, whichever is larger, payable at the end of every 2 or 3 weeks, could provide additional protection for H-2A workers. However, the length of the pay increment should consider that the contract period does not always correspond with the period of time the H-2A worker spends at one worksite. Some large associations move workers from one worksite to another during the same contract, and the workers receive wages from different employers. It is important that any modification of the three-quarter guarantee be implemented in a manner that protects workers but also avoids increasing the administrative complexity of the program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To simplify the H-2A application process and reduce the cost and burden on agricultural employers, we recommend that the Attorney General delegate authority for approval of H-2A visa petitions from INS to the Secretary of Labor or designee and revise corresponding regulations as necessary to implement and facilitate such an agreement, including revising visa extension and appeals procedures.", "If the Attorney General delegates this authority, we recommend that a combination of two other actions be taken.", "After the Attorney General has delegated INS\u2019 role in petition approval to Labor, to reduce total application processing time and facilitate better accuracy in estimating the date workers will be needed, we recommend that the Secretary of Labor amend the regulations to allow H-2A applications to be submitted up to 45, rather than 60, days before the date of need so long as INS does not have a role in the petition approval process.", "To protect work opportunities for domestic workers by ensuring that sufficient time is available for agricultural employers to positively recruit them while reducing the total processing time, we recommend that the Congress amend the Immigration and Nationality Act so that, as long as the authority for approval of H-2A visa petitions remains with Labor, Labor is required to complete all applications at least 7 days before the date of need, rather than 20 days.", "To better protect both domestic and H-2A workers, we recommend that the Secretary of Labor take the following actions:", "Extend the authority to suspend employers with serious labor standard or H-2A contract violations to WHD,", "Revise its regulations to require agricultural employers to guarantee H-2A workers\u2019 wages for the first week after the date of need and to pay workers those wages no later than 7 days after the date of need, and", "Revise regulations regarding the three-quarter guarantee to remove incentives to overestimate the contract period.

Labor disagreed with the assertions of some of those we interviewed that welfare recipients were unlikely to provide a source of farm labor. In particular, the Department stated that the problems, such as child care, that employers and former welfare recipients will confront as they seek employment in farm occupations are little different from the challenges facing employers and recipients in other industries and occupations. Furthermore, Labor rejected the notion that few recipients are located in or near many rural areas, contending that at least some rural areas have very large welfare populations that could serve as potentially significant sources of labor in close proximity to many agricultural establishments.", "Although Labor believes that the three-quarter guarantee generally serves its intended purpose, Labor agreed that the structure of the three-quarter guarantee could result in employers\u2019 overestimating the contract period in the expectation that less work and lower earnings toward the end of the contract period will encourage workers to \u201cabandon\u201d employment and thereby relieve the employer of the obligations of the three-quarter guarantee and return transportation reimbursement. Labor agreed to evaluate possible solutions to this problem but believed that, given fluctuations in the amount of work required during a growing season, applying the guarantee on an incremental basis may not be the most appropriate solution. In response to Labor\u2019s comments, we amended the recommendation to say that regulations should be revised to apply the three-quarter guarantee to remove incentives to overestimate the contract period.

Consistent with the notion that qualified domestic farmworkers may not now be available, USDA questioned our use of county unemployment rates as an indicator of labor market conditions and noted that our data on the unemployment rates of farmworkers failed to account for regional mismatches in farm labor supply and demand. USDA also provided information that it believes suggests that sufficient numbers of qualified workers are not available for agricultural employers, including 1987 data on characteristics of the national farm labor supply, and excerpts from a 1988 GAO report that analyzed labor market conditions for tobacco growers in selected counties in Virginia and North Carolina.", "Information provided by USDA does not alter our assessment that the overwhelming weight of the evidence indicates that widespread farm labor shortages do not exist now and are unlikely to occur in the near future. USDA\u2019s rejection of consideration of annual and monthly unemployment rates as an indicator of labor market conditions contradicts the position of the Department during our review, when it concurred with our use of such data. Moreover, USDA relies on such data in determining whether various jurisdictions, including agricultural areas, are essentially labor-surplus areas and thus should receive waivers of the work requirement for food stamp eligibility.", "Furthermore, our analysis of national and county unemployment rates was only one piece of evidence we analyzed to assess the condition of agricultural labor markets throughout the nation. We also reviewed changes in real wage rates, investment patterns by agricultural employers, and federal and state agency assessments of labor market conditions in agricultural areas. In addition, we made a serious effort to present the analytical difficulties of the concept of a labor market shortage and weaknesses associated with the evidence presented.", "We also note that, although in this report we included only the annual unemployment rate for 20 major agricultural counties, we also reviewed monthly unemployment rates from January 1994 through June 1997 for these counties. As we reported, 15 of these counties had unemployment rates above 7 percent for every month during this entire period, even during peak periods of agricultural activity. Many of these counties, for example, Yuma, Arizona, and Yakima, Washington, had rates far in excess of 7 percent for every month during the period. On the basis of this analysis, we believe that it is plausible to conclude that such agricultural areas, which have high unemployment even during peak periods of agricultural activity, do not have labor shortages. This conclusion is also consistent with the anecdotal information we received from our interviews with agricultural employers around the country, who, while expressing concern about the availability of labor in the future, had not yet experienced a labor shortage.", "USDA also presented data from 1987 suggesting that a considerable proportion of the agricultural labor force is casual, for example, housewives and students, who presumably do not have a strong attachment to the labor force. Although these may be the latest data available, they are over 10 years old, before the legalization of over 1.3 million SAW workers and the full implementation of the H-2A program as specified in IRCA. It is unclear what percentage of the current agricultural labor force is composed of such groups. Furthermore, casual workers like students and housewives would not contribute to the seasonal fluctuation in the unemployment rates of agricultural areas, since presumably many return to school or other activities in the off-season and thus do not actively seek work at that time.", "These data are also relevant to the issue that USDA raises concerning the number of qualified workers in the agricultural labor force. Although it is clear that a substantial portion of the agricultural labor force is not legally authorized to work in this country, we were unable to determine the distribution of such workers throughout the country. We were also unable to assess the distribution of other sources of domestic workers, such as welfare recipients and unemployed or underemployed farmworkers who may have the skills for agricultural employment. USDA\u2019s identification of students and housewives represents another pool of potentially qualified labor that could be tapped by agricultural employers. Given the limited effect of INS enforcement operations, it is most likely that the number of workers not legally authorized to work in this country will change slowly in many parts of the country. The pace of change will potentially permit agricultural employers and federal and state authorities to substitute other domestic labor where available, if they pursue this option, or, where necessary, to use the H-2A program.", "As additional evidence concerning the ability of agricultural employers to recruit qualified domestic farmworkers, USDA also cited our 1988 report, which included an analysis of the agricultural labor market supply in the production of tobacco in selected counties in Virginia and North Carolina. The qualitative information from the targeted case study analysis of selected tobacco-growing counties in two states complements the extensive quantitative data in this report. In this report, we discuss the potential for localized labor shortages in specific crops under current labor market conditions and, consistent with our earlier work, cite difficulties agricultural employers may have now in obtaining domestic tobacco workers in North Carolina. We also note that tobacco producers in Virginia and North Carolina, the crop and geographic area we focused on in our 1988 report, are now significant participants in the H-2A program. Our finding that certain H-2A program requirements, including the positive recruitment requirement, do not appear to be accomplishing their intended purpose echoes our 1988 study, in which we concluded that \u201cthere were shortcomings in the protections of U.S. workers in the recruitment process.\u201d That report also made recommendations to the Labor Department on how to enhance the effectiveness of this requirement.", "We believe that it is inappropriate to use our 1988 limited case study analysis to generalize about the current availability of sufficient supplies of qualified farm labor on a national level. Major events that can influence the availability of farm labor, including the full integration of 1.3 million SAW workers, welfare reform, and the mechanization of the Florida sugarcane industry, have transpired since that time.

However, USDA points to the impact INS efforts can have on individual agricultural employers, a point we also make in the report. While we agree that INS enforcement efforts may have an impact on individual agricultural employers, there is no evidence that it will cause a widespread farm labor shortage. USDA discusses INS enforcement activity directed at employers and at \u201cconducting roadblocks, sweeps of shopping centers . . . and other places they [INS] expect aliens to be found,\u201d but this activity is not new and is limited in scope. As discussed in chapter 2, such INS enforcement activity is included in the responsibilities of the 304 staff years devoted to noncriminal investigations, or an average of about 6 INS staff years per state.", "While USDA cites the efforts of INS\u2019 Border Patrol to \u201cseal the border,\u201d the extent to which these efforts have reduced the availability of illegally authorized workers is unclear. As we recently reported, INS intelligence reports and other available data do not indicate whether the increased difficulty of entry in the areas of highest known illegal activity on the southwest border of the United States has deterred the flow of illegal workers into the country. Apprehension statistics are INS\u2019 primary quantitative indicator of the results of INS\u2019 strategy to deter illegal entry along the southwest border. Apprehension data, standing alone, however, have limited value for determining how many aliens have crossed the border illegally. Data were unavailable, for example, on whether there has been a decrease in attempted reentries by those who have previously been apprehended. For a more detailed description on the difficulties in accurately measuring the total number of illegal aliens in the United States and in estimating how many illegal aliens come into this country each year, see Illegal Immigration: Southwest Border Strategy Results Inconclusive; More Evaluation Needed (GAO/GGD-98-21, Dec. 11, 1997). USDA also cites Labor\u2019s enforcement activities as potentially reducing the Labor supply. INS, and not Labor, has responsibility for identifying workers not legally authorized to work. Labor\u2019s enforcement responsibility is limited to ensuring that employers have collected documents relating to authorization to work; Labor does not verify the authenticity of the documents collected.", "USDA stated that \u201cINS often determines, through procedures not available to employers, that 75 percent or more of an employer\u2019s work force submitted fraudulent documents.\u201d We agree that while it is possible that INS has determined that 75 percent or more of an employer\u2019s workforce submitted fraudulent documents, INS cannot provide information on the frequency with which this occurs. INS does not collect data on the percentage of an employer\u2019s workforce in all industries or in specific industries, such as agriculture, found to have fraudulent documents. INS officials stated that the percentage of such workers varies greatly from one employer to another. For example, information INS provided in response to our requests for information about specific individual enforcement efforts showed one employer with only 1 percent of workers with fraudulent documentation and another with 50 percent. \u201cWorkers who claim to be U.S. citizens and possess fraudulent documents are liable to be detected by the Social Security Administration (SSA). SSA requires employers to verify through its Enumeration Verification System the names and social security numbers that do not agree with SSA records (if the Wage and Tax statements filed by the employer has an error rate that exceeds ten percent.)\u201d", "Instead, SSA officials stated that while employers are encouraged to use the Enumeration Verification System, they are not required to do so. When the name and Social Security number do not agree, SSA places the record in the Earnings Suspense File. It sends a letter to the employee at the address that is on the W-2 form and asks the employee for a correction. SSA only contacts the employer if the address is incomplete or missing. SSA has a task force examining ways to better use the Suspense File, including the possibility of requiring employer use of the Enumeration Verification System."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USDA Questioned INS Visa Petition Approval Only After Labor Certification", "paragraphs": ["USDA questioned our finding that Justice authorizes the State Department to issue nonimmigrant visas for H-2A workers only after the Department of Labor issues a labor certification, with reference to the statutory requirement that the certification be applied for, but not specifically obtained, before INS petition approval. In response to this concern, INS stated that \u201cthe INS will NEVER approve a new H-2A petition unless the petition is accompanied by a labor certification issued by the U.S. Department of Labor.

USDA said that \u201che Department of Labor rejects late-filed applications.\u201d We agree with USDA that it would be inappropriate to characterize emergency applications filed fewer than 60 days prior to date of need as \u201clate.\u201d However, our review of H-2A applications in one regional office that processes a large number of H-2A applications confirmed Labor officials\u2019 statements that emergency applications represent only a small fraction of all applications. In fact, data for the period October 1, 1996, through June 30, 1997, the only period for which these data were collected in this region, identified fewer than 15 percent of the applications filed within the 60-day period as \u201cemergency.\u201d", "Furthermore, Labor does not reject nonemergency applications because they were filed with fewer than 60 days remaining. Our analysis showed that for the period October 1, 1995, through June 30, 1997, Labor approved 99 percent of all such applications, the same percentage approved for applications filed within the statutory deadline. In addition, despite having fewer than 60 days, Labor issued certifications for 76 percent of these applications at, or before, the date of need.", "We agreed with USDA that an agricultural employer who experiences an unexpected labor shortage as a result of INS enforcement activity would be eligible for an emergency certification.

USDA asserted that \u201cthere is significant incentive for the employee to stay and collect 3/4 wages without working, receive the return transportation, and maintain eligibility to return to the job the following season.\u201d However, USDA also quoted the manager of a major H-2A association as saying that 1,598 of 4,573 (more than one-third) of the association\u2019s H-2A workers chose not to complete the contract period. In addition, USDA uses the case of a sheepherder who \u201chad not received regular wages when due\u201d to refute our assessment of the difficulty in enforcing the three-quarter guarantee provision. However, in citing this case, USDA stated that \u201c subsequently worked for a series of H-2A employers and it may be that his total employment did not meet the 3/4 guarantee. The unresolved dispute is which of the series of employers owe a 3/4 guarantee and how is the liability to be apportioned between them.\u201d The situation USDA describes is one of the difficulties inherent in enforcing the three-quarter guarantee, raising concerns about the application of the provision to H-2A workers who are brought into the country through associations that may move the worker from one employer to another during the course of the contract.", "In response to anecdotal information USDA included in its response to our draft report, we conducted limited follow-up interviews, including interviewing the employer, employer\u2019s agent, and Labor officials involved in an H-2A application from Arkansas. While the individuals interviewed disagreed on some of the facts of the case, the interviews served to confirm our concern about the extent to which H-2A contract periods were accurately estimated. Specifically, the grower told us that the workers were only needed through the middle of August while the job order and H-2A application identified the expected period of employment to last until December 31. Furthermore, our discussions with the ETA certification official raised concerns about requirements for positive recruitment under emergency applications."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USDA Commented on Recommendations Regarding Changing Application Processing Deadlines", "paragraphs": ["USDA officials agreed that the 60-day time requirement for filing H-2A labor certification applications is problematic in that it is difficult for employers to precisely estimate their date of need 60 days in advance and that it may limit the success of recruiting domestic workers who are currently employed. USDA also agreed with our conclusion that INS\u2019 role in the petition process is unnecessarily burdensome and supported our recommendation that the H-2A application process be reduced from 60 to 45 days. However, USDA objected to our recommendation to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act so that, as long as the authority for approval of H-2A visa petitions remains with Labor, Labor would be required to complete all applications at least 7 days before the date of need, rather than 20 days. We recommend that the total H-2A application process be reduced to 45 days in combination with reducing the certification requirement to 7 days to maintain the period of time Labor has to certify the labor shortage. This maintains the existing period of time available for recruitment of domestic workers. We disagree with USDA\u2019s statement that \u201cthe certification date has no bearing on the opportunities for domestic workers because positive recruitment is required both before and after certification.\u201d Under current regulations, employers must provide evidence that they have complied with the positive recruitment requirements set forth in Labor\u2019s acceptance of the H-2A application. Labor reduces the number of H-2A openings certified on the basis of information the employer provides on the results of positive recruitment efforts, adjusted for estimates of the number of workers who will not report for work. Positive recruitment efforts after the certification have no bearing on the number of H-2A openings approved.", "USDA expressed concern that the remaining 7 days do not allow enough time for H-2A workers to obtain visas and travel to the worksite. Our recommendation does not reduce the time allowed for this step in the process. Under current law, workers cannot obtain visas until employers have processed visa petitions through INS within the 20 days allowed. As we reported, estimates of the time required to process petitions through INS can reduce the remaining time to fewer than 7 days."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
