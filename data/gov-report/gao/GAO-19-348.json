These policies and procedures\u2014known as \u201cChild Find\u201d\u2014are generally implemented by local school districts (see fig.). IDEA gives states some latitude in setting eligibility criteria and defining disability categories. In addition, states may determine their own processes for identifying and evaluating children. As a result, a child eligible for services in one state might be ineligible in another. According to advocates, special education subject matter specialists, and state and local officials GAO interviewed, a number of challenges related to correctly identifying and evaluating children suspected of having a disability can affect eligibility decisions. For example, school district officials in all four states GAO visited cited challenges in properly identifying and evaluating English Learner students, as districts do not always have staff who are conversant in a child's first language and skilled in distinguishing language proficiency from disabilities.", "The Department of Education (Education) monitors and supports Child Find efforts primarily by reviewing states' annual performance data and providing professional development and technical assistance.

For  instance, a 2016 series of investigative reports by the Houston Chronicle  alleged the systematic delay or denial of special education services for  children with disabilities in Texas. The series alleged that, to reduce  costs, the Texas Education Agency (TEA) set an 8.5 percent cap on the  percent of students who could receive special education services, and  intensified monitoring of school districts that exceeded that level.  Education monitored TEA and found, among other things, that some  school districts took steps designed to keep the percentage of children  receiving special education services at or below the 8.5 percent cap.  Education also found that TEA did not ensure that some school districts in  the state properly performed their Child Find responsibilities. Similarly, in  2016, the Connecticut State Department of Education found that a local  school district was not properly identifying children in need of special  education services.

States that choose to  provide services to at-risk children may use IDEA risk factors to  determine eligibility, such as low birth weight or history of abuse and  neglect, or they may develop their own list of risk factors. For  example, Massachusetts developed its own at-risk criterion for  eligibility, which requires the presence of four or more defined child  and family factors, including biological, medical, and trauma-related  factors. As of 2018, seven states or territories were serving at-risk  infants and toddlers, according to an Education official.", "Early Intervention process. The processes states use to deliver Part  C Early Intervention programs can vary in a number of ways. First, the  types of agencies designated as the Part C Lead Agency vary from  state to state; these lead agencies are responsible for administering  and monitoring Early Intervention programs in their states. For  example, Iowa\u2019s State Educational Agency (SEA) administers both its  Parts C and B programs; Massachusetts and New York administer  their Parts C and B programs through separate agencies; and,  Colorado shares these responsibilities between two agencies.  Second, the extent to which lead agencies directly provide Early  Intervention programs, including locating and evaluating children, or  do so through contractors varies. For example, both Colorado and  Iowa administer their Early Intervention programs directly, while  Massachusetts and New York contract with private entities to do so. In  Massachusetts, early childhood officials said that they contract with 31  different vendors that operate 60 Early Intervention programs  throughout the state. In addition to providing Early Intervention  services, these programs are responsible for locating and evaluating  children, according to the early intervention officials. Those officials  also said that each of these individual programs have unique  relationships with referral sources, which can affect the likelihood that  the sources will make referrals to a given program. Regardless of the  type of entity responsible for Early Intervention programs, having  strong relationships with referral sources is important, according to  early childhood officials in all four of the states we visited.  Otherwise, according to these officials, some children who are likely to  be eligible for Early Intervention services may not be identified or  evaluated for needed services.", "In Colorado, where Early Intervention responsibilities are shared  between the Part C lead agency and the SEA, state officials said that  this arrangement can make it difficult to ensure a seamless process  and can cause delays between evaluation and services. They said  that this can result in incorrect identification or services because they  do not have control over the evaluations\u2014responsibility for  evaluations is assigned to the Part B agency. Part C officials also said  this can cause confusion for families as they are moved between  agencies. Relatedly, some infants and toddlers may not be identified  for Early Intervention services because of the challenges of sharing  data between state agencies when more than one agency is  responsible for providing special education to children. In three of the  four selected states we visited, responsibility for special education  services for children was shared by more than one agency and  officials in all three states told us that difficulties in sharing Early  Intervention program data could hamper efforts to identify potentially  eligible children for special education services. Officials in one of the  states said that sharing data could allow them to identify children  being provided school-aged special education services that had not  received Early Intervention services. The officials said that if  commonalities were found among these children, it could help them  find similar children and ensure they receive Early Intervention  services in the future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "School-Age (IDEA Part B)", "paragraphs": ["Eligibility criteria. In practice, IDEA Part B\u2019s disability definitions  provide minimum standards that all states must meet. According to  Education officials, IDEA allows states the flexibility to adopt more  expansive definitions of disabilities than those provided in the IDEA  statute and regulation, provided that the state definition would not  exclude children who would be covered by the IDEA definition. For  example, in New York an intellectual disability is defined as  \u201csignificantly subaverage general intellectual functioning \u2026 that  adversely affects a student\u2019s educational performance,\u201d while in  Massachusetts an intellectual impairment is defined as occurring  when \u201cthe permanent capacity for performing cognitive tasks,  functions, or problem solving is significantly limited or impaired and is  exhibited by\u2026a slower rate of learning .\u201d Also,  states must establish their own eligibility criteria for determining the  presence of a Specific Learning Disability (SLD)\u2014a broad category of  disorders related to understanding and using language.

Officials in  one school district in New York said that, as part of their approach,  there was a concerted effort to use student data to make decisions  about intervention levels and special education evaluation decisions,  while a school district official in Massachusetts said that the district  had placed a greater emphasis on improving classroom instruction as  a means to reduce the need for special education services rather than  on intervention systems used for identifying and making decisions  about potentially eligible children.

Officials from these states cited various  reasons parents might withhold consent, such as opting to wait and see if  the child\u2019s problems are resolved over time. State early childhood officials  in Massachusetts also said that parents will sometimes refuse to provide  consent for evaluation due to a lack of awareness of Early Intervention  services or the Early Intervention process. To better address this, officials  said that they are working collaboratively with state early education and  care providers to inform parents about these issues. Massachusetts  officials stated that parents may mistrust government agencies or associate Early Intervention services or providers with child protective  services agencies and mistakenly think they are being investigated.", "Insufficient personnel with the right qualifications to conduct evaluations is  another reason infants and toddlers may not be consistently identified and  evaluated, particularly in certain types of locations. Officials from lead  agencies in Massachusetts, Colorado, New York, and regional education  officials in Iowa, noted that it was difficult to find enough Early  Intervention personnel with appropriate expertise in low population  density areas which can complicate the process of identifying and  evaluating children.

Regulations implementing  the 2004 amendments to the IDEA include a  provision mandating that states allow, as part  of their criteria for determining whether a child  has a Specific Learning Disability (SLD), the  use of a process based on the child\u2019s  response to scientific, research-based  intervention. See 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.307(a)(2).  RTI is a school-wide approach that attempts  to address the needs of all students, including  struggling learners and students with  disabilities, and integrates assessments and  interventions to maximize student  achievement. Key characteristics of RTI are:  (1) students receive high-quality research- based instruction in the general education  setting; (2) schools continually monitor and  document student performance; (3) schools  screen all students for academic and  behavioral problems; and (4) schools provide  multiple levels (tiers) of instruction that are  progressively more intense, based on the  student\u2019s response to instruction. Children  who do not respond to interventions are to be  referred for evaluation to determine eligibility  for special education and related services.", "School district officials in all of the states we visited and representatives  from various advocacy organizations said that there were challenges  related to implementing RTI. Representatives from advocacy  organizations in all four states we visited cited concerns with school RTI  practices that may delay student evaluations or contribute to incorrect  eligibility determinations. Advocates in Massachusetts told us that some  school districts are more likely than others to put students suspected of a  disability through the RTI process for extended periods of time before  evaluating them.

School district  officials we interviewed in all four states we visited described inherent  challenges in properly identifying and evaluating English Learner students  for special education disabilities. In Massachusetts and New York, school  district officials we interviewed explained that they do not always have  staff with the necessary expertise to perform evaluations in a child\u2019s first  language, which makes it more difficult to determine if a child\u2019s learning  difficulties are caused by a disability or by language proficiency issues.  State education officials in New York told us that they are concerned  about identification issues related to English Learner students, noting that  over 200 languages are spoken by their students and about 12 percent of  their students with disabilities were also English Learners in 2017-18.

For example, advocates we  interviewed in Massachusetts said that under identification can occur  when school districts do not communicate with parents in their home  language and, as a result, the parents do not understand how to engage  with the special education process. Advocates in both states told us that  over and under identification may also occur if the lack of language  proficiency is mistaken for a disability or if a disability is mistaken for  language learning issues.", "Education and the Department of Justice have issued guidance to assist  schools in meeting their obligations under federal law to ensure that  English Learner students who may be eligible for services under IDEA are  located, identified, and evaluated for special education services in a  timely manner.

Technical assistance offerings include training on data  collection and Early Intervention issues for various audiences such as  teachers, administrators, and special education service providers.  Officials in each of the states we visited said they had used Education\u2019s  technical assistance.

For example, Education issued a  memorandum in 2016 reminding states and districts that (1) RTI  processes cannot be used to delay or deny a timely evaluation of a child  suspected of having a disability and (2) implementation or completion of  RTI is not required prior to evaluating a student for special education  services. Officials in Colorado said they found this guidance helpful and  issued guidance to their school districts based on Education\u2019s  memorandum. Additionally, in 2007 and 2008 Education addressed  issues regarding Child Find requirements for certain groups of children,  such as those who are homeless or those who are residing in Immigration  and Customs Enforcement (ICE) residential facilities. Homeless  children, for example, are inherently difficult to identify and evaluate for  special education services because they and their families are highly  mobile. Education\u2019s guidance reminded states and school districts that  their Child Find obligations include these hard to find subgroups and  directed states to coordinate with emergency shelters and homeless  advocacy programs, among others, to help find children suspected of  having a disability.", "Education\u2019s website notes that each state is assigned a customer service  representative, a Part B contact, a Part C contact, and a team leader.  Education officials we spoke to told us that staff hold monthly check-in  meetings with state officials to provide information and discuss issues of  concern. They also said that issues needing clarification sometimes arise  during these check-in meetings. For example, they said that in a meeting  with state directors they identified a lack of clarity around some English  Learner issues. As a result, Education developed guidance to explain  Child Find obligations regarding English Learner students as well as other  obligations under IDEA. Education also has a customer service unit  available to assist states with questions about IDEA, special education,  and related services.", "State officials in all four states we visited told us they had good  relationships with Education IDEA monitoring staff and rely on them to  learn about available technical assistance and other resources.
