However, DOD's and CG's medical professionals do not incorporate medical screening questions specific to gambling disorder as they do for other similar medically determined addictive disorders, such as substance use. DOD officials stated they do not screen for gambling disorder because they focus on mental-health disorders that are high risk to overall readiness, high volume, and have validated measures for assessment. While gambling disorder is not a frequently diagnosed condition, the preoccupation with gambling, financial hardship, and increased risk of suicide can pose a risk to individual readiness.

Neither DOD's nor CG's guidance for substance-use disorders explicitly includes gambling disorder. DOD health officials stated that their substance-use instruction \u201cimplicitly\u201d covers gambling disorder; however, it refers only to problematic substance use. The Coast Guard has three documents that provide guidance and policy to both medical and nonmedical personnel on substance abuse, but these documents do not specifically discuss gambling disorder as an addiction.

The Military  Health System is a complex organization that provides health services to  almost 10 million DOD and Coast Guard servicemembers and their  dependents across a range of care venues, including the battlefield,  traditional hospitals and clinics at stationary locations, and authorized  civilian providers. The Military Health System employs more than 150,000  military, civilian, and contract personnel working in military treatment  facilities. In the Military Health System, care is provided through  TRICARE, DOD\u2019s regionally structured health-care system. Under  TRICARE, DOD and Coast Guard active-duty servicemembers typically  receive most of their care in what is known as the direct-care  component\u2014that is, in military hospitals and clinics referred to as military  treatment facilities. The care provided in military treatment facilities is  supplemented by services offered through TRICARE\u2019s purchased-care  networks of civilian providers.

DOD\u2019s 2002 Health Related Behaviors  Survey of the DOD active-duty population and the 2010\u20132011 survey of  the DOD Reserve Component populations asked respondents about their  problematic gambling behaviors, but the results of these surveys are not  directly comparable to the DOD data, as shown in table 3. An estimated  1.2 percent (with a standard error of 0.2 percent) of active-duty military  personnel met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,  Fourth Edition, criteria for lifetime prevalence of probable pathological  gambling based on the self-administered survey of health-related  behaviors. Similarly, an estimated 1.3 percent (with a standard error of  0.1 percent) of Reserve Component respondents to the 2010\u20132011 DOD  Health Related Behaviors Reserve Component Survey met the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition,  criteria for lifetime prevalence of probable pathological gambling. These  survey data are not comparable to DOD data presented in table 3 for  three reasons. First, the surveys were based on the Diagnostic and  Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria that were applicable at the  time of the surveys, which, as discussed above, differed from the current  version in the disorder\u2019s categorization and the number of diagnostic  criteria. Second, the surveys were based on anonymous self- administered questionnaires, while gambling disorder and problem  gambling clinical data were based on clinicians\u2019 interactions with  servicemembers. Third, the estimate of lifetime prevalence does not  indicate current prevalence. Further, according to the most-recent edition  of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, a majority of  individuals with gambling disorder do not seek out treatment, which  implies that servicemembers may report problematic gambling behaviors  on an anonymous survey but not seek treatment. DOD stated that since  2002 more-recent versions of the active-duty Health Related Behavior  Survey, which occurs approximately every 3 years, have not asked about  gambling behaviors because previous iterations of the survey in 1992 and  1998 showed similar low rates of gambling behaviors for the active-duty  force, and DOD officials stated that they had sought to shorten the length  of the survey. However, the Health Related Behavior Surveys have  regularly included at least one question regarding financial difficulties,  which may indicate a gambling problem.", "The Department of Veterans Affairs also collects data on the number of  former servicemembers who visit the Veterans Health Administration for  treatment for problem gambling or gambling disorder. However, Veterans  Health Administration officials stated that they do not have data on how  many individuals developed gambling problems during their military service.

For the U.S. general  population review, we identified only one report within our scope; that  study estimated the prevalence of past-year problem gambling to be 4.6  or 5.0 percent of the population and the prevalence of past-year  pathological gambling to be 2.4 or 1.0 percent of the population (using the  South Oaks Gambling Screen\u2013Revised and the Diagnostic Interview  Schedule-IV instruments, respectively). This study is not directly  comparable to Military Health System data because it analyzed the  results of phone-based surveys of the U.S. general population; on the  other hand, Military Health System data are based on clinical interactions  of the U.S. military population. In a separate literature search on the  prevalence of problem gambling and gambling disorder in the U.S.  military, three of the four results were the previously discussed DOD  Health Related Behavior Surveys. The fourth result was a small,  nonrepresentative, 6-month self-report questionnaire study of incoming  patients at a Navy outpatient psychiatric clinic that indicated 1.9 percent  of 360 military personnel were diagnosed with a lifetime prevalence of  pathological gambling using the South Oaks Gambling Screen.  However, this is the prevalence among those patients voluntarily  presenting to a psychiatric clinic who agreed to complete the questionnaire and is not a valid indicator of prevalence among all clinic  patients, the base population, the military service, or the military as a  whole."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD and the Coast Guard Do Not Systematically Screen for Gambling Disorder, but DOD and Coast Guard Medical Personnel State That They Address Gambling Disorder in Line with Current Medical Practices", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOD and the Coast Guard Do Not Systematically Screen for Gambling Disorder", "paragraphs": ["DOD and the Coast Guard do not systematically screen for gambling  disorder through DOD\u2019s annual health assessment or any other type of  periodic health screening of servicemembers. DOD Instruction 6025.19,  Individual Medical Readiness, which is applicable to the military services,  including the Coast Guard, requires military departments to screen  servicemembers for physical and mental health conditions using an  annual screening tool called the Periodic Health Assessment. DOD and  the Coast Guard use the annual Periodic Health Assessment to assess  each servicemember\u2019s overall health and medical readiness and to  initiate preventive services, as warranted. The Periodic Health  Assessment assesses health conditions that may limit or prevent a  servicemember from deploying, and the behavioral-health section asks  specific questions on prescription drugs, alcohol consumption, and post- traumatic stress. However, there are no questions on the assessment that explicitly mention gambling that would allow for medical personnel to  screen for gambling disorder\u2014an addictive disorder medically similar to  substance abuse, as previously discussed. Furthermore, DOD Instruction  6490.07, Deployment-Limiting Medical Conditions for Service Members  and DoD Civilian Employees, which a 2013 DOD memorandum  supplements, describes mental-health conditions that would limit or  prevent personnel from deploying. These conditions may include, but are  not limited to, individuals with substance-use disorders undergoing active  treatment as well as those at risk for suicide.", "As part of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Substance  Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration aims to reduce the  effect of substance abuse and mental illness and to focus the nation\u2019s  public-health agenda on these issues as well as addiction. They provide  some examples for screening-question sets that are used to identify  potential gambling disorders in the general population by health-care  personnel that could be used on the DOD Periodic Health Assessment.  One example is the South Oaks Gambling Screen that consists of  questions in categories such as frequency of gambling, type of gambling,  and patient perceptions. Another screening example is the \u201cLie/Bet\u201d  screening which requires just two questions:  1.  Have you ever had to lie to people important to you about how much  you gambled?  2.  Have you ever felt the need to bet more and more money?", "DOD and Coast Guard officials stated that they do not screen for  gambling disorder because they focus military health surveillance on  mental-health disorders that are high risk to overall readiness, high  volume, and have validated measures for assessment. However, while  gambling disorder is a comparatively low-volume disorder, the  preoccupation with gambling, financial hardship, and increased risk of  suicide can pose a risk to individual readiness and has been identified in  the recent Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders as  sharing similar symptoms and treatment methods with substance-use  disorders. According to DOD Instruction 6490.07, individuals with clinical  psychiatric disorders with residual symptoms that impair duty  performance are precluded from contingency deployment unless a waiver  is granted. In addition, a 2013 Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health  Affairs memorandum that supplements this instruction also states that  individuals with mental disorders should demonstrate a pattern of stability  without significant symptoms or impairment for at least 3 months prior to  deployment, unless a waiver is granted. It also states that  servicemembers diagnosed with substance-use disorders should not  deploy if doing so would interrupt active treatment. Therefore, for  servicemembers with gambling disorder, it may be difficult to maintain  individual deployment readiness and perform duties effectively. For  example, according to the 2013 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of  Mental Disorders, gambling disorder is a risk factor for suicide attempts,  with roughly 17 percent of those in treatment attempting suicide at some  point. In addition, data from the DOD Suicide Event Report show there  were 8 suicides and 13 suicide attempts related to gambling behavior by  servicemembers in fiscal years 2011\u20132015.", "Additionally, gambling disorder is difficult to detect because there are no  objective laboratory tests, such as urinalysis for substance use, to identify  individuals with potential gambling disorder, according to the American  Society of Addiction Medicine. For this reason, screening is even more  important to identifying servicemembers that may need assistance. In  addition, military servicemembers may also be reluctant to seek mental- health treatment because of perceived stigma. According to the 2013  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, less than 10  percent of individuals with gambling disorder seek treatment. Similarly,  the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has  indicated that screening is important because few seek treatment directly  for gambling disorder, and they instead seek treatment for other problems  such as depression. Gambling disorder can also be easier to hide than  other addictions, according to the American Society of Addiction  Medicine. Without proactively asking gambling disorder questions as part  of screening to help detect gambling disorder, DOD and the Coast Guard  risk not identifying affected servicemembers and providing assistance for  the disorder. When coupled with higher suicide rates, high rate of co- occurrence of other mental disorders, and the potential for critical  financial situations, the effect that gambling disorder can have on  individual readiness and the military family could be significant."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD and Coast Guard Medical Personnel State That They Use Current Diagnostic Standards to Diagnose Gambling Disorder and They Treat It Using Established Substance-Use Addiction Treatment Programs", "paragraphs": ["According to Defense Health Agency and service medical officials, both  DOD and Coast Guard medical personnel use the Diagnostic and  Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria to diagnose  servicemembers with gambling disorders, and they employ the same  evidence-based practices, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, to treat  the disorder.

In addition, the instruction establishes guidelines for  problematic substance use, such as its incompatibility with readiness and  military discipline, the goal of substance treatment programs to maintain  force health and readiness, and implications for eligibility for access to  classified information. As previously discussed, gambling disorder is the  only non-substance-related condition categorized as an addiction in the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The non- substance-use terminology is significant because of its absence  throughout the DOD instruction, while problematic substance use is a  repetitive theme. Although medical personnel with whom we spoke are  aware of the change in the treatment of gambling disorder between the  manual\u2019s editions, this change is not reflected in the guidance for DOD\u2019s  nonmedical personnel that would help ensure that servicemembers are  referred to medical providers for gambling problems.", "We also found that the DOD military services\u2014Army, Marine Corps, Air  Force, and Navy\u2014do not include gambling disorder in their substance  abuse policy and guidance documents:", "Army: Army Regulation 600-85, The Army Substance Abuse Program,  provides alcohol- and drug-abuse prevention and control policies, as  well as individual responsibilities. Officials from the Army Substance  Abuse Program told us that the program does not provide services to  servicemembers with gambling disorder. However, Army Regulation  600-85 derives its program authority from DOD Instruction 1010.04,  which, according to Defense Health Agency officials, implicitly applies  to gambling disorder and, therefore, requires the Army substance- abuse program to include gambling disorder as well. This example  indicates that there is not a clear understanding whether DOD  Instruction 1010.04 covers gambling disorder within the Army.", "Navy: The Navy provides its policy for alcohol- and drug-abuse  prevention in Chief of Naval Operations Instruction 5350.4D, Navy  Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Control. In addition, the Navy  also uses the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery Instruction 5353.4B,  Standards for Provision of Substance Related Disorder Treatment  Services, to update a uniform set of standards for the provision of  substance-related disorder treatment services within the Department  of the Navy. Both of these Navy documents list the current version of  the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders as a  reference, but neither discusses any specific information on gambling  disorder.", "Air Force: Air Force Instruction 44-121, Alcohol and Drug Abuse  Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT) Program, outlines the Air Force\u2019s  policies for its alcohol- and drug-abuse prevention and treatment  program. The Air Force guidance does list the 2013 Diagnostic and  Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders as a reference, but does not  specifically mention gambling disorder.", "Marine Corps: Marine Corps Order 5300.17, Marine Corps Substance  Abuse Program, provides policy and procedural guidance to  commanders, substance-abuse personnel, and Marines to effectively  use and carry out the Marine Corps substance-abuse program, and  so that commanders may improve their capability to treat and prevent  alcohol- and drug-abuse problems. This guidance does reference the  2013 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, but does  not include any policy or guidance information on gambling disorder.", "The Coast Guard, which DOD Instruction 1010.04 does not cover, has  three documents that provide guidance and policy to both medical and  nonmedical personnel on substance abuse, but Coast Guard officials  stated that they do not have any policy that specifically discusses  gambling disorder. However, they did indicate that, from a medical  perspective, gambling disorder has multiple similarities with substance  abuse and is treated in accordance with Commandant Instruction  M6200.1C, Coast Guard Health Promotion Manual. While this document  does not list the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders as  a reference, it does mention it in several sections primarily in regard to  diagnostic codes. Commandant Instruction M1000.10, Coast Guard Drug  and Alcohol Abuse Program, details the Coast Guard\u2019s general  administrative policies on the substance-use program, that although does  not mention gambling disorder, is currently under revision to remove all  reference to medical issues. Although Commandant Instruction M6000.1F  Coast Guard Medical Manual, does refer to pathological gambling (the  former name of gambling disorder), the manual classifies the condition as  an impulse-control disorder, not as an addiction as prescribed by the  most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental  Disorders. According to Commandant Instruction M6000.1F, a diagnosis  of an impulse-control disorder may warrant separation from the Coast  Guard, whereas certain types of substance use disorders are addressed  in the Coast Guard Drug and Alcohol Abuse Program. Thus, gambling  disorder is not being treated in the same manner as other addictive  disorders, such as alcohol-use disorder.", "According to GAO Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, management must communicate high-quality information  internally to enable personnel to perform key roles in achieving  objectives, addressing risks, and supporting the internal control system.  In addition, these standards require that DOD communicates high-quality  information throughout the entity using established reporting lines. High- quality information is to be communicated down, across, up, and around  reporting lines to all levels of the entity. DOD and the Coast Guard do not  explicitly communicate their policies to unit commanders and other  nonmedical personnel that gambling disorder should be addressed in the  same manner as other addictive disorders, such as substance-use  disorders, that is, through each service\u2019s substance-use programs or  civilian providers through TRICARE.", "DOD has taken the initial step in communicating high-quality information  regarding the diagnostic classification of gambling disorder as an  addiction to its medical personnel through a memorandum in December  2013 directing the adoption of the recent edition of the Diagnostic and  Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Given this action, DOD health  officials stated that DOD Instruction 1010.04 \u201cimplicitly\u201d covers gambling  disorder, but this implied knowledge would only likely be derived from a  detailed awareness of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental  Disorders publication and its diagnostic classifications. Coast Guard  officials told us they do not have a formal instruction on gambling  disorder. Additionally, because the Coast Guard\u2019s medical manual,  Commandant Instruction M6000.1F, is based on the previous edition of  the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, pathological  gambling is not classified as an addiction. When the issue of gambling  disorder was raised with DOD and Coast Guard health-care officials, the  officials agreed that, while their guidance on substance use technically  covers problem gambling, the guidance would help clarify if it was revised  to explicitly include problem gambling. However, the officials at this point  do not have any plans to update the guidance accordingly.", "By not explicitly including mention of gambling disorders in its guidance  for problematic substance use, the Office of the Secretary of Defense  (OSD) and the military services, including the Coast Guard, are not  communicating necessary policy, education, and awareness information  to nonmedical personnel. As currently written, OSD and military service,  including Coast Guard, personnel, such as unit commanders, do not have  guidance that instructs them to refer personnel with gambling problems  for medical evaluation of a potentially addictive disorder, thus possibly  preventing personnel from receiving necessary and appropriate medical  assistance. This could lead to administrative or disciplinary actions that  address only the misconduct associated with the behavior. Also, gambling  disorder is one of the factors that can also lead to the revocation or failing  of a background security investigation for security clearances, thus  affecting individual readiness and the capacity of the organization to meet  its mission. While gambling disorder is a comparatively low-volume  disorder, DOD instructions acknowledge that mental health issues may  affect individual readiness. Gambling disorder may also be a risk to  national security. A 2006 memorandum from the Under Secretary of  Defense for Intelligence stated that compulsive gambling is a concern as  it may lead to financial crimes including espionage. Absent explicit  guidance, OSD, the DOD military services, and the Coast Guard risk not  being able to identify and provide appropriate treatment and counseling to  DOD and Coast Guard servicemembers afflicted by gambling disorder  and mitigate or prevent individual readiness issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Gambling disorder has been identified within the medical community as  an addiction similar to drug or alcohol use. Gambling disorder can also  develop in conjunction with other addictions. Gambling disorder is a risk  factor for suicide\u2014and according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual  of Mental Disorders about 17 percent of individuals in treatment for  gambling disorder attempt suicide at some point in their life. A person with  gambling disorder may also have financial or legal issues that, combined  with other addictions, could spiral out of control. According to the  American Psychiatric Association, only 10 percent of individuals with  gambling disorder seek treatment. However, DOD and the Coast Guard  do not include gambling disorder questions as part of a systematic  screening process for identifying servicemembers who may have a  gambling disorder. Implementing systematic screening for gambling  disorder may help to identify servicemembers with problem gambling or  gambling disorder. Without incorporating medical screening questions  specific to gambling disorder, gambling problems may not be identified  until they reach a critical point affecting the individual\u2019s readiness in  addition to harming the financial situation of the servicemember and,  potentially, national security.", "In addition, guidance for nonmedical personnel does not discuss  gambling disorder as an addiction; therefore, DOD and service guidance  do not direct nonmedical personnel that gambling should be treated in a  medical manner. Explicitly including gambling disorder in guidance would  identify it as a medical issue for nonmedical personnel. Communicating  this change throughout DOD would make clear the proper steps to be  taken to address this addiction before it becomes an administrative or  disciplinary issue.

However, DOD did not concur with our recommendation to incorporate  medical screening questions specific to gambling disorder as part of a  systematic screening process across DOD, such as in DOD\u2019s annual  Periodic Health Assessment for behavioral and mental-health issues. In  its written comments, DOD stated that there is no evidence to suggest  that gambling disorder is a high-prevalence disorder in DOD and that it is  impractical to screen for every low-prevalence disorder. DOD noted that  there are numerous mental health disorders with similar or higher  prevalence (e.g., bipolar disorder, psychotic disorders, and obsessive- compulsive disorder) for which DOD does not routinely screen. DOD  stated that screening for additional conditions in the Periodic Health  Assessment adds time and resources and would require an additional  burden on the servicemember and provider. DOD noted that priority to  screen for a disorder is given to high-risk, high-volume, and problem- prone disorders with validated measures for assessment.", "We disagree that DOD can definitively conclude that gambling disorder  and problem gambling among DOD and Coast Guard servicemembers  are \u201clow prevalence,\u201d and therefore related screening questions should  not be a part of a systematic screening. First, as we noted in our report,  DOD prevalence data are limited to those compiled in the Military Health  System Data Repository, which reflects only DOD and Coast Guard  servicemembers who seek care for gambling-related issues through the  TRICARE system, and excludes information from sources outside of the  Military Health System. These sources include, for example, nonmedical  counseling that a Marine might receive from the Marine Corps Community  Counseling Program, Behavioral Health Program, or Consolidated  Substance Abuse Counseling Center; from treatment or counseling  provided at civilian facilities outside the TRICARE system; or from  counseling received at local support groups, such as Gamblers  Anonymous. Second, the data do not reflect care received by Reserve  Component members unless they are on active orders for more than 30  days. Third, the data does not account for those who do not seek care  inside or outside the TRICARE system. Screening specifically for  gambling disorder takes on particular importance because, as noted in  the 2013 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (i.e., the  primary source used by civilian and military mental-health-care providers  to diagnose mental disorders), less than 10 percent of individuals with  gambling disorder seek help and because, according to the American  Society of Addiction Medicine, gambling disorder can be easier to hide  than other addictions. According to the 2013 Diagnostic and Statistical  Manual of Mental Disorders, persons diagnosed with gambling disorder  exhibit a preoccupation with gambling, are at risk of a higher rate of a co- occurrence of other mental disorders, are at increased risk of suicide, and  are at risk of critical financial situations. We note that these issues can  pose a significant risk to individual readiness and, potentially, to national  security.", "Furthermore, DOD stated that the two examples for screening-question  sets that we cite in our report, the \u201cLie/Bet\u201d screening and the South Oaks  Gambling Screen are not appropriate diagnostic tools because the  \u201cLie/Bet\u201d screening has scored poorly as a diagnostic screening tool and  the South Oaks Gambling Screen has a high rate of false positives and  would result in an additional burden to servicemembers and the provider.  To clarify, in our recommendation we do not limit DOD to using these two  examples for screening-question sets as the specific questions that we  are recommending that DOD incorporate as part of a systematic  screening process across DOD. DOD further stated that it is actively  engaged in screening servicemembers for financial difficulties and other  symptoms often associated with gambling through the Health Related  Behavior Survey and the Periodic Health Assessment. As we note in our  report, limiting screening to questions about financial difficulties will likely  not result in the identification of individuals with gambling disorder before  it affects individual readiness. Due to each of these reasons, we continue  to believe that our recommendation to incorporate medical screening  questions specific to gambling disorder as part of a systematic screening  process across DOD is valid.", "DOD also included two substantive technical comments as part of its  written response. First, DOD stated that it is unclear what is within our  scope for inclusion of epidemiological studies on the prevalence of  gambling disorder. DOD felt the prevalence percentages in the Kessler  study (2008) should have been included as part of our results. We did  identify this study in our literature search and, although it was published  after 2006, the data were collected between 2001 and 2003, which is  outside the time frame of our review, as stated in appendix II. To address  DOD\u2019s comment, we included more specific language related to the  scope of the literature search in the abbreviated scope and methodology  section earlier in the report. Second, DOD noted that our statement  regarding 8 suicides and 13 suicide attempts related to gambling behavior  should be put into context. Specifically, DOD stated that, according to  DOD Suicide Event Reporting data, only 0.6 percent of all suicides and  0.3 percent of all attempts had a history of problem gambling. We did not  address this comment in the report because the contextualization does  not apply to the entire scope of the population included in this review.  DOD Suicide Event Reporting data do not include the entire reserve  component population\u2014as we stated in the report\u2014only those in an  active-duty status.

We reviewed summary data for accuracy and obvious errors and  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable to report on the total  number of individuals diagnosed with gambling disorder or seen for  problem gambling in the Department of Veterans Affairs system. We also  conducted literature searches regarding the prevalence of problem  gambling and gambling disorder in the general population as well as the  military population. Specifically, for the military prevalence review, we  searched for studies reporting the prevalence of problem gambling within  the active and reserve (but not veteran) U.S. military population, including  the Coast Guard, in English-language professional journals, government  reports, and other published and unpublished papers published between  2001 and 2016.

We  screened these sources by reviewing the titles and abstracts and other  necessary bibliographic information and excluded sources that were out  of scope. We also reviewed bibliographies to identify additional sources,  but no new sources meeting the review criteria were identified. This  process resulted in identifying four sources for a complete review, of  which two were found not to contain relevant data.

We reviewed  screening tools, such as the DOD\u2019s Periodic Health Assessment to  identify whether they contained gambling disorder screening questions.  We also reviewed the American Society of Addiction Medicine treatment  criteria for addictive conditions, which assess the appropriate treatment  venue for each patient based on a multidimensional assessment; these  criteria were designed to define one national set of criteria for providing  outcome-oriented and results-based care in the treatment of addiction.  We interviewed mental-health officials, counselors, chaplains, and  personnel-security officials regarding the screening, diagnosis,  counseling, and treatment of individuals with gambling disorder. We also  conducted interviews with officials from both domestic and overseas  bases to determine practices and methods for diagnosing and treating  gambling disorder. We selected a nongeneralizable sample of four  military installations that represented all four DOD military services as  well as the Coast Guard and had reported at least one diagnosed case of  gambling disorder. We also selected these installations because they  were in close proximity to each other and close to GAO facilities in the  Southern California area, for cost reasons. In addition, the California  National Guard provided written responses to questions on the diagnosis  and treatment of gambling disorder. We selected and met with Army,  Navy, and Marine Corps representatives from four overseas bases in the  Republic of Korea and Japan that had reported more than one case of  gambling disorder or problem gambling in fiscal years 2011\u20132015 or had  DOD-run slot machines. Only two combatant commands have bases  with slot machines\u2014U.S. Pacific Command and U.S. European  Command. We chose bases in U.S. Pacific Command, which had an  outpatient program for servicemembers with gambling disorder in  Okinawa, Japan. We were unable to arrange any meetings with Air Force  bases in the Republic of Korea and Japan. The overseas interviews  included chaplains stationed in this theater. We also reviewed DOD data  on suicide and suicide attempts that were related to gambling. At our  request, DOD conducted a search of its Suicide Event Report using the  following search terms: gamble, debt, bookie, casino, roulette, cards,  poker. The resulting numbers are underestimates of the number of  suicides and attempted suicides due to the way the data are collected;  the magnitude of the underestimation is unknown, according to DOD  officials. The officials reviewed the search results to ensure that the  content was indicative of monetary gambling (i.e., to ensure that \u201cdebt\u201d  referenced gambling debts and not other sources of debt, such as credit  card debt or child support). Death-risk gambling (e.g., Russian Roulette)  was excluded in this analysis. The search identified 8 deaths due to suicide and 13 suicide attempts between fiscal years 2011 and 2015  where the behavioral-health professional completing the DOD Suicide  Event Report indicated any gambling behavior as a relevant antecedent  factor. DOD stated the occurrence of gambling behavior should not be  interpreted as being causally related to the occurrence of the suicide  behavior.", "To evaluate the extent to which DOD and Coast Guard guidance address  gambling disorder in a manner similar to substance-use disorder, we  compared DOD\u2019s and the Coast Guard\u2019s respective policies on substance  use against GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government. According to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, management must communicate high-quality information  internally to enable personnel to perform key roles in achieving  objectives, addressing risks, and supporting the internal control system.
