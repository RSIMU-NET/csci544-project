Both traditional and newer delivery models use this approach to incentivize providers to improve their performance. Feedback reports serve to inform providers of their results on various measures relative to established targets. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 mandated that GAO compare private entity and Medicare performance feedback reporting activities.", "GAO examined (1) how and when private entities report performance data to physicians, and what information they report; and (2) how the timing and approach CMS uses to report performance data compare to that of private entities. GAO contacted nine entities\u2014health insurers and statewide collaboratives\u2014recognized for their performance reporting programs. Focusing on physician feedback, GAO obtained information regarding report recipients, data sources used, types of performance measures and benchmarks, frequency of reporting, and efforts to enhance the utility of performance reports. GAO obtained similar information from CMS about its Medicare feedback efforts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Private entities GAO reviewed for this study selected a range of measures and benchmarks to assess physician group performance, and provided feedback reports to physicians more than once a year. Private entities almost exclusively focused their feedback efforts on primary care physician groups participating in medical homes and accountable care organizations, which hold physicians responsible for the quality and cost of all services provided. They limited their feedback reporting to those with a sufficient number of enrollees to ensure the reliability of reported measures. The entities decided on the number and type of measures for their reports, and compared each group's performance to multiple benchmarks, including peer group averages or past performance. All the entities used quality measures, and some also used utilization or cost measures. Because of the variety of quality measures and benchmarks, feedback report content differed across the entities. Some entities noted that in addition to national benchmarks, they compared results to state or regional level rates to reflect local patterns of care which may be more relevant to their physicians. Most health insurers spent from 4 to 6 months to generate their performance reports, a period that allowed them to amass claims data as well as to make adjustments and perform checks on the measure calculations. Commonly, private entities issued interim feedback reports, covering a 1-year measurement period, on a rolling monthly, quarterly, or semiannual schedule. They told GAO that physicians valued frequent feedback in order to make changes that could result in better performance at the end of the measurement period.", "Feedback from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) included quality measures determined by each medical group, along with comparison to only one benchmark, and CMS did not provide interim reports to physicians. The agency has phased in performance feedback in order to meet its mandate to apply value-based payment (VBP) to all physicians in Medicare by 2017, a challenge not faced by private entities. In September 2013, CMS made feedback reports available to 6,779 physician groups. While private entities in this study chose the measures for their reports, CMS tied the selection of specific quality measures to groups' chosen method of submitting performance data. Although both CMS and private entities focused their feedback on preventive care and management of specific diseases, CMS's reports contained more information on costs and outcomes than some entities. While private entities employed multiple benchmarks, the agency only compared each group's results to the national average rates of all physician groups that submitted data on any given measure. CMS's use of a single benchmark precludes physicians from viewing their performance in fuller context, such as relative to their peers in the same geographic areas. CMS's report generation process took 9 months to complete, several months longer than health insurers in the study, although it included more steps. In contrast to private entity reporting, CMS sent its feedback report to physicians once a year, a frequency that may limit physicians' opportunity to make improvements in advance of their annual payment adjustments.", "The Department of Health and Human Services generally concurred with GAO's recommendations and asked for additional information pertaining to the potential value of using multiple benchmarks to assess Medicare physicians' performance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["The Administrator of CMS should consider expanding performance benchmarks to include state or regional averages, and disseminating feedback reports more frequently than the current annual distribution."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Increasingly, health care payers\u2014including Medicare\u2014are rethinking the  way they reimburse providers in an attempt to shift away from paying  solely for the volume of care delivered and toward paying them for the  value of their care.

Measures typically  fell into one of several measurement areas, each with as few as one or as  many as 20 individual measures. For example, in the quality  measurement areas for pulmonary and respiratory conditions, one private  entity reported on a single measure (appropriate use of medications for  asthma), while another reported three measures (appropriate use of  medications for asthma, appropriate testing for pharyngitis, and  avoidance of antibiotic treatment for adults with acute bronchitis).

While most health  insurers generated performance reports in 4 to 6 months, CMS issued  reports about 9 months after the end of the January to December 2012  reporting period.", "To produce its 2013 physician feedback reports using administrative  claims, CMS began with the standard claims run-out period followed by  intervals for provider attribution, measure calculation, risk-adjustment,  and quality assurance. (See fig. 10.) CMS officials said they allowed a   3-month run-out interval to account for providers\u2019 late-year claims  submissions. After the run-out period, CMS required 5 to 6 months for a  series of additional tasks needed to prepare the data for reporting. For  groups that submitted data to CMS via the web interface or registry  options, CMS gave these groups 3 months to submit such data after the  end of the 12-month performance period. CMS then calculated the  measures for these options over a period of the next several months.  Although FFS beneficiaries see multiple physicians, CMS attributed each  beneficiary to a single medical group through its yearly attribution  process. It used the claims for the 12-month reporting period to  determine which groups provided the beneficiary the most primary care  and then assigned responsibility for performance on quality and cost  measures to that group. Following attribution, the agency risk-adjusted  the cost measures to account for differences in beneficiary  characteristics and complexity, and standardized the cost measures by  removing all geographic payment adjustments. Finally, CMS officials said  they performed data checks to ensure accuracy before the reports were  disseminated.", "According to health insurers and collaboratives, physicians find that  frequent feedback enables them to improve their performance more  quickly; however, CMS did not provide physicians interim performance  feedback. However, with only annual feedback from CMS, physicians  may be missing an opportunity to improve their performance on a more  frequent basis. Asked if more frequent reporting was considered, CMS  officials cited concerns about the time it would take to generate each set  of reports. With each round, the agency would need to attribute all  beneficiaries to a medical group, risk-adjust and standardize the cost  measures, and compute the benchmarks for each measure. In addition,  providing interim reports on quality data would require certain providers to  report more frequently. For example, providers who submit via registry  would need to finalize their data more often than annually.

Private entities have selectively rolled  out their feedback programs, generally applying them to relatively large  groups of primary care physicians participating in medical homes and  ACOs. Although they are not uniform in their approaches, the entities in  our study used their discretion to select a limited number of quality and  utilization/cost measures, calculated them using claims data, and used  them to assess performance against a variety of benchmarks. In  response to physicians\u2019 needs, their feedback reports tended to be  frequent, timely, and dynamic.", "CMS\u2019s approach to performance reporting faces some unique challenges.  First, it is driven by the statutory requirement that, by 2017, Medicare pay  FFS physicians in groups of all sizes, including specialists, using a VM.  Second, the agency has had to develop the feedback program in the  context of pre-existing incentive programs, such as PQRS. CMS finalized  several key changes to the feedback program for future reporting periods,  as it expands the application of the VM to all physicians. Specifically,  CMS continues to modify program components such as measures and  reporting mechanisms as it works to align the reporting and feedback  aspects of multiple programs. Despite these program modifications, we  found that certain features of private entities\u2019 feedback programs, which  are lacking in CMS\u2019s program, could enhance the usefulness of the  reports in improving the value of physician care.", "CMS\u2019s use of a single nationwide benchmark to compare  performance on quality and cost ignores richer benchmarking  feedback that could benefit physicians. Private entities in our study  measured provider performance against several benchmarks. CMS\u2019s  reliance on a national average as the sole benchmark precludes  providers from gauging their performance relative to their peers in the  same geographic area. Without such contextual information, providers  lack the feedback to better manage their performance and target  improvement efforts.", "Additionally, CMS disseminates feedback reports only once a year  (for example, September 2013). This gives physicians little time  (October through December) to analyze the information and make  changes in their practices to score better in the next measurement  period. The private entities we reviewed sent reports more than once  a year, and reported that greater frequency of reporting enabled more  frequent improvements. Without interim performance reports,  providers may not be able to make needed changes to their  performance in advance of their annual VM payment modifications.", "Our findings also support past GAO recommendations that CMS reward  physicians for improvement as well as performance against absolute  benchmarks, and develop a strategy to reliably measure solo and small  practices, such as by aggregating data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["As CMS implements and refines its physician feedback and VM  programs, the Administrator of CMS should consider taking the following  two actions to help ensure physicians can best use the feedback to  improve their performance:", "Develop performance benchmarks that compare physicians\u2019  performance against additional benchmarks such as state or regional  averages; and", "Disseminate performance reports more frequently than the current  annual distribution\u2014for example, semiannually."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS for comment. In its written  response, reproduced in appendix III, the department generally agreed  with our recommendations, and reiterated our observation that the  agency faces unique challenges with its mandate to report to Medicare  FFS providers in groups of all sizes that encompass all specialty care  areas.", "HHS conditionally agreed with our recommendation that reporting  physician performance using multiple benchmarks would be beneficial,  but asked for further information on private entities\u2019 practices and their  potential use for Medicare providers. As we stated in the report, private  entities generally use two or three different types of benchmarks to  provide a variety of performance assessments. We found alternative  benchmarks that could enhance Medicare feedback reporting by allowing  physicians to track their performance in their own historical and  geographic context. For example, some entities\u2019 reports included  physician group performance on certain measures relative to their past  performance, a recommendation we previously made to HHS in  December 2012. Although it agreed to consider developing benchmarks  for performance improvement, HHS has yet to do so. A comparison to  past performance allows a medical group to see how much, if at all, it has  improved regardless of where it stands relative to its peers. In this way,  CMS can motivate physicians to continuously improve their performance.  In addition, some entities in our review compared physician performance  data to statewide or regional-level benchmarks. Because of the number of  Medicare physicians, CMS has extensive performance data, which could  enable more robust localized peer benchmarks than any individual health  plan could generate. As we noted, such benchmarks reflect more local  patterns of care that may be more relevant to physicians than  comparisons to national averages alone.", "HHS further asserted that, because the physician feedback program\u2019s key  purpose is to support the national VM program, it is appropriate to limit  reporting to a single national benchmark. HHS expressed concern that  displaying other benchmarks could be misleading and confusing for the  purposes of the VM. However, CMS\u2019s reports provide a group\u2019s VM  payment adjustment in a concise, one-page summary, as shown in   figure 9. We do not believe that additional benchmark data, displayed  separately, would detract from the information provided on the summary  page, and could enhance the value of the reports for physicians.", "HHS agreed with our second recommendation to disseminate feedback  reports more frequently than on an annual basis. As seen in the private  entity practices of using rolling or preliminary data for interim reporting,  disseminating reports more frequently can assist physicians in making  improvements to their performance before CMS determines their VM  payment adjustment. HHS commented that producing more frequent  reports would first require modifying the PQRS data collection schedules.  For example, groups of EPs that use the web interface and registry  options currently are only required to submit data to CMS once a year.  The registry option will eventually require groups to submit data to CMS  on a quarterly or semiannual basis, and HHS noted that these  requirements would have to be synchronized with the timing of data  submission through the web interface and EHR options.", "The agency also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as  appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees and the Administrator of CMS.
