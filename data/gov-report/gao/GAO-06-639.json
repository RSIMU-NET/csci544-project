This report discusses (1) how many oil and hazardous substance spills greater than 50 gallons (or of an unknown volume) were reported in the corridor from 1994 to 2004, and how accurately reported spills reflect the extent of actual spills; (2) what processes are used to notify parties of spills, and if they contain explicit requirements for reporting times and spill magnitude; and (3) the extent of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Coast Guard's spill prevention efforts and enforcement activities in the corridor from 1994 to 2004."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The NRC received 991 spill reports and the Ontario Spills Action Centre received 157 reports of spills in the corridor from 1994 through 2004, but these reports do not accurately portray the actual number or volume of spills. Many spills go unreported by responsible parties because they do not understand or fail to comply with reporting requirements. Further, multiple reports for the same spill are often recorded by NRC and provided to EPA and the Coast Guard for investigation. EPA does not remove all duplicate spill reports or update its data after investigating spills. Coast Guard officials update their spill data after investigations but they are unable to update spill volume estimates due to automated system limitations. GAO also found that, according to agency data sets, other events--combined sewer overflows (CSOs) and industrial permit violations--occurred more frequently than spills in the corridor. While data on industrial permit violations and CSOs might be subject to the same limitations as the spill data because the data are self reported and facilities may not report all of these events, spills may be particularly subject to underreporting because they are not part of a structured program as CSOs and industrial permit violations are. There are multiple parties involved in spill notification in the corridor and agreements outlining U.S.-Canadian notification processes are not explicit about reporting times or the magnitude of spills that warrant notification. The coast guards of each country have agreed to notify one another of spills primarily when a joint response may be needed. Another agreement between Michigan and Ontario officials calls for notifying each other of spills that may have a joint impact. We reviewed six selected spill incidents that illustrate the various ways that notification can occur. The drinking water facility operators we contacted on the U.S. side of the corridor had differing perspectives on current notification processes, and the majority expressed concern that their facilities could be contaminated by spills if they are not notified in a timely manner. Finally, efforts have been made to develop informal notification processes between individual industries or trade associations and drinking water facilities. EPA's spill prevention program is limited and the Coast Guard addresses spill prevention as part of other compliance efforts. EPA's prevention program addresses only oil spills. Further, EPA is uncertain of which specific facilities are subject to regulation under its spill prevention program, and conducts varying numbers of inspections per year. EPA inspections uncovered significant spill prevention deficiencies, whereas the Coast Guard's inspections revealed minor issues. The agencies issued a total of 16 penalties for spills and program noncompliance during the period we reviewed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Recent spills of large quantities of oil and hazardous substances like vinyl  Recent spills of large quantities of oil and hazardous substances like vinyl  chloride have raised public concerns about the safety of drinking water for  chloride have raised public concerns about the safety of drinking water for  the more than 5 million people living within the St. Clair\u2013Detroit River  the more than 5 million people living within the St. Clair\u2013Detroit River  corridor, which borders the United States and Canada.

For oil spills, any amount  that would create a sheen on the water is a reportable quantity whereas,  for hazardous substances, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  regulations (prescribed under Superfund and the Clean Water Act) specify  what amounts the substances must exceed to be reportable. The NRC is  the national point of contact for spill reporting, and it distributes reported  spill information to agencies, including EPA and the Coast Guard, which  are tasked with spill response for inland and coastal spills, respectively. In  the corridor, EPA\u2019s Region 5 and the Coast Guard\u2019s District 9 are  responsible for responding to reported spills. While the NRC is a major  source of spill information for the agencies, EPA and the Coast Guard may  be contacted directly about a spill or learn of it while conducting their  regular duties. EPA and the Coast Guard\u2019s spill-related responsibilities are  outlined in the National Contingency Plan, the federal government\u2019s guide  to oil and hazardous substance spill response. It describes how the  agencies are to assess a spill, and initiate response action if necessary. In  addition to federal agencies, the Michigan Department of Environmental  Quality (Michigan DEQ) and Michigan State Police have a role in spill- related response and notification. In Canada, the Ontario Ministry of  Environment has a prominent role in spill-related activities in the St. Clair\u2013 Detroit River corridor, including notification and enforcement. The  Ontario Ministry of Environment\u2019s Spills Action Centre (Ontario SAC)  obtains and reports spill information to responders and other  stakeholders. Environment Canada, the federal-level regulatory agency,  has a lesser role in spill-related activities in the corridor.", "To decrease the likelihood of spills, both EPA and the Coast Guard  administer spill prevention programs. EPA\u2019s program requires that non- transportation related facilities (e.g., power plants) with a specified  storage capacity prepare spill prevention plans and meet certain  operational standards. These facilities must also provide containment  structures or explain in their plans why the structures are not feasible. The  Coast Guard\u2019s prevention program requires vessels with the capacity to  carry certain amounts of oil and hazardous substances\u2014and certain  facilities that transfer oil and hazardous substances\u2014to have written  transfer procedures or operations manuals, meet minimum equipment  requirements, and follow prescribed procedures when transferring oil on  navigable waterways. EPA and the Coast Guard have the authority to fine  parties that are responsible for spills, or that do not comply with spill  prevention program requirements.", "In this context, you asked us to examine (1) how many oil and hazardous  substance spills of more than 50 gallons (or of an unknown volume) were  reported in the St. Clair\u2013Detroit River corridor from 1994 to 2004, and how  accurately reported spills reflect the extent of actual spills; (2) what  processes are used to notify parties of spills, and whether they contain  explicit requirements for reporting times and spill magnitude; and (3) the  extent of EPA and the Coast Guard\u2019s spill prevention efforts and  enforcement activities in the St. Clair\u2013Detroit River corridor from 1994 to  2004.", "To obtain overall information relating to spills, we gathered information  from officials within various offices in EPA; the Coast Guard; the state of  Michigan; and Ontario, Canada. To determine the number of spills over 50  gallons (or of an unknown volume) reported in the St. Clair River, Lake St.  Clair, and the Detroit River and its tributary, the Rouge River, between  1994 and 2004 we obtained spill data maintained by NRC, EPA, the Coast  Guard, Michigan DEQ, and the Ontario SAC. We also obtained EPA and  Michigan DEQ data sets related to other pollutant discharges, such as  combined sewer overflows (CSO) and National Pollution Discharge  Elimination System (NPDES) industrial permit violations to obtain more  complete information on pollutants discharged into the water bodies of  the St. Clair\u2013Detroit River corridor. To assess what processes are used to  notify parties of spills and whether they contain explicit requirements for  reporting times and spill magnitudes, we reviewed applicable laws and  spill notification agreements and obtained information on implementation  of these agreements. We obtained and analyzed documentation on six  spills to better understand how the notification process was conducted  under varying circumstances, and to show a range of spill materials and  source locations. We also obtained information from all 17 of the drinking  water facility operators on the U.S. side of the corridor to obtain their  perspectives on the timeliness of spill notification. To identify spill  prevention efforts and enforcement activities, we obtained and analyzed  the relevant legislation, agency spill prevention and enforcement policies,  as well as agency data on spill-related inspections and enforcement  actions in the corridor since 1994.

It contains the greatest diversity of  fish species found in the Detroit River and it is part of the migration route  for 117 fish and 92 bird species. The Detroit River itself was designated an  American Heritage River in 1998 for these ecological resources. Despite  these and other benefits, the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers are considered  \u201cAreas of Concern\u201d by the U.S. and Canadian governments under the Great  Lakes Water Quality Agreement as a result of beneficial-use impairments,  such as restrictions on fish consumption.", "Pollutant discharges to the waters of the corridor include CSOs\u2014caused  by heavy rains that force wastewater treatment plants to bypass their  overburdened systems and discharge raw or partially treated waste  directly into the water bodies. Michigan law requires that wastewater  treatment facilities report their combined and sanitary sewer overflows to  the Michigan DEQ within 24 hours. Discharges from industrial facilities  with NPDES permits account for additional pollutants that enter the  waters of the corridor. Industries with NPDES permits are required to  report on the quality of all discharges and to detail any pollutants  discharged that exceed their permit limits to EPA in monitoring reports at  intervals specified in their permits, commonly monthly. As a result,  NPDES-permitted industries regularly monitor their discharges. In  addition to these requirements, federal law requires that parties that  discharge oil or a hazardous substance beyond specified quantities into  waters of the corridor report these incidents to the NRC. Spills and other  pollutant discharges might also be reported to the NRC by members of the  public that observe pollutant materials in waterways. When spills,  industrial permit violations, and sewer overflows contain oil, they are  visible\u2014and more likely to be reported by observers. In contrast, releases  of chemicals into the water are oftentimes not visible, unless they can be  detected by their effects, such as fish kills. Figure 2 illustrates these  sources of pollution.", "While EPA has federal regulatory responsibility for NPDES-related  discharges and CSOs, EPA and the Coast Guard share responsibility for  spill prevention and response on the U.S. side of the corridor. The National  Contingency Plan and the Southeast Michigan Area Contingency Plan  describe a geographic division of responsibility between these agencies,  but due to EPA\u2019s expertise, the Coast Guard may refer chemical spills to  EPA even if the spills are in locations otherwise assigned to the Coast  Guard. When spills originate on land but impact the navigable waters,  both agencies might be involved in response. Within EPA, Chemical  Preparedness officials enforce regulations that address chemical release  reporting requirements while Oil Program officials coordinate spill  response and oil spill prevention inspections. When spills involve  industrial permit violations or sewage releases, EPA\u2019s NPDES program  officials are also involved\u2014but because EPA approved Michigan\u2019s NPDES  program, Michigan officials are more directly involved in these cases. As  agencies respond to spills, they work with responsible parties to ensure  that they fund the cost of cleanup activities. If EPA and the Coast Guard\u2019s  spill responders do not identify the responsible party, however, they may  obtain funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund (Oil Fund) or  Superfund to finance their response efforts, including the cleanup.", "According to officials from the Coast Guard, notification of potentially  affected parties is oftentimes a component of the agencies\u2019 spill response  efforts. In addition to federal agencies, the Michigan DEQ and State Police  also provide spill notification. On the Canadian side of the corridor, the  Ontario SAC consolidates spill reports routed to their center, as well as to  other agencies. For example, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment has  an agreement with Environment Canada under which they receive all spill  reports for the federal agency. There are many potential pathways for spill  notification in the corridor. The overall process can be divided into spill  occurrence and reporting by a responsible party or observer to a  designated reporting center; spill reporting from designated spill reporting  centers to response agencies; and spill notification from response agencies  to stakeholders, including drinking water facilities. Sometimes parts of the  process are collapsed; for example, spill reporting centers may notify  other stakeholders as well as response agencies.

Reporting by responsible parties and others is critical  because only one water quality monitoring station capable of detecting  spills exists in the corridor. The Sarnia-Lambton Environmental  Association (SLEA), a Canadian industry consortium, maintains a  monitoring station south of the highly industrialized Sarnia area. Though  SLEA monitors for a suite of chemicals, it does not detect all types of  discharges\u2014and while it shares spill data with the Ontario Ministry of  Environment, its purpose is not to collect spill-related information for  regulatory agencies; rather, it collects the information as a service to SLEA  members, as well as agencies and communities.", "When spills are reported, in many cases the responsible party is unknown.  In many of these instances, a member of the public or party other than the  responsible party provides information to the NRC.

The Ontario SAC is  staffed by Ontario Ministry of Environment officials who are responsible  both for obtaining preliminary spill information for the province, as well as  for determining which spill reports relate to the same incident. The  Ontario SAC has a rolling summary of spill incidents on a display screen  and on staff computers, which allows them to identify multiple reports  that relate to a common incident. (See fig. 3.)

This was viewed as prohibitively expensive by Michigan  officials, and as an alternative, the State Police and the Michigan DEQ\u2019s  Pollution Emergency Alerting System (PEAS) began operating as a spill  notification system. The PEAS system is used for reporting spills to the  Michigan DEQ during non-business hours, including holidays, weekends,  and evenings.

EPA Region 5 officials told us that they rely on  Michigan DEQ to respond to the majority of spills since they are in closer  proximity. Region 5 officials respond to spills upon receiving a request for  assistance from Michigan DEQ officials, and when spills are over 1,000  gallons, EPA officials respond to provide assistance even if they are not  requested to do so.

For this reason, EPA officials were unable to tell us  which spills in the corridor in our time frame were investigated by their  agency.

Ontario officials, upon learning of this  limit, did not agree. They thought this figure was too high and also  indicated that volume alone is not an adequate measure of potential  impact. In their opinion, other factors such as toxicity and concentration  also need to be considered. Since two large chemical spills occurred at  Sarnia industrial facilities in 2003 and 2004, Ontario officials told us they  have notified Michigan officials of spills of various sizes but have not  always been informed of large U.S. spills by Michigan authorities. Ontario  officials provided some examples of when the Province learned of spills  originating in Michigan and impacting Ontario through calls to the SAC  from fisherman and other local stakeholders. Michigan State Police  officials told us they are uncertain as to whether they are notified of all  Canadian spills. These officials have not tracked spill notification to and  from Ontario; however, they told us they intend to start doing so.", "Though the Ontario\u2013Michigan spill notification agreement specifies that  notification is to be immediate for those spills likely to adversely affect the  adjoining jurisdiction, officials on both sides told us that they are not  always notified in a timely manner. Michigan DEQ officials told us that the  greatest lag in the notification process is the time between when a spill  occurs and when it is reported by a responsible party to agency officials.  Ontario officials told us that they are not always able to notify immediately  because some assessment is often required to determine if there is any  likelihood of an impact on the U.S. side. Ontario officials also told us that  the number of parties or steps involved in the Michigan notification  process is greater than those involved in their process, and this could  contribute to delays in Michigan\u2019s spill notification. A local official from a  county bordering Lake St. Clair also told us that the process employed by  Michigan State Police and Michigan DEQ officials to notify stakeholders  has too many steps, and drinking water facilities are too far down on their  list for timely notification. Two local officials told us that Michigan\u2019s spill  notification process should include electronic communication, rather than  relying exclusively on a phone tree, since this provides too many  opportunities for communication to be disrupted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Six Selected Spill Incidents Illustrate the Various Ways Spill Notification Can Occur", "paragraphs": ["Spill notification varies from spill to spill, depending on the unique  circumstances of the incident. We selected six spill cases to illustrate the  various ways that spill notification can occur. These six cases were chosen  to maximize variability among several factors including country of origin,  spill material, and whether the responsible party was known. (See table 1.)", "In three of the six cases we reviewed, the public, rather than the  responsible party, was the first source of spill information to response  agencies. In one of these cases, the responsible party later provided the  approximate time that the incident occurred and therefore we could  calculate the time between spill occurrence and reporting, which was  about 24 hours. Notification of agency officials and then drinking water  facilities occurred most quickly when the responsible party reported the  spill within 2.5 hours of its occurrence. In February and May of 2004, a  spill of methyl ethyl ketone and then an oily water spill occurred in  Ontario; these entered the St. Clair River. For these spills, Ontario officials  notified Michigan officials within 1 to 2 hours of the spill being reported.  Michigan drinking water facilities were then informed of the spill by  Michigan officials within the next 1 to 2.5 hours. For these incidents,  notification took less than 5 hours, from spill occurrence to notification of  drinking water facilities. When responsible parties did not promptly report  the spill, the notification process took 2 days or more. For two chemical  spills that we reviewed, including an ethylene and propylene glycol spill in  Michigan and a vinyl chloride monomer spill in Ontario, the responsible  party failed to notify regulatory officials until several days after the spill  occurred. The Canadian spill was not detected by the responsible party,  because their monitoring equipment was not running as a result of a  power outage. The U.S. spill was not detected until a member of the public  observed fish dying and reported it to Michigan DEQ officials; the  responsible party failed to notify state officials of the spill. In addition, our  review of six selected cases illustrated that in five cases, agencies notified  one another per the notification agreements. In the case in which they did  not, Michigan officials determined that there was no potential impact to  Canadian waters. Finally, for the six spills we reviewed, drinking water  facilities were not notified in three instances. In these cases, agency  officials determined that it was unnecessary to notify the facilities  because, in their view, the facilities would not be affected or the  information was deemed too late to be useful.

These facility  operators indicated that proximity to spill locations makes a difference in  their definition of notification timeliness because they might have more or  less time to prepare for spill material to pass their intakes. Figure 7  illustrates the location of U.S. drinking water facilities in the corridor.  Despite the difference of opinion on notification timeliness, the majority of  the 17 drinking water facility operators all along the corridor told us they  would like to be notified of a spill immediately, or within 1 hour or less of  its occurrence. In the six spills we profiled, notification never occurred in  this time frame.", "Furthermore, many Michigan drinking water facility operators along the  corridor expressed concern that their facilities could be contaminated by  spills. Some cited factors that could increase the likelihood of facility  contamination, such as vessel traffic along the corridor or the number of  industries located along the corridor. They told us that spill notification  plays a key role in whether their facilities might be contaminated. Some  told us that spill notification is the most important factor in their ability to  protect the drinking water. Two facility operators also indicated that their  customers have expressed concerns about the safety of their drinking  water. Generally, facility operators located along the St. Clair River and  the top of Lake St. Clair seemed to express greater concern than facility  operators located along the southern part of Lake St. Clair and the Detroit  River. For example, a facility operator in the northern part of the corridor  told us that he believes drinking water facility contamination due to spills  is \u201ca matter of when, not if.\u201d However, Michigan DEQ officials told us that  several factors make it unlikely that spills in the St. Clair River will  contaminate drinking water:    Drinking water intakes are 20\u201330 feet below the water\u2019s surface.", "The river has distinct channels, and it is difficult for a pollutant originating  on one side of the river to cross these channels.", "At 180,000 to 200,000 cubic feet per second, the river flows so quickly that  pollutants are flushed downstream before they affect drinking water.", "In contrast, Michigan DEQ officials told us that Canadian drinking water  facilities are more vulnerable to contamination from spills in the St. Clair  River. These officials noted that Canadian drinking water facilities have  shut down more often than Michigan facilities as a result of spills in the  corridor.

For example, a  local emergency management coordinator in the St. Clair River area of the  corridor has developed an informal agreement with Canadian industry  representatives to call and notify him directly of any spills into the St. Clair  River. Upon receiving spill information, he provides the information  directly to drinking water facility operators along the portion of the  corridor that borders the St. Clair River. Three drinking water facility  operators listed him as their first source of spill information. In addition,  Sarnia-Lambton Environmental Association (SLEA) officials told us that  their member facilities contact Michigan drinking water facilities directly  in the event of a spill. Several drinking water facility operators confirmed  that they have received notification from members of this consortium of  Canadian industries.", "In addition, two monitoring systems are being developed by officials from  counties bordering the corridor and Michigan DEQ officials, who have  obtained federal grants to install spill detection equipment in the St. Clair  and Detroit Rivers. These systems are designed to provide spill  information directly to drinking water facility operators with water  monitoring equipment located near their intakes. One monitoring system,  for the St. Clair River and Lake St. Clair, is funded by an EPA grant of  $962,200 to Macomb and St. Clair Counties. The other monitoring system,  for the Detroit River, is funded by a DHS grant of $760,000 to Michigan  DEQ. The officials involved in obtaining both grants told us they are  coordinating their efforts so that an overall network of water quality  monitors will be more seamless along the corridor. For example, they plan  to purchase the same monitoring equipment so that maintenance can be  shared. EPA and Michigan DEQ officials estimate that the monitoring  systems will be in place in the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers no later than  2007 (see fig. 8). These systems are based on the Ohio River Valley  Sanitation Commission\u2019s (ORSANCO) spill detection and notification  system, established in 1978 to protect drinking water intakes from  chemical contamination.

The  Coast Guard\u2019s annual facility inspections incorporate spill prevention  components that are similar to EPA\u2019s SPCC inspection components, but  their material transfer inspections and spot checks are not comparable to  EPA\u2019s focused spill prevention inspections.

In  addition, the facility never had its SPCC plan certified by a professional  engineer. The SPCC inspector found that another facility had no additional  containment around some bulk storage tanks, and it failed to amend its  SPCC plan as required. In contrast, Coast Guard officials from District 9  told us that their inspections revealed that nearly all facilities and vessels  were in compliance, and those that were not had only minor  noncompliance issues related to spill prevention, such as incidental  omissions in operations manuals.

They also explained that  limited staff resources are available to pursue enforcement actions. EPA  Region 5 has the equivalent of roughly one and a half full time staff  persons devoted to spill-related enforcement duties conducted by the  Office of Regional Counsel and the Oil Program. The Oil Program is  responsible for determining noncompliance with the SPCC program,  which entails establishing a history of spills or noncompliance; it is then  responsible for determining penalty amounts.", "Determining noncompliance and identifying responsible parties for spills,  however, can be problematic for EPA. While EPA Region 5 officials told us  they use their spill data when pursuing an enforcement case, the agency,  for most spills, does not confirm the validity of the spill data or gather  additional information. Michigan DEQ responds to most reported spills in  the corridor, but EPA Region 5 does not coordinate with Michigan DEQ to  collect information for enforcement purposes. It is EPA\u2019s policy to collect  spill information directly because, according to EPA officials, it is  preferable to have first-hand knowledge in the event that staff have to  testify or provide a deposition for an enforcement case, among other  reasons. To gather additional information, Oil Program officials stated that  they send requests to facilities for spill-related information that they can  then use in enforcement cases. If spill information is obtained, EPA Region  5 officials told us that their informal policy is not to pursue an  enforcement case when the proposed penalty is less than $11,000 or the  spill involves less than 100 gallons or two barrels of oil. They also stated  that in most cases for which they issued a penalty, the amounts were  ultimately reduced substantially through negotiations with the responsible  party. For example, one facility was issued a financial penalty of  approximately $320,000 for a spill prevention violation and the negotiated  final payment was $25,000.", "Like EPA, the Coast Guard relies primarily on assisting companies in  coming into compliance with spill prevention program regulations. The  average financial penalties that were assessed by the Coast Guard\u2019s  District 9 were relatively low compared to the maximum financial penalty  of $32,500 that it has the authority to issue for a spill violation. Coast  Guard officials from District 9 told us that, in determining penalties, they  take into account how much a facility or vessel owner has already paid for  the cost of cleaning up a spill. In regard to why no penalties were  assessed for spill prevention program violations, officials from the Coast  Guard stated that they have the authority to order a facility or vessel to  cease operations if it does not comply with their spill prevention program,  and this serves as a strong deterrent to noncompliance. They added that  large financial penalties have not been needed due to the cooperation of  companies coming into compliance with their prevention regulations.", "Similar to the Coast Guard, Michigan DEQ did not issue penalties for  noncompliance with their spill prevention program in the time frame we  reviewed. Michigan DEQ did, however, issue four penalties averaging  $35,000 to responsible parties for spills in the corridor. Michigan DEQ also  issued three penalties for multiple violations including spills and industrial  permit violations; the penalties totaled approximately $300,000. Lastly, in  Ontario, the Ministry of Environment did not have the authority to issue  administrative penalties for spills until 2005. Prior to that time, the  Ministry of Environment pursued spill-related penalties through the  provincial court system and from 2002 to 2004, four facilities were  assessed penalties averaging approximately $171,000 in U.S. dollars after  successful prosecutions.", "In addition, though EPA and Coast Guard officials acknowledge that spill  reporting is not always occurring, the agencies did not penalize  responsible parties for failure to report chemical releases in the time  period we reviewed. We are, however, uncertain as to how many chemical  releases occurred in the corridor due to data limitations. The authority  provided under the EPCRA allows EPA officials to penalize regulated  industries for failure to report, in a timely fashion, spills of reportable  quantities of hazardous or extremely hazardous substances. However, EPA  Region 5\u2019s Chemical Preparedness officials who administer EPCRA told us  that they rely on 30 to 40 information requests sent to companies per year  for the entire six-state region to gather the necessary information on  reporting in order to pursue enforcement. They stated that, with three staff  for the region to enforce the EPCRA and other regulations related to  chemical releases, they lack the resources to inspect more than roughly 15  facilities per year to determine compliance with timely notification and  other reporting requirements. They did not issue any penalties for failure  to report chemical releases in the corridor in the time frame we reviewed.  Superfund authorizes EPA and the Coast Guard to issue penalties for  failure to report hazardous substance spills, but neither agency did so in  the time frame we reviewed. The Clean Water Act, on the other hand, does  not authorize civil penalties for a responsible party\u2019s failure to notify NRC  of an oil spill; only criminal sanctions are available. Michigan DEQ officials  may make a criminal complaint or request that the state\u2019s Attorney  General pursue civil action for failure to report spills; however, they did  not in the period we reviewed. On the Canadian side of the corridor,  Ontario\u2019s Environmental Protection Act provides Ministry of Environment  officials with the authority to penalize responsible parties for failure to  report spills, as this is a violation of the act. The Ministry did so recently,  and the company responsible for a large chemical spill into the St. Clair  River in 2003 was charged and convicted of failing to report the spill  immediately.", "Spill-related penalties that are collected by EPA and the Coast Guard help  supplement the funds that provide for response efforts when a responsible  party is not identified to pay costs. In these cases, EPA and the Coast  Guard may obtain financing from the Oil Fund or Superfund to pay for  their response efforts, including the cleanup. But these funds are being  depleted by cleanup efforts in the corridor and are not being replenished  through the cost recovery process because, in many cases, the responsible  parties have not been identified. Fund data maintained by the National  Pollution Funds Center show that, from 1994 to 2004,    approximately $8.4 million from the Oil Fund financed oil spill cleanups  in the corridor, for which $80,067 was recovered to offset those  expenditures, and   approximately $17,000 from Superfund financed hazardous material spill  cleanups, with no additional funds recovered to offset those expenditures."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Spills of oil and hazardous substances into waters of the corridor continue  to be a concern, and agencies responsible for addressing this problem face  challenges on several fronts including obtaining accurate spill information,  and conducting spill notification and comprehensive prevention efforts.

Specifically, the  agency cited an example used in our report and noted that it was the result  of unusual circumstances that arose during the transition from one data  system to another. In addition, DHS noted that Coast Guard investigators  do have the ability to update spill volume estimates in investigative report  narratives. We acknowledge that the Coast Guard transitioned from one  data system to another in the time frame we reviewed. However, Coast  Guard officials told us that with the current data system, initial spill  volume estimates cannot be readily updated, except in the narrative of the  investigation reports. We acknowledge that investigators do have the  ability to update volumes in the report narratives but initial volume  estimates cannot be changed in the volume data field of the current  system. It is difficult to readily assess the magnitude of spills based on the  initial volume estimates contained in the automated spill data.  Furthermore, Coast Guard officials told us that they would benefit from an  additional field in their spill data system which incorporated final spill  volume estimates. In addition, DHS commented that additional factors  should be considered in our report regarding agency efforts to penalize  responsible parties for failure to report spills. DHS acknowledged that the  responsible parties for many spills are not identified and, while penalties  were not assessed for failure to report spills in the corridor in the time  frame we reviewed, DHS stated that the Coast Guard, with the Department  of Justice, has successfully prosecuted responsible parties for spills  outside the corridor. The full text of DHS\u2019s comments is included in  appendix VII.", "EPA provided the following three comments on our report. First, EPA  stated that it does respond to every spill, whether directly or indirectly, in  the same way that the Coast Guard responds. However, EPA could not  provide documentation of its response efforts whereas the Coast Guard  provided documentation that indicated what actions were taken in  response to each spill. In addition, EPA stated that its spill responders rely  heavily on Michigan DEQ to respond to spills and coordinate response  actions with the Coast Guard. EPA also said that it responded directly to  greater than one percent of spills\u2014as opposed to less than one percent, as  previously stated by EPA officials. Nevertheless, the level of EPA\u2019s  response is unclear due to lack of documentation. Second, EPA  commented on our recommendation that it update spill information  maintained by the NRC. We acknowledge that EPA does not modify spill  data maintained by the NRC; however, our recommendation was that it  explore the feasibility of updating spill information maintained by the NRC  by informing NRC of duplicate spill reports. While EPA maintains that  information on spills can now be updated using a new system called Web  EOC, and our report acknowledges that Web EOC is a method to update  spill data electronically, the extent of its use is uncertain according to EPA  officials. Finally, EPA commented on the feasibility of our  recommendation that it gather information on facilities that are covered  under its spill prevention program. EPA stated that there is no authority in  the Clean Water Act or the prevention regulations for facilities to provide  this information to EPA. It further stated that under the Paperwork  Reduction Act the agency would need to seek approval from the Office of  Management and Budget. However, EPA has previously identified SPCC  facilities in the corridor. If the agency determines that formal rulemaking  is necessary for it to gather information on which facilities are covered  under its spill prevention program, then we believe it should consider  undertaking such a rulemaking. EPA officials also provided specific  technical comments and clarifications on the draft report that we have  incorporated in the report as appropriate.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

To assess the  reliability of each data set we questioned and interviewed knowledgeable  officials about the data and the systems that produced them, and manually  reviewed the data. Limitations to the data are discussed in the report and  in appendix II. When appropriate, we analyzed the data sets individually to  determine spill frequency over time and spill characteristics, such as  volume and the type of material spilled. We were not able to combine the  spill data sets for analysis because each entity tracks spills differently, and  we were limited in what we could conclude from the individual data sets  because the degree to which they are updated varies widely. We also  obtained EPA and Michigan DEQ data sets related to other pollutant  discharges, such as combined sewer overflows (CSO) and industrial  discharge permit violations, to provide context for the spill data and  obtain more complete information on pollutants discharged into the water  bodies of the St. Clair\u2013Detroit River corridor. These data are likely subject  to the same limitations as the spill data, in that industrial permit violations  and CSOs are self-reported and facilities may be reluctant to report these  events; however, spills may be particularly subject to underreporting  because they are not part of a structured program as are CSOs and  industrial permit violations.", "To assess what processes are used to notify parties of spills and whether  they contain explicit requirements for reporting times and spill magnitude,  we reviewed applicable laws and spill notification agreements and  obtained information on implementation of these agreements from EPA,  the Coast Guard, Michigan DEQ, the Michigan State Police, and Canadian  officials. In addition, we obtained and analyzed documentation on six  spills to better understand how the notification process was conducted in  specific incidents. We selectively sampled the spill data sets for spills to  illustrate the implementation of notification practices under various  scenarios, including spills with source locations in both the United States  and Canada and spills of differing materials and volumes. We questioned  the 17 drinking water facility operators on the U.S. side of the corridor to  obtain their perspectives on the timeliness of spill notification.
