How DOD manages this investment has been a matter of congressional concern for years. Numerous programs have been marked by cost overruns, schedule delays, and reduced performance. Over the past 3 decades, DOD's acquisition environment has undergone many changes aimed at curbing cost, schedule, and other problems. In order to determine if the policy DOD put in place is achieving its intended goals, we assessed the outcomes of major weapons development programs initiated under the revised policy. Additionally, we assessed whether the policy's knowledge-based, evolutionary principles are being effectively implemented, and whether effective controls and specific criteria are in place and being used to make sound investment decisions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Changes made in DOD's acquisition policy over the past 5 years have not eliminated cost and schedule problems for major weapons development programs. Of the 23 major programs we assessed, 10 are already expecting development cost overruns greater than 30 percent or have delayed the delivery of initial operational capability to the warfighter by at least 1 year. The overall impact of these costly conditions is a reduction in the value of DOD's defense dollars and a lower return on investment. Poor execution of the revised acquisition policy is a major cause of DOD's continued problems. DOD frequently bypasses key steps of the knowledge-based process outlined in the policy, falls short of attaining key knowledge, and continues to pursue revolutionary--rather than evolutionary or incremental--advances in capability. Nearly 80 percent of the programs GAO reviewed did not fully follow the knowledge-based process to develop a sound business case before committing to system development. Most of the programs we reviewed started system development with immature technologies, and half of the programs that have held design reviews did so before achieving a high level of design maturity. These practices increase the likelihood that problems will be discovered late in development when they are more costly to address. Furthermore, DOD's continued pursuit of revolutionary leaps in capability also runs counter to the policy's guidance. DOD has not closed all of the gaps in the policy that GAO identified nearly 3 years ago, particularly with regard to adding controls and criteria. Effective controls require decision makers to measure progress against specific criteria and ensure that managers capture key knowledge before moving to the next acquisition phase. However, DOD's policy continues to allow managers to approach major investment decisions with many unknowns. Without effective controls that require program officials to satisfy specific criteria, it is difficult to hold decision makers or program managers accountable to cost and schedule targets. In this environment, decision-making transparency is crucial, but DOD is lacking in this area as well."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s planned investment in research, development, and procurement of  major weapon systems will total approximately $1.3 trillion between 2005  and 2009, with over $800 billion of that investment yet to be made. DOD is  facing a significant number of problems in managing its acquisitions.  Military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq are consuming a large share of  DOD resources and causing the department to invest more money sooner  than expected to replace or fix existing weapons. Meanwhile, DOD is  intent on transforming military operations while pursuing multiple  megasystems that are expected to be the most expensive and complex  ever. These costly conditions coupled with increases in spending for other  national priorities, such as health care and social security, make it  essential that DOD effectively leverage its investments, particularly in  weapon system acquisitions. If DOD manages its current portfolio of  weapons within traditional margins of error, the financial consequences  could be dire.", "DOD\u2019s strategy for acquiring major weapon systems has traditionally been  to plan programs that would achieve a big leap forward in capability  within a single development program, a strategy that often results in major  cost and schedule problems. We have assessed weapon acquisitions as a  high-risk area for 15 years, and although U.S. weapons are among the best  in the world, the programs to acquire them have continued to produce  poor cost and schedule outcomes. However, the current defense  acquisition environment continues to be characterized by cost and  schedule growth, a lack of confidence by congressional and DOD leaders,  and no appreciable improvement in the defense acquisition system. DOD  knows what to do to achieve better outcomes. It has written into policy an  approach that advocates that adequate knowledge be attained at critical  junctures before DOD managers agree to invest more money in the next  phase of weapon system development. The policy also emphasizes  evolutionary principles for acquiring weapons rather than trying to achieve  a big leap forward in capability within a single development program. We  have reported in the past that DOD\u2019s revised policy does not incorporate  adequate controls to ensure the effective implementation of a knowledge- based, evolutionary acquisition process. However, DOD believes that the  policy includes the necessary controls to achieve effective outcomes.", "You requested that we evaluate DOD\u2019s compliance with and  implementation of its revised acquisition policy intended to produce better  cost, schedule, and performance outcomes for major acquisition  programs. In order to obtain an early assessment of the cost and schedule  impact of the revised policy, and to assess DOD\u2019s effectiveness in  implementing a knowledge-based, evolutionary acquisition approach we  assessed (1) the cost and schedule status of major weapons development  programs initiated under the revised policy, (2) whether the policy\u2019s  knowledge-based, evolutionary acquisition principles are being effectively  implemented, and (3) whether effective controls and specific criteria are  in place and being used to make sound investment decisions.", "In conducting our evaluation, we reviewed pertinent acquisition statutes,  policies, and guidance; analyzed development cost and schedule data for  23 major acquisition programs approved to start system development  under DOD\u2019s revised acquisition policy between October 2000 and  December 2004; conducted case study reviews of nine of those   23 programs; and interviewed officials from the Office of Secretary of  Defense and each of the military services. We conducted our review from  May 2005 to February 2006 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Additional information about our  methodology is contained in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Historically, DOD\u2019s programs for acquiring major weapon systems have  taken longer, cost more, and often delivered fewer quantities and other  capabilities than planned. GAO has documented these problems for  decades. In 1970, GAO reported that considerable cost growth had been  and was continuing to occur on many current development programs.  Since that report was issued, numerous changes have been made to DOD\u2019s  acquisition process and environment to try to improve acquisition  outcomes. Those changes include numerous executive branch initiatives  and legislative actions as well as roughly 11 revisions to DOD\u2019s acquisition  policy between 1971 and 2005. Despite these efforts, defense acquisition  programs in the past 3 decades continued to routinely experience cost  overruns, schedule slips, and performance shortfalls.", "Figure 1 illustrates the continued problem of development cost overruns.  The figure depicts the combined cost overruns for large development  programs (programs totaling more than $1 billion for research,  development, testing and evaluation in fiscal year 2005 dollars) in each of  the past 3 decades. The figure also identifies some of the major studies and  improvement efforts initiated during this time frame. As the figure  illustrates, efforts to improve acquisition outcomes have not been  successful in curbing acquisition cost problems. Programs initiated in the  1970s exceeded DOD\u2019s initial investment estimate by 30 percent, or   $13 billion (in fiscal year 2005 dollars), and similar outcomes continued  during the subsequent decades despite numerous reform efforts and policy  revisions.", "Since the mid-1990s, we have studied the best practices of leading  commercial companies. Taking into account the differences between  commercial product development and weapons acquisitions, we  articulated a best practices product development model that relies on  increasing knowledge when developing new products, separating  technology development from product development, and following an  evolutionary or incremental product development approach. This  knowledge-based approach requires developers to make investment  decisions on the basis of specific, measurable levels of knowledge at  critical junctures before investing more money and before advancing to  the next phase of acquisition. An evolutionary product development  process defines the individual increments on the basis of mature  technologies and a feasible design that are matched with firm  requirements. Each increment should be managed as a separate and  distinct acquisition effort with its own cost, schedule and performance  baseline. An increment that excludes one of these key elements puts an  extra burden on decision makers and provides a weak foundation for  making development cost and schedule estimates. The knowledge-based,  evolutionary approach in our model is intended to help reduce  development risks and to achieve better program outcomes on a more  consistent basis.", "Hoping to improve acquisition outcomes, DOD leaders initiated significant  revisions to the department\u2019s acquisition policy again in October 2000, by  adopting the knowledge-based, evolutionary system development  approach. We reported in November 2003, that much of the revised policy  agrees with GAO\u2019s extensive body of work and that of successful  commercial firms. DOD\u2019s revised policy emphasizes the importance of and  provides a good framework for capturing knowledge about critical  technologies, product design, and manufacturing processes. If properly  implemented and enforced this approach could help DOD\u2019s decision  makers gain the confidence they need to make significant and sound  investment decisions for major weapon systems. Furthermore, the policy\u2019s  emphasis on evolutionary system development sets up a more manageable  environment for achieving knowledge. We also noted that DOD\u2019s policy  strongly suggests the separation of technology development from system  development, a best practice that helps reduce technological risk at the  start of a program and makes cost and delivery estimates much more  predictable. Figure 2 depicts in general how DOD\u2019s revised policy adopts  key aspects of the best practices model.", "Although DOD took significant steps in the right direction, its policy does  not include controls that require program officials to meet the key criteria  that we believe are necessary for ensuring that acceptable levels of  knowledge are actually captured before making additional significant  investments. We previously recommended that DOD design and  implement necessary controls to ensure that appropriate knowledge is  captured and used to make decisions about moving a program forward  and investing more money at critical junctures. DOD officials  acknowledged the advantages of using knowledge-based controls, but  stated that they believed the policy already included enough controls to  achieve effective program results. The officials agreed to monitor the  acquisition process to assess the effectiveness of those controls and to  determine whether additional ones are necessary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Revised Policy Has Not Improved Development Program Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["The cost and schedule outcomes being achieved by development programs  initiated since DOD first issued its revised policy have not improved over  those achieved by programs managed under prior versions of the policy.  Of the 23 major programs we assessed, 10 have already reported estimated  development cost growth greater than 30 percent or expected delays of at  least 1 year in delivery of an initial operational capability to the warfighter.  These programs combined represent a cost increase of $23 billion (in  fiscal year 2005 dollars) and an average delay in delivery of initial  capability of around 2 years. Most of the other programs were still in the  early stages as of December 2005 with over half of system development  remaining and had not yet reported an adequate amount of cost or  schedule data to effectively analyze their progress. Table 1 contains the  cost and schedule increases for the 23 programs we assessed, expressed  as a percentage of each program\u2019s development estimate.", "The Army\u2019s Future Combat System is a case in point. Less than 3 years  after program initiation and with $4.6 billion invested, the Army has  already increased its development cost estimate $8.9 billion or 48 percent  and delayed delivery of initial capability by 4 years over the original  business case. Similarly, just over 1 year after initiating development of the  Aerial Common Sensor aircraft, the Army has reported that severe weight  and design problems discovered during development have stopped work  on the program. As a result, program officials are anticipating at least a   45 percent cost increase and a delay of 2 years in delivering an initial  capability to the warfighter. These two Army programs are not the only  ones experiencing problems. Table 2 contains cost and schedule data for   6 of the 10 largest development programs initiated under the revised  policy, including the Future Combat System and Aerial Common Sensor.  As the table illustrates there are several programs experiencing large cost  increases and schedule delays.", "A good measure of acquisition performance is return on investment as  expressed in acquisition program unit cost because unit cost represents  the value DOD is getting for its acquisition dollars invested in a certain  program. The programs listed in table 2 will not achieve the return on  investment that DOD anticipated when they began development. In the  case of Joint Strike Fighter, for example, DOD initially intended to  purchase 2,866 aircraft at an acquisition program unit cost of about   $66 million. The Navy has reduced the number of Joint Strike Fighter  aircraft it plans to buy; technology and design problems encountered  during development have led to the significant cost growth. As a result, the  acquisition program unit cost is now about $84 million, an increase of   27 percent. We recently reported that the risk of even greater increases is  likely because flight testing has not yet started and the acquisition strategy  involves substantial overlap of development and production. Similar  problems have led to increases in the Future Combat System program. At  program initiation, the Army anticipated that each of 15 units would cost  about $5.5 billion to develop and deliver. Since that time, instability in the  program\u2019s technologies and requirements have led to significant cost  increases, leading to a 54 percent increase in acquisition program unit  cost, now estimated to be $8.5 billion.", "Regarding all 23 development programs, DOD leaders originally planned to  invest a total of about $83 billion (fiscal year 2005 dollars) for system  development and anticipated delivering an initial operational capability to  the warfighter in 77 months on average. However, development costs have  grown and delivery schedules have been delayed significantly. DOD now  expects to invest over $106 billion in those same programs, an increase of  over $23 billion or 28 percent.

The rationale  should address the key knowledge-based criteria appropriate for milestone  decisions, explain why a program\u2019s level of knowledge in each area was  deemed acceptable if criteria have not been met and provide a plan for  achieving the knowledge necessary to meet criteria within a given time frame."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD provided written comments on a draft of this report. The comments  appear in appendix II.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary of  Defense should establish specific controls to insure that program officials  demonstrate that they have captured a level of knowledge that meets or  exceeds specific criteria at three key points in the acquisition process:  program start, design readiness review, and production commitment. DOD  agreed that knowledge-based decision making is consistent with sound  business practice and stated that it would continue to develop policy that  reflects a knowledge-based approach and improves acquisition outcomes.  DOD noted that it would consider our recommendations as it reassesses  the DOD acquisition business model and the knowledge required at each  decision point. We believe that DOD\u2019s plan to reassess its business model  provides a good opportunity to establish the controls and specific criteria  recommended in this report. Therefore, we are retaining our  recommendation that the Secretary of Defense should establish controls  to insure that program officials demonstrate that they have captured a  level of knowledge that meets or exceeds specific criteria at three key  points in the acquisition process.", "DOD also partially concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary  of Defense require decision makers to provide written rationale in  acquisition decision documentation for each major decision. DOD agreed  that acquisition decisions should be documented, decision makers should  be held accountable, and that they should provide the rationale for their  decisions. DOD believes that the implementation of Section 801 of the  National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2006 reinforces these  processes. The act calls for the decision maker to certify that the program  meets certain requirements, such as technology maturity, prior to starting  a new development program at Milestone B. However, the act is focused  on the decision to start a development program and does not identify  specific criteria for programs to be measured against at design readiness  review or production commitment. We believe our recommendation adds  transparency and accountability to the process because it requires the  decision maker to provide the rationale for a decision to allow a program  to move forward, not only at Milestone B but at other key decision points  as well. Therefore, we are retaining our recommendation that the  Secretary of Defense require decision makers to provide written rationale  for each major decision in acquisition decision documentation.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense; the  Secretaries of the Air Force, Army, and Navy; and the Director of the  Office of Management and Budget.

We collected our data  from Selected Acquisition Reports, presidential budget documents,  ongoing GAO work, and pertinent program officials. We utilized previous  GAO reports related to defense acquisition policies and worked with  knowledgeable GAO staff to ensure the use of current, accurate data.

Our case study  programs were the Aerial Common Sensor, Multi-Platform Radar  Technology Insertion Program, Global Hawk Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,  Small Diameter Bomb, Future Combat System, Joint Strike Fighter,  Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle, Multi-Mission Maritime Aircraft, and the  E-2 Advanced Hawkeye. We interacted directly with numerous program  officials to seek input on current developments with their programs. We  studied program documents to assess how well programs understand and  are implementing the revised acquisition policy. We also analyzed drawing  release data for those programs that have either passed their design  review or have provided GAO with estimated drawing release data for a  future design review to assess design maturity. In several cases, we asked  that program offices verify information in these various documents.", "We also reviewed Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5000.1, DOD  Instruction 5000.2, and the Defense Acquisition Guidebook.
