Although the cleanup is complete, its sufficiency has not yet been ascertained; key steps remain before the planned Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge that will occupy the site can open to the public. For example, in about November 2006, the regulatory agencies--the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment--plan to issue their joint final decision on the sufficiency of the cleanup and any risk posed by residual contaminants. The total cost of the cleanup, since 1995, is about $10 billion in constant 2005 dollars. This cost includes contract costs of about $7.7 billion (including contractor fees of about $630 million), long-term stewardship and pension liabilities estimated at about $1.3 billion, and other costs of nearly $1 billion. Although numerous measures in place to assess the cleanup appear adequate to judge the sufficiency of the cleanup, DOE did not effectively carry out some aspects of its oversight responsibilities. Among the assessment measures are completion of the regulatory process, activities undertaken to verify remedial actions, and reviews by independent and federal entities. The regulatory agencies have approved the cleanup of 360 areas of known or suspected contamination at the site. Data supporting the cleanup of these areas form the basis of regulatory decisions regarding the cleanup's sufficiency. Accordingly, we reviewed the contractor's controls intended to ensure the quality of these data and found them to be robust. However, DOE lacked assurance that the controls were working as intended because it did not independently assess the quality of these key data. One official told us that DOE was involved daily in reviewing documents and discussed with the contractor any data quality issues that arose. DOE has identified and implemented at other sites some lessons from Rocky Flats, but DOE has not systematically tracked lessons learned at all of its cleanup sites, thus potentially losing the benefits of such lessons."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Once a bustling nuclear weapons production complex employing  thousands of workers, the Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) Rocky Flats site,  near Denver, Colorado, is being transformed into a wildlife refuge that will  be managed by the Department of the Interior\u2019s Fish and Wildlife Service  (FWS). For about 40 years, the Rocky Flats plant produced plutonium  triggers, or \u201cpits,\u201d for nuclear weapons. That activity resulted in  radiological and chemical contamination of some of the site\u2019s buildings,  soil, and water. Cleanup of the site began in 1995 under a contract between  DOE and Kaiser-Hill Company L.L.C., and included decontaminating and  demolishing several plutonium-processing buildings, one of which had  been labeled \u201cthe most dangerous building in America,\u201d along with  hundreds of other contaminated buildings and structures. The cleanup  required the contractor to remove large volumes of nuclear material and  radioactive debris, and investigate and remediate as necessary  contamination at 360 individual hazardous substance sites that were  identified through historical records and extensive sampling and analysis at  the site in the early 1990s. In total, according to GAO\u2019s calculations, the  amount of cleanup waste that had to be removed from the site was  equivalent to a 65-story building the length and width of a football field.", "Cleanup of the site was conducted under the Rocky Flats Cleanup  Agreement, the legally binding agreement that provided the framework for  the cleanup effort. The cleanup agreement implements the provisions of  the applicable statutes, including the Comprehensive Environmental  Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (CERCLA); the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as  amended (RCRA); and the Colorado Hazardous Waste Act. The cleanup  agreement specified the roles of DOE and the two regulatory agencies for  the site:  the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Colorado  Department of Public Health and Environment (Colorado). Pursuant to the  cleanup agreement, EPA had lead regulatory authority over the cleanup of  the site\u2019s buffer zone, which includes about 5,900 acres of undeveloped  land around the center of the site, while Colorado had lead regulatory  authority over the cleanup of the core industrial area\u2014which includes  about 385 acres in the center of the site, where the plutonium-processing  activities occurred.", "When GAO reported on the cleanup effort in February 2001, the project  was behind schedule and over cost. However, in October 2005, the  contractor declared that it had finished the physical cleanup of the site, as  defined in the contract (e.g., demolishing buildings and shipping  contaminated waste and soil off site), much earlier and at less cost than  DOE and the contractor had anticipated 5 years earlier. Although the  cleanup is complete, its sufficiency has not yet been ascertained. EPA\u2019s and  Colorado\u2019s joint final decision on the sufficiency of the cleanup and the  final remedy for the site is expected to be published around November  2006. With the exception of one pedestrian trail, most of the planned  wildlife refuge will not open until at least 5 years after the refuge is  established (depending on the availability of funding).", "In this context, we determined the (1) factors that contributed to the  physical cleanup\u2019s early completion; (2) work remaining to be done as well  as total project costs, including long-term costs; (3) measures in place to  assess whether the cleanup achieved a level of protection of public health  and environment consistent with the Rocky Flats Cleanup Agreement; and  (4) lessons the Rocky Flats project may hold for other DOE cleanup  projects.", "In conducting our work, we visited the Rocky Flats site several times and  reviewed documents and data prepared by DOE, EPA, Colorado, FWS, the  contractor, and various scientific organizations. We reviewed and analyzed  agency and contractor documents on decontamination and demolition  accomplishments and techniques. We also analyzed documents related to  the cost-plus-incentive-fee contract, including contract negotiation  documents, the contract cost and fee structure, and contract modifications,  although we did not evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the contract. We  reviewed and analyzed cleanup verification strategies and results, and  reviewed the content of scientific analyses, including a study of how  actinides migrate through soil and water and an assessment of the public  health risk posed by contaminants remaining at the site, but did not  evaluate the science underlying them. In addition, because decisions about  the sufficiency of the cleanup have been and will be based on remediation  data, we assessed the soundness of the agencies\u2019 and contractor\u2019s  processes and procedures for ensuring the quality of these data. We also  reviewed the results of audits of the key laboratories used by the  contractor to analyze samples of radioactively contaminated soil.", "For further review, we selected a nonprobability sample of four of Rocky  Flats\u2019 360 cleanup areas (including areas referred to as individual  hazardous substance sites, potential areas of concern, and under-building  contamination sites), using criteria such as the location of the cleanup area  and the severity of its contamination. For these four individual cleanup  areas\u2014building 771, the 903 pad, the 903 lip area, and trench T-7\u2014we  assessed the closeout reports and the data supporting them to determine  the extent to which the data collection and laboratory analyses adhered to  data quality standards and procedures. For example, we reviewed records  of laboratory analyses of contaminated soil samples from the areas, and  documents showing the extent to which the projects adhered to stated data  quality objectives. We did not evaluate the remedial data or laboratory  analyses themselves.", "Further, to obtain citizen and local government views about community  input to the cleanup and the effect of various cleanup verification activities,  we surveyed 58 current and past members of the two local community  groups that served in an advisory capacity to DOE:  the Rocky Flats  Citizens Advisory Board and the Rocky Flats Coalition of Local  Governments. We also attended monthly meetings of these two groups. We  interviewed officials of DOE, EPA, Colorado, FWS, the contractor, and  various scientific organizations. We conducted our work in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards from March 2005  through May 2006. In September 2005, we briefed you and your staff and  reported on the preliminary results of our review.  Details on our  objectives, scope, and methodology are in appendix I; summary survey  results are in appendix II."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["For nearly 40 years, the Rocky Flats plant, located about 16 miles  northwest of downtown Denver, served as a nuclear weapons production  facility. Afterward, the site bore the scars of that role:  soil, groundwater,  surface water, and many of the buildings at the site were contaminated  with radioactive materials, such as plutonium and uranium; toxic metals,  such as beryllium; and hazardous chemicals, such as cleaning solvents and  degreasers. Accordingly, the site became one of DOE\u2019s priorities for  environmental cleanup. While most of the approximately 6,300 acres that  make up the Rocky Flats site served through the years as an undeveloped  buffer zone, about one-half of a square mile (385 acres) in the center of the  site constituted the industrial area, where for decades, plutonium was  shaped into plutonium triggers or \u201cpits\u201d for use in nuclear weapons. About  one-fourth of the site\u2019s more than 800 original structures (e.g., buildings  and storage tanks) were radiologically or chemically contaminated\u2014some  severely so\u2014by site operations over the years.", "The site was cleaned up under the terms of a contract between DOE and  Kaiser-Hill. The first contract took effect July 1, 1995. In late 1999, DOE and  Kaiser-Hill negotiated a new contract, which took effect on February 1,  2000. The cleanup work was done predominantly by subcontractors, under  the contractor\u2019s management.", "The 2000 contract specified both the contractor\u2019s and DOE\u2019s  responsibilities. The contractor was responsible for processing, packaging,  and shipping off site all of Rocky Flats\u2019 nuclear materials and radioactive  and hazardous wastes; cleaning up and demolishing more than 700  structures that remained on site in February 2000; and cleaning up the site\u2019s  contaminated soil and groundwater. DOE was required to provide a variety  of services and items to support the project. Essentially, the contract  required DOE to arrange receiver sites for all the materials and wastes and  obtain the necessary certifications for the containers in which the materials  and wastes had to be packed and shipped. Many DOE sites played a  significant role in Rocky Flats\u2019 cleanup and closure, especially those sites  that received materials or wastes from Rocky Flats, such as the Savannah  River Site in South Carolina, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in New  Mexico, the Nevada Test Site, and the Hanford Site in Washington.", "Much of the cleanup work at Rocky Flats was labor intensive and tedious.  Plutonium is dangerous to human health, even in minute quantities,  especially if inhaled or ingested. Accordingly, workers handling plutonium- contaminated materials and equipment had to wear cumbersome  protective suits with enclosed respiratory systems, and sometimes had to  wield heavy and ungainly tools. Also, the equipment being worked on had  to be enclosed within plastic or glass to prevent airborne contaminants  from reaching unprotected workers or surfaces. Figure 1 shows workers in  protective clothing cutting contaminated materials to fit shipping  containers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Four Key Factors Contributed to Early Cleanup", "paragraphs": ["Four key factors contributed to the early completion of the physical  cleanup of Rocky Flats: (1) DOE and the contractor overcame several  major challenges identified in GAO\u2019s 2001 report on the Rocky Flats  cleanup, (2) DOE and the site\u2019s regulatory agencies agreed to use an  accelerated process to clean up the site, (3) a number of site-specific  characteristics combined to limit the scope and complexity of the cleanup  effort, and (4) DOE offered the contractor $560 million in total incentive  fees to finish the cleanup ahead of schedule and under cost."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOE and Contractor Overcame Previously Identified Cleanup Challenges", "paragraphs": ["The first key factor that contributed to the early completion of the physical  cleanup of Rocky Flats was that DOE and the contractor resolved four of  the five major challenges we identified in our 2001 report. These challenges  included (1) completing the decontamination and demolition of the site\u2019s  structures; (2) overcoming limitations on the available number of  transportation casks and on the loading capability for transuranic waste;  (3) identifying the overall scope of the cleanup project\u2014specifically, the  extent of contamination, the eventual use of the site, and the level of  cleanup that eventual use would require; (4) getting the automated  plutonium-packaging system to reliably perform at the rate needed for  timely completion; and (5) preventing safety problems, which can result in  work shutdowns and delay cleanup work."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Completing Decontamination and Demolition of Structures", "paragraphs": ["One major challenge DOE and the contractor overcame was completing the  decontamination and demolition of hundreds of structures at the site. At  the end of fiscal year 2000, the contractor had completed only about 10  percent of the predemolition work, which included activities such as  removing plutonium and other nuclear materials from furnaces, pipes, and  other locations within buildings; draining and removing plutonium- or  uranium-laden liquids or residues from process pipes and tanks;  dismantling plutonium-processing furnaces; stripping out contaminated  process pipelines; and cutting up and removing hundreds of contaminated  gloveboxes. Further, at the time of our 2001 report, the contractor had  demolished only 81 of the 802 structures that existed at the site when  cleanup began. That accomplishment equated to about 10 percent of the  total number of structures and only about 5 percent of the total square  footage. Remaining to be demolished at the end of fiscal year 2000 were 721  structures, encompassing about 3.4 million square feet.", "DOE and the contractor overcame challenges to decontamination and  demolition primarily through innovation, as workers continuously sought  innovative cleanup technologies that would accomplish tasks more safely,  quickly, and cheaply. For example, the contractor found that it could  chemically decontaminate large pieces of equipment, such as tanks and gloveboxes, by wiping their surfaces with a liquid cerium nitrate solution.   By doing so, the contractor could reduce the contamination enough that  the contaminated object could be shipped as low-level radioactive waste  rather than transuranic waste, which requires a more costly shipping and  disposal process. The Rocky Flats buildings contained approximately 1,475  gloveboxes, ranging from shoe box size to the size of an entire room. By  reducing the level of contamination, the contractor could ship even large  gloveboxes whole, rather than having to cut them into pieces small enough  to fit into standard waste boxes used for shipping transuranic waste. Figure  2 shows workers using cerium nitrate to decontaminate a glovebox and  loading a dismantled, decontaminated glovebox into a container for  shipping.", "The use of explosives in building demolition was another important time- saving demolition technique. Contractor officials said they had learned  lessons from another DOE site at which DOE had doubted the demolitions  experts and reduced the amount of explosives used, resulting in an  explosion that failed to bring the structure down. At Rocky Flats,  accordingly, the contractor and DOE brought in demolitions experts and,  while closely reviewing the demolition plans and overseeing the work, let  the experts\u2019 opinions prevail. As a result, the use of explosives saved time  and money for the contractor and DOE. For example, in bringing down  building 881, one of the four original manufacturing facilities at Rocky  Flats, a contractor official estimated that the use of explosives saved about  4 months, and reduced risks to workers by removing hazards associated  with heavy equipment and the falling debris that typically results from their  use in lieu of explosives. After being completely decontaminated, building  881 was wired with explosives and, as shown in figure 3, collapsed into its  basement.", "In addition to building 881, the contractor used explosives to bring down  smaller facilities, such as the guard and water towers, and to separate the  concrete from the rebar (the steel reinforcing bar) on the walls of building  886.", "Additional information on decontamination and demolition activities at  Rocky Flats is contained in appendix III."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overcoming Limitations on Shipping and Transportation Capabilities", "paragraphs": ["A second challenge DOE and the contractor overcame was limitations on  the available number of transportation casks and on the loading capability  for transuranic waste. At the time of our 2001 report, the contractor\u2019s  ability to ship the total volume of waste off site to DOE\u2019s WIPP facility by  the target closure date was in doubt because of uncertainties about  whether DOE could obtain and provide the number of transportation casks  necessary to meet the contractor\u2019s projected shipping schedule, especially  for fiscal years 2002 and 2003, and because of uncertainties about whether  the three loading facilities (two of which were still under construction at  the time of our 2000 review) would be able to meet the shipping schedule  for the site\u2019s peak shipping years. That shipping schedule had been  compressed by various events, including delays in the opening of WIPP.", "DOE and the contractor overcame this challenge primarily through  cooperation and perseverance. Whenever a DOE site could not use a  shipping container as scheduled, WIPP would send the container to Rocky  Flats instead. Also, DOE headquarters maintained a high priority on Rocky  Flats throughout the cleanup and made sure that it received the  government-furnished services and items it needed. Figure 4 shows special  transportation casks used to transport transuranic waste.", "Also, while buildings at Rocky Flats were being demolished, the contractor  built the two additional loading facilities, as previously mentioned, to  ensure that loading and shipping schedules could be supported. The new  facilities resolved the challenge of inadequate loading capability and  allowed the contractor to increase its transuranic waste-shipping capability  to 15 shipments a week."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Identifying the Overall Scope of the Cleanup", "paragraphs": ["A third major challenge DOE and the contractor overcame was identifying  the overall scope of the cleanup\u2014specifically, the extent of contamination,  the eventual use of the site, and the level of cleanup that eventual use  would require. At the time of our 2001 report, the postcleanup use of the  site\u2014and, therefore, the level of cleanup required\u2014was uncertain.  Moreover, the extent of soil contamination on the site and the depth and  degree of contamination under many of the former production buildings  was not fully understood, particularly in the former industrial area, because  parts of the site had not been fully sampled. Finally, at the time of our 2001  report, DOE, the regulatory agencies, and the community stakeholders had  not yet reached agreement on an appropriate level of soil cleanup, although  various studies were under way. These challenges were resolved through  congressional intervention and community collaboration.", "Congressional action ended the uncertainty about the end use of the site  with passage of the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge Act of 2001  (Refuge Act). Knowing the site\u2019s end use enabled DOE and the regulatory  agencies to then make assumptions about site users and their risk of  exposure to residual contamination. The risk posed to a person by  exposure to a contaminant is measured by a combination of the  contaminant\u2019s toxicity, together with the frequency, pathway, and duration  of exposure. Thus, a more stringent cleanup level is required for a site that  will be used constantly, such as for residential purposes, than for a site that  will be used sporadically, such as for recreational purposes. Once the  Refuge Act was passed, DOE and the regulatory agencies assumed that the  principal site users would be wildlife refuge workers, who would spend  about 8 hours a day at the site (4 hours indoors and 4 hours outdoors), 250  days a year, for 18.7 years; and refuge visitors, who would spend about 2.5  hours a day at the site, 100 days a year, for 30 years (6 years as a child and  24 years as an adult). Soil cleanup levels could then be set at a level that  would protect both types of users.", "DOE collaborated with the community in determining the level of  remediation the cleanup would achieve. Before passage of the Refuge Act,  the Rocky Flats Cleanup Agreement had specified an interim soil cleanup  level (action level) of 651 picocuries of plutonium per gram (pCi/g) of soil,  meaning that a soil cleanup action would be triggered by a soil sample indicating the existence of plutonium in excess of 651 pCi/g. This action  level was considered unacceptable by the two stakeholder community  groups: the Rocky Flats Citizens Advisory Board and the Rocky Flats  Coalition of Local Governments; these groups argued for a much more  stringent action level. DOE funded a community-directed, independent  scientific assessment of soil action levels. This independent assessment  was overseen by a panel of community representatives. DOE also funded a  workshop, organized by the Rocky Flats Citizens Advisory Board, featuring  experts who provided presentations on radiological assessments, risk  analyses, and various computer-modeling scenarios and assumptions.  Working with local governments and members of the public, DOE and the  regulatory agencies ultimately agreed on a soil action level of 50 picocuries  of plutonium per gram (pCi/g) of surface soil (i.e., the top 3 feet of soil),  meaning that a remedial action would be triggered by a soil sample  indicating the existence of plutonium in excess of 50 pCi/g. A plutonium  level of 50 pCi/g translates to a risk level of 1 in 500,000 (that is, this level of  contamination could result in one more case of cancer than otherwise  would have been expected in every 500,000 persons). DOE and the  regulatory agencies decided that, with a surface soil action level of 50  pCi/g, higher concentrations of plutonium in soil could remain at greater  depth. Accordingly, DOE and the regulatory agencies agreed to set an  action level of 3,000 pCi/g for depths of 3 to 6 feet below the surface,  depending on the extent of the contamination. Once a remedial action was  triggered, cleanup would continue until contamination greater than 1,000  pCi/g had been removed.", "In addition to collaborating on decisions about soil cleanup levels,  community groups provided comments and advice on many other aspects  of the cleanup that influenced DOE\u2019s decisions in some cases. Our survey  of the Rocky Flats Citizens Advisory Board and the Rocky Flats Coalition  of Local Governments found that 21 of the 25 respondents were very or  somewhat satisfied with how DOE engaged the group in the cleanup  process. Also, 19 of the 25 respondents said they were very or somewhat  satisfied with how DOE used the group\u2019s input. Nearly all (23 of 25) said  they believed the groups\u2019 input had a very or somewhat positive effect on  the cleanup process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Problems with Automated Plutonium-Packaging System", "paragraphs": ["The unreliable functioning of the automated plutonium-packaging system  is the only one of the five challenges we identified in 2001 that DOE and the  contractor never fully resolved. It was only through persistence and \u201cbrute  force\u201d that the packaging was finally completed in July 2003, more than a  year late and at least $50 million over budget. The system never worked  reliably, and many of the processes that were designed to be automated  had to be done manually. It required continuous maintenance and  modification, and broke down as many as two or three times a day,  requiring a \u201ctriage\u201d repair team on call 24 hours a day. Nevertheless,  according to DOE officials, the pursuit of any alternative to the system  would probably have resulted in even greater cost and schedule delays.  Figure 5 shows GAO officials and staff being briefed on the glovebox line  behind the automated plutonium-packaging system; this glovebox line  handled the prepackaging of wet combustibles.", "The final challenge that DOE and the contractor overcame was safety  problems, which can result in shutdowns and delay cleanup work. At the  time of our 2001 report, DOE was concerned about the number and  severity of safety violations that had occurred since the inception of the  2000 contract. In response to those concerns, the contractor developed a  comprehensive plan to improve its safety and compliance performance.", "Although some safety incidents occurred after our 2001 report, the  contractor\u2019s overall safety performance improved. In two key measures of  safety, for example, Rocky Flats\u2019 performance was considerably better than  the average performance in the construction industry. One of these  measures is total recordable cases (TRC). Recordable cases, in general, are  any that require \u201cmore than a Band-Aid,TM\u201d according to a contractor safety  official\u2014for example, an injury that requires stitches, prescription  medication, or 1 or more days away from work. At Rocky Flats, the 12- month TRC rolling average at the end of 2004 was 0.9 per 100 full-time  workers. This was a significant improvement over the 7.6 rate that existed  at the site in July 1995, when Kaiser-Hill took over from the previous  contractor. By comparison, the TRC average in the construction industry  for calendar year 2004 was 6.4 per 100 full-time workers. The contractually  established limit for TRCs at Rocky Flats was a 12-month rolling average of  3.5 per 100 full-time workers. Using the other key measure of safety, lost  workdays, Rocky Flats also performed well. At the end of 2004, the site\u2019s  12-month rolling average rate for lost workday cases was 0.2, much lower  than the site\u2019s July 1995 rate of 4.6 and well below the construction industry  rate of 2.4 for calendar year 2004. The contractually established limit for  lost workdays at Rocky Flats was a 12-month rolling average rate of 2.0.", "The contractor\u2019s safety director reported that these safety improvements  were achieved through a combination of actions, including getting the  Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, and other top  management officials involved; improving the work-planning process to  incorporate job-hazards analyses; involving the workers early in safety- planning and job-hazards analyses; holding first-line supervisors (i.e.,  foremen) responsible for informing workers of top management\u2019s emphasis  on safety; and improving the training provided to workers. The site  developed a course, commonly known as Rocky Flats 101, that contained a  hands-on, simulated work environment in which workers learned how to  use ladders and various other tools in contaminated spaces. The course  was very effective, according to the safety director."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Accelerated Cleanup Process Allowed Faster, More Collaborative Work", "paragraphs": ["The second key factor that contributed to the early completion of the  physical cleanup of Rocky Flats was the use of an accelerated cleanup  process. The Rocky Flats cleanup began in the late 1980s and early 1990s  with extensive characterization (sampling of soil, groundwater, surface  water, and air). But after several years of characterization, public  frustration was building at the lack of visible progress in cleaning up the  contamination at the site. According to DOE officials, the extensive  sampling that was done at the site in the late 1980s and early 1990s,  together with historical documents about the use and disposal of materials  and wastes, facilitated use of the accelerated process. Instead of  proceeding under the full CERCLA/RCRA process, the Rocky Flats Cleanup  Agreement authorized DOE to perform most of the cleanup through  removal actions. In a 1996 report, we recommended that DOE make greater  use of removal actions to increase the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of  cleanups. Under the accelerated process, cleanup actions, including soil  removal, occur early and throughout the process rather than at the end,  with confirmation sampling at each cleanup area to ensure that the  remediation was sufficient. DOE officials report that the accelerated  process allowed more timely removal of contaminants from the site.", "The pace of work in reviewing and approving cleanup documents was  \u201cfrantic,\u201d according to Colorado officials. Colorado, DOE, and the  contractor agreed on a \u201creview template\u201d of documents Colorado needed  to see for each building and area; the template allowed Colorado officials  to provide immediate review by working closely with the contractor.", "Although the cleanup agreement specified that Colorado had 14 days (30  days in some cases) to review and provide comments on cleanup-related  documents, use of the review template shortened the review time  considerably. For example, the contractor would send draft documents to  Colorado officials, who would provide comments directly to the  contractor; the contractor then would respond by making corrections,  providing additional data or documents, or doing more work if necessary.  By working closely with the contractor along the way to resolve questions  or concerns, Colorado was able to respond quickly\u2014sometimes on the  same day\u2014to DOE\u2019s faxed requests for official approval of cleanup-related  documents. Colorado officials pointed out that had they not been willing to  work in this way with the contractor, but had instead taken the 14 or 30  days provided for review and approval under the cleanup agreement, the  contractor would not have been able to complete the cleanup as early as it  did. (DOE noted that Colorado\u2019s work with the contractor was not done  without DOE\u2019s involvement; as mentioned throughout the report, the entire  process was collaborative.)", "DOE, EPA, and Colorado agreed that the accelerated process and the  collaboration it fostered were essential to the cleanup\u2019s early completion.  According to EPA and Colorado officials, their agencies had staff on site  \u201ccontinuously,\u201d working in the field with DOE and contractor staff to  discuss and observe cleanup operations, and requiring \u201creal time\u201d changes  as necessary. Throughout the process, the regulatory agencies were  intimately involved in reviewing data and otherwise contributing to the  development of studies, plans, and decision documents. As a result, the  \u201cback end\u201d of the review process was very streamlined, according to  contractor officials.", "While the accelerated cleanup actions were under way, and as data from  the completed cleanup actions became available, DOE concurrently  conducted the remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS), which  summarizes site conditions at closure and evaluates necessary long-term  remedies, such as site monitoring. Based on all of the data collected at the  site, including the results of the individual accelerated cleanup actions and  the RI/FS, DOE will identify its preferred final remedy in the proposed plan,  which will be released for formal public comment once the final RI/FS has  been approved by EPA and Colorado. DOE shared the draft RI/FS with the  public and obtained EPA\u2019s and Colorado\u2019s comments on it; these comments  were considered during preparation of the final RI/FS. After considering  comments received on the proposed plan during a 60-day public comment  period, DOE will select and document its preferred remedy in the final  decision document.

Climatically and geologically, the semiarid  climate and the alluvial fan upon which the site is located contributed to  slow erosion of soils over time, thus inhibiting the off-site migration of  contaminants. The site also benefited from layers of shale and claystone\u2014 hundreds of feet thick in places\u2014that prevented contamination from  seeping into the deep drinking-water aquifer that underlies part of the site.", "Chemically, the cleanup was aided by the nature of the two key  contaminants\u2014plutonium and americium, which are essentially insoluble  in water and, instead, tend to bind to soil and sediment particles, according  to a study undertaken in the late 1990s. At Rocky Flats, there is little  groundwater movement, and no groundwater was contaminated with  plutonium and americium. Instead, soil was the predominant  environmental medium requiring cleanup. Remediation of contaminated  soil generally consists of digging it up and shipping it to a disposal site, a  simpler task than remediating groundwater. The contaminants move  around the site, and potentially off site, by surface-soil erosion, wind, or  surface water. For example, westerly winds spread contaminated soil to  off-site lands east of Rocky Flats. In a 1997 combined corrective action  decision/record of decision about these lands, EPA and Colorado  determined that the lands did not pose an unacceptable or significant risk  to human health or the environment, notwithstanding the low levels of  plutonium and americium that existed in the soil\u2014in portions of the  lands\u2014from Rocky Flats activities.", "Structurally, the robust construction of the plutonium-processing buildings,  with their thick concrete floors and walls, contained many leaks and spills  of radioactive and hazardous materials, thereby limiting the extent and  severity of contamination under the buildings. Building 371, for example,  was a complex, extremely strong, and rigid structure that was built to  withstand accidents such as earthquakes, tornadoes, winds, and fires. The  building was a partially buried structure of reinforced concrete with an  extensive foundation of concrete caissons up to 6 feet in diameter, drilled  into bedrock, and concrete wall and slab thicknesses beyond typical  industrial use and code requirements. Similarly, building 771 featured  concrete thicknesses ranging from 6.5 inches to more than 2 feet.", "Finally, the local economy was a factor in the success of the cleanup,  according to Colorado officials.

The contract  provided for an incentive fee tied partly to schedule but predominantly to  cost. The contractor would earn the target fee of $340 million if it  completed its work between December 16, 2006, and March 31, 2007, at a  cost between $4 billion and $4.2 billion. If the contractor completed the  cleanup outside of these schedule and cost ranges, the fee would rise or fall  accordingly\u2014to as much as $460 million for less costly, earlier completion,  or as little as $130 million for more costly, later completion. In 2003, when  officials saw that the contractor was confident of earning the maximum fee  and was no longer working aggressively to further shorten the completion  timeline or reduce costs, DOE approved a $100 million increase in the  maximum incentive fee. In the end, DOE awarded the contractor $49  million of the additional available fee, based on a reduction in the total  project cost of an additional $129 million.", "DOE also encouraged the contractor to continue its practice of sharing  incentive fees among its workforce by offering employees financial  incentives to continue to work safely and generate ideas for ways to save  costs and time. In its initial contract bid for the 1995 contract for the Rocky  Flats cleanup, Kaiser-Hill committed to share 20 percent of its profits with  employees. The contractor\u2019s president explained that incentives were  offered across the workforce, although the incentive type varied by work  group. Salaried employees were individually evaluated based on their  project and safety performance; the value of their incentive pay was based  on the final total project cost. For hourly employees, incentive pay was  determined though collective bargaining but was primarily based on  schedule performance. Steelworkers received an annual incentive bonus,  based on schedule performance; workers in the building trades received an  annual hourly increase, also based on schedule performance. The  contractor also had a safety incentive program that included spot cash  awards. Over the life of the project, the contractor distributed  approximately $100 million of company earnings (about 20 percent of its  $510 million incentive fee) to its workers, and DOE contributed an  additional $30 million that was used for incentive pay.", "According to the contractor, financial incentives for early or under-budget  completion of a project are a powerful motivator; however, it is important  to note that the financial incentive offered at Rocky Flats was only one of  many factors contributing to the early completion of the cleanup. In GAO\u2019s  experience, such incentives are not always this successful. As we reported  in December 2005, the Department of Defense has not fared well at using  incentive-fee contracts to improve cost-control behavior or meet program  goals. Specifically, about half of the 27 incentive-fee contracts included in  GAO\u2019s review failed or were projected to fail to meet a key measure of  program success\u2014completing the objective (i.e., delivering the product or  service specified by the contract) at or below the target price. Research on  incentive fees by GAO, Harvard University, and the RAND Corporation  going back decades has concluded that incentive fees do not consistently  motivate contractors to control cost.", "Additionally, according to the contractor, enhanced workforce transition  benefits could be considered important to worker motivation and  productivity. Enhanced benefits included pension and post-retirement  medical benefits and outplacement services such as relocation and  education benefits.", "Another unusual and critically important feature of the Rocky Flats  contract was consistent funding. An underlying premise of the contractor\u2019s  ability to finish the job early and under budget was that a stable source of  funding would be provided throughout the cleanup. As part of the contract  negotiation process, DOE and the contractor assumed an annual funding  level of $657 million per year. Both DOE headquarters and Congress helped  each year to ensure that the site received a consistent funding level. The  contract also stipulated the services and items that the government would  provide, including making a number of shipping containers available and  arranging treatment and disposal sites for radioactive waste at the site.

As of May 2006, EPA and  Colorado officials said they had approved the closeout reports on all 360  areas of known or suspected contamination at Rocky Flats and had  concluded that no further accelerated cleanup actions were necessary for  those areas. Closeout reports are the last step of a regulatory approach  that documented the accelerated cleanup actions taken, quantified  contaminants remaining after the cleanup actions were completed, and  documented whether the project goals had been met. The remediation of  each area of soil contamination at Rocky Flats followed a four-step  process:  characterization, contaminant remediation, confirmation  sampling, and clean fill and project documentation.", "The first step\u2014characterization\u2014identified whether contamination had  occurred. The contractor had to design a sampling and analysis approach  for each specific cleanup area and receive DOE\u2019s approval before  submitting the approach to the regulatory agencies for their review and approval. Once a potentially contaminated area was identified, the  contractor would propose one of several approaches to collect the  necessary samples. For example, the contractor might choose a standard  statistical sampling approach, which entails designing a sample grid  capable of identifying an elevated area of contamination with 90 percent  confidence, then applying that grid to the actual cleanup area. Sample  collection involved taking small scoops of dirt, which were analyzed in a  laboratory for a variety of contaminants such as metals, volatile organic  compounds, and radionuclides.", "The second step\u2014contaminant remediation\u2014cleans up any contaminants  that characterization found to exceed acceptable levels. Again, the  contractor would prepare a remediation plan, based on a standardized  approach for removing soil, in consultation with EPA, Colorado, and  members of the public, for EPA and Colorado to approve. Once approval  was granted, the contractor could proceed with the actual cleanup.  Cleanup typically involved digging out the contaminated soil, packaging it,  and shipping it to a licensed treatment or disposal facility. The depth to  which soil was removed varied depending on the type and severity of  contamination. In some areas, less than a foot of soil needed to be  removed; in other areas, 20 feet of soil needed to be removed. The  contractor took samples throughout the remediation to identify when the  remediation goal had been met and could then move on to the third step.  According to officials of both EPA and Colorado, they frequently directed  their staff to observe the cleanup actions to ensure they were being  implemented as agreed. Colorado officials said that, while the frequency  and duration of their oversight varied by project, daily interaction and  observation by Colorado staff was typical.", "The third step\u2014confirmation sampling\u2014required taking small scoops of  dirt from areas where the contractor believed remediation was complete,  and having them analyzed for the presence of previously identified  contaminants. The samples could be analyzed at an on-site laboratory or  sent off site, depending on the types of contaminants. If the laboratory  confirmed that the contaminants had been removed to an acceptable level,  the contractor could move on to the next step. If the laboratory results  showed an unacceptable level of contaminants, then additional soil would  be removed, followed by additional confirmation sampling. Additional soil  removal and sampling rarely occurred, however, because field  measurements and analyses were used to guide the remediation work  before the final confirmation samples were taken.", "The fourth and final step\u2014clean fill and project documentation\u2014included  filling the excavated area and preparing a closeout report that documented  that the cleanup had met the stated goals and quantified any residual  contamination. The contractor generally filled the excavated area with  Rocky Flats alluvium, a mixture of sand, dirt, and gravel. Documentation of  residual contamination was important to the regulatory process because  these data were instrumental in completing the remedial investigation and  feasibility study, including the comprehensive risk assessment.  After  DOE approved the closeout report, it was delivered to the regulatory  agencies for final approval. The regulatory agencies\u2019 approval meant that  the cleanup was sufficient and that no further accelerated action was  needed. This four-step remediation process is illustrated in figure 11.", "Although soil remediation was the primary cleanup focus at Rocky Flats,  some groundwater required remediation for elevated levels of uranium,  nitrates, and volatile organic compounds. Three passive systems were  installed to treat the contaminants in the groundwater. At one former  waste-drum storage area, for example, remediation of a carbon  tetrachloride plume, along with other volatile organic compounds, involved  excavating about 700 cubic yards of contaminated soils, treating them  through thermal desorption, and then constructing a passive treatment  system that uses iron filings to cleanse contaminants from the  groundwater. Figure 12 shows the cleanup of a plume of carbon  tetrachloride and other volatile organic compounds (VOC) that originated  from a waste-drum storage area at Rocky Flats.", "Because of the tendency of plutonium and americium particles to cling to  soil, a primary concern among stakeholders was the potential off-site  transport of soil contaminated with plutonium and americium via surface  water. Contaminated soil washes into ditches and streams when it rains or  snows. Accordingly, cleanup efforts have focused on the surface soils to  reduce the source of radionuclides that could be susceptible to erosion and  eventual transport off site via Walnut and Woman Creeks. Also, surface  water is managed and monitored both on site\u2014through a series of holding  ponds\u2014and at the points where it leaves the site. The ponds, which DOE  constructed decades ago to retain any major release during operations, are  used to ensure that water leaving the site meets all applicable water quality  standards. DOE operates the final pond in each series as a \u201cbatch and  release\u201d system; that is, releases from those ponds occur only after water  sampling has confirmed that the water meets water quality standards. The  efficacy of the accelerated cleanup actions taken to protect water quality  will be evaluated in the remedial investigation/feasibility study.

The comprehensive risk assessment incorporated  approximately 2 million data records and examined both human and  ecological risk. Specific tasks included   identifying remaining contamination at Rocky Flats and determining  whether it can adversely affect humans, animals, or plants;  determining whether pathways exist whereby human or ecological  receptors may come into contact with these contaminants, for example,  through inhalation or ingestion of surface water;  assessing the contaminants\u2019 potential effects, including cancer, on the  human and ecological receptors, where complete pathways exist; and  calculating the potential risk to the human and ecological receptors,  based on the pathways and the levels and toxicity of the contaminants.", "The human health risk assessment calculated the risk that residual  contaminants posed to wildlife refuge workers and visitors. The  assessment identified five residual contaminants at the site that could  affect human health, including plutonium located adjacent to the most  contaminated precleanup areas of the site. The risk model assumed that  the primary pathways for plutonium were either through inhalation or  through skin contact.

We identified  four key data quality controls: establishing data quality objectives, using  data quality parameters, verifying and validating data, and auditing  laboratories that analyzed samples for Rocky Flats.

An independent consultant\u2019s study raised the concern that DOE was  allowing one of the terminal ponds to fill to a high level, thereby  diminishing its ability to store large quantities of water should a heavy  rainfall occur. Such an event could result in water being released without  being tested. The independent review recommended that DOE maintain the  pond at a lower capacity as a precautionary strategy, and DOE concurred.

One area of  contention involved the landfill that had been used at Rocky Flats in the  1950s and 1960s. DOE\u2019s characterization of the landfill suggested that  uranium and volatile organic compounds were present. DOE and the  regulatory agencies subsequently agreed to implement an accelerated  cleanup action that included buttressing the landfill to prevent the waste  from slumping into Woman Creek; regrading parts of the landfill, which is  located on a hillside, to prevent erosion; placing 2 feet of soil atop the  surface to isolate the contaminants; installing storm water management  berms to divert surface flows to perimeter channels; and seeding the entire  cover, buttress, and channels with native grass species. An independent  review disagreed with several aspects of this accelerated action, including  that it did not include a biointrusion layer; these layers inhibit the ability of  burrowing animals like mice and prairie dogs to bring contaminants up to  the surface, where people at the site might be exposed to them. DOE and  Colorado felt that a biointrusion layer was unnecessary because the  accelerated cleanup action met the legal requirements for landfill closure,  and the observed environmental conditions indicated that the landfill  posed only a minimal risk. EPA added that the issue of biointrusion was  examined during the remedy\u2019s design, with the conclusion that the steep  slope (18 percent), combined with the native grass cover, would not be  attractive habitat for burrowing animals. In the end, a biointrusion layer  was not included in the landfill cover.

At that time, final  decision documents had been completed for two areas (the 881 hillside and  the off-site areas), and accelerated cleanup actions had been completed at  several areas. Among the completed accelerated actions were the removal  and, as necessary, treatment of contaminated debris and soil at several  trenches; the installation of three groundwater treatment systems; the  removal of contaminated sludge from solar evaporation ponds; and  emptying and treating the contents of six underground storage tanks. The  review concluded that the remedies for these two areas were protective  and that the accelerated actions had addressed immediate hazards and  were generally functioning as intended. The review of the off-site areas,  though not required under EPA guidance, was nonetheless conducted  because of the substantial public interest in those areas.

Early in the cleanup, DOE  officials recognized that a significant investment in hazard  identification, safety planning, and safety implementation (i.e., the  integrated safety management system) during the actual work would  ensure that the work was performed without unacceptable risks or  unnecessary delays. Later, DOE officials said they came to understand  that this focus on safety not only helped work progress, but also  facilitated efficiency by building trust and engaging the workforce.  Safety was both consistent with, and essential to, effective project  execution.", "Performance-based contract incentives improve results.", "According to DOE officials, the first contract they had with Kaiser-Hill  demonstrated that attaching incentives to clearly defined performance  measures vastly improved actual results. The 2000 contract took the  concept to the next level, providing large incentives to the contractor  and the workers to safely and compliantly complete the cleanup within  the target schedule and cost. The additional incentives for schedule and  cost savings resulted in closure more than a year ahead of schedule and  $530 million under budget. However, as previously noted, such  incentives are not always this successful, and the financial incentive  offered at Rocky Flats was only one of many factors contributing to the  cleanup\u2019s early completion.", "Take a consultative approach to cleanup decisions. As previously  discussed, the collaborative process was essential to the cleanup\u2019s early  completion. According to DOE officials, the cleanup was successful  because all of the stakeholders were engaged in the process and  supportive of the ultimate goal. The input of numerous key figures,  including members of Congress, senior DOE managers, state and local  elected officials, and officials of federal and state regulatory agencies,  was actively solicited and ultimately met with the convergence of the  cleanup agreement, the contract, and the desired end state. DOE  officials said they communicated openly and often with stakeholders to  seek the best solutions, and they came to value input from formerly  dogmatic opponents. Moreover, Colorado, EPA, DOE, and the  contractor worked closely together on cleanup decisions from the  beginning through the end. As cleanup proceeded on an area, Colorado  had access to meetings and detailed information about the cleanup.

As discussed earlier, consistent  project funding was a key factor in the cleanup\u2019s early completion.  According to DOE and EPA officials, congressional and departmental  commitment to stable funding over the life of the project aided  tremendously in project planning and execution. Also, the stable  funding helped in regulatory interactions and credibility with the  general public.", "Involve the future site manager in remedial decisions. According  to FWS, when a former DOE site is considered for conversion to a  wildlife refuge, it is \u201cvastly preferable\u201d for FWS to be involved early in  the cleanup process and have a decision-making role. DOE officials  agreed and said they have actively involved FWS since passage of the  Refuge Act. According to DOE officials, FWS substantially influenced  cleanup decisions, even in areas of the site that will not become part of  the future refuge. For example, they said, FWS\u2019s input effected a major  change in the cover design for the present landfill. Additionally, FWS  influenced the composition of the revegetation seed mixes sitewide and  the methods of protecting sensitive habitat and endangered species. But  DOE did not incorporate all of FWS\u2019s suggestions, such as  characterizing and disposing of waste in the original landfill,  incorporating barriers around landfills to discourage intrusion by  burrowing animals, and using irrigation and soil amendment to enhance  the success of seeded native vegetation. According to DOE officials, the  two agencies\u2019 different perspectives on cleanup methods highlight the  difficulty of coordination between two federal agencies that have  different missions. These difficulties can persist even when staff of the  two agencies are collocated and interact daily, as was the case at Rocky  Flats. In retrospect, DOE officials said, it would have been better to  recognize that difficulty early and obtain an executive\u2013level consensus  on the vision for the outcome.", "Be aware of potential beryllium contamination. According to a  senior contractor official, beryllium was \u201cubiquitous\u201d at the site; it was  found even in containers of metals and oxides. In terms of worker  safety, beryllium was more of a predemolition challenge than other  contaminants because there is no effective way to monitor beryllium on  a real-time basis.", "Question accepted technologies. The contractor was able to save  substantial money and time at Rocky Flats by questioning the usual  disposal and remediation processes. For example, the accepted practice  was that a glovebox or any part of one was, by definition, transuranic  waste. However, the contractor found a way to decontaminate  gloveboxes and dispose of them much more easily and less expensively  as low-level waste. According to a senior contractor official, this  particular technical lesson learned at Rocky Flats may be applicable to  DOE\u2019s cleanup work at the Hanford site.", "Contain contaminated water. According to an official with the  Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, lessons  learned at Rocky Flats included the importance of ensuring that there  are no underground drainage systems or conduits when large amounts  of water are used during a cleanup. This lesson stemmed from an  unfortunate experience in the cleanup of building 771, when water used  in decontamination efforts seeped into underground conduits that had  not been adequately plugged. The water flushed contaminants through  the conduits, resulting in elevated levels of americium in one series of  ponds at the site. This turned out to be an expensive lesson, as the  contractor had to bring in equipment and treat about 26 million gallons  of americium-contaminated water.", "Although DOE captured and implemented at other sites some of the  lessons it learned at Rocky Flats, others risk being lost. For example,  contractor and DOE officials said that at Rocky Flats, and at other cleanup  sites, many lessons that could be gleaned from records and data will be lost  if not recorded, summarized, or otherwise captured and shared. According  to the Rocky Flats manager, an effort termed the \u201cLegacy Project\u201d was  begun in 2001 to start collecting the project knowledge and lessons before  the institutional memory was lost. This effort continued intermittently  through the summer of 2005, drawing upon record documents, working  papers, and personal experience. Also, DOE Rocky Flats officials said that  officials of DOE\u2019s Legacy Management office in Grand Junction, Colorado,  had shared with them lessons learned from the Grand Junction office\u2019s  experience working with the long-term management of sites formerly  contaminated by uranium mill tailings. According to the Rocky Flats  manager, these lessons will be brought to Rocky Flats as Legacy  Management executes its responsibilities for site management and  maintenance. As the mission scope of Legacy Management expands, it will  continue to carry experience from Rocky Flats to other sites that are  transferred to it for long-term care. Also, although DOE officials told us in  March 2005 that they were planning a workshop on lessons learned at  Rocky Flats in decontamination and demolition, that workshop has not  been held. According to the Rocky Flats manager, several technical assist  visits occurred with contractor and DOE personnel from sites in Idaho,  Ohio, and Washington. These visits were believed to be more focused and  efficient than a workshop format. At this time, a general workshop is not  planned; however, technical assist and assessment visits to facilitate the  sharing of lessons are continuing.", "DOE officials at Rocky Flats have drafted the Rocky Flats Closure Legacy  report, a lengthy document that captures the 4-year effort of the Legacy  Project.

Lacking clear  and specific guidance on cleanup verification, DOE officials at Rocky Flats  undertook what they thought was a reasonable approach. However, DOE  did not complete all of the cleanup verification activities it had planned; it  also did not publicly explain its rationale for not doing so. As a result, DOE  lost a valuable opportunity to increase public awareness of, and confidence  in, the verification results. Ironically, although the verification activities  were undertaken to increase public confidence in the cleanup, the results  sparked additional questions from the public. Finally, although DOE has  implemented at other cleanup sites some of the lessons learned at Rocky  Flats, DOE does not require that lessons learned at one site be  implemented, where applicable, at other sites.

DOE suggested that we reference this regulatory requirement in the report  section dealing with additional steps to be taken.

We do, however, reference DOE Order 5400.5 and its  draft implementing guidance in our discussion of cleanup verification  activities.

Kaiser-Hill noted that a significant portion of these benefit costs  were accrued by previous contractors. Kaiser-Hill acknowledged, however,  that such costs represent financial obligations to the taxpayer. For our  purposes, inclusion of these costs was necessary to report total costs of the  cleanup since 1995, including long-term costs.", "Additionally, Kaiser-Hill commented that because the final disposition of  trench T-7 (the fourth individual cleanup project we reviewed in depth)  required only minimal cleanup, it was completed through the standard \u201cno  further accelerated action\u201d justification process.

More important, the CDPHE , EPA and  Kaiser-Hill consistently solicited the advice of the Board.

Operating as  federal board is very important.\u201d  \u201cI believe that the DOE did a good job in answering reasonable requests  from Board members.  did not always jump through every hoop  presented nor should they have.

The reason I checked \u2018somewhat satisfied\u2019  instead of \u2018very satisfied\u2019 is that we could never get DOE to incorporate  stewardship planning into the cleanup process in a substantive manner.

Out of this study came the recommendation that the  plutonium RSAL be reduced by 95% from 651 pCi/g to 35 pCi/g. While  DOE did not accept this recommendation, it did work with the  regulators to reduce the action level for  in surface soil (top  3 feet) from 651 to 50 pCi/g. DOE and the regulators, however, pushed a  tradeoff, in that in exchange for this better surface cleanup (top 3 feet)  the public would have to accept having larger quantities of plutonium  left in the subsurface environment\u2014between 1000 and 7000 pCi/g at a  depth of 3 to 6 feet below the surface, with no limit on the concentration  allowed below 6 feet.\u201d  \u201cThe Board has had an impact on all areas of the cleanup process . . .  from how the landfill caps were constructed, to the overall level of  cleanup, to how buildings were safely removed. . . .\u201d  \u201cI understand that in the beginning the Board had a tremendous impact  on the cleanup. Because of the Board and community members, the  surface soil cleanup levels were changed to be more conservative, from  651 pCi/g to 50 pCi/g. I feel  the Board had less of an influence later  in the process. However, because of the Board, DOE was aware that the  community was watching, and I believe the community got a better  cleanup because of that.\u201d  \u201cDOE solicited a large amount of input from the Coalition over the  course of the site\u2019s cleanup. Although not all of the Coalition\u2019s input was  incorporated into cleanup plans, a substantial amount of Coalition  positions were incorporated into the cleanup. As a result, local  community buy-in into the process was enhanced. DOE, Kaiser-Hill, the  regulators, and the Coalition were successful partners in the site\u2019s  closure.\u201d  \u201cWe were able to influence the level of cleanup. We were also able to get  more cleanup in areas like the 903 pad in exchange for leaving building  foundations in place\u2014771 & 371.\u201d  \u201cBy the Coalition engaging in depth on matters of technical feasibility,  schedule, cost, worker safety, D&D   design and implementation, contaminant control and monitoring, it  forced the DOE, regulators and Kaiser-Hill to focus and impart progress  and planning to the Coalition board and public.\u201d  \u201cThe Coalition affected the cleanup on a number of levels. We were the  best supporters and the most effective critic. We helped maintain  congressional support for the project and held DOE, Kaiser-Hill and the  regulators accountable. We were central to determining the future use of  the site and to revising the cleanup priorities to better match the needs  of the community. We brought DOE to the table in a public forum which,  along principally with the , was central to  ensuring the dialogue remained open. We pushed for a free flow of  information.\u201d 11. Please explain or provide examples of what, if anything, DOE  might have done differently to change the effect of the   input on the cleanup process.", "Respondents offered a number of suggestions and comments, including the  following:  \u201cThe only change would be on the future monitoring of the site i.e., LSO   which has been completely  controlled by politics and not by DOE and the board. . . .\u201d   \u201cI always believed that if DOE had approached it more as a partnership  with their end customer the cleanup process would have been done  better.\u201d  \u201c did continue with a very active public participation process to  address  and all aspects of the cleanup. However,  rather than doing this process via the  established in  1993 to advise DOE on the cleanup, DOE created a new body, the RFCA   Focus Group . . . The value of the  Focus Group was that it allowed more intense discussion of details than  was usually possible in a  meeting. But shifting the principal  discussion of the cleanup to the Focus Group . . . had the effect of  undermining and marginalizing the .\u201d   \u201cDOE could have engaged the Board better in terms of budgeting. We  were never asked to partner with the site in requesting funds for our  participation through the federal budget process. . . . We also will not be  funded for what we saw as a valuable project to develop risk  communication tools to help alleviate concerns about the residual  contamination at the site. We have heard from citizens who live near the  site that they are concerned that contamination has been left behind.  There is no way that these citizens are going to read and understand the  immense multi-volume Remedial Investigation study and  Comprehensive Risk Assessment. If there are any further water quality  exceedences, even if they are not life threatening, they are going to call  into question the protectiveness of the cleanup. DOE had better hope  this doesn\u2019t happen, because they appear to have no plan or the tools to  address concerns that might be raised by the less knowledgeable in the  community.\u201d  \u201cDOE at times declined to allow members of the Board to observe  internal meetings between DOE, , and the regulators. This  made it more difficult for the Board to thoroughly understand the  technical details of a cleanup decision and respond in an educated way.\u201c  \u201cOne recurring Coalition theme was the lack of long-term stewardship  considerations in remedial action planning and documents. Instead of  incorporating the long-term stewardship considerations into the  documents, it was left to post-physical closure documents. . . . The  Coalition position has always been that long-term stewardship planning  should be an integral part of the remedial activities and not relegated to  post-closure status.\u201d  \u201cAs the clean up was underway in early 2005, DOE seemed to agree that  ORISE should conduct a [Multi-Agency Radiation Survey and Site  Investigation Manual, or MARSSIM]-based final clean up verification.  Since this approach was apparently not specified in the contract, Kaiser- Hill balked and DOE was left to fund an over-flight survey by a low flying  helicopter to, for PR  purposes, attempt to pick up  (detect) major hot spots. The overflight technology was not sufficiently  sensitive to detect exceedences of the clean up level. In addition due to  soil moisture and shielding in the industrial area, the overflight  detection approach was of little credible value. By omitting this final  verification Kaiser-Hill was able to \u2018complete\u2019 physical closure early and  collect an added 100 million dollar award.\u201d", "We now have a few questions about the results of the cleanup. As  you know, since 1995, when it was awarded the Rocky Flats cleanup  contract, Kaiser-Hill has decontaminated and demolished hundreds  of structures, installed groundwater treatment systems, and  removed contaminated soil, among other cleanup tasks specified by  the contract and the Rocky Flats Cleanup Agreement. 12.

I am convinced we got the best cleanup possible for the  conditions, political climate, and money spent.\u201d    \u201cThis process has been open and has benefited from intense public  oversight, talented and committed regulators (especially at CDPHE  ), and  independent reviews of key assumptions and decisions such as the  Actinide Migration Panel and the soil action level review. Further, the  surface water quality standards are extremely stringent and with rare  exception they are getting met. That increases my confidence.\u201d   \u201cThe main reason I am extremely confident that the cleanup will be  protective of public health and the environment is because of the  tremendous amount of excellent oversight work provided by the  regulators (CDPHE and EPA). I can\u2019t say enough of how impressed I am  with the technical staff of the regulatory agencies.

We were led to believe that the verification  would be a MARSSIM based approach; what we really received was a  process that had never been used for verification purposes (the aerial  flyover); an ORISE review that was constrained by DOE and a limited  scope review.\u201d  \u201cI believe the majority of the buffer area will be very low risk to the  public. The ponds, the industrial area, the 903 pad, 903 lip and 903 wind  blown area could expose the unsuspecting public to a higher risk  depending on individual sensitivities even though the residual Pu   level is at or below 50 pCi/g.\u201d", "One of the 2 respondents who were \u201cnot very\u201d or \u201cnot at all\u201d confident (in  response to question 12) about the cleanup\u2019s protectiveness said,  \u201cI don\u2019t believe that the cleanup was done to be protective of public  health and the environment. Otherwise, DOE would not have pursued  the wildlife preserve aspect. Basically, the wildlife preserve is an  \u201cadministrative\u201d control to limit the future land use, limit public  exposure to the existing contamination at the site, and allowed DOE to  leave behind a lot of contamination.\u201d 14.

I do understand the reasons for  this not occurring.\u201d  \u201cA 100 percent scan of the DOE-retained lands would give me a  complete idea of what is out there. . . .\u201d  \u201cThe implementation of our consultants\u2019 recommendations and a  \u201cTRUE\u201d MARSSIM based final survey.\u201d  \u201cOnly after the Focus Group had been meeting for a full year was it  finally made clear that the better cleanup sought by some participants  was not in the cards because decisions placing a cap on what could be  spent had already been made. To some of us involved in this enormously  time consuming process, this announcement revealed that the public  participation process was in large measure a sham. Some DOE  personnel insist that DOE had been open about the fiscal cap, but the  DOE official who made the announcement at the Focus Group later said  that its effect on the meeting was \u2018like throwing a dead rat on the table.\u2019\u201d  \u201cI really do not have any concern about the site per se.

FWS  now needs the resources to convert the site.\u201d  \u201cDOE and the regulators should have required independent   based protocols to verify complete and comprehensive surface soil  clean up levels site wide. This should have been done by an independent  contractor.\u201d 15. At this point in time, do you have any remaining concerns about  the cleanup? 16. Please provide examples or details of your remaining concerns.", "Respondents offered a number of concerns, including the following:  \u201cThe underground \u201cstuff\u201d\u2014landfills and basements.

The site needs several good growing seasons to help re-establish  vegetation covering the remediated portions of the DOE-retained land.  Without adequate vegetative cover, erosion problems can arise which  could ultimately result in the mobilization of actinides from the surface  soil into surface water.\u201d  \u201cMy concerns now lie in the importance of creating a robust  stewardship plan and assuring that monitoring will continue well into  the future as well as knowing that if we find that a remedy has failed the  DOE will do what it takes to address this failure.\u201d   \u201cI worry about the magnitude of the long-time stewardship  responsibilities. There are numerous examples at other sites of where  controls fail because governments forget that there are institutional  controls which carry with them use restrictions. How we will protect  Rocky Flats over the long-term remains somewhat of a mystery for me.\u201d   \u201cWhat will be done in the coming years, and by whom, to keep the public  out of the contaminated areas?\u201d  \u201cPlutonium and uranium take hundreds of thousands of years to decay.", "Even in 100 years, the site can change sufficiently so that subsurface  contamination is exposed. Also, physical controls may well decay into  dust by the time the next century rolls around and institutional controls  could be forgotten. In the future, the site could be used for subsistence  farming. Who knows what will happen?  The uncertainty of the future  contributes the largest concern I have about the cleanup.\u201d", "In the summer of 2005, DOE arranged for a number of cleanup  verification activities, including Kaiser-Hill\u2019s ground-based scans  along the boundaries of previously remediated areas where  contamination was once known to exist; Bechtel Nevada\u2019s aerial  scan of the site; and the Oak Ridge Institute of Science and  Education\u2019s (ORISE) sampling and ground-based scanning of the  903 pad and lip area.

The other parts of the  verification were too confusing for the majority of the community to  understand.

The aerial scan is a very valuable tool but also a very  limited one.\u201d 23. How, if at all, did ORISE\u2019s verification activities (e.g., soil  sampling and surface scans using sodium iodide \u201cFIDLER\u201d  scintillation detectors) affect your confidence in the site\u2019s cleanup?", "Neither increased nor diminished my confidence Don\u2019t know/no basis to judge 24.

I understand that according to the risk  assessment formulas that were developed and the averaging nature of  these formulas these \u2018hot spots\u2019 technically did not have to be  remediated. The decision to remediate these, however, was important to  help assure public confidence in the site cleanup.\u201d  \u201cThe ORISE work ended up raising more questions and concerns by the  public. Also, we are left with the impression at the end that their work is  incomplete because DOE did not provide them with funding to do the  final review of the aerial survey. Also, trying to make MARSSIM fit into  what was needed to verify the cleanup at the site was just too difficult to  follow. . . . The ORISE work started out with great expectations, but  things just got too confusing at the end. For the average citizen, I don\u2019t  think the verification made any difference at all.\u201d    \u201cThe ORISE budget was very limited\u2014about $250,000\u2014and was not  sufficient to do an adequate job of site verification because the protocol  they had to follow was disjointed.\u201d    \u201cORISE\u2019S work showed that for the area they reviewed, the statistical  approach Kaiser-Hill used was valid.

Hope there is someplace in the future (for a  couple of years) for such activities to continue.

In the 903 pad area where a  sampling verification  was implemented\u2014hot spots substantially exceeding 50 pCi/g were  found and picked up. It would seem reasonable to conclude that other  areas of the 903 pad and the industrial area would have similar  exceedences.\u201d  \u201cDOE, other state agencies, and communities should study what we did  at Rocky Flats because we were on the cutting edge of how to work  within the regulations but allow great latitude in engaging the  community and for remediating a complex nuclear site.\u201d  \u201cStandley Lake Cities still have serious concerns about Woman Creek\u2019s  risk from  Woman Creek has no  terminal testing control pond!\u201d  \u201cORISE should have been allowed to survey more of the area and to do  some surveying of the Buffer Zone.\u201d"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Additional Information on Decontamination and Demolition Activities at Rocky Flats", "paragraphs": ["The contractor used a number of innovative techniques to accomplish  decontamination and demolition tasks at Rocky Flats. One of these, as  discussed in the report, was the use of a cerium nitrate solution to  decontaminate large pieces of equipment. Another innovative  decontaminating technique was the contractor\u2019s use of InstaCoteTM to  encapsulate large surface-contaminated tanks and other equipment.  InstaCote is a polyurea plastic coating that was sprayed on equipment. The  InstaCote not only sealed in the contamination, but also served as the  shipping conveyance and disposal package. According to DOE officials, use  of the InstaCote saved \u201ceasily thousands of hours\u201d and increased worker  safety, as it eliminated the difficult and dangerous job of cutting  contaminated equipment and packaging it for shipment. The InstaCote  could be used even with extremely large pieces of contaminated  equipment, such as a super-compacter used to reduce waste volume by  crushing drums containing radioactive waste and drums that were empty  but had formerly contained radioactive waste. Figure 14 shows the super- compacter before InstaCote was applied and with the InstaCote awaiting  transport to a disposal facility.", "One of the most difficult decontaminating challenges DOE and the  contractor overcame was decontaminating concrete. When concrete  became contaminated with liquid radioactive waste (e.g., by spills during  nuclear material processing or waste disposal), the past practice was to fix  the contamination in place using sometimes several layers of an epoxy  paint. Before a building containing contaminated concrete could be  demolished, this paint had to be removed down to the base material, and  the base material had to be decontaminated. The contractor removed the  contaminated paint using various methods such as scabbling, shaving, or  hydolasing. Scabbling chipped away the first layer of the surface with a  pneumatic hammer; however, this option created dust and increased the  potential for the release of contaminants into the air. Shaving removed  layers of concrete with a machine, and was considered more efficient and  less hazardous than hydrolasing for decontaminating concrete surfaces  with deeper contamination. Hydrolasing, the preferred method for  removing paint and shallow surface contamination, involved blasting away  paint and the initial layer of the surface material with water, then self- containing the water and resulting debris. Figure 15 shows the hydrolase  system in use in building 886 at Rocky Flats, a former nuclear laboratory  known to have light contamination under painted surfaces.", "But in some cases, according to a senior contractor official, contaminated  liquid had seeped so deeply into the concrete that it could not be removed  using any of these three methods. This was the case, for example, in the  \u201cinfinity room\u201d (so called because the level of radioactive contamination in  the room was greater than instruments could measure) of building 771,  which had often been referred to as \u201cthe most dangerous building in  America.\u201d When concrete was contaminated to the core, the only option  was to cut it out and remove it. The entire \u201cinfinity room\u201d floor had to be  cut out and shipped as transuranic waste, as shown in figure 16.", "In other cases, when the contaminated concrete was far underground (i.e.,  in building foundations), it was decontaminated to the lowest levels  reasonably achievable and left in place. DOE and the regulatory agencies  agreed to decontaminate and leave in place the foundations of buildings  371 and 771/774, and cover them with clean fill dirt. According to DOE and  contractor officials, leaving the foundations in place poses little risk to  human health and safety because the foundations and the soil around them  were decontaminated to specified levels before being covered. Also, they  said, leaving the foundations in place was safer for the workers at the site  than removing them, which would have required workers wearing  respiratory protection systems that constrain movement and visibility to  winch up massive, multiton pieces of concrete from a confined space. A  Colorado official said he had agreed to the decision to leave the  foundations in place after carefully considering the balance between the  potential future risk of exposure with the real and immediate risk of  worker safety.  In lieu of removal, the contractor treated the foundations  with a fixative to prevent contaminants from migrating during demolition  activities, then covered them with a cushion of sand and a layer of clean fill  dirt. According to DOE and contractor officials, plutonium should not  migrate out of the foundations, and if it does, it should not migrate beyond  the surrounding soil. This contention is supported by the results of the  actinide migration study, which concluded that fixed actinide  contamination does not readily move in the environment. Also, neither  humans nor wildlife would be exposed unless a future major excavation  activity were to take place.  However slight it may be, the potential risk to  human health and safety posed by leaving the foundations in place is the  reason that controls such as groundwater monitoring wells and treatment  systems will remain in place, according to Colorado officials.", "Another innovative decontaminating and demolition strategy the  contractor developed in conjunction with DOE and the regulatory agencies  involved dividing the site into areas and completing most or all of the work  in one area\u2014from building decontamination to demolition\u2014so that  environmental remediation could begin in that area while decontamination  and demolition work was being done in the next area. This strategy enabled  the cleanup to proceed more quickly by allowing the earlier start of  environmental restoration work and by allowing workers more time to  address any unforeseen circumstances. The strategy also achieved  economies of scale, as site services\u2014such as water, steam, and power\u2014 could be eliminated throughout an entire area, rather than on a building-by- building basis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Information on the Quality of Remediation Data at Rocky Flats and on DOE\u2019s Planned and Actual Verification", "paragraphs": ["This appendix presents additional information on our review of the  processes and procedures in place at Rocky Flats to evaluate the quality of  remediation data.

Accordingly, we reviewed the processes and procedures in  place to ensure data quality, and we identified four key controls: (1)  establishing data quality objectives, (2) using data quality parameters, (3)  verifying and validating data, and (4) auditing laboratories that analyzed  samples for Rocky Flats. Our review showed that, overall, the contractor  generally followed these data quality controls and clearly documented its  compliance with them for the four accelerated cleanup actions we  reviewed in depth. For these four cleanup actions\u2014at building 771, the 903  pad, the 903 lip area, and trench T-7\u2014we assessed the closeout reports and  the data supporting them to determine the extent to which the data  collection and laboratory analyses adhered to data quality standards and  procedures. We did not, however, evaluate the remedial data or laboratory  analyses themselves.", "To assess the use of the first key control\u2014establishing data quality  objectives\u2014we identified the criteria documented in the Industrial Area  and Buffer Zone Sampling and Analysis Plan. We then reviewed the cleanup  project sampling plan addenda, remedial action plans, and cleanup project  closeout reports for each of the four projects to determine whether the  data quality objectives had been established and were considered during  the projects\u2019 cleanup. To assess the use of the second control, we reviewed  the four projects\u2019 closeout reports to verify that the data had been checked  against the data quality parameters in accordance with the criteria located  in both the Rocky Flats Implementation Guidance Document and the  Industrial Area and Buffer Zone Sampling and Analysis Plan. These  documents establish the guidelines for evaluating analytical data and  address the overall quality of the data quality control. We examined the  closeout reports for each of the four projects to ensure that the projects  met the criteria for the third control\u2014data verification and validation. And  finally, to assess the use of the fourth control, we reviewed reports on  audits of laboratories that analyzed data for the site\u2019s cleanup. Specifically,  we reviewed source documentation from audits conducted by DOE\u2019s  consolidated audit program and DOE\u2019s mixed analyte performance  evaluation program. We concentrated our review on laboratory audit  results relevant to detecting plutonium for the 3-year period during which  cleanup was under way for the four projects.", "Establishing data quality objectives. DOE and the contractor  established data quality objectives to act as planning tools for collecting  data and for making decisions. The data quality objectives process is  specified in the site\u2019s quality assurance project plan. The process is  intended to provide a systematic procedure for defining criteria for data  collection, including when and where to collect samples, what level of  decision error is tolerable, and how many samples to collect. In our review  of the four selected cleanup areas, we found general adherence to the data  quality objectives process. For three of the four projects we selected, we  verified that both the characterization and confirmation sampling were  planned according to the data quality objective process as defined in the  Industrial Area and Buffer Zone Sampling and Analysis Plan. Because the  fourth project required only minimal cleanup, it was completed through the  standard \u201cno further accelerated action\u201d justification process. According to  the contractor, the justification documentation for such areas (those  requiring minimal cleanup) should include information on data adequacy,  but not at the same level of detail as was required for other cleanup areas.  We recognize that areas closed out through the \u201cno further accelerated  action\u201d process may not necessitate the same level of data quality  documentation as other areas. Nevertheless, the Rocky Flats Cleanup  Agreement requires that the justification documentation for \u201cno further  accelerated action\u201d areas include information on data quality and usability.  The documentation we reviewed for trench T-7 did not include such  information.", "Applying PARCC parameters. EPA\u2019s policy requires it to apply data  quality parameters for precision, accuracy, representativeness,  completeness, and comparability\u2014known as the PARCC parameters.  Because radionuclides were involved, an additional data quality  parameter\u2014sensitivity\u2014was used at Rocky Flats. These parameters  provided information to the contractor and the regulatory agencies about  the acceptability or utility of the data. For example, precision measures  whether using the same analytical technique will result in the same results  for a particular sample (i.e., analyzing the same sample twice and comparing the results). According to the sampling and analysis plan,  assessments of the data according to the PARCC parameters are  documented in the closeout reports for the accelerated cleanup actions  and, according to EPA officials, are checked through the verification and  validation process discussed next.  Our review of the four selected cleanup  areas indicated that the PARCC parameters were consistently applied. For  three of the four projects we selected, we verified that the data were  reviewed in accordance with each of the data quality parameters. The  fourth project required only minimal cleanup and was completed through  the standard \u201cno further accelerated action\u201d justification process for which  no formal data quality discussion was required.", "Verifying and validating laboratory data. Data verification was  required for 100 percent of the laboratory data at Rocky Flats. Data  validation was required for 25 percent of the data, but because this  requirement pertained to the Rocky Flats site as a whole, the percentage of  data validated could vary considerably from one cleanup area to another.  Data verification is a review of a laboratory\u2019s electronic data package  summary to evaluate the extent to which the laboratory met specified  quality control and reporting criteria. Data validation is a more in-depth  review that includes not only verifying the data, but also examining the raw  data and manually verifying calculations done by the laboratory. After a  laboratory analyzed samples, it sent the results to a subcontractor that  reviewed the data according to either the verification or the validation  criteria and assigned codes indicating the data\u2019s quality. For example, one  code would be assigned to data for which no problems were observed,  whereas another code would be assigned to data that did not meet the  quality control requirements.", "Our review of the closeout reports on the four cleanup projects we selected  indicated general adherence to the verification and validation  requirements. Specifically, for three of the four projects, at least 98 percent  of the overall data had been verified, and between 23 percent and 50  percent had been validated. The contractor provided several explanations  for why 100 percent of the data had not been verified. For example, at the  903 lip area, because a number of samples were collected close to the time  that the closeout report was submitted, verification and validation  occurred after the report was completed. Additionally, the large number of  samples collected in September 2004 (from the 903 lip area and other areas  around the site) overloaded the verification and validation staff. Most of  these records were verified or validated in late November or early  December 2004, and all had been verified or validated by early 2005,  according to the contractor.", "Auditing laboratories. The 32 laboratories that analyzed samples  collected from Rocky Flats were required to undergo annual technical  audits to ensure the accuracy of their analytical results. Since 2000,  contractor officials said they have largely satisfied the audit requirement by  voluntarily participating in DOE\u2019s consolidated audit program, with the  exception of one on-site laboratory that the contractor audited. A typical  DOE laboratory audit, according to the audit program manager, includes a  3-day visit to the laboratory by a team of five to six people.  DOE certifies  laboratory auditors in particular areas, including chemistry (e.g.,  radiochemistry or organic chemistry), and uses a standardized checklist to  verify that laboratory practices meet DOE standards. When auditors  identify problems, they can provide comments or issue priority I or priority  II findings. Priority I findings are the most severe; they represent a serious  breakdown in management controls that could render the laboratory  unacceptable for use or unfit to perform services for DOE. Laboratories  that receive priority I and II findings are required to develop and implement  corrective action plans, and the contractor\u2019s policy stipulated that  laboratories receiving priority I findings could do no more work for Rocky  Flats until they had rectified the problem. Of the 118 audits conducted of  laboratories analyzing Rocky Flats cleanup samples, only 10 priority I  findings were issued, according to the subcontractor official responsible  for laboratory audits at Rocky Flats.", "We reviewed the performance of the two primary laboratories that  analyzed confirmatory samples for plutonium 239 for the four selected  cleanup areas and found no areas of concern with the laboratories\u2019 quality.  To limit our review, we focused on two performance criteria: (1) laboratory  audit findings from DOE\u2019s consolidated audit program documents on alpha  spectroscopy, which is used to analyze confirmatory samples for  plutonium; and (2) results from DOE\u2019s mixed analyte performance  evaluation program, which assesses a laboratory\u2019s analytical abilities by  sending the laboratory a sample of a known quantity of a contaminant and  comparing the laboratory\u2019s results with the actual quantity. Our review  showed that the audit findings for alpha spectroscopy resulted in one audit  observation. Our review of the second performance criteria of the tests of  the two laboratories\u2019 analytic ability found that, from 2002 through 2004,  the two laboratories analyzed a combined total of 16 samples of plutonium  239, or alpha samples, and received acceptable test results in all but 3. Of  those 3 samples, 2 samples were considered acceptable but were off by 20  percent to 30 percent, and 1 sample was not acceptable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Information on DOE\u2019s Planned and Actual Verification Activities", "paragraphs": ["DOE revised two of the planned verification activities at Rocky Flats. First,  due to time and cost constraints, DOE reduced the scope of the  contractor\u2019s planned scanning and sampling activities. Second, DOE  revised the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education\u2019s (ORISE)  planned assessment of the contractor\u2019s scans of the 903 lip area. The  revision incorporated an approach consistent with the Multi-Agency  Radiation Survey and Site Investigation Manual (MARSSIM). The actual  verification activities conducted by both the contractor and ORISE  identified \u201chot spots\u201d of radionuclide-contaminated soil; these hot spots  were subsequently remediated."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOE Reduced Size and Scope of Scanning and Sampling Portion of Planned Verification", "paragraphs": ["The first part of DOE\u2019s cleanup verification effort\u2014the contractor- conducted scanning and sampling\u2014was reduced in scope due to time and  cost constraints. In September 2004, the Rocky Flats site manager  requested that the contractor develop a sitewide surface radiological  survey using the Multi-Agency Radiation Survey and Site Investigation  Manual (MARSSIM). MARSSIM is the outcome of a joint effort by DOE,  EPA, the Department of Defense, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  to develop uniform guidance for conducting final surveys to demonstrate  compliance with specified radiological cleanup levels. It recommends 100  percent scanning of areas most likely to be contaminated with  radionuclides.", "Scanning can be conducted through use of devices known as high-purity  germanium (HPGe) detectors, as shown in figure 17, or sodium iodide  scintillation detectors, known as FIDLERs. These devices can scan entire  areas to determine whether certain radionuclides are present in a given  area.", "This scanning approach had been used several times by ORISE at Rocky  Flats to demonstrate the sufficiency of radiological cleanup of buildings  prior to their demolition. However, according to the contractor, DOE had  limited experience using this approach to characterize surface soil and  sediment. In its October 2004 letter responding to DOE, the contractor  concluded that applying MARSSIM across the site would cost  approximately $7.5 million and would take 19 months after the site cleanup  had been completed. Further, the contractor said that implementing  MARSSIM at the site could constitute a \u201csignificant contract change,\u201d and  could postpone completion of the cleanup. In essence, the difficulty was  that the MARSSIM approach was inconsistent with the cleanup strategy.  The approved site cleanup strategy was to remove contamination to a 90  percent confidence level, meaning confidence that at least 90 percent of the  contamination had been remediated to agreed-upon levels. In contrast,  MARSSIM, which was developed years after the Rocky Flats cleanup  strategy had been approved and begun, recommends applying a 100  percent verification strategy\u2014that is, scanning areas most likely to contain  residual radionuclide contamination. Accordingly, MARSSIM was sure to  find \u201chot spots\u201d\u2014particularly at the 903 pad and lip area, the extent and  severity of which would then require investigation and potentially cleanup  action. Not having anticipated the implications of applying MARSSIM at the  site, in terms of both cost and schedule, DOE subsequently rejected that  approach.", "In March 2005, the contractor proposed a less expensive, less time- consuming plan for demonstrating the cleanup\u2019s compliance with the  cleanup agreement. The plan\u2019s objectives were to verify, with reasonable  certainty, that no unknown areas of radiological contamination remained at  the site, that all remedial actions were complete, and that existing sampling  data remained valid. The verification approach included scanning,  sampling, and reviewing historical and existing data. Through such  activities, the contractor intended to increase DOE\u2019s and the community  groups\u2019 confidence that the cleanup objectives had been achieved. The plan  purported to exceed the guidance laid out in MARSSIM, although an ORISE  official refuted this claim. Further comments provided by a contractor  hired by the Rocky Flats Coalition of Local Governments to provide input  on the process added to DOE\u2019s concerns and resulted in DOE\u2019s rejecting  the contractor\u2019s sampling methodology.", "The contractor\u2019s final scanning and sampling plan, issued in May 2005,  included two actions to meet the verification objectives. First, the entire  site would be scanned with sodium iodide detectors affixed to a helicopter.  According to the contractor, the detectors would detect, within the top  several inches of surface soil, gamma rays indicating the existence of any  residual plutonium that exceeded 50 picocuries per gram of soil, over a range of 80 square meters\u2014roughly the size of a two-car garage.  Figure 18  shows electrical poles that were felled to allow the helicopter to fly as low  as possible over the site and the aerial scan of the site for residual  plutonium in surface soil.", "Of the 21 community group survey respondents who expressed an opinion  on the aerial scan, 9 said the scan greatly or somewhat increased their  confidence in the site\u2019s cleanup. Another 8 said the scan neither increased  nor diminished their confidence, and the other 4 said the aerial scan greatly  or somewhat diminished their confidence in the site\u2019s cleanup.", "Another component of the contractor\u2019s final plan was targeted ground- based scanning around the perimeter of previously remediated areas,  including the perimeter of the major plutonium buildings and the 903 lip  area. These scans were conducted with a high-purity germanium detector,  as described earlier. Of the 21 community group survey respondents who  expressed an opinion on the contractor\u2019s ground-based scans, 11 said these  scans greatly or somewhat increased their confidence in the site\u2019s cleanup.", "Another 7 said the scans neither increased nor diminished their confidence,  and the other 3 said the ground-based scans greatly or somewhat  diminished their confidence in the site\u2019s cleanup."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE Revised ORISE\u2019s Portion of Planned Verification to Incorporate MARSSIM", "paragraphs": ["The second part of DOE\u2019s cleanup verification effort\u2014ORISE\u2019s review of  contractor-conducted scans for remaining radiological contamination\u2014 was revised to apply MARSSIM to the 903 lip area.

At a September 1, 2005, public meeting hosted by the  Rocky Flats Citizens Advisory Board, DOE and the contractor presented  the results of the contractor\u2019s and ORISE\u2019s verifications. DOE and the  contractor reported that the aerial scan had identified known areas of  radionuclide contamination, such as areas where contaminated soil was  stored pending its shipment off site. (The scan also identified an off-site  area, but subsequent investigation found no contamination there.)   However, the aerial scan did not achieve its projected sensitivity. Whereas  detection of 50 picocuries of plutonium per gram of soil over 80 square  meters was the criterion for success, according to the contractor\u2019s final  plan, the scanner achieved this detection level for only 25 percent of the  site, owing to the moisture content in the ground and the altitude of the  helicopter\u2019s flyover. They also reported that the contractor\u2019s ground-based  scan found five areas on the perimeter of the 903 lip area that contained  contamination in excess of 50 picocuries per gram of soil, which were  subsequently remediated.", "In addition, DOE and the contractor reported that ORISE\u2019s MARSSIM  sampling had identified 13 \u201chot spots,\u201d or areas with contamination above  the cleanup agreement\u2019s action level of 50 picocuries of plutonium per  gram of soil. Contamination in these 13 hot spots ranged from 65 to 425  picocuries of plutonium per gram of soil. However, a DOE official said that  DOE would not remediate those areas because the regulatory agencies had  already approved the accelerated cleanup actions, and those actions had  been conducted in accordance with the cleanup methodology agreed to by  DOE and the regulatory agencies. The cleanup methodology required that  at least 90 percent of any given area be remediated to the required levels;  accordingly, there was a 10 percent chance that areas of elevated  contamination remained. Even though the cleanup had been conducted in  accordance with the approved methodology (which allowed for the chance  of such elevated contamination remaining), DOE\u2019s initial refusal to  remediate the hot spots caused concern for the Rocky Flats Coalition of  Local Governments, according to the Coalition\u2019s executive director. Within  2 weeks, after consulting with EPA and Colorado, DOE agreed to have the  contractor remediate the hot spots.", "Overall, hundreds of samples were taken at the 903 pad and lip area,  including initial and confirmatory samples.

Specifically, DOE did not have ORISE complete the  planned assessment of the aerial and ground-based scanning or the planned  assessment of the contractor\u2019s investigations of the results of the aerial and  targeted ground-based scans. According to a DOE official, DOE decided  that the results of these remaining assessments would not justify their  completion, particularly because the aerial survey had failed to find any  anomalies.", "Of the 20 community group survey respondents who expressed an opinion  on ORISE\u2019s soil sampling and surface scans (using a FIDLER\u2014a sodium  iodide scintillation detector), 16 said the scan greatly or somewhat  increased their confidence in the site\u2019s cleanup.
