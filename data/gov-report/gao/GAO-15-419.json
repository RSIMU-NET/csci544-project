According to GAO's analysis of the 2013 Survey of Consumer Finances, many older households without retirement savings have few other resources, such as a defined benefit (DB) plan or nonretirement savings, to draw on in retirement (see figure below). For example, among households age 55 and older, about 29 percent have neither retirement savings nor a DB plan, which typically provides a monthly payment for life. Households that have retirement savings generally have other resources to draw on, such as non-retirement savings and DB plans. Among those with some retirement savings, the median amount of those savings is about $104,000 for households age 55-64 and $148,000 for households age 65-74, equivalent to an inflation-protected annuity of $310 and $649 per month, respectively. Social Security provides most of the income for about half of households age 65 and older.", "Studies and surveys GAO reviewed provide mixed evidence about the adequacy of retirement savings. Studies range widely in their conclusions about the degree to which Americans are likely to maintain their pre-retirement standard of living in retirement, largely because of different assumptions about how much income this goal requires. The studies generally found about one-third to two-thirds of workers are at risk of falling short of this target. In surveys, compared to current retirees, workers age 55 and older expect to retire later and a higher percentage plan to work during retirement. However, one survey found that about half of retirees said they retired earlier than planned due to health problems, changes at their workplace, or other factors, suggesting that many workers may be overestimating their future retirement income and savings. Surveys have also found that people age 55-64 are less confident about their finances in retirement than those who are age 65 or older."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Baby boomers, the youngest of whom are now in their 50s, are  approaching and reaching retirement in waves.

(1) Social Security: Social Security pays benefits to retirees, their  spouses, and their survivors, as well as to some disabled workers.  According to the Social Security Administration (SSA), as of 2012, 86  percent of households age 65 and older received Social Security benefits.  Benefits are paid to workers who meet requirements for the time they  have worked in \u201ccovered employment\u201d \u2013 jobs through which workers pay  Social Security taxes, which cover about 96 percent of U.S. workers,  according to SSA. Workers can claim benefits starting at age 62 (or  when they become disabled), but for retiring workers the monthly benefit  they receive increases the longer they delay receiving them, up until age  70.history and are progressive, meaning that Social Security replaces a  higher percentage of earnings for lower-income workers and their  dependents than for higher-income workers.", "Monthly Social Security benefits are based on a worker\u2019s earnings  Social Security benefits offer two main advantages: they are a monthly  stream of payments that continue until death and they adjust annually for  cost-of-living increases. According to the 2014 report from the Social  Security Board of Trustees, the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI)  trust fund from which Social Security benefits are paid is projected to  become depleted in 2034, at which point continuing income is projected  to be sufficient to cover just 75 percent of scheduled benefits. This projection raises the possibility of changes to Social Security benefits,  taxation, or both before the depletion date.  (2) Defined Benefit Plans: these plans are \u201ctraditional\u201d employment-based  pension plans that offer benefits typically determined by a formula based  on factors specified by the plan, such as salary and years of service. DB  plans typically offer pension benefits in the form of an annuity that  provides a monthly payment for life, although some plans also offer a  lump-sum distribution option. An annuity can help to protect a retiree  against risks, including the risk of outliving one\u2019s assets (longevity risk),  and may also offer survivor benefits. However, DB plans carry the risk  that a plan sponsor may freeze or terminate the plan. If a private-sector  plan terminates with insufficient assets to pay promised benefits, the  Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), a federal government  corporation, provides plan insurance and pays promised benefits subject  to certain statutory limits, which may result in some beneficiaries getting  reduced benefits.  (3) Retirement Savings: Introduced over 30 years ago, two primary types  of retirement savings vehicles currently exist: employment-sponsored DC  plans (such as 401(k) plans) and IRAs. For both types, benefits accrue in  the form of account balances, which grow from contributions made by  workers (and sometimes by their employers) and investment returns.  Examples of employer-sponsored DC plans include 401(k) plans, 403(b)  plans, and similar plans for which employers can offer payroll deductions,  employer contributions to employee accounts, or both. Individuals can  also save for retirement through IRAs, which allow individuals to make  contributions for retirement without participating in an employment- sponsored plan. DC plans and IRAs provide tax advantages, portability  of savings, and transparency of known account balances. However, they  also place the primary responsibility on individuals to participate in,  contribute to, and manage their accounts throughout their working  careers, and to manage their savings throughout retirement in order to  keep from running out of money.", "For 2015, individuals can contribute up to $5,500 in IRAs ($6,500 for those age 50 or  older), while the contribution limit for 401(k) plans is $18,000 ($24,000 for those age 50 or  older). Contributions to 401(k) plans and traditional IRAs are not subject to tax when made  (26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 402(e)(3) and 219(a) and (e), respectively); distributions or withdrawals of  principal or earnings from them are subject to tax (26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 402(a) and 408(c)(1),  respectively). Contributions to Roth IRAs are not tax-deductible, but after one has been  established for 5 years, upon reaching age 59\u00bd, an individual may make withdrawals of  principal or earnings not subject to tax. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 408A(c) and (d). revenue loss associated with these accounts included $51.8 billion for DC  plans and $16.2 billion for IRAs.", "Employment-based retirement plan coverage, especially in the private  sector, has shifted from DB to DC plans.

In contrast, in 1975,  about three-quarters of private-sector pension participants had DB plans,  and half of all participants in 1990 had DB plans.

Their findings  emphasize the impact of children and the progressive benefit structure of  Social Security, which replaces a higher percentage of income for lower- income earners than higher-income earners, as key factors explaining  how such a high percentage of households can reach retirement income   They find that only 16 percent of households  adequacy.Khitatrakun find that the percentage of households with adequate  retirement income declines with earnings: about 30 percent of lowest- decile earners undersave in their estimation, compared to 5 percent of the  highest decile. A 2012 study by Hurd and Rohwedder similarly uses a  lifecycle framework that estimates consumption paths of Health and  Retirement Study households, based on consumption in the years prior to  retirement, and projects which households have enough financial  resources to maintain this consumption path until death. The studies by  Hurd and Rohwedder and Scholz, Seshadri, and Khitatrakun assume that  households value consumption later in retirement less than earlier, in part  reflecting the declining probability of being alive later in life;. This  assumption lowers consumption targets later in retirement than they  would under an assumption that households smooth their consumption  throughout retirement. Hurd and Rohwedder found that 23 percent of  married couples and 51 percent of single persons fall short of these  targets. However, they find that single households and those with less  education are more likely to be unprepared for retirement by the study\u2019s  targets.", "However, even with these factors, Scholz, Seshadri, and  A 2012 study from the Investment Company Institute (ICI) and a 2014  study by Andrew Biggs and Sylvester Schieber also express doubt that  Americans are not saving adequately for retirement, although they do not  set an adequacy benchmark based on replacement rate or standard of  living targets against which to measure household savings. ICI argues  that a \u201cfive-tiered pyramid\u201d of retirement assets, made up of Social  Security, employment-based DB and DC pensions, IRAs, housing equity,  and other financial assets, has successfully provided for retirees.  However, while they find that, based on 2010 data, most near-retiree  households across income groups have some assets in an employment- sponsored plan or an IRA, they also find that the percentage of such  households rises with income: about half of households with income less  than $30,000 to about 95 percent of households with income of at least  $80,000. ICI also cites a lower percentage of 65-and-older Americans  living in poverty than the overall population as evidence of success with  the retirement system. They conclude that \u201con average\u201d households are  able to maintain their standard of living in retirement.", "The Biggs and Schieber study argues that reported replacement rates  published in prior Social Security Trustees reports understated the extent  to which Social Security benefits replace earnings because Social  Security uses lifetime earnings (instead of final-year earnings) and  indexes earnings to average wages instead of average prices. These  assumptions, they argue, overstate income during working years, and  thus, published estimates understate how much Social Security benefits  replace as a percentage of working income. Biggs and Schieber, like  Scholz, Seshadri, and Khitatrakun, also argue that some studies set too- high replacement rate targets because they ignore the favorable  economic impact of children leaving the household.", "Assumptions about income targets and methodology help drive the  conclusions of these different studies. Some considerations in evaluating  all of these studies include:  How income and expenses may change during retirement. One limitation  of replacement rate calculations is that they suggest a fixed amount of  retirement income and expenses. In reality, retirement income may vary  throughout retirement, depending in part on the degree to which a  household\u2019s income is annuitized. To the extent that retirees have to  manage savings in lump-sum form, such as in an IRA or DC plan, they  face risk from investment returns and outliving their resources, among  other factors. Even annuitized income, if not adjusted for inflation, may  lose purchasing power, especially over longer retirement periods. To the  extent that Social Security makes up a significant portion of retirement  income, as we find earlier in this report, the amount and purchasing  power of income throughout retirement may be more predictable, as  would annuitized income from a DB plan or any other annuitized wealth (if  inflation adjusted). Similarly, expenses, especially health care, may be  neither steady nor predictable in retirement. Finally, for women  approaching or in retirement, becoming divorced, widowed or  unemployed can have detrimental effects on their income security.", "How the impact of children on target income may be complicated. To the  extent that children become independent long before parents retire,  households approaching retirement may already have adjusted to higher  levels of consumption, possibly raising their standard of living and  required replacement rates. In retirement, the extent to which grown  children may remain partially dependent on retired parents also would  lessen the extent to which the cost of raising children is a foregone  expense in retirement.", "How income from Social Security may change. The 2014 Social Security  Trustees; Report projects the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust  Fund, which pays Social Security retirement benefits, to become insolvent  in 2034, at which point revenues are projected to be enough to cover 75  percent of scheduled benefits.insolvency or because of reforms to extend the solvency of the trust fund,  this could represent a major challenge to households who rely heavily on  Social Security for retirement income. Similarly, if reforms raised payroll  taxes on workers, this could affect their ability to save for retirement.  Further, as the normal retirement age continues to rise for receiving full  benefits (gradually from 65 for beneficiaries born in 1937 or earlier to 67  for those born in 1960 or later), future Social Security replacement rates  will fall unless workers delay claiming until they are older."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Surveys Show That Workers Age 55 and Older Approaching Retirement May Overestimate Their Ability to Earn Future Income", "paragraphs": ["Surveys indicate that workers age 55 and older generally plan to retire at  an older age and work more in retirement than current retirees actually  did.

The 2013 SCF surveyed 6,026 U.S. households about  their pensions, incomes, asset holdings and debts, and demographic  information. The SCF is conducted using a dual-frame sample design.  One part of the design is a standard, multistage area-probability design,  while the second part is a special over-sample of relatively wealthy  households. This is done in order to accurately capture financial  information about the population at large as well as characteristics  specific to the relatively wealthy. The two parts of the sample are adjusted  for sample nonresponse and combined using weights to make estimates  from the survey data representative of households overall.

Similarly, we  used other Federal Reserve variables to describe additional resources  asked about in the SCF, such as home ownership, financial assets  (including savings in and outside of a retirement account), debt, and net  worth.

We consulted  with Federal Reserve staff to inform our calculations of Social Security  and DB plan income. One limitation to these income calculations is that  Social Security and DB plan income are for the respondent and his or her  spouse/partner for 2013, whereas other income is reported for the entire  family for 2012. However, we believe the estimates are reliable for our  purposes. For example, 88 percent of households age 65 and older  consist only of the respondent and his or her spouse/partner.
