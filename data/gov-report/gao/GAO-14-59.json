The schedules appeared to have reasonable durations for most activities, but they did not include information about required resources.", "For both schedules, the Bureau logically linked many activities in a sequence. Yet in both schedules the Bureau did not identify the preceding and following activity for a significant number of activities. Without this logic, the effect of a change in one activity on future activities cannot be seen in the schedule, potentially resulting in unforeseen delays.", "The Bureau is not in a position to carry out a quantitative risk analysis on the schedules.", "As a result of these issues, the schedules are producing inaccurate dates, which could mislead Bureau managers to falsely conclude that all of the work is on schedule when it may not be. Without reliable schedule information, such as valid forecasted dates and the amount of flexibility remaining in the schedule, management faces challenges in assessing the progress of MAF development efforts and determining what activities most need attention. Staff managing the schedules said that they had not received thorough training or certification on scheduling best practices, and, according to schedule managers, staff turnover contributed to the issues GAO identified. Workforce planning and training can help the Bureau have the skills in place to ensure that characteristics of a reliable schedule are met to support key management decisions.", "The Bureau has documented collaboration activities that follow many leading practices for collaboration. Because several divisions are involved in efforts to develop the MAF, collaboration across these divisions is critical. In recent months, the Bureau has put in place a variety of mechanisms to aid coordination, such as crosscutting task teams. For example, research projects relevant to developing the MAF have representation from multiple divisions. The Bureau has also established memorandums of understanding across divisions to provide a broad framework for working together. Continued management attention to collaboration practices will help to ensure that collaboration across units is occurring as MAF development continues."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Census Director take a number of actions to improve the reliability of its schedules, including steps to ensure that all relevant activities are included in the schedules, complete scheduling logic is in place, and a quantitative risk assessment is conducted.

If the Bureau\u2019s address  list and maps are inaccurate, people can be missed, counted more than  once, or counted at the wrong location. However, our prior work has  shown that developing an accurate address list has been both labor  intensive and costly. In the 2000 and 2010 Censuses, for example,  Bureau field staff verified every existing Master Address File (MAF)  housing unit address in the nation and added missing housing units by  going door-to-door. The 2010 effort, known as address canvassing,  required 140,000 temporary workers to verify 145 million addresses at a  cost of $444 million. The Bureau felt that in the absence of research  demonstrating where it could rely on something less than door-to-door  visits to update its address list, it needed to proceed with full canvassing  to develop a quality address list and maps. In addition, census workers  used handheld computers for the first time in the 2010 address  canvassing operation to capture global positioning system information to  improve Bureau maps and address lists.", "With a life cycle cost around $13 billion, the 2010 Census was the most  expensive population count in U.S. history, costing over 50 percent more  than the $8.1 billion 2000 Census.

(Hereafter, we refer to these as  MAF). Primary among the efforts is the Geographic Support System  Initiative (GSS-I), being carried out by the Bureau\u2019s Geography Division.  A central goal of GSS-I is to enable the Bureau to use \u201ctargeted\u201d address  canvassing to replace the more expensive \u201cfull\u201d address canvassing from  prior censuses. Targeted address canvassing would limit the operation  only to areas where the Bureau believes door-to-door verification is  needed to develop an accurate and complete address list, such as areas  where there has been significant new housing development.

While full  address canvassing helped ensure the accuracy of the address list, we  believe it was also very costly. According to Bureau decision documents  leading up to the 2010 Census, the Bureau canceled planned research on  the feasibility of targeting its canvassing when prioritizing its research  agenda early in the decade given its funding levels. As part of the  Bureau\u2019s effort to conduct the 2020 Census at a cost lower than the 2010  Census, the Bureau is researching the feasibility of conducting targeted  address canvassing, verifying addresses in only select areas that are  more likely to require updates to the address list. To support targeted  address canvassing, the Bureau plans to increase its reliance on other  previously used sources of updates, including U.S. Postal Service files,  commercial database files, and significant input from state and local  governments. For example, GSS-I is working to allow government  agencies at all levels to more regularly share and update their address  lists with the Bureau throughout the decade (rather than solely 2 years  prior to the decennial, as had been the case in prior decennial censuses)  so that fewer areas need to be fully canvassed.", "The life cycle for 2020 Census preparation is divided into five phases, as  illustrated in figure 1.

Scheduling staff  were unable to explain why this information was missing. Without this  logic, the effect of a change in one activity on future activities cannot be  seen in the schedule. For example, in the GSS-I schedule, the \u201cdelivery of  the targeted address canvassing recommendation report\u201d to managers  has no predecessor. According to the Bureau, this report is to outline the  research findings, impacts, operational considerations, and benefits of  conducting a targeted address canvassing.

Activities for  which constraints would be justified are Census Day and the delivery of  the Apportionment Count, because they have legally mandated  deadlines. But, for example, the Bureau also placed a constraint on the  delivery of a draft targeted address canvassing report. Such an activity  would likely not need a constraint because delays in preceding activities  could affect the actual timing of the delivery of the draft report. Placing a  constraint on this type of activity would mask in the schedule the effects  of any changes or delays that would affect the true delivery date. While  our schedule guide states that documenting the justification for  constraints is important, the Bureau has not provided justifications in the  schedule for its use of constraints. The Bureau told us that justifications  are in meeting notes and e-mails, rather than the schedule. If this  information is not included in the schedule, the justification for constraints  remains unclear to those who did not have access to the meeting notes or  e-mails.

The absence of a critical path or a poorly constructed  one calls into question the reliability of the calculated schedule dates,  such as estimates of when research results will be available. When  certain constraints are placed on an activity, this can automatically trigger  the schedule software to place an activity on the calculated critical path  when it might otherwise not be. Because the Bureau used so many  constraints and the schedule is missing logic about preceding and  following activities, it is possible that the calculated critical path includes  activities that are not necessarily germane to the true critical path.  Eliminating the unnecessary constraints and including additional logic  would provide a more accurate picture of the degree of criticality in the  schedule. Until the Bureau can produce a true critical path, it will not be  able to provide reliable timeline estimates of effects of schedule changes.  This undermines the Bureau\u2019s ability to focus on activities that will have  detrimental effects on the progress of designing targeted address  canvassing and other 2020 Census decisions.", "Finally, a critical path with so many activities appearing on it is not useful  to managers in identifying what is truly necessary to develop the MAF in a  timely manner. For example, within the 2020 Research and Testing  schedule, 52 percent of activities not yet completed appear on the  calculated critical path. Similarly, for the GSS-I schedule, 19 percent of  the activities appear on the calculated critical path, almost half of which  could be because constraints are placed on them.

For example,  two documents dated July 2013 cite the same baseline date from the  schedule list major milestones, but the documents indicate a different  date for the same part of the research and testing schedule; one states  that the research and testing milestones for the current phase will be  complete in September 2014, while the other states that these milestones  will be completed in September 2015. Bureau managers acknowledged  that the planning milestones within the schedule had not been updated to  reflect ongoing Bureau management decisions about reprioritizing  research and testing plans in light of budget uncertainty during fiscal year  2013.

Our analysis of two Bureau schedules key to MAF  development efforts indicates that there are problems with the schedules\u2019  reliability. It will be important to ensure that schedules are comprehensive  in order for management to be reasonably assured that they have  complete information to make decisions. Similarly, problems with the  schedules\u2019 construction mean that the progression of critical events could  be unclear to management. Finally, the schedules lack credibility,  meaning that risks, including those the Bureau has already identified,  could impact the schedules in ways not yet considered. Some of the  identified deficiencies indicate that staff and managers have not been  available and prepared to sufficiently construct and maintain the  schedules. Conducting a workforce planning process of staff working on  MAF schedules could help the Bureau to identify staff skills needed to  help ensure related gaps are addressed.
