In light of these questions, GAO was asked to review Advocacy's activities.", "This report examines Advocacy's (1) research, (2) regulatory activities, and (3) workforce planning efforts. GAO analyzed Advocacy's research, comment letters, and other regulatory information for fiscal years 2008-2013; assessed Advocacy's policies and procedures against federal standards for internal control and information quality; and interviewed agency officials, and small business and industry representatives.

However, GAO identified key areas in Advocacy's system of internal control that could be improved.", "Research. GAO found that Advocacy did not ensure that its staff monitored the quality of the information the office disseminated, as required. GAO reviewed 20 selected research products and found that in 16 cases a required quality review had not been documented. Advocacy recently established a review policy for its research, but it does not include procedures for selecting the reviewers or documenting that a review occurred and how reviewer comments are addressed. GAO also found that Advocacy staff had not followed federal information quality guidelines to retain data and could not substantiate the quality of information in two cost-estimation reports\u2014a research product it has contracted for every 5 years. Without better controls over its quality review process and efforts to substantiate the information it disseminates, Advocacy cannot ensure the validity of one of its core activities\u2014research in support of small businesses.", "Regulatory activities. Advocacy recently updated procedures for its regulatory activities, but these could be strengthened. GAO found the extent to which individual staff maintained records varied, in part, because the procedures lacked policies for documentation. For instance, the procedures state that when staff decide to intervene in the rulemaking process, they must follow up as appropriate with the interested groups to ensure that Advocacy has sufficient information and data to support its case. However, there is no policy that these interactions be documented. Federal internal control standards state that documentation and records should be maintained. If key procedures are not being documented, managers do not have an institutional record that agency goals and objectives in this area are being met. GAO also found that the Federal Advisory Committee Act's transparency and other requirements do not apply to Advocacy's meetings with stakeholders to get input on regulations (roundtables).", "Workforce planning. Advocacy's workforce efforts include training and mentoring for new staff, but do not include succession planning, which is recommended by the Office of Personnel Management. According to federal internal control standards, effective management of a workforce is essential to achieving program results. Officials told GAO that Advocacy was a small office and that additional staff were hired on an as-needed basis. However, some key staff have been with Advocacy for many years and their experience will be difficult to replace. If Advocacy does not incorporate succession planning strategies into its workforce planning efforts, it is at risk of not having the skills and expertise to meet its mission when key staff leave or retire."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO makes several recommendations to improve the Office of Advocacy's controls over the quality of its research, the documentation of its regulatory activities, and workforce planning.

Our sample was  designed to include a variety of topics and report types and focused on  more recent publications in order to maximize the possibility that the  research staff involved would be available for interviews. In addition, we  evaluated three of Advocacy\u2019s most recent external studies on the  economic costs of regulation and assessed the studies against OMB and  SBA Information Quality Guidelines. We also reviewed peer reviewers\u2019  comments and other external reviews on the studies to understand  questions that had been raised about the studies.

We  interviewed Advocacy staff who were responsible for these activities and  reviewed supporting documentation to understand their origins and  purposes. In addition, we attended three roundtables. To analyze whether  FACA (5 U.S.C. App. II) applies to Advocacy\u2019s roundtables, we reviewed  relevant statutes, case law, regulations, and guidance. We also  considered Advocacy\u2019s views on the issue. Lastly, we interviewed officials  from the entities that interact with Advocacy in rulemaking\u2014the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Occupational Safety and Health  Administration (OSHA), Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, also  known as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and OMB\u2019s  Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). Also, we interviewed  officials from six industry associations that represent small and large  businesses; one large corporation; and two nonprofit organizations whose  missions relate to policies or rules under consideration, to understand  their perspectives on Advocacy\u2019s roundtables and other work. We made  our selections to include representatives from a variety of sources, and  while the results from our interviews cannot be projected to all entities  that interact with Advocacy, the information we gathered provides insights  into how the selected groups view Advocacy and its work in representing  small businesses to federal policymakers.", "To assess Advocacy\u2019s workforce planning efforts, we interviewed senior  management to discuss any workforce planning efforts that were in place.

First, in 1980 the White  House Conference on Small Business made recommendations that led  directly to the passage of the RFA, which requires government agencies  to consider the effects of their regulatory actions on small entities and,  where possible, mitigate them. Under the RFA, agencies provide a small  business impact analysis, known as an initial regulatory flexibility  analysis, with every proposed rule published for notice and comment and  a final regulatory flexibility analysis with every final rule. The Chief  Counsel for Advocacy was charged with monitoring federal agencies\u2019  compliance with the act and with submitting an annual report to  Congress.", "Second, in 1996 the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness  Act (SBREFA) provided for the judicial review of agency compliance with  key sections of the RFA. It also established a requirement that EPA and  OSHA convene panels whenever these agencies are developing a rule  for which an initial regulatory flexibility analysis would be required  (SBREFA panels). These panels consist of the agency, OIRA, and  Advocacy. The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act added the newly created CFPB to  the agencies required to convene SBREFA panels. The SBREFA panels  meet with representatives of the affected small businesses to review the  agencies\u2019 draft proposed rules, identify alternative approaches to the  rules, and provide insight on the anticipated impact of the rules on small  entities. The panels issue a report, including any recommendations for  minimizing the economic impact of the rule on small entities.", "Third, Advocacy\u2019s responsibilities were further expanded by Executive  Order 13272, which was issued in 2002. The order required each agency  to establish procedures and policies to promote compliance with the RFA  and to publish a response in the Federal Register to any written comment  received from Advocacy on rules published. This requirement was  codified by the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010. Executive Order  13272 also directs Advocacy to provide training to federal agencies on  how to comply with the RFA.", "Until 2010, Advocacy\u2019s budget was part of SBA\u2019s. As of fiscal year 2010,  however, Advocacy was given statutory line-item funding in a Treasury  account separate from other SBA funding, with Congress setting the  amount available for Advocacy\u2019s direct costs. In fiscal year 2014,  Advocacy\u2019s enacted budget was $8.75 million. Its fiscal year 2015 budget  request was $8.46 million. Of that amount, $7.75 million (92 percent) is to  be used to fund compensation and benefits for Advocacy\u2019s professional  staff, with the balance of Advocacy\u2019s budget split almost equally between  external research and all other direct expenses.

More specialized research\u2014requiring proprietary data or  econometric analysis\u2014typically is conducted by contractors (external).  SBA handles the contracting process for Advocacy. The contracts  generally last for 1 year. Advocacy economists act as the official  contracting officers\u2019 representatives (contracting officer) overseeing and  coordinating the work of the contractors. The contracting officers maintain  a contract file for each external research product. Each year the Office of  Economic Research solicits research topics from Advocacy staff and  small business stakeholders, such as associations comprised of small  businesses. In addition, Congress requests studies, either formally (by  putting the requirement into a law), or informally (through discussions with  Advocacy staff). A final list of potential research is presented to the Chief  Counsel before the beginning of the fiscal year, and the counsel chooses  the topics for the year. In fiscal year 2013, Advocacy produced 22  research products on topics that included access to capital, small  business exporters, entrepreneurship, and minority- and women-owned  businesses. Other Advocacy research addresses the concerns  highlighted in Advocacy\u2019s authorizing statute, such as examining the role  of small business in the American economy, assessing the effectiveness  of existing federal subsidies and assistance programs for small  businesses, and evaluating efforts to assist small veteran-owned small  business concerns.", "Advocacy follows a peer review process that was revised and formalized  in 2013 and applies to all internal and external research products.  Advocacy staff, including the Director of the Office of Economic  Research, conduct peer reviews for internal products. For external  research products, the peer review is initiated when Advocacy receives  the first draft of the product, typically 6 to 8 months after the contract has  been awarded, and generally includes external reviewers. In addition to  the peer review process, all of Advocacy\u2019s research products are required  to pass Advocacy\u2019s internal clearance process, which involves review by  the Director of Economic Research, editors in Advocacy\u2019s Office of  Information, and individuals in Advocacy\u2019s Office of Chief Counsel (Senior  Advisor, Deputy Chief Counsel, and Chief Counsel)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulatory Activities", "paragraphs": ["Advocacy\u2019s Office of Interagency Affairs oversees the office\u2019s regulatory  activities, which aim to convey the views of small businesses on the  impact of federal regulations and related costs.

Attorneys in this office (\u201cregulatory attorneys\u201d) are expected to become  experts in the policy areas they oversee and to establish and maintain  broad and effective networks of small business experts (e.g., trade  associations) in their policy area. The regulatory attorneys are  encouraged to go to trade association and other industry meetings in  order to maintain and expand those networks. In addition to maintaining  working relationships with industry members and experts, the staff are to  establish and maintain relationships with the regulatory staff within each  agency who write the rules.", "One of the primary ways Advocacy provides input to agencies that are  issuing rules and regulations of concern to small businesses is through  public comment letters. Our review of comment letters from fiscal years  2009 through 2013 found that they covered a wide range of rulemakings  on issues such as food labeling, designations for critical habitat, and  emission standards. Advocacy made a number of recommendations in its  comment letters that included creating an exemption for small businesses  or strengthening economic analyses required by the RFA. Advocacy also  issued \u201cnonrule\u201d letters that involved the agencies\u2019 other activities, such  as agencies\u2019 scientific research. These letters constitute a small  proportion of Advocacy\u2019s comment letters.

Roundtables are  convened on a regular basis in two policy areas\u2014environment and labor  safety\u2014while events covering other areas are convened on an ad hoc  basis, depending on which regulatory or rulemaking issues might be  forthcoming. According to the regulatory attorneys, the most typical  reason for convening a roundtable was an upcoming rule or legislation  that would impact small businesses. The regulatory attorneys use the  information gathered from the roundtables, together with other  information, to inform Advocacy\u2019s positions on the issues involved, and to  give Advocacy direction on proposed rules\u2019 economic impacts and  possible regulatory alternatives. The attorneys also told us roundtable  discussions help them set priorities, and broaden their knowledge base.  The roundtables sometimes resulted in a comment letter, although not  always. Table 2 shows the number of roundtables by policy area for fiscal  years 2009 through 2013.", "As discussed previously, Executive Order 13272 requires Advocacy to  provide training to the agencies on how to comply with the RFA.

We found that the written guidance discussed the various levels of review  for internal and external products as well as a process for initiating peer  review. However, it did not specify how the economists who managed the  research products were to identify peer reviewers. Instead, Advocacy  officials told us that they relied on their own expertise and professional  contacts to identify appropriate peer reviewers and provide  recommendations through the Director of Research and to the Chief  Counsel for Advocacy. The officials told us that within a specific subject  matter there is often a small group of available peer reviewers, in part  because their expertise is specialized and there are not many other  alternatives.", "OMB\u2019s peer review guidance calls on agencies to select peer reviewers  with the appropriate knowledge and expertise and to take into account  their independence and lack of conflicts of interest.

Federal internal control standards state that internal control activities help  ensure that management\u2019s directives are carried out and in implementing  those standards management is responsible for developing the detailed  policies, procedures and practices for their agency\u2019s operations.

According  to interviews with Advocacy economists who managed the research, all of  the 20 products underwent some form of peer review. The economists  said that the type of review was commensurate with the methodological  complexity of each product, among other factors. However, the Advocacy  officials were unable to produce any documentation that peer reviews  occurred for these 16 products. According to Advocacy\u2019s peer review  guidance, the economists who manage the research should document all  correspondence pertaining to the peer review and maintain this  documentation in the research file. In addition, federal internal control  standards require all transactions and significant events be documented  and that the documentation be readily available.", "Advocacy officials do not have procedures to review the external research  files to ensure that the peer reviews were documented. Furthermore, they  noted that for some of the less in-depth internal research products\u2014 typically 2 to 5 pages\u2014such documentation would be administratively  burdensome. However, we note that the documentation could be  likewise concise, such as a checklist, or a form that reviewers sign,  similar to the one currently used by Advocacy for its internal clearance  process. Otherwise, absent written documentation, Advocacy managers  are limited in their ability to conduct oversight and ensure that this key  quality control activity is happening. For example, for one of the internal  research products we selected for review, the study author no longer  worked at Advocacy, and therefore no one could tell us with any certainty  whether the required peer review had occurred, or who had participated  in it.

Of the 10 external research files we reviewed, 4 had  documentation that a peer review occurred, and 1 file included evidence  that the peer reviewer comments were incorporated into the final report.  Advocacy officials told us that the economists who managed external  research consolidated the peer reviewers\u2019 comments and forwarded to  the author those that needed to be addressed, including methodological  and data issues and other comments, but not those that might change the  scope of the contracted research. They also told us that they did not  typically maintain documentation showing which comments had been  addressed and why, but included the final report in the research file.  However, Advocacy\u2019s peer review process states that the economist  managing the research will analyze and incorporate, as needed, peer  reviewers\u2019 suggestions and maintain all related documentation in the  research file. However, since the economists are not keeping records and  documenting that comments have been considered and addressed,  management does not have an institutional record to provide reasonable  assurance that its quality control process is being followed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Advocacy Has Not Followed Some Required Elements of Information Quality Guidelines", "paragraphs": ["While Advocacy has quality review policies for its peer review process, it  does not have policies and procedures that reflect the federal information  quality guidelines on retaining data for influential studies or taking other  steps to substantiate the quality of information in such studies when they  have not retained the data. Advocacy officials told us that they did not  retain the original data or underlying computer codes for three external  studies on the costs of regulation as required by the information quality  guidelines. We focused on external studies on estimating the costs of  regulation because it is a key research area for Advocacy, according to its  originating statute and the mission statement of its Office of Economic  Research. The OMB Information Quality Guidelines require that all  agencies producing and disseminating \u201cinfluential statistical information\u201d  help ensure a high degree of transparency about data and methods to  facilitate the reproducibility of such information by qualified third parties.  The SBA guidelines implement this standard for transparency by requiring  that the underlying data be stored and made available for public review  for as long as the agency-disseminated information based on the data are  valid. The guidelines also state that all formulas, calculations, matrixes,  and assumptions used in processing the data should be available.  Because Advocacy classified two of the regulatory cost studies as  \u201cinfluential\u201d according to the OMB guidelines, those data should have  been maintained.", "Advocacy officials said that they did not maintain the data or models for  influential external research because there might be a cost associated  with obtaining such data, which would raise the costs of the studies,  possibly making them prohibitively expensive. However, in the case of  two of the studies, the original data were from publicly available sources  and involved a relatively small dataset, suggesting the cost would not  have been prohibitive. The OMB guidelines state that sufficient  transparency\u2014achieved in part by storing the relevant data\u2014results in  analyses that can be substantially reproduced. Not retaining the  underlying information for these influential research papers makes it  much more difficult to assess the quality of that work, including its  objectivity\u2014a key goal of the information quality guidelines.", "We also found that Advocacy staff had not taken additional steps, in the  absence of retaining the underlying data, to substantiate the quality of the  regulatory cost estimates in two of the studies that it sponsored and  disseminated. The OMB guidelines state that when data and methods  are not retained and made available to the public because of other  compelling interests such as privacy, trade secrets, intellectual property,  and other confidentiality protections, the agency shall apply rigorous  checks to the analytical results and document what checks were  undertaken. Because Advocacy had not retained data on the two cost  estimation studies that had been criticized, we interviewed senior  Advocacy officials, including the Director of its Office of Economic  Research, about the information and methodologies used in the studies.  We asked them a set of questions related to criticisms of the  methodologies, data, and models used in the studies that were identified  in our evaluation and the work of other researchers. Advocacy staff  declined to answer many of our questions and instead directed us to the  authors, stating that they, not Advocacy economists, were the experts on  the issues covered in the studies. However, the authors would not  speak with us, stating that they were no longer contractually obligated to  respond to our requests for information.", "During our discussions with Advocacy officials, they stated that the  purpose of the studies was not to estimate the overall costs of  regulations, but rather to estimate the disproportionate share borne by  small businesses. They also noted that, as with all contract research, the  external research reports contain a disclaimer indicating that the views  presented did not necessarily represent those of Advocacy. In addition,  Advocacy added language to the 2010 report\u2019s cover page about the  uncertainty of the authors\u2019 estimates of the costs of regulation.  Advocacy officials noted that the majority of the research it conducts is  not classified \u201cinfluential\u201d according to the OMB and SBA guidelines, and  that they have no plans to engage in such work in the near future.  However, given Advocacy\u2019s mission, it may do influential research in the  future as it has in the past even if on a limited basis. We acknowledge  that these reports may not necessarily be representative of all Advocacy\u2019s  research efforts, but not substantiating the quality of the information in  even one study could call into question the credibility of Advocacy\u2019s  research program. Thus, establishing policies and procedures that reflect  the federal information quality guidelines on retaining data for influential  studies or when such data are not retained because of certain compelling  interests, and requiring additional steps to substantiate the quality of the  information, would put Advocacy in a better position to provide  reasonable assurance about the quality of its research program.", "OMB Information Quality Guidelines require that agencies develop  policies to ensure that managers be able to substantiate the quality of  information they disseminate. The guidelines also discuss narrow  circumstances under which an agency does not have to substantiate the  quality of the information that resulted from a research project of one of its  contractors or grantees. In those circumstances, the researcher is to  make clear with an appropriate disclaimer that the views expressed in the  research are his or her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the  agency. However, OMB cautions that \u201cif an agency, as an institution,  disseminates information prepared by an outside party in a manner that  reasonably suggests that the agency agrees with the information, this  appearance of having the information represent agency views makes  agency dissemination of the information subject to these guidelines.\u201d", "As we noted previously, Advocacy placed a disclaimer on the two studies,  but its actions indicate its agreement with the information in the studies.  First, Advocacy made the two studies available on its website, where they  continue to be available. Second, Advocacy\u2019s disclaimer that appeared on  the 2010 study noted that it contained information and analysis that was  reviewed and edited by Advocacy. Advocacy\u2019s description of its review  role suggests that the agency contributed to the content, if not the  conclusions of the study. Finally, several Advocacy comment letters have  cited the 2005 study\u2019s regulatory cost estimates in support of their  arguments. Because Advocacy\u2019s actions raise, at the least, an  appearance of agreement with the information contained in the studies,  we believe that the office was required to substantiate the quality of the  estimates of the economic costs contained in the studies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Documentation of Key Regulatory Activities is Inconsistent and Roundtables Are Not Publicized According to Advocacy\u2019s Policies", "paragraphs": ["Advocacy has practices and procedures (\u201cpolicies\u201d) for its regulatory  activities\u2014comment letters and roundtables\u2014however, documentation of  these key regulatory activities is inconsistent.

But when we  interviewed seven regulatory attorneys about how they developed  comment letters generally, some told us that they maintained a record  of the entities providing input for specific letters, but others said that  they did not.

We interviewed seven regulatory  attorneys responsible for the roundtables and their management and  were told that the attorneys set agendas and selected speakers based  on their own assessment of the issues and, in some cases, with  suggestions from small businesses or interested industry parties.  Advocacy officials emphasized that they only held roundtables when  there is sufficient interest or need on the part of small businesses.", "Roundtable Discussions and Participants. Information gathered from  the roundtables is used to inform Advocacy\u2019s positions on issues  related to small businesses and in comment letters, but Advocacy\u2019s  guidance contains no policies to document roundtable discussions.  Our content analysis of Advocacy\u2019s comment letters showed 19  percent of them referred to roundtable discussions. However, staff did  not routinely take and maintain notes of the discussions, according to  the interviews we conducted with the regulatory attorneys. In addition,  not all staff take attendance at the events. In most cases, Advocacy  staff keep an \u201cRSVP list\u201d of those who have indicated that they will  attend. However, some of the staff noted that the RSVP lists may not  include all participants, including those on the phone. As a result it is  difficult to determine the extent to which small businesses and related  entities were represented at these events.", "Advocacy officials told us that they did not have guidance on maintaining  documentation on the sources of input to comment letters or on  roundtable discussions because they did not feel that setting such  standards was required to fulfill their duties under Advocacy\u2019s statute.  Furthermore, they noted that, in the case of roundtables, keeping records  in a manner that identified specific speakers would inhibit discussion and  limit their ability to gain valuable input. They also cited logistical  challenges in taking accurate attendance at larger events. We  acknowledge that specific parties might not want to be publicly named,  but federal standards for internal control call for agencies to document  significant events. Taking steps to balance the need for privacy so  individuals can speak freely, with a commitment to maintain a basic level  of documentation of these events\u2014that is, documenting which entities  provided input into its comment letters and roundtables\u2014could help  Advocacy demonstrate that it is meeting its mission to represent the  interests of small businesses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Advocacy\u2019s Policy for Publicizing Information on Roundtable Events Is Not Followed", "paragraphs": ["Key documents for Advocacy\u2019s roundtables\u2014agendas and presentation  materials\u2014are not made available to the public at-large after the fact.

It is  Advocacy\u2019s policy to add any interested parties to the invitation list, if  asked, and several of the attorneys we interviewed said they did so. They  also told us they made agendas and presentations available to any  interested parties who requested them after the roundtable. However, the  agendas and presentations are not posted to the website or made  publically available in any systematic way and if small businesses and  other interested parties do not know about the roundtables, they cannot  request information from the events.", "Advocacy\u2019s policies and procedures state that agendas and presentations  should be posted on Advocacy\u2019s website. Advocacy officials stated they  had been unable to post roundtable materials to the website, which SBA  maintains, because of difficulties in meeting certain readability and  accessibility requirements in the Americans with Disabilities Act.  However, a variety of other Advocacy reports and publications are posted  on its website that also must meet these requirements, and Advocacy  officials did not explain why information on the roundtables could not be  likewise included.

We found that the roundtables are not advisory  committees, and thus Advocacy is not required by law to follow these  rules. We first determined that Advocacy is an \u201cagency\u201d covered by  FACA. It is an \u201cauthority of the Government of the United States, whether  or not it is within or subject to review by another agency.\u201d In addition,  Advocacy possesses the type of \u201csubstantial independent authority\u201d  required by the courts. While located within SBA, Advocacy is  independent of SBA, and it has distinct statutory authorities and  responsibilities, a separate statutory charter, and an appropriation  account that is separate from the rest of SBA.

A covered  advisory committee is a panel, task force, or similar group created or  used by an agency for the purpose of providing advice or  recommendations on particular matters. Participants\u2019 input must be  sought as a group, not as a collection of individuals. The formality and  fixed structure of the group also is an important factor in determining  coverage under FACA. Advocacy does not seek roundtable participants\u2019  input as a group, however; rather, attendees provide their individual  perspectives on the agency rule or policy under discussion, do not  significantly interact with one another, and no attempt is made to reach a  consensus. Advocacy\u2019s roundtables also do not have the requisite  organized or fixed structure; rather, as noted, Advocacy\u2019s policy is to  extend roundtable invitations to anyone who expresses a desire to attend.  Finally, according to Advocacy, it is the agency itself, not the roundtable  participants, that develops policy advice and recommendations, albeit  based in part on the data and information provided by roundtable  participants (as well as obtained elsewhere).

While the office currently does some workforce planning,  its efforts do not include the long-term strategic plans that would help  ensure that it maintains the expertise and skills needed to fulfill its  mission. While Advocacy now has responsibility for developing its own  budget, goals, and performance measures, our review of its strategic plan  and goals did not find goals or objectives that discussed workforce issues  such as staff development and succession planning. Advocacy officials  told us that they used their organizational chart as the basis for their  workforce planning efforts and discussed workforce issues with staff and  managers at meetings as needed (see fig. 2). Advocacy officials said that  because Advocacy was a small office with only 46 staff, the  organizational chart and meetings to discuss staffing issues met their  workforce planning needs. Advocacy officials told us that to develop staff  they provided training to regulatory attorney and economist staff, had  established a mentoring program for newer staff, and were implementing  a knowledge-sharing database to help staff develop expertise in  specialized policy areas.", "When we asked Advocacy officials about succession planning and their  plans for addressing the departure of senior or experienced staff, the  officials told us that most of the turnover in staff occurred during changes  in administration. For example, according to Advocacy officials, the  change of administration in 2009 resulted in the turnover of at least 15 of  20 senior officials. Among these were the 10 regional advocates, who are  located in each of SBA\u2019s regional offices across the country, and make up  the Office of Regional Affairs. Turnover tends to be low among the  economists and regulatory attorneys, some of whom have been with the  office for years. Advocacy officials said that because rulemaking often  took so long, they generally had enough time to hire or realign any staff  as needed.", "According to federal internal control standards, effective management of  a workforce is essential to achieving program results. Our body of work  on workforce planning has demonstrated the importance of such planning  and the need to develop long-term strategies\u2014such as training and  succession planning\u2014for acquiring, developing, and retaining staff to  achieve programmatic goals. OPM\u2019s Human Capital Assessment and  Accountability Framework states that agencies and offices with workforce  planning are better able to manage their staff by, for example, ensuring  that systematic processes are in place for identifying and addressing any  gaps between current and future workforce needs. Further, OPM  recommends that succession planning is needed to ensure continuity in  leadership positions. In addition, workforce planning can help  management determine the type of training and other strategies that are  needed to address factors such as projected retirements and succession  planning. In past work on succession planning, we have found that in  addition to focusing on replacing individuals, succession planning  strategies can also strengthen current and future organizational  capacity.", "Given the length of time some attorneys and economists have been with  Advocacy, the loss of their expertise through retirement, among other  things, could leave significant gaps in needed skills and knowledge,  according to Advocacy officials. Yet Advocacy has not incorporated  succession planning into its workforce planning efforts, such as its  training and mentoring initiatives. Further, Advocacy officials told us that  they discussed future staffing needs and various options for addressing  them, including training, but these efforts are not documented in a  manner that would ensure consistent implementation. However, ensuring  that activities such as staff training are consistently implemented is  particularly important when senior management can change significantly  every 4 or 8 years. Without incorporating long-term succession planning  into its workforce planning efforts, Advocacy is not in the best position to  ensure that it has qualified staff to fill leadership and other key positions  and a skilled workforce able to meet the demands of its mission on behalf  of small businesses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Effective internal controls are critical for the Office of Advocacy if it is to  achieve program outcomes and minimize operational problems.

In its research operations, Advocacy has taken  some initial steps toward establishing stronger control policies by, for  example, formalizing its peer review process for internal and external  research products. However, the guidance provided did not include  information on how to select appropriate peer reviewers\u2014the experts  whom Advocacy relies on to assess the quality of the research that it  disseminates. The guidance also lacks policies for documenting that a  peer review occurred and how reviewer comments were addressed  for its external research products. Such guidance would help ensure  that Advocacy research staff fully understand how best to identify the  most qualified peer reviewers, and how to document and incorporate  reviewer comments. In addition, Advocacy did not follow federal  guidelines for information quality for influential studies that set out  requirements for retaining data and taking additional steps to  substantiate the quality of information it disseminates when it has  certain compelling reasons to not retain the data. Improving policies  and procedures for its research activities would help support  Advocacy\u2019s mission to provide quality research on small business  issues that decision makers and the public can rely on.", "Regulatory activities.

As a result, the extent to which the small businesses\u2019 views on  regulations were being obtained and communicated is unknown.  Improving its guidance to staff on its regulatory activities and  emphasizing the importance of documentation would enable  Advocacy to more effectively demonstrate to decision makers that it  was obtaining and communicating the interests of small businesses.  In addition, Advocacy is not following its internal policy to post  materials from roundtables on its website.

To evaluate Advocacy\u2019s research activities, we analyzed a  nonprobability sample of research, which included 10 research products  authored by Advocacy staff (internal), and 10 products produced by its  contractors (external). To select a sample of internal research products  that best represented the variety of internal research, we reviewed the 58  research products issued from fiscal years 2008 through 2012, and  categorized each as either \u201croutine\u201d (meaning published either quarterly  or semi-annually, and relying on the same underlying data set), or as  \u201cnonroutine.\u201d Within the routine category, we selected the mostly recently  published product from each of the following routine publications: (1)  Small Business Profiles of the States and Territories, (2) Small Business  Quarterly Bulletin, (3) Quarterly Lending Bulletin, (4) Small Business  Lending, and (5) The Small Business Economy. For the nonroutine  products, we created five categories, such as \u201canalysis\u201d and \u201cfact sheets.\u201d  We selected, from each of those five categories, the most recently  published report. Then, for each of the 10 selected internal research  products, we used a data collection instrument and interviewed the  Advocacy staff who wrote the products in order to see to what extent the  products adhered to Information Quality Guidelines issued by the Office  of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Small Business  Administration (SBA) and Advocacy\u2019s internal quality review process  (\u201cpeer review\u201d). To assess the quality of the peer review used for  Advocacy\u2019s external research, we reviewed the contract files for the 10  most recently published external research products, as of year-end 2013,  and compared how the work was produced, including Advocacy\u2019s peer  review process, against the OMB Peer Review Guidance and OMB and  SBA information quality guidelines, and applicable federal internal control  standards.

We focused on external studies in these  areas because they are key research areas for Advocacy, according to its  originating statute and the mission statement of its Office of Economic  Research.
