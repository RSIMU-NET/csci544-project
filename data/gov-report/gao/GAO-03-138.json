Industry officials and academics have speculated that several factors may have caused U.S. companies to use questionable accounting practices. Some officials have stated that increased focus and guidance by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on accounting issues in the late 1990s may have prompted more companies to restate previously reported financial statements. Although the number of restating companies continues to make up a small percentage of all publicly listed companies annually, the number of restatements due to accounting irregularities grew significantly--145 percent--from January 1997 through June 2002. The 845 restating companies GAO identified had restated their financial statements for many reasons--for example, to adjust revenue, costs or expenses, or to address securities-related issues. From January 1997 to June 2002, issues involving revenue recognition accounted for almost 38 percent of the 919 announced restatements. Finally, different parties can prompt a restatement, including the restating company, an external auditor, or SEC. The 689 publicly traded companies GAO identified that announced restatements between January 1997 and March 2002 lost billions of dollars in market capitalization in the days around the initial restatement announcement. However, these losses had potential ripple effects on overall investor confidence and market trends. The growing number of restatements and mounting questions about certain corporate accounting practices appear to have shaken investors' confidence in the nation's financial reporting system. Although determining the effect of the restatements and other accounting issues on overall investor confidence is difficult to measure, various attempts to measure investor confidence have been made. With the increase in the number of restatements due to accounting irregularities, 20 percent of SEC's enforcement cases since the late 1990s were for violations resulting from financial reporting and accounting practices. To address these, SEC has sought a variety of penalties, including levying monetary sanctions, issuing cease-and-desist orders, and barring individuals from appearing before SEC or serving as officers or directors in public companies. The recent increase in the number and size of restatements and disclosures of accounting issues and irregularities underlying them have raised significant questions about the adequacy of the current system of corporate governance and financial disclosure oversight. In addition to public companies, their auditors, and SEC, investors rely on a variety of parties for oversight and financial information, including stock markets, securities analysts, and credit rating agencies, all of which have roles in the corporate governance system or provide information to the investing public. However, recent events have raised concerns about the roles played by each of these parties. On July 30, 2002, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was enacted. The act addresses many of these concerns, including strengthening corporate governance and improving transparency and accountability to help ensure the accuracy and integrity of the financial reporting system. The act authorizes additional funding for SEC, which has faced staffing and workload imbalances that have challenged its ability to fulfill its mission."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["A number of well-publicized announcements about financial statement  restatements by large, well-known public companies such as Xerox,  Enron, and WorldCom have erased billions of dollars of previously  reported earnings and raised questions about the credibility of accounting  practices and the quality of corporate financial disclosure and oversight in  the United States. Industry officials and academics have speculated that  several factors may have caused U.S. companies to use questionable  accounting practices, including (1) corporate pressure to meet quarterly  earnings projections and thus maintain stock prices during and after the  market expansion of the 1990s, (2) perverse executive compensation  incentives, (3) outdated accounting and rule-based standards, and (4)  complex corporate financing arrangements. Industry officials also have  testified that public accounting firms\u2019 independence has been  compromised and that they may have faced some pressure to agree with, or  ignore, questionable accounting practices in order to keep some clients\u2019  business.

We included only announced restatements that were being made to  correct previous material misstatements of financial results. Therefore, our  database excludes announcements involving stock splits, changes in  accounting principles, and other financial statement restatements that  were not made to correct mistakes in the application of accounting  standards. While several other studies have used similar methodology,  there is no known authoritative restatement list against which to compare  the completeness of our list. However, we cross-checked portions of our  list with lists compiled by SEC, the Congressional Research Service, and  others when this information was available. We also reviewed SEC filings  to verify the accuracy of particular restatement announcement dates.", "To determine the immediate impact on stock prices, we analyzed 689 of the  919 restatements that were announced from January 1, 1997, to March 26,  2002, to determine why restatements occurred and collected information  on other characteristics of the restatement trends. We excluded 230 cases  because (1) they involved stocks not listed on the New York Stock  Exchange (NYSE), the National Association of Securities Dealers  Automated Quotation (Nasdaq), or the American Stock Exchange (Amex);  (2) they involved announcements made after March 26, 2002; or (3) they  were missing data for the relevant time period due to trading suspensions,  bankruptcies, and mergers, among other things. For each of these 689  cases, we analyzed the company\u2019s stock price on the trading day before, the  trading day of, and the trading day after the announcement date in order to  assess the immediate impact and calculate the change in market  capitalization. We also analyzed the intermediate impact (60 trading days  before and after the restatement announcement date) for 575 restatements.  This calculation required 3 months of trading data before and after the  announcement date; therefore, we excluded an additional 114 restatements  because the announcement was made after December 31, 2001, the  restating companies filed for bankruptcy, or data were missing for the  relevant time period. In both the immediate and intermediate calculations,  we attempted to adjust for overall market movements, such as the general  decline in the stock market since 2000. We also did additional analyses on  the cases that were excluded from the immediate and intermediate impact  analyses due to missing data to determine the immediate and intermediate  impact on market capitalization. We also reviewed survey and other  empirical data and obtained the views of industry experts on investor  confidence and participation in U.S. capital markets.", "To obtain information about the recent enforcement actions SEC has taken  to address accounting and auditing irregularities, we collected information  on SEC\u2019s enforcement process, reviewed available SEC information, and  analyzed SEC\u2019s enforcement activity involving accounting irregularities  from January 1, 2001, to February 28, 2002.

The  Securities Act requires that a public offering of securities be registered with  SEC. Although the Securities Act establishes a full disclosure regulatory  requirement applicable to the initial offering of securities, it does not  require any periodic reporting thereafter. The Exchange Act, designed to  facilitate subsequent trading of securities by investors, requires public  companies to comply with certain periodic reporting requirements to  ensure an ongoing flow of meaningful information that investors can use in  making investment decisions. To fulfill its mission, SEC also reviews  certain offering documents and periodic filings of selected companies to  determine whether they contain the required information.", "The self-regulatory structure is premised on the concept of corporate  governance. Officers and directors of a public company are responsible for  ensuring that the preparation and content of financial statements fully and  accurately depict the company\u2019s financial condition and the results of its  activities. However, the board of directors\u2014particularly the audit  committee\u2014and the public company\u2019s internal auditor play important roles  in oversight. The primary role of the corporate board of directors is to  oversee the management of a company and to protect the interests of its  shareholders. Internal auditors offer another internal check on the  operations and control systems within a company. Independent external  auditors are to provide an additional safeguard in connection with all  public companies and many other entities.", "All public companies registered with SEC are required to have their  financial statements audited by an independent public accountant.  Although a public company\u2019s management is responsible for the  preparation and content of the public company\u2019s financial statements, the  independent external auditor is responsible for auditing the financial  statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards  (GAAS). The purpose of the audit is to provide reasonable assurance that a  company\u2019s financial statements are fairly presented in all material respects  in accordance with GAAP. As we testified before the Senate Committee on  Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs on March 5, 2002, for over 70 years,  the public accounting profession, through its independent audit function,  has played a critical role in enhancing a financial reporting process that  facilitates the effective functioning of our capital markets. Independent  audits give the public confidence that issuers\u2019 financial statements are  reliable and contribute to an efficient market for public companies\u2019  securities. This sense of confidence can exist only if reasonable investors  perceive auditors as independent and expert professionals who have  neither interests in the entities they are auditing nor other conflicts of  interest. Investors and other users expect auditors to bring integrity,  independence, objectivity, and professional competence to the financial  reporting process, and to prevent the issuance of misleading financial  statements.", "SEC has traditionally relied on the private sector to set standards for  financial reporting and independent audits, retaining largely oversight  responsibilities. As mentioned earlier, the Securities Act and the Exchange  Act require companies that sell securities in the United States to register  with SEC and make periodic filings disclosing the companies\u2019 financial  status and changes in condition. Although the registration process requires  the accuracy of the facts represented in the registration statements and  prospectuses, this registration process does not guarantee accuracy. As  part of its oversight of the registration and filing process, SEC staff review  selected issuers\u2019 filings for compliance with accounting and disclosure  requirements. Disclosure documents include   registration statements for new offers of securities,   proxy materials sent to shareholders before an annual meeting,   annual reports to shareholders,   quarterly statements of financial condition,  current reports on significant occurrences,   documents concerning tender offers, and   filings related to mergers and acquisitions.", "SEC\u2019s review of corporate filings may be a full review, a full financial  review, or monitoring of certain filings for specific disclosure items. SEC\u2019s  Division of Corporation Finance (CorpFin) is responsible for this function  and reviews filings on a selective basis. CorpFin performs full reviews of  financial information, public disclosures, and related filings, as  appropriate, for substantially all registrations of initial public offerings  (IPO) of securities. As reported in our March 2002 report on SEC\u2019s  operations, during the 1990s, the number of IPOs grew substantially, which  contributed to a 59 percent increase in corporate filings from 1991 to  2000. Full reviews are also required for all current reports of a change in a  registrant\u2019s certifying accountant. Experienced staff select or \u201cscreen\u201d  other filings for review on the basis of certain financial and qualitative  screening criteria. SEC\u2019s goal in 2001 was to perform a full financial  review\u2014a review of the companies\u2019 financial statements, related footnotes,  and management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and  results of operations\u2014of about one-third of all public companies\u2019 annual  reports. Earlier this year, we reported that SEC reviewed half that amount  in 2001. Finally, using screening criteria, experienced staff may select other  filings for monitoring, which involves reviewing a specific portion of the  filing.", "The stock exchanges and markets, which are self-regulatory organizations  (SRO) whose registrations are approved by SEC under the Exchange Act,  also have an oversight role. A stock exchange or market establishes listing  standards, which are minimum quantitative and qualitative requirements  that companies must meet for their stock to be eligible for initial and  continued listing for trading. Listing standards prescribe the corporate  governance structures and accounting and auditing regulations that  companies listed on a stock exchange or market are expected to follow.  For example, listing requirements generally address conflicts of interest by  corporate insiders, the composition of audit committees, and shareholder  approval of corporate actions. The large exchanges also require their listed  companies to have boards of directors with an independent audit  committee to, among other duties, oversee the company\u2019s internal controls  over financial reporting processes.", "Securities analysts, through their research and stock recommendations,  play an important role in providing investors with information that may  affect investment decisions.  Analysts typically research the current and  prospective financial condition of certain publicly traded companies and  make recommendations about investing in those companies\u2019 securities  based on their research. This research is likely to include all publicly  available information about the company and its businesses, including  financial statements; research on the company, industry, product or sector;  and public statements by and interviews with executives of the company  and its customers and suppliers. The analysis and opinions are generally  presented on a relative basis and compare companies\u2019 performance within  a sector or industry.", "Credit ratings produced by rating agencies are widely circulated; many  investors rely on these ratings to make investment decisions. These ratings  include opinions about the creditworthiness of certain public companies  and their financial obligations, including bonds, preferred stock, and  commercial paper. The credit ratings that result from analyses of this  information can affect securities markets in a number of important ways,  including an issuer\u2019s access to and cost of capital, the structure of financial  transactions, and the ability of certain entities to invest in certain rated  obligations. According to SEC, the importance of credit ratings in securities  markets has increased significantly as markets have become more  complex. Although rating agencies, as a matter of policy, may rate the debt  of certain large corporate issuers, any company can hire a rating agency to  rate its debt before the debt is issued. Credit rating agencies rely on a  variety of public and nonpublic information, including company  presentations, audited and interim financial statements, and other relevant  industry materials. Pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as  amended, (Advisers Act), Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating  Organizations (NRSRO) register as investment advisers, are required to  have an adequate basis for their ratings, and are prohibited from having  undisclosed conflicts with respect to the ratings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Number of Restatements Has Grown Significantly and Trends Emerge", "paragraphs": ["Although on a yearly basis the number of companies restating their  financial statements due to accounting irregularities makes up only a small  percentage of publicly listed companies, we found that the number of  restatements has grown significantly since 1997.

Generally, for the past 2 years, the number of large and small companies  restating has been equal. Likewise, the average (median) market  capitalization of a restating company has grown from about $500 million  ($143 million) in 1997 to $2 billion ($351 million) in 2002. While the  average size of listed companies increased about 60 percent from 1997 to  2002, the average size of companies restating their financials grew over 300  percent.

Moreover, as the average  size of U.S. companies fell during the period from 1999 to 2002, the average  size of restating companies continued to increase.", "Another indication that the size of companies restating has increased is the  growing number of NYSE-listed companies identified as restating. This  result is attributable to the fact that more large companies are listed on  NYSE than the other stock markets. Nasdaq has on average 62 percent  more companies listed on its market than NYSE. Historically more Nasdaq- listed companies restated due to accounting irregularities than NYSE-listed  companies. For example, in 1997, 21 NYSE-listed companies had  announced restatements; by 2001, the number had increased to 80, an  almost fourfold increase. During the same time, the number of Nasdaq- listed companies announcing restatements almost doubled from 61 to 113.  Also during the same time, the number of Amex-listed companies restating  increased from two to eight. However, during the first half of 2002, the 125  restatements attributable to companies listed on NYSE and Nasdaq were  almost evenly split at 53 and 54, respectively, even though more companies  are listed on Nasdaq.

For example, some of the companies  identified as restating because of revenue recognition had prematurely  recognized revenue. Cost or expense-related issues were the next most  frequently identified reason, accounting for almost 16 percent of all the  restatements we identified. (See table 2 for a description of each reason.)   These types of restatements include instances of improper cost  recognition, tax issues, and other cost-related improprieties that led to  financial misstatements. For example, the recent WorldCom  announcement that it had incorrectly recorded certain operating expenses  as capital expenditures, effectively overstating net income, was considered  a cost or expense-related restatement.", "Although most of the other categories account for only a small percent of  total restatements, we found that securities-related restatements, which  made up about 6 percent of the total, increased significantly during the first  half of 2002.

For example, although AOL  Time Warner (AOL) lost market capitalization in the immediate days  surrounding its 1997 restatement announcement, we estimated the  intermediate impact on AOL to be a $24.3 billion gain due primarily to news  of the potential acquisition of CompuServe. The intermediate impact  analysis does not control for these types of market factors, and as a result,  any event that occurs during this time period is attributed to the  restatement announcement. In 1997, the AOL market capitalization  increase was large enough to produce an overall positive change in our  estimate of the intermediate impact on market capitalization for 1997,  although the average holding period abnormal return was negative.

Of the 70  remaining cases, we were able to obtain information on 60 of these, each  involving a different company. In 25 of the cases, the company filed for  bankruptcy protection within a reasonably short period of time following  the restatement announcement. In 17 of the cases, the company continued  as an independent concern; and in all but 4 of these cases, the company  was delisted from NYSE, Nasadq, or Amex for failure to meet minimum  listing standards. In the remaining 18 cases, the company either was  acquired by or merged with another company.", "We analyzed the market capitalization impact of a restatement on the 25  companies that filed for bankruptcy and the 17 companies that continued  as independent concerns (42 companies in all). On average, the market  capitalization of these companies dropped by over 80 percent in the  months surrounding the restatement announcement. We calculated the  market capitalization of these firms to be approximately $37.4 billion 60  trading days prior to the restatement announcement and $9.3 billion 1  trading day prior to the restatement announcement. Trading was  suspended within 60 trading days following the restatement announcement  for the stocks of companies in all but 4 of these cases, and we estimated  that the market capitalization of these companies was $1.4 billion when  their stocks were suspended. Of the firms that continued as independent  concerns, their market capitalization was approximately $0.2 billion  roughly 3 months after the restatement announcement. Thus, an additional  $37 billion may have been lost following the restatement announcement for  these 42 companies. Enron was one of the companies that was included in  this analysis. By our estimates, Enron accounted for over 80 percent of the  losses.", "We also conducted a separate intermediate impact analysis on the  additional 230 announcements that were excluded from our primary  analysis due to missing TAQ data.

We estimated that the market capitalization of these 134 companies  dropped over 10 percent, on average, from 60 trading days before, through  60 trading days after the announcement. However, we calculated that the  market capitalization of these firms increased by $2.3 billion during this 6- month time frame.

The results suggest that individual investor  confidence was at 79 percent in January 2002 and declined to 69 percent by  June 2002.

This implies a divergence in opinion between individual and institutional  investors but it is unclear what this difference means for overall confidence  in the stock market and how confidence has been impacted by financial  statement restatements.

For example, results suggest that individual investors\u2019 belief that  there will be no stock market crash in the next 6 months has gradually  declined since 1989. However, this index finds that during this same period,  results revealed no such trend for institutional investors, with the  exception of a large drop after September 11.

The remaining 25 percent involved actions brought against  accounting firms and CPAs. SEC officials said that enforcement actions for  cases of accounting-related violations are usually brought against the most  senior responsible corporate officials. They said that they prefer to charge  those who had first-hand knowledge of an accounting-related violation. In  addition, if an individual knows about an accounting-related violation and  does not take corrective action, that person\u2019s failure to act may, under  some circumstances, be enough to impute liability. Officials also said they  usually charge recordkeeping violations directly against the violating  public company because the company is responsible for keeping records.  SEC may also charge the company with an accounting-related violation  when the evidence against a number of individuals is sufficient to presume  the behavior is corporate policy at the company. According to one SEC  official, historically, SEC has been reluctant to seek civil monetary  penalties against companies in financial fraud cases because their costs  would be passed along to shareholders who had already suffered as a result  of the violations.", "Congress, market participants, and others have questioned the lack of  severity of many of the sanctions given the level of investor harm.  According to one SEC official, because monetary penalties are often paid  by officer and director insurance policies or are considered insignificant in  relation to the violation, Enforcement should pursue more officer and  director bars. However, this official acknowledges that SEC sought more  officer and director bars in fiscal year 2001 than in the previous year and  the test for imposing officer and director bars is restrictive. We found that  of the 150 AAERs we reviewed, SEC charged over 30 chief financial officers  (CFO) and over 30 CEOs with accounting-related violations. SEC imposed  23 injunctions; civil monetary penalties totaling over $1.2 million (ranging  from $10,000 to $162,000) against 19 individuals; over $2.5 million in  disgorgement (ranging from almost $18,000 to over $772, 000) against 10  individuals; 6 cease and desist orders; and 9 officer and director bars. See  appendixes V through XX for a summary of the actions taken by SEC in the  16 cases we analyzed.", "Enforcement may also bring an enforcement action against other  individuals such as officers and principals who are not part of top  management (other participants and responsible parties). In the AAERs we  reviewed, SEC charged such individuals with accounting-related  violations that resulted in 31 injunctions, over $1.8 million in civil monetary  penalties (ranging from over $8,000 to $350,000) against 29 individuals;  over $1 million in disgorgement (ranging from $10,000 to over $521,000)  against 13 individuals; 21 cease and desist orders; and 9 officer and director  bars. For example, SEC and in some cases the Department of Justice have  filed suit against several former senior officers at public companies,  including Waste Management Inc. (Waste Management), Rite Aid  Corporation (Rite Aid), Critical Path, and Adelphia. These former  executives have been charged with securities law violations such as fraud,  fraudulent reporting, record-keeping violations, and insider trading.  Further, they have been accused of forging contracts, purchase orders, and  other documents, lying to auditors, and entering into undisclosed  agreements to falsely boost a company\u2019s revenue.", "Enforcement may also bring actions against accounting firms when the  facts indicate that the controlling principals of an accounting firm  committed an accounting or other violation. If the accounting firm is one of  the U.S. \u201cBig Five,\u201d the accounting issues must rise to the \u201cnational level\u201d  before SEC will take action against the entire firm. SEC officials  characterized a national-level issue as one in which one or more principals  at the national office of the firm are culpable in connection with the  wrongful conduct, regardless of whether they are on the engagement team.  Enforcement also investigates improper professional conduct by  accountants and other professionals who appear before SEC, and the  agency may pursue administrative disciplinary proceedings against these  professionals under SEC\u2019s Rules of Practice 102(e). If SEC finds that  securities laws have been violated or improper professional conduct has  occurred, it can prohibit professionals from appearing before SEC  temporarily or permanently. Enforcement officials told us that SEC  typically pursues cases in which a licensed accountant or auditor violates  the securities laws or demonstrates improper professional conduct under  Rule 102(e). A licensed accountant engages in improper professional  conduct if he or she intentionally or knowingly violates an applicable  professional standard or engages in either of the two types of negligent  conduct defined under the rule. As table 6 shows, from January 2001  through February 2002, SEC has taken action against 39 CPAs, 1  accountant, and 9 accounting firms. In addition, SEC has imposed 14  injunctions, over $7.7 million in civil monetary penalties (ranging from  $30,000 to $7 million) against 8 individuals and firms; over $83,000 in  disgorgements (ranging from over $16,000 to almost $42,000) against 2  individuals and 1 firm; and issued 33 cease and desist orders.", "SEC may also charge outside auditors with fraud in certain cases. For  example:  If an outside auditor finds an accounting violation or misrepresentation  while conducting an audit but does not take action to correct the matter,  the auditor has failed to comply with GAAS, and issues a materially  misleading report.", "If a fraud occurred that an outside auditor found out about and the  auditor failed to take appropriate action, the auditor has failed to  comply with GAAS and Section 10A of the Exchange Act, thus  contributing to a material misstatement (a GAAP violation).", "If there is evidence to prove that an outside auditor also functioned as  an adviser with regard to financial reporting that violates SEC reporting  requirements, the auditor has violated GAAS independence rules.", "SEC has brought a number of recent actions against accounting firms for  accounting-related violations. For example, in 2001, SEC obtained the first  antifraud injunction in more than 20 years against one of the \u201cBig Five\u201d  accounting firms. While neither admitting nor denying the charges, Arthur  Andersen agreed to pay $7 million to settle charges that it allegedly  \u201cknowingly or recklessly issued materially false and misleading audit  reports on Waste Management\u2019s financial statements.\u201d SEC found that the  Waste Management financial statements that Arthur Andersen audited from  1992 to 1996 had overstated pretax income by more than $1 billion. In  another case, SEC brought a fraud action against an Arthur Andersen  partner for authorizing unqualified audit opinions on Sunbeam  Corporation\u2019s 1996 and 1997 financial statements. In January 2002, SEC  censured KPMG LLP for engaging in improper conduct because it served as  an independent accounting firm for an audit client while making  substantial investments in the company. Most recently, while neither  admitting or denying the charges, in July 2002 PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP settled SEC charges that it violated auditor independence rules.

A basic limitation of the model is that  financial statements present the business entity\u2019s financial position and  results of its operations largely on the basis of historical costs, which do  not fully meet the broad range of user needs for financial information.  Enron\u2019s failure and the inquiries that have followed again have raised many  questions about the adequacy of the current financial reporting model,  such as the need for additional transparency, clarity, more timely  information, and risk-oriented financial reporting.", "In addition, as we reported earlier this year, boards of directors and their  audit committees are a critical link to fair and reliable financial reporting.  However, recent actions or inaction by boards of directors (especially audit  committees) of several public companies have raised questions about how  well this system of oversight functions. For example, the Report of  Investigation by the Special Investigation Committee of the Enron Board  of Directors (known as the Powers Report) identified several failures of the  board in overseeing Enron\u2019s relationships with several special purpose  entities.  The report found that while Enron\u2019s board put certain controls in  place, many of the controls were not adequate nor were they properly  implemented. Moreover, the report also found that while the board did not  receive certain information, it also failed to appreciate important  information that was brought to its attention. Finally, the report found that  the audit committee had a responsibility to review related-party  transactions but performed only a cursory review. More generally,  Congress, experts, and others have raised questions about the  independence of corporate boards and the effectiveness of the independent  director function in protecting shareholders."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Allegations of Accounting Fraud Raise Questions about the Quality of Audits", "paragraphs": ["Auditors are responsible for planning and performing audits to obtain  reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that financial statements are free  from direct and material misstatement, whether caused by error or fraud.

Likewise, some  critics of the accounting profession\u2019s peer review system, which was  established to monitor member public accounting firms for compliance  with standards, viewed the system as largely ineffective (fig. 11). Although  SEC has the statutory authority to establish accounting standards and  issues interpretative guidance and staff accounting bulletins on accounting  and auditing matters, SEC has delegated much of its responsibility for  setting standards for financial reporting and independent audits to the  private sector. It has accepted accounting standards (GAAP) established by  FASB as the primary standards for preparation of financial statements.  Similarly, SEC has accepted the auditing standards, GAAS, promulgated by  the Auditing Standards Board (ASB) as the standards for independent  audits.", "As stated over the years by many who have studied the accounting  profession, no major aspect of the independent auditor\u2019s role has caused  more difficulty than the auditor\u2019s responsibility for detecting fraud. As we  testified earlier this year, in August 2000, the Panel on Audit Effectiveness  concluded that the auditing profession needed to address vigorously the  issue of fraudulent financial reporting, including fraud in the form of  improper earnings management. The report expressed concern that  auditors may not be requiring enough evidence\u2014that is, they have reduced  the scope of their audits and the level of testing below what is needed to  reasonably ensure the reliability of the financial information upon which  they report. Some academics have questioned the profession\u2019s movement  toward audits that focus on business processes and the information  systems used to generate financial information. Likewise, others question  the AICPA\u2019s proposed audit processes, which make many of the audit steps  aimed at detecting a material misstatement caused by fraud optional  instead of mandatory.", "The increase in financial statement restatements involving accounting  irregularities has caused questions about the independence and quality of  audits being conducted by the independent auditors to resurface. As we  testified, the current fragmented corporate governance and oversight  structure and lack of a strong self-disciplinary mechanism as a contributing  factor. Likewise, since the mid-1970s, many observers of the auditing  profession have expressed concerns about expanding the scope of  professional services provided by the public accounting profession. One  common concern is that auditors\u2019 fees for consulting services, which are a  substantial part of the total fees, can create actual or perceived conflicts  that threaten auditors\u2019 independence. The independence of public  accountants\u2014both in fact and in appearance\u2014is crucial to the credibility of financial reporting and, in turn, the capital formation process. While  this issue has been studied and debated for years, the Enron failure has  brought the issue to the forefront once again because of the close  relationship between Arthur Andersen and Enron. As mentioned  previously, two recent cases, although not related to restatements,  addressed this growing concern. First, SEC censured KPMG LLP in January  2002 for engaging in improper professional conduct because it served as an  independent accounting firm for an audit client while making substantial  investments in money market portfolios operated by the client.

Listing standards address several quantitative requirements such as  operating history, income, and share price. They also include specific  guidelines on corporate governance. Although public companies that fail to  meet listing standards can be delisted, not all companies that fail to comply  with the guidelines are delisted. For example, we reported in our 2001  report on Amex listing standards, in the first 8 months of 2000, one-third of  Amex\u2019s new listings did not meet the exchange\u2019s listing standards.", "Recent questions about the quality of financial disclosure have resulted in  criticism of the role played by credit rating agencies and securities analysts  in promoting investment in many now-bankrupt companies or failing to  downgrade ratings before problems occurred, such as at Enron and  WorldCom. Credit rating agencies have been criticized as reactive and  unable to identify potential problems. Likewise, one of the primary flaws  cited in the existing analyst structure is the potential for conflicts of  interest. For example, providing investment-banking services, such as  underwriting an IPO or advising on a merger or acquisition, can be a  lucrative source of revenue for an analyst\u2019s firm. As a result, analysts may  face pressure not to say or write things that could jeopardize existing or  potential client relationships for their investment banking colleagues.", "Moreover, brokerage firms\u2019 compensation arrangements can put pressure  on analysts to issue positive research reports and recommendations. Many  analysts are paid at least partly and indirectly on the basis of their firms\u2019  underwriting profits. Therefore, they may be reluctant to make  recommendations that could reduce such profits and, hence, their own  compensation. Recently securities analysts have been investigated for  recommending stocks of companies to help investment-banking colleagues  win lucrative underwriting contracts, even though e-mail messages from  analysts indicated that privately the analysts did not support their public  ratings. Most notably, the New York State Attorney General investigated  Merrill Lynch & Company, Inc.\u2019s research practices, which resulted in the  firm paying a $100 million fine in May 2002. In addition, other regulators  and prosecutors launched inquiries into analyst research.

NASD alleged that the two worked closely  with Winstar\u2019s management and consulted management prior to issuing  research reports that reportedly reflected their independent judgment and  analysis.

The  plan includes limiting reviews to specific disclosure issues or areas of  material importance and assigning reviews to experienced staff.

As we  reported earlier this year, SEC faces challenges in effectively carrying out  its regulatory activities because of existing workload and staffing  imbalances. In particular, we found that SEC\u2019s ability to review corporate  filings has been strained, resulting in fewer corporate filings being  reviewed each year. Likewise, we found that the number of enforcement  actions pending at the end of the year had increased substantially. SEC  officials noted that these circumstances were also due to the increasing  complexity of accounting and disclosure, which require more time to  review filings and investigate matters. In addition to increasing workloads,  CorpFin and Enforcement have had to manage high turnover rates and  large numbers of staff vacancies. SEC\u2019s current experience with hiring  additional staff (authorized by its supplemental appropriation for its fiscal  year 2002) illustrates that SEC is likely to face ongoing challenges in filling  many of these positions, especially accountants. The supplemental  appropriation gives SEC the authority to hire 100 additional staff, which  according to SEC, would be best filled by primarily hiring accountants. SEC  officials stated that while they are committed to hiring a significant number  of accountants with the supplemental appropriation, the personnel process  required for hiring accountants is more time consuming and cumbersome  than the process for hiring attorneys. They added that this might result in  SEC hiring more attorneys to fill the currently available positions.", "In addition to challenges in recruiting and hiring staff, SEC faces ongoing  human capital management challenges, as discussed in our September 2001  report\u2014which found that although compensation was the primary reason  staff left or would consider leaving SEC, SEC has other human capital  challenges to address. SEC now has pay parity, the ability to pay  employees on par with other federal banking agencies. When funded and  fully implemented pay parity should help SEC attract and retain staff, but  higher compensation alone cannot solve SEC\u2019s retention challenges in the  future. Because SEC\u2019s employees can always opt for higher private-sector  pay, SEC\u2019s efforts to enhance its human capital programs as a means to  recruit and retain employees will become more important. For example,  our 2001 survey of current and former SEC accountants, attorneys, and  examiners provided useful information that SEC management can use to  identify key opportunities to improve employee job satisfaction, including  advancement opportunities, the appraisal process, the performance  incentive system, and the work review process.", "SEC also faces future challenges in the technology. As we identified in our  SEC resources report, budgetary limitations have historically confined  SEC\u2019s technology budget to fund hardware and software maintenance and  technology infrastructure needs. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act authorized a  budget increase that would begin to allow SEC to fund some of its existing  unfunded technology needs, such as purchasing technology that would  enhance the ability of reviewers to detect trends in corporate filings and  better leverage SEC\u2019s limited staff. However, to effectively enhance SEC\u2019s  technological base, SEC will need to develop a process to prioritize  technology needs and explore ways to more fully utilize available  technology that will allow it to leverage existing staff resources. According  to SEC officials, this is an area that SEC had not fully explored due to  resource constraints but holds promise for strengthening the agency\u2019s  regulatory efforts in the future. Moreover, additional funding in this area  may enable SEC to reinvigorate certain regulatory efforts, including  enforcement and corporate filing reviews, by making greater and more  effective use of technology.", "Going forward, SEC also faces a number of process-oriented challenges as  it attempts to rebalance its existing responsibilities, which include  reviewing filings and enforcing securities laws, with its new responsibilities  under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. An effective strategic planning process is  particularly important to help SEC stay abreast of ongoing and future  challenges. As we reported in March 2002, SEC had not engaged in a  comprehensive strategic planning process that would enable it to  proactively manage its dynamic regulatory responsibilities. However,  since that time, SEC has taken the first step in developing a comprehensive  process by engaging a consulting firm to help it review existing operations.  Once this review is complete, SEC will be in a position to develop a  dynamic comprehensive strategic planning process that better addresses  its mission goals and staffing needs.", "Finally, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act increases the demands placed on SEC to  effectively manage its human capital resources and put processes in place  that will allow it to effectively carry out its new duties and responsibilities  that are important to restoring and maintaining shareholder confidence in  U.S. markets.

We excluded these financial statement restatements because  they did not necessarily reveal previously undisclosed, economically  meaningful data to market participants.", "Once a relevant restatement was identified, we classified it into 1 or more  of 13 categories based on the information presented in the initial  restatement announcement and collected other relevant information. For  purposes of analysis, we further collapsed these 13 categories into 9  categories\u2014(1) acquisition and merger related; (2) cost or expense related;  (3) in-process research and development related; (4) reclassification; (5) related-party transactions; (6) restructuring, assets, or inventory; (7) revenue recognition; (8) securities related; and (9) other. Our  classification closely resembles that employed by FEI and Wu (2001) and  HCG (2002). Finally, to determine characteristics of the companies  restating their financial reports, we collected information on market  capitalization values, total assets, and Standard Industrial Classification  codes for the restating companies we identified."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Determining the Impact of Financial Statement Restatements on Market Values of Restating Companies", "paragraphs": ["To analyze the impact of restatement announcements involving accounting  irregularities on the stock market value of restating companies, we used  the standard event study approach. The event to be measured was the  initial announcement from January 1, 1997, to March 26, 2002, of a financial  statement restatement involving accounting irregularities by a publicly  traded company with common stock issued on the New York Stock  Exchange (NYSE), National Association of Securities Dealers Automated  Quotation (Nasdaq) National Market System or SmallCap venue, American  Stock Exchange (Amex), or the over-the-counter (OTC) bulletin board or  Pink Sheets. Throughout, we refer to the subset of companies with stock  traded on NYSE, Nasdaq, and Amex as \u201clisted.\u201d We obtained historical  stock price data for the relevant listed companies from NYSE\u2019s Trade and  Quote (TAQ) database. This database contains detailed records of all quotes and transactions made for all NYSE, Nasdaq NMS and SmallCap,  and Amex issues.", "Although we identified 919 restatement announcements from January 1,  1997, to June 30, 2002, we excluded some restatements from our analysis  for a number of reasons. First, we excluded restatements by companies  with stock traded on the OTC bulletin board or Pink Sheets because we did  not have access to reliable historical price data for these stocks. We  estimated that the exclusion of these unlisted companies would have a  negligible impact on our market capitalization results, as companies with  stock traded on the OTC bulletin board and Pink Sheets tend to be smaller  in terms of market capitalization, but it is not clear whether their exclusion  will introduce positive or negative bias in our average holding period  abnormal returns results. Secondly, we excluded initial restatement  announcements after March 26, 2002, the last trading day covered by our  TAQ data subscription that allowed us to perform the necessary  calculations for our analysis. Finally, we excluded from our analysis any  restatement by a company that had extensive portions of data missing  during the relevant time period around the restatement announcement.  Missing data were generally attributable to extended trading suspensions,  stock delistings, bankruptcies, and mergers. However, TAQ was also  missing data for several listed companies; thus, we excluded these  companies from our analysis. We cannot estimate the impact that these  exclusions would have on our reported results. To the extent a company\u2019s  stock price declined following delisting, our analysis would be biased  toward understating the impact of financial statement restatement  announcements. To address these issues, we performed separate analyses  on subsets of these cases using alternative stock price data.", "To determine the impact of the restatement announcement on a company\u2019s  stock price, we identified the trading day that corresponded with the initial  announcement date. Although many companies announced their  restatements during or before normal trading hours on a trading day, others  publicly announced their financial statement restatement after the close of  trading or on a nontrading day. In these cases, we defined the  announcement day as the next trading day. We then identified the relevant  trading days before and after the restatement announcement, collectively  known as the event window. To analyze the immediate impact of financial  statement restatement announcements, we specified the immediate event  window as the period from the trading day before the announcement  through the trading day after the announcement. To analyze the longer-term  impact of restatement announcements, we also specified an intermediate  event window of approximately 6 calendar months, which included 60  trading days (3 months) before the announcement through 60 trading days  (3 months) after the announcement. ) in which Ait is the abnormal return of the stock of company i on date t, Rit is  the realized return of the stock of company i on date t, and E(Rit|X) is the  expected return of the stock of company i on date t conditioned on some  information set, X. We used the rate of return of the Wilshire Total Market  Index on date t as our conditioning information, X.", "To calculate the abnormal return, we first specified a statistical model for  estimating the expected return of the stock of company i on date t. We used  a standard market model, which relates the rate of return of the stock of i  to the return of the overall market as in which \u03b5 it is an error term and \u03b1  and \u03b2 are the parameters of the market  model. In this specification, \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the intercept and slope,  respectively, of the linear relationship between the return of the stock of  company i on date t and the return of the market on date t. The parameter,  \u03b2 , is a measure of the covariation between the returns of the stock of i and  the returns of the market. In this way, the expected return is risk-adjusted,  taking into account the risk of stock i relative to the overall market. Next,  we estimated the parameters of the model using a subset of the data. This  subset, referred to as the \u201cestimation window,\u201d included approximately 120  trading days (typically about 6 calendar months) of daily closing price data  through the day prior to the initial restatement announcement. We  estimated the market model using the ordinary least squares estimation  procedure for each of the companies for which we had sufficient data. ) ) ) ) )", "To measure the impact of the restatement announcement on the stock of  company i, we calculated the abnormal return over the holding period from  day \u20131 to day +1 to capture the immediate impact, and we calculated the  abnormal return over the holding period from day \u201360 to day +60 to capture  the intermediate impact. We also calculated the immediate impact on the  market capitalization of company i by multiplying the difference between  the actual stock price on day +1 and the expected price on day +1 (the  immediate market-adjusted change in price) by the number of shares  outstanding, and we calculated the intermediate impact on the market  capitalization of company i by multiplying the difference between the  actual stock price on day +60 and the expected price on day +60 (the  intermediate market-adjusted change in price) by the number of shares  outstanding. To assess the overall impact of the general event of a  restatement announcement, we averaged individual holding period  abnormal returns over all restatement announcement events in our sample  for both the immediate and intermediate time frames, and we summed all of the unadjusted and adjusted market changes in price for both the  immediate and intermediate time frames.", "For the companies that dropped out of our sample from the immediate to  the intermediate event window due to trading suspensions, delistings,  bankruptcies, and mergers, among other reasons, we attempted to capture  the longer-term impact of their financial restatement announcements in a  separate analysis using unadjusted data. For each such company, we  identified its status approximately 3 months after its initial restatement  announcement using Lexis-Nexis and other sources\u2014whether it was a  going concern, bankrupt, or merged with or was acquired by another  company. If a company were a going concern, we estimated its market  capitalization using publicly available data from Nasdaq or Pink Sheets and  SEC, and estimated the change in market value from 60 trading days before  the restatement announcement. If a company went bankrupt, we estimated  the loss in market capitalization by assuming a total loss. We did not  attempt to estimate the impact for a company that merged with or was  acquired by another company.", "The usual interpretation of abnormal returns over an event window is that  they measure the impact of the event on the value of a company\u2019s stock.  This interpretation may be misleading due to other firm-specific or market  factors. Our simple market model attempted to account for only the overall  market\u2019s effect on the stock. One of the more relevant factors in this event  study was the simultaneous release of the restatement announcement and  scheduled financial statements to the market. For example, a company may  have issued its first quarter 2000 earnings that could have missed, met, or  exceeded the market\u2019s expectations while also announcing that it was  restating previously issued financial statements from 1998 and 1999. To the  extent that this was an issue, our results could be biased in either direction  and, hence, attributing abnormal returns solely to the restatement  announcement could be misleading. Another potential factor is information  leakage. Events such as the announcement of an SEC inquiry, internal or  external accounting review, or abrupt departure of a company\u2019s chief  executive officer or chief financial officer may be an early indication that a  financial restatement is forthcoming. Furthermore, it is important to note  that as we increase the time period over which we attempt to assess the  impact of the restatement on a particular stock, there can be many other  factors influencing the behavior of the stock price. To the extent that other  influences on the price are significant, our intermediate results reflect not  only the impact of the restatement announcement but these factors as well.", "Additionally, there are potential sources of bias in our estimation  procedure. Some of the more important involve event-date uncertainty,  violations of our statistical assumptions, and using daily closing stock  prices. While our event study methodology assumes that we are able to  precisely identify the event date with certainty, this sometimes involved a  certain amount of judgment. The announcement of a financial statement  restatement typically only provides the date of the announcement; whether  the announcement was made before, during, or after trading on that date  may not be clear. Another possible source of bias stems from violation of  our standard statistical assumptions. A further potential source of bias in  our estimation involves using the daily closing prices of stocks. In the event  study framework, we implicitly assumed that these daily closing prices  were recorded at identical time intervals each day. However, this  assumption is easily violated because the last transaction for a given stock  can and generally does occur at a different time each day. Additionally,  some of the stocks in our event study were \u201cthinly\u201d or infrequently traded,  and several days could elapse between transactions. Referring to the last  recorded prices as daily closing prices assumed that closing prices are  equally spaced at 24-hour intervals, which is not the case. To the extent that  this assumption is violated, our results may be biased.", "Overall, our analysis focused on the impact of a company\u2019s restatement  announcement on its market capitalization. Therefore, we did not take into  account the effects on market participants with short positions or various  options positions, nor did we gauge the impact on the company\u2019s  bondholders. To whatever extent\u2014whether positively or negatively\u2014these  market participants were affected by financial statement restatements, our  results are necessarily incomplete."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Determining the Impact of Financial Statement Restatements on Investor Confidence", "paragraphs": ["To analyze impact of financial statement restatements on the confidence of  market participants, we relied principally on outside sources.

The survey-based  indexes of investor confidence were obtained from UBS Americas, Inc.,  and the International Center for Finance at the Yale School of Management.  The Nobel Laureate economist, Dr. Lawrence Klein, acknowledged the UBS  Index for its accuracy and timeliness. The Yale School of Management  Indexes are considered to be the longest running effort to measure investor  confidence and the project is directed by one of the leading experts in the  field, Dr. Robert Shiller. We were also able to collect survey results about  the direct impact of restatements on investor confidence from UBS  Americas. Although the literature on the impact of restatements on  investor confidence is sparse, we identified two such studies. The results of  both studies were consistent with the hypothesis that investor confidence  has been negatively impacted by financial statement restatements.  However, we were not able to quote or cite one study, as the results were  preliminary at the time of this report\u2019s issuance.

(For example, a case  discount or other similar incentive.) Instead of properly booking the  expense, Mr. Wilson, Ms. Cummings, and Mr. Chung allegedly tried to  conceal it from the auditors by directing division level officers and  employees to make false entries in various accounts on the company\u2019s  books. The effect was to falsely and substantially inflate the Aurora\u2019s  financial results. The complaint states that the result was to materially  understate expenses and liabilities on the company\u2019s publicly filed financial  statements. The object of the scheme was to conceal from the investing  public the fact that the company had not met its earnings targets from  quarter to quarter.", "The scheme allegedly involved several other employees, including Dirk  Grizzle, vice-president of finance and principal financial officer of Aurora\u2019s  Foods division (AFI) until June 2000. The complaint described the  following events. Sometime in March 1999, Mr. Grizzle and Ms. Cummings  discussed putting known trade promotion expenses in accounts receivable,  rather than simply recording them on Aurora\u2019s books. The effect would be  to conceal these expenses from the auditors. Thereafter, on a regular basis,  Ms. Cummings and/or Mr. Chung instructed Mr. Grizzle to move large  portions of the expense to accounts receivable. Mr. Grizzle carried out  these instructions by directing Tammy Fancelli, a senior financial analyst at  AFI until September 2000, and James Elliott, the manager of customer  financial services at AFI until September 2000, to make false entries in the  accounts receivable ledgers and subsidiary ledgers. Beginning in about  April 1999, Mr. Grizzle also prepared, at least quarterly, two versions of  AFI\u2019s trade promotions reserve analysis, one for the company\u2019s internal  use, which showed an ever-growing trade underaccrual, consisting  primarily of items of actual, known expense, and the others to be provided  to the auditors, which falsely showed an overaccrued position.", "The complaint also alleges that at another of the company\u2019s divisions,  Timothy B. Andersen, the vice-president of finance and principal financial  officer at Aurora\u2019s Van de Kamp\u2019s division (VDK) until June 2000, carried  out Ms. Cummings\u2019s and Mr. Chung\u2019s instructions to reduce expenses on  the books to enable Aurora to hit \u201cmust make\u201d numbers on a quarterly or  more frequent basis. In almost every instance, in order to hit these earnings  targets, Mr. Andersen reduced trade promotion expense and the  accompanying trade promotion accrual, even though he knew that the  division had already recorded insufficient trade expense and had under- accrued the trade promotion reserve.", "According to the SEC complaint, Mr. Andersen allegedly accomplished this  by directing VDK\u2019s director of budget and planning to reduce the trade  promotion accrual. Because the division\u2019s computers automatically posted  accruals to the reserve account as sales were posted, the automated entries  had to be adjusted manually. However, the complaint alleges that Ms.  Cummings eventually became concerned that these manual entries would  draw audit scrutiny and directed Mr. Andersen to turn off the automated  posting system. Thereafter, all accruals were posted by hand at the levels  dictated by Ms. Cummings.", "The complaint alleges that Ms. Cummings directed VDK\u2019s director of  budgeting and planning to prepare for the auditors a version of the trade  reserve analysis employing incorrect assumptions, which, had they been  disclosed, would have immediately revealed the inadequacy of the  accruals. Mr. Keith Luechtefeld, the controller at Aurora\u2019s VDK division  until June 2000, was aware of these deliberate underaccruals, and on at  least one occasion, carried out Mr. Andersen\u2019s instruction to conceal the  underaccruals by shifting $2 million from other liability accounts on VDK\u2019s  books to the trade promotion reserve. These entries had no purpose other  than to make it appear to the auditors that the accrual was adequate, when,  in fact, it was not.", "Allegedly, throughout 1999, division officers at both AFI and VDK regularly  informed Aurora CEO, Mr. Wilson, of the substantial trade accrual deficit,  but Mr. Wilson refused to take action to correct the problem and, from time  to time, noted his concurrence in actions directed by his subordinates Ms.  Cummings and Mr. Chung to conceal the underaccrual. The complaint  alleges that Mr. Wilson also made several public statements in 1999  concerning the company\u2019s financial condition, which failed to disclose the  substantial unrecorded trade marketing expense. By January 2000, Mr.  Wilson allegedly actively participated in efforts to conceal the false  accounting entries from the auditors and personally directed division  employees to lie to the auditors.", "Finally, SEC alleges that, as a result, Mr. Wilson, Mr. Chung, Ms. Cummings,  Mr.Grizzle, Ms. Fancelli, Mr. Andersen and Mr. Luechtefeld violated, or  aided and abetted violations of, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange  Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5; that all of the individual  defendants violated Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1  in connection with a financial reporting fraud involving Aurora; that Mr.  Wilson, Mr. Chung and Ms. Cummings also violated Rule 13b2-2  promulgated under the Exchange Act; that Aurora violated Sections 13(a)  and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13; and  that Mr. Wilson, Mr. Chung and Ms. Cummings, as control persons of  Aurora, are liable for Aurora\u2019s violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of  the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13.", "The Commission sought a final judgment (1) permanently enjoining each  defendant from future violations of the securities laws; (2) ordering Mr.  Wilson, Mr. Chung, Ms. Cummings and Mr. Grizzle to disgorge performance  bonuses paid to them on the basis of materially overstated earnings, plus  prejudgment interest; (3) imposing civil penalties against each defendant  (except Aurora); and (4) barring Mr. Wilson, Mr. Chung, Ms. Cummings, and  Mr. Grizzle from serving as an officer or director of a public company.", "The company has consented to a permanent injunction from further  violations of the reporting and internal control provisions of the federal  securities laws.

Specifically, SEC made the following findings. In the  final week of December 2000 Critical Path\u2019s president and vice president of  sales concluded that there was no legitimate means by which Critical Path  could achieve its revenue and earnings goals.

In addition, Critical Path planned to recognize a $7 million sale to  a firm that was formed for this transaction and was owned by a group of  shareholders who owned a substantial amount of Critical Path stock. With  revenue from these transactions, Critical Path would beat consensus  estimates for revenue but not earnings for the quarter. However, Critical  Path\u2019s finance officer disclosed the backdating of the $750,000 contract to  the new chief financial officer (CFO), who corrected the contract date and  did not allow the revenue to be recorded in the fourth quarter.", "The complaint alleges that on January 17, 2001, Critical Path\u2019s independent  accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), told the new CFO that  the company should not record as revenue the $7 million transaction with  the reseller because in PwC\u2019s view the reseller and the business objectives  of the transactions lacked substance.", "After the market closed on January 18, 2001, Critical Path announced  unaudited condensed consolidated operating results for the fourth quarter  and year 2000, \u201cprepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles,\u201d which included $52 million in revenue and a net loss of $11.5  million, excluding special charges.

Of this amount, Critical Path expected that  approximately $4.2 million involved transactions that would not result in  revenue and that the remainder might result in revenue that would be  recognized during 2001. The company further expected that costs and  operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2000 were going to increase by  $1 million to $2 million. In addition, the revisions would cause the  company\u2019s net loss for the fourth quarter of 2000, excluding special  charges, to increase in the range of $19 million to $21.5 million.", "On April 5, 2001, Critical Path filed its Form 10-K with SEC for fiscal year  2000. The final revisions were greater than originally estimated (table 11).  Revenue for the third quarter of 2000 was restated to $35.3 million (down  from $45 million). The net loss was restated to $18.6 million (up from $8.7  million), excluding special charges. Revenue for the fourth quarter was  revised to $42.3 million (down from $52.0 million announced on January 18,  2001). The total net loss was revised to $23.3 million, compared with $11.5  million previously announced.

This case was  transferred to the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut for  consolidation or coordination for pretrial purposes with the previously  described 21 consolidated actions currently pending there under the  caption, Carlson v.

The named plaintiff, Thomas  Patti, is a Xerox employee who alleges he is a participant in the Xerox  Corporation Profit Sharing and Savings Plan (Plan) who invested or  maintained investments in the Xerox stock fund during the proposed class  period, February 15, 1998 to the present. He seeks to represent a class of  individuals similarly situated, which he claims exceeds 50,000 persons. The  defendants include Xerox, the Plan (as a nominal defendant only) and the  following individuals or groups of individuals during the proposed class  period: the Plan Administrator, the Plan\u2019s administrative committee, the  board of directors, the finance committee of the board of directors, and the  treasurer. The complaint claims that all of the defendants were fiduciaries  of the Plan under ERISA and, as such, were obligated to protect the Plan\u2019s  assets and act in the best interest of Plan participants. The complaint  alleges that the defendants failed to do so and thereby breached their  fiduciary duties. The complaint sets out four separate ERISA causes of  action. Specifically, he claims that the defendants failed to provide accurate  and complete material information to participants concerning Xerox stock,  including accounting practices which allegedly artificially inflated the value  of the stock, and misled participants regarding the soundness of the stock  and the prudence of investing retirement benefits in Xerox stock. The  plaintiff also claims that the defendants failed to ensure that Plan assets  were invested prudently, to monitor the other fiduciaries and to disregard  Plan directives they knew or should have known were imprudent.", "A consolidated putative shareholder derivative action is pending in the  Supreme Court of the State of New York against several current and former  members of the board of directors, including William F.

The plaintiffs also allege that each of the  director defendants breached his/her duties of due care and diligence in the  management and administration of Xerox\u2019s affairs and grossly mismanaged  or aided and abetted the gross mismanagement of Xerox and its assets. The  complaint also asserts claims of negligence, negligent misrepresentation,  breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty against KPMG LLP.  Additionally, plaintiffs claim that KPMG LLP is liable to Xerox for  contribution, based on KPMG LLP\u2019s share of the responsibility for any  injuries or damages for which Xerox is held liable to plaintiffs in related  pending securities class-action litigation. On behalf of the company, the  plaintiffs seek a judgment declaring that the director defendants violated  and/or aided and abetted the breach of their fiduciary duties to Xerox and  its shareholders.", "On May 16, 2002, a shareholder derivative action was brought in U.S.  District Court for the District of Connecticut against KPMG LLP. The  company was named as a nominal defendant. The plaintiff purported to  bring this action derivatively in the right, and for the benefit, of Xerox. He  contended that he is excused from complying with the prerequisite to make  a demand on the Xerox board of directors, and that such demand would be  futile, because the directors are disabled from making a disinterested,  independent decision about whether to prosecute this action. In the  original complaint, plaintiff alleged that KPMG LLP, Xerox\u2019s former outside  auditor, breached its duties of loyalty and due care owed to Xerox by  repeatedly acquiescing in, permitting and aiding and abetting the  manipulation of Xerox\u2019s accounting and financial records in order to  improve the company\u2019s publicly reported financial results. He further  claimed that KPMG LLP committed malpractice and breached its duty to  use such skill, prudence and diligence as other members of the accounting  profession commonly possess and exercise. The plaintiff claimed that as a  result of KPMG LLP\u2019s breaches of duties, Xerox has suffered loss and  damage. On May 29, 2002, the plaintiff amended the complaint to add as  defendants the present and certain former directors of Xerox. He added  claims against each of them for breach of fiduciary duty, and separate  additional claims against the directors who are or were members of the  audit committee of the board of directors, based upon the alleged failure,  inter alia, to implement, supervise and maintain proper accounting  systems, controls and practices.", "On June 6, 2002, a shareholder, Stanley Lerner, commenced a derivative  action in the U. S. District Court for the District of Connecticut against  Messrs. Allaire, Buehler, Romeril, G. Thoman, and Ms. Mulcahy. The  plaintiff purports to bring the action derivatively, on behalf of Xerox, which  is named as a nominal defendant. The plaintiff alleges that the individual  defendants breached their fiduciary duties of care and loyalty by disguising  the true operating performance of Xerox through improper undisclosed  accounting mechanisms between 1997 and 2000.", "On June 22, 2000, SEC began an investigation of accounting issues related  to Xerox\u2019s Mexican business. On April 11, 2002, SEC and Xerox concluded  a settlement, as a result of which SEC filed a civil complaint alleging that  from at least 1997 through 2000, Xerox used a variety of undisclosed  accounting actions to meet or exceed Wall Street\u2019s expectations and  disguise its true operating performance from investors. The complaint  alleges that \u201cin a scheme directed and approved by its senior management,  Xerox disguised its true operating performance by using undisclosed  accounting maneuvers\u2014most of which were improper\u2014that accelerated  the recognition of equipment revenue by over $3 billion and increased  earnings by approximately $1.5 billion.\u201d  According to SEC\u2019s complaint,  Xerox engaged in a variety of accounting violations, including  Accelerating leasing revenue\u2014Xerox allegedly repeatedly changed the  way it accounted for lease revenue but failed to disclose that the  associated gains were the result of accounting changes rather than  improved operating performance. Moreover, many of the practices used  failed to comply with GAAP. For example, Xerox used a return on equity  allocation method that involved calculating the estimated fair value of  the equipment as the portion of the lease payments remaining after  subtracting the estimated fair value of the services and financing  components. As the estimated fair value of services and financing  declined, the equipment sales revenue that was recognized immediately  increased. Xerox was also accused of accelerating the recognition of  revenues by immediately recognizing as the revenue price increases and  extensions of existing lease rather than recognizing the increases over  the remaining life of the lease.", "Improper increases in residual values of leased equipment\u2014Xerox  allegedly adjusted the estimated residual value of leased equipment  (that is, its remaining value at the end of the lease term) after the  inception of the lease in violation of GAAP. SEC alleges that this write- up in the residual value of equipment was used to credit the cost of  sales, were recorded close to the end of quarterly reporting periods as \u201ca  gap-closing measure to help Xerox meet or exceed internal and external  earnings and revenue expectations.\u201d", "Acceleration of revenues from portfolio asset strategy transactions\u2014 selling investors the revenue streams from portfolios of its leases that  otherwise would not have allowed for immediate revenue recognition.  SEC alleges that Xerox used these transactions to recognize revenue  that would have otherwise been recognized in future periods and failed  to disclose this practice.", "Fraudulent manipulation of reserves and other income\u2014Xerox  allegedly increased its earnings by releasing excess reserves that were  originally established for some other purpose into income in violation of  GAAP. Xerox also allegedly systematically released a gain associated  with the successful resolution of a dispute with the Internal Revenue  Service to improperly increase earnings from 1997 through 2000.  Although GAAP required that the entire gain be recognized upon the  completion of all legal contingencies in 1995 and 1996, Xerox used most  of it to meet its earnings targets.", "Failure to disclose factoring transactions\u2014Xerox allegedly failed to  disclose factoring transactions that allowed it to report a positive year- end cash balance, instead of a negative one. This factoring involved  Xerox selling its receivables at a discount in order to realize instant cash  instead of a future stream of cash. According to SEC complaint, analysts  looked to Xerox to increase its liquidity and called for stronger end-of- year cash balances in 1999. Unable to generate cash, Xerox management  instructed its largest operating units to explore the possibility of  engaging in factoring transactions with local banks. These transactions  materially affected Xerox\u2019s 1999 operating cash flows but these  transactions were not disclosed in its 1999 financial statements. In some  of the factoring transactions involved buy-back agreements in which  Xerox would reacquire the receivables after the end of the year. By  accounting for these transactions as true sales, Xerox violated GAAP.  Not only did Xerox fail to disclose the agreements, it failed to reverse  them in the next year.", "Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Xerox  consented to a final judgment that includes a permanent injunction from  violating the antifraud, reporting and recordkeeping provisions of the  federal securities laws, specifically Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of  1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the  Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1. 13a-13, 12b-20 and 13b2-1  promulgated thereunder. In addition, Xerox agreed to restate its financials  for the years 1997 through 2000 and pay a $10 million civil penalty.
