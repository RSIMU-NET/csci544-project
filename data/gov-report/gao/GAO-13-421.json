The law mandates that agencies, with extramural R&D budgets that meet the thresholds for participation, must spend a percentage of these annual budgets on the SBIR and STTR programs. The agencies are to report on their activities to SBA and, in turn, SBA is to report to Congress. Eleven agencies participate in SBIR, and five of them also participate in STTR. The act's 2011 reauthorization mandates that GAO review SBA's and the agencies' compliance with spending and reporting requirements, and other program aspects, for fiscal years 2006 to 2011. GAO determined (1) the extent to which participating agencies complied with spending requirements and how the agencies calculated these requirements, (2) the extent to which participating agencies and SBA complied with certain reporting requirements, (3) the potential effects of basing the spending requirements on an agency's total R&D budget, and (4) the cost to participating agencies of SBIR and STTR program administration. GAO reviewed agency calculations of spending requirements and the required reports and interviewed SBA and participating agency program and financial officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Using data agencies had reported to the Small Business Administration (SBA), GAO found that 8 of the 11 agencies participating in the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program and 4 of the 5 agencies participating in the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program did not consistently comply with spending requirements for fiscal years 2006 to 2011. In calculating their annual spending requirements for these programs, some agencies made improper exclusions from their extramural research and development (R&D) budgets and used differing methodologies. SBA, which oversees the programs, provided guidance in policy directives for agencies on calculating these requirements, but the directives do not provide guidance on calculating the requirements when appropriations are late and spending is delayed, resulting in agencies using differing methodologies. This made it difficult to determine whether agencies' calculations were correct. Without further SBA guidance, agencies will likely continue calculating spending requirements in differing ways.", "The participating agencies and SBA have not consistently complied with certain program reporting requirements. For example, in their methodology reports to SBA, the agencies submitted different levels of detail on their methodologies, such as the programs excluded from the extramural budget and the reasons for the exclusions. SBA's guidance states that the methodology reports are to itemize each R&D program excluded from the calculation of the agency's extramural budget and explain why a program is excluded but does not specify the format of the methodology reports to ensure consistency. Also, SBA's annual reports to Congress contained limited analysis of the agencies' methodologies, often not including information on particular agencies. Without more guidance to agencies on the formats of their methodology reports and more analysis of the contents of those reports, SBA cannot provide Congress with information on the extent to which agencies are reporting what is required. Further, SBA has not submitted an annual report on these programs for fiscal years 2009 to 2011 but plans to submit the reports to Congress later in 2013--making the data available to Congress on the programs 2 to 4 years late.", "Potential effects of basing each participating agency's spending requirement on its total R&D budget instead of its extramural R&D budget include an increase in the amount of the spending requirement--for some agencies more than others--depending on how much of the agency's R&D budget is composed of extramural spending. Also, if the thresholds of the spending requirements for participation in the programs did not change, changing the base to an agency's total R&D budget would increase the number of agencies required to participate.", "The agencies' cost of administering the programs could not be determined because the agencies have not consistently tracked that cost as they are not required to by the authorizing legislation of the programs. Nine of the 11 agencies in SBIR provided GAO with estimates of some of these costs for fiscal year 2011--most of which were for salaries and expenses. With the start of a pilot program allowing agencies to use up to 3 percent of SBIR program funds for administrative costs in 2013, SBA plans to require agencies to track and report administrative costs paid from program funds."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends, among other things, that SBA provide additional guidance to agencies for spending and reporting requirements and provide Congress with a more timely annual report with more analysis of the agencies' methodologies.

To determine  the extent to which participating agencies have complied with the  programs\u2019 spending requirements, we compared spending requirements  for fiscal years 2006 to 2011 with the amounts agencies reported  spending in each annual report to SBA. We determined that an agency  met its spending requirement if the agency\u2019s reported spending for these  programs was equal to or greater than the reported spending  requirement. We used the agencies\u2019 obligations data to represent  spending for the programs in part because obligations data were readily  available from each of the agencies for program purposes, and  obligations provided a reasonable measure of the spending for the  programs in each year. In addition, we collected data and documents  from agencies and interviewed agency officials about how they calculated  their extramural R&D budgets, including any amounts agencies are  authorized to exclude from those budgets. To assess the reliability of the  spending data, we questioned agency officials about the source and data  quality control procedures and reviewed relevant documentation.

We  also assumed that the current spending thresholds that require agency  participation in the SBIR and STTR programs\u2014 $100 million and $1  billion in extramural funding respectively\u2014would instead apply to total  R&D funding. In other words, an agency with total annual R&D funding of  $100 million would be required to participate in the SBIR program, while  an agency with total annual R&D funding of $1 billion would be required  to participate in both the SBIR and STTR programs. We compared the  spending requirements under this first scenario with the spending  requirements under the current law to determine the potential effects of  changing the methodology to calculate the spending requirements for  fiscal years 2006 to 2011.

The SBIR  program has a three-phase structure as follows:  In Phase I, agencies award up to $150,000 for a period of about 6 to 9  months to small businesses to determine the scientific and technical  merit and feasibility of ideas that appear to have commercial potential.", "In Phase II, small businesses whose Phase I projects demonstrate  scientific and technical merit, in addition to commercial potential, may  compete for awards of up to $1 million to continue the R&D for an  additional period, normally not to exceed 2 years.", "Phase III is for small businesses to pursue commercialization  objectives resulting from the Phase I and II R&D activities, where  appropriate.

Generally, the extramural R&D  budget is defined as the sum of the total obligations for R&D minus  amounts to be obligated for intramural R&D, that is, R&D conducted by  employees of a federal agency in or through government-owned,  government-operated facilities. In determining their extramural R&D  budget, agencies have authority to exclude certain R&D programs from  the extramural R&D base used for calculating SBIR and STTR spending  requirements, such as facilities and equipment used for R&D and certain  intelligence activities. For example, under the Small Business Act, DOE  must exclude amounts obligated for its naval reactor program from its  extramural R&D budget. Likewise, under the act, DOD excludes  programs carried out by certain elements of the intelligence community.

HHS  met its overall agency spending requirement even with the improper  exclusions, according to the data in HHS\u2019 annual reports to SBA.", "In addition to identifying improper exclusions, we found that, when  appropriations were received late in the year, agencies used differing  methodologies to calculate their spending requirements, making it difficult  to determine whether agencies\u2019 calculations were correct. For example,  some agency program managers told us that, when appropriations were  received late in the year, they used their prior year actual spending to  calculate their current year spending requirement, while others calculated  their current year spending requirement using some other methodology.  Specifically, program managers at the National Institute of Standards and  Technology (NIST)\u2014a subunit of Commerce\u2014stated that program  managers at NIST used the past year\u2019s actual SBIR spending to calculate  the current year\u2019s requirement. In contrast, NASA calculated its SBIR  spending requirement by determining what percentage its extramural  R&D spending comprised of its total R&D spending in the prior year.  NASA then applied this percentage to the current year\u2019s total R&D budget  to calculate the current year\u2019s extramural budget, which it then used as  the basis for calculating the SBIR and STTR spending requirements.  Although SBA provided guidance in policy directives for participating  agencies on calculating their spending requirements, neither SBA\u2019s prior  nor its current policy directives provide guidance to agencies on how to  calculate such spending requirements when agency appropriations are  delayed.

The act requires that agencies report to SBA their  methodologies for calculating their extramural budgets within 4 months  after the date of enactment of their respective appropriations acts.  However, most participating agencies documented their methodologies  for calculating their extramural R&D budgets for these fiscal years and  submitted them to SBA after the close of the fiscal year with their annual  reports, but three agencies\u2014USDA, Education, and DOT\u2014did not  provide a methodology report for 1 fiscal year during this period. USDA  did not submit a report on its fiscal year 2007 methodology because  agency officials said it was identical to prior years. Officials from  Education and DOT said they typically submitted their methodology  reports with their annual reports. However, they told us that for fiscal year  2011 they did not submit their methodology reports to SBA on time  because that was the first year that agencies were required to submit  their annual reports to SBA\u2019s automated system and there was not a  place in SBA\u2019s system to submit methodology reports.

Education officials later told us they  submitted their 2011 methodology report to SBA in January 2013.", "SBA officials said that they have not held the agencies to the act\u2019s  deadline for submitting methodology reports, in part because continuing  resolutions enacting final appropriations have sometimes not been  passed until the middle of the fiscal year. This timing for appropriations  has pushed the required reporting date of the methodology report\u2014due 4  months after appropriations are set\u2014until late in the fiscal year. SBA  officials said this has made it more convenient for participating agencies  to submit the methodology report with the annual report. Further, SBA  officials said the agency uses the methodology reports for their annual  reports to Congress. By not having the methodology reports earlier in the  year as specified by law, however, SBA does not have an opportunity to  promptly analyze these methodologies and provide the agencies with  timely feedback to assist agencies in accurately calculating their spending  requirements. SBA officials said they have provided feedback orally and  through e-mails to the participating agencies about their methodology  reports, but many agency program managers said that SBA has provided  little feedback. By not providing such feedback, SBA is forgoing the  opportunity to assist agencies in correctly calculating their program  spending requirements and helping to ensure that they meet mandated  requirements.", "More significantly, the majority of the agencies did not include information  consistent with a provision in SBA\u2019s SBIR and STTR policy directives that  specifies the act\u2019s requirement for a methodology report from each  agency. Specifically, the SBA policy directives state that the  methodology report must include an itemization of each R&D program  excluded from the calculation of the agency\u2019s extramural budget and a  brief explanation of why it is excluded. In our review, we found that  two of the participating agencies\u2014EPA and HHS\u2014complied fully with  the requirements because they included in their methodology reports  an itemization of the programs excluded from the calculation of their  extramural R&D budget and an explanation of why the programs were  excluded for all 6 fiscal years in our review; and six agencies\u2014DHS, DOD, DOE, DOT, NASA and NSF\u2014did not fully  meet these requirements for the 6 fiscal years in our review because  their methodology reports either identified some excluded programs  but not others that we identified or the reports omitted explanations for  exclusions.", "As a result, agencies submitted different information, including different  levels of detail on their methodologies. For example, some agencies  provided itemization of each R&D program excluded, including dollar  amounts and statutory authority, as part of the calculation of the agency\u2019s  extramural budget and a brief explanation of why it is excluded, while  other agencies only provided a brief explanation. SBA officials told us that  most participating agencies\u2019 methodology reports have changed little from  year to year, so SBA does not raise questions about details of their  methodologies. In the absence of guidance from SBA on the format in  which the methodology reports are to be presented, DOD developed a  methodology template that guides the calculation of DOD\u2019s extramural  R&D budget and in turn the programs\u2019 spending requirements, including  the identification of any R&D programs excluded from the basis for  calculating their spending requirements and a brief explanation of why  they are excluded. Without guidance on the format of methodology  reports, participating agencies are likely to continue to provide SBA with  broad, incomplete, or inconsistent information about their methodologies  and spending requirements. Furthermore, without having more consistent  information from agencies, it is difficult for SBA to comprehensively  analyze the methodologies and determine whether agencies are  accurately calculating their spending requirements.", "In addition, for the agency annual report requirement, SBA has provided a  template that asks agencies for the extramural R&D budget base used to  calculate the SBIR or STTR spending requirements, but it does not ask  for the specific calculations used to derive that budget base. Unlike the  requirement set by law and SBA policy directives for methodology reports  to include a description of their methodologies for calculating extramural  R&D budgets, information on actual calculations, such as identifying  exclusions, is not required for agency annual reports to SBA. However,  because annual reports show the results of the previously described  methodology including such information in the annual reports is important.  By not requesting that agencies include calculations used to derive the  budget base in its template, SBA has been receiving incomplete  information from the participating agencies, which limits the usefulness of  data the agency reports to Congress. SBA officials told us that  participating agencies\u2019 calculations of spending requirements have  changed little from year to year, and so SBA does not raise questions  about the calculations. SBA likewise does not request that agencies  include information in their annual reports that would enable SBA to  conduct better oversight, including information on (1) whether agencies  met the mandated spending requirements, (2) the reasons for any  noncompliance with these requirements, and (3) the agencies\u2019 plans for  meeting any noncompliance in future years.

For example, in  its fiscal year 2006 annual report, SBA concluded that all of the  participating agencies complied with program requirements in calculating  their extramural R&D budgets but did not present the basis for its  conclusion.

For the  STTR program, if the funding percentage in the law were applied to the  total R&D budget instead of the extramural budget, NSF\u2019s spending on  STTR would have increased to about 2.7 percent of the extramural R&D  budget, and Commerce\u2019s spending would have increased from zero.", "In addition to the changes in the dollar amount of funds available for  STTR and SBIR spending requirements, agencies said that changing the  base for calculation of budgets for these programs would affect agency  operations, depending on assumptions about how the funding base  change is implemented. For example, changing the base would increase  SBIR and STTR budgets and could result in reductions in certain types of  intramural R&D with corresponding reductions in full-time equivalent  staffing of these programs. In addition, some agency officials said there  were potential changes in the content of the agency\u2019s extramural R&D  effort because of changes in the types of businesses that receive grants  and contracts.", "In addition to applying the same percentages as used under current law  to the total R&D budget, we analyzed the potential changes to spending  requirements using two other alternative scenarios that apply different  percentages to the total R&D budget.

Agency officials  said an important reason that administrative costs for the SBIR and STTR  programs are not comprehensively identified or tracked is that using SBIR  or STTR budgets to fund administrative costs has been generally  prohibited. The Small Business Act generally prohibits agencies, except  for DOD, from using any of their SBIR or STTR budgets to fund  administrative costs of the programs, including the cost of salaries.  Agencies reported that administrative costs of the programs were paid out  of budget accounts other than the SBIR and STTR accounts.", "In addition, agency officials told us that the SBIR and STTR programs cut  across many agency programs and disciplines and that the staff  supporting the programs may work on a full-time or part-time basis,  making identification and estimation of costs more difficult. For example,  DOE reported the administrative costs of the SBIR and STTR program  office only, but pointed out that the programs involved the part-time efforts  of 70 to 100 additional people throughout DOE, including technical  program managers, grants specialists and contracting officers, whose  costs were not estimated.", "Similarly, HHS officials said it would be an exceptionally complex  calculation to determine how much is currently spent on the  administrative costs of the SBIR or STTR program because a large  number of HHS staff work a fraction of their time on these programs.  Officials in HHS\u2019 National Institutes of Health (NIH), which accounts for  the majority of HHS\u2019 SBIR and STTR R&D programs, said there were a  small number of full-time staff on these programs; rather, NIH officials  said that most staff managing the programs do so as a collateral part of  their duties and are not required to track the portion of their time spent on  the programs. NASA reported that its budget estimate included a  separate line for SBIR and STTR program management that covers  personnel costs, travel, and procurement costs. NASA officials noted,  however, that other costs to operate the programs are not included in this  budget estimate, including the cost of NASA technical experts to review  proposals and the cost of technical and contracting representatives  interacting with small businesses.

In  its role overseeing the programs, SBA has issued policy directives that  provide agencies with guidance on the implementation of the programs.  Agencies participating in the programs are required by law to spend a  specific minimum portion of their extramural R&D budgets on these  awards and to report certain information related to their spending to SBA.  In turn, SBA is to review this information and report on it annually to  Congress. However, participating agencies\u2019 compliance with the  programs\u2019 spending requirements is unclear because some agencies  improperly calculated their spending requirements and\u2014in the absence of  specific guidance from SBA when their appropriations were delayed\u2014 agencies used differing methodologies for calculating these requirements.  Without guidance from SBA, agencies will likely continue to calculate  spending requirements in differing ways, which will continue to raise  questions about their compliance. In addition, most agencies\u2019 reports to  SBA about their methodologies for calculating their spending  requirements did not contain key details, such as the identification of any  R&D programs excluded from the basis for calculating their spending  requirements and a brief explanation of why they are excluded, which is  required both by law and SBA policy directives. Agencies also submitted  differing information in these reports because SBA\u2019s policy directives do  not specify the format for the reports. Without guidance on the format of  methodology reports, participating agencies are likely to continue to  provide SBA with broad, incomplete, or inconsistent information about  their methodologies and spending requirements. Furthermore, without  more complete and consistent information from agencies, it is difficult for  SBA to comprehensively analyze the methodologies and whether  agencies are accurately calculating their spending requirements.  Moreover, according to agency officials, SBA provided little timely  feedback about the agencies\u2019 methodology reports. By not providing such  feedback, SBA is forgoing the opportunity to assist agencies in correctly  calculating their program spending requirements and helping to ensure  that they meet mandated requirements.", "In addition, for the participating agencies\u2019 annual report requirement, SBA  has provided a template requesting the extramural R&D budget base that  agencies used to calculate the programs\u2019 spending requirements, but the  template does not request the specific calculations agencies used to  derive those requirements. By not requesting such calculations, SBA has  been receiving inconsistent and incomplete information from the  participating agencies, which limits the usefulness of data it reports to  Congress. SBA likewise does not request that agencies include  information in their annual reports that would enable better oversight,  including information on (1) whether agencies met the mandated  spending requirements, (2) the reasons for any noncompliance with these  requirements, and (3) the agencies\u2019 plans for meeting any noncompliance  in future years. Finally, SBA\u2019s annual reports to Congress have been  years late or contained little analysis of the methodology reports agencies  submitted to describe how they calculated their spending requirements.
