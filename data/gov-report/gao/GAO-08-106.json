The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in part responded by providing displaced individuals with temporary housing in the form of mobile homes and travel trailers, placed on both private property and at FEMA-constructed group sites. In 2006, FEMA awarded 10 contracts in Mississippi to maintain and deactivate (MD) the housing units and 5 for group site maintenance (GSM). GAO was asked to investigate whether there were indications of fraud, waste, and abuse related to FEMA's oversight of these 15 contracts. GAO analyzed FEMA's issuance of task orders, tested a representative sample of monthly maintenance inspections payments, prepared case studies detailing the costs related to trailers placed at group sites, and investigated improper activity related to the contracts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["FEMA's ineffective oversight resulted in an estimated $30 million in wasteful and improper or potentially fraudulent payments to the MD contractors from June 2006 through January 2007 and likely led to millions more in unnecessary spending beyond this period. For example, FEMA wasted as much as $16 million because it did not issue task orders to the contractors with the lowest prices. In addition, GAO estimates that FEMA paid the contractors almost $16 million because it approved improper or potentially fraudulent invoices. This amount includes about $15 million spent on maintenance inspections even though there was no evidence that inspections occurred and about $600,000 for emergency repairs on housing units that do not exist in FEMA's inventory. Furthermore, FEMA's placement of trailers at group sites is leading to excessive costs. FEMA will spend on average about $30,000 on each 280 square foot trailer at a private site through March 2009, the date when FEMA plans to end temporary housing occupancy. In contrast, expenses for just one trailer at the Port of Bienville Park case study site could escalate to about $229,000---the same as the cost of a five bedroom, 2,000 square foot home in Jackson, Mississippi. Part of the reason for this expense is that FEMA placed only eight trailers at the Bienville site. FEMA wastes money when it operates sites with such a small number of trailers because GSM costs are fixed whether a site contains 1 or 50 trailer pads. At Bienville, FEMA spends over $576,000 per year--$72,000 per trailer--just for grounds maintenance and road and fence repair. GAO also found evidence of improper activity related to the contract award process. For example, FEMA awarded GSM contracts to two companies that did not appear to have submitted independent bids, as required. These companies shared pricing information prior to submitting proposals to FEMA and also shared the same president and accountant. Personnel at both companies also misrepresented their job titles and functions, a potential violation of the False Statements Act. In another case, FEMA's contracting officer awarded a $4 million contract to make the temporary housing units disabled-accessible; the contracting officer allegedly had a previous relationship with the awardee's subcontractor. GAO licensed engineers estimated that the work should have only cost about $800,000, or one-fifth of what FEMA ultimately paid."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina caused catastrophic damage to the Gulf  Coast, killing over 1,000 people and obliterating homes and entire towns  through wind and rain damage, flooding, and the destruction of roads,  bridges, and water and sewer lines. In Mississippi alone, reports estimate  that Katrina destroyed or damaged approximately 134,000 homes and  10,000 rental units. As part of the federal response, the Federal  Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provided many of these  displaced individuals with temporary housing in the form of travel trailers  and mobile homes. According to FEMA, 17,608 households in Mississippi  were still residing in travel trailers and mobile homes as of August 2007.  These households will be allowed to continue this occupancy through  March 2009.", "In the aftermath of the storm, FEMA placed the temporary housing units  on private properties where individuals were rebuilding their homes. For  predisaster renters, FEMA also placed housing units at preexisting  commercial sites (e.g., trailer parks) and at FEMA-constructed group sites  at leased locations, such as stadium grounds and school fields. To support  the temporary housing, FEMA originally awarded sole source contracts to  four major firms and paid these firms billions of dollars to set up and  maintain the units and sites. According to FEMA, it awarded these  contracts noncompetitively because of the urgent need for a rapid  emergency response. After much public criticism and investigations of the  costs claimed by the four contractors, FEMA solicited proposals for new  contracts for the maintenance and deactivation (MD) of mobile homes and  trailers and for group site maintenance (GSM). The MD contracts are  primarily for monthly preventative trailer maintenance, emergency repairs,  and unit deactivation and removal, while the GSM contracts cover  maintenance of the grounds facilities at the site, lawn care, and road and  fence repair. In Mississippi, FEMA awarded 10 MD contracts in May 2006  to maintain approximately 30,000 housing units and 5 GSM contracts in  September 2006 to maintain 39 group sites.", "Both the MD and GSM awards have a 5-year term and FEMA guaranteed  each contractor a minimum amount for the first year: $50,000 for MD  contracts and $100,000 for GSM contracts. FEMA has subsequently  decided to issue task orders under only five of the MD contracts for the  second year; however, the 5 remaining contractors are still eligible to have  task orders issued against their existing contracts. According to FEMA, it  paid the 10 MD contractors almost $63 million from May 2006 through May  2007 and paid the 5 GSM contractors about $9 million from September  2006 through May 2007. In addition, FEMA data shows it has spent over  $13 million on site leases, $6.5 million for security services at the sites, and  $4.4 million on utilities. FEMA data also shows it spent over $4 million to  lay asphalt around 150 travel trailers in group sites to make them  accessible to disabled individuals in compliance with Uniform Federal  Accessibility Standards (UFAS).", "You asked us to investigate whether there were indications of fraud,  waste, and abuse related to FEMA\u2019s oversight of the 10 MD and 5 GSM  contracts in Mississippi. We focused our efforts on investigating   (1) FEMA\u2019s issuance of task orders to the MD contractors and (2) FEMA\u2019s  invoice review process. We also prepared case studies to assess the costs  associated with the placement of travel trailers at group sites and  investigated allegations of criminal and improper activity related to the  contracts.", "To conduct our investigation, we analyzed FEMA\u2019s issuance of task orders  under the contracts and the costs associated with the most expensive  contract line items from June 2006 through January 2007. In addition, we  selected and tested a representative sample of payments made to the MD  contractors for monthly preventative maintenance inspections from June  2006 to January 2007. To prepare our case studies, we reviewed specific  costs associated with a nonrepresentative selection of 3 group sites and 1  commercial site in Mississippi. We did not conduct a comprehensive  evaluation of whether FEMA adhered to its own solicitation requirements  and other laws or regulations when awarding the 10 MD and 5 GSM  contracts. However, our interviews with FEMA officials, contractor  personnel, and confidential informants led us to identify potentially  improper activity associated with the award process. To further  investigate this activity, we reviewed and compared the contract  proposals, total bid prices, line item bids, and government estimates for  work. We conducted our work from October 2006 to September 2007. We  conducted our investigative work in accordance with the standards  prescribed by the Presidents Council on Integrity and Efficiency and  conducted our audit work in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.

The act  limits this direct assistance to an 18-month period, after which FEMA may  charge fair market rent for the housing unless it extends the 18-month  free-of-charge period due to extraordinary circumstances. To manage this  post-disaster housing, FEMA typically has in place a contingency technical  assistance contract. However, when Katrina made landfall in August 2005,  FEMA was in the process of competing this contract\u2014bids had been  solicited and evaluated, but no contract was in place. Therefore, FEMA  awarded \u201cno-bid\u201d contracts to four major engineering firms (Bechtel  Corporation, Fluor Corporation, the Shaw Group Incorporated, and CH2M  Hill Incorporated) for, among other things, the support of staging areas for  housing units, installation of housing units, maintenance and upkeep, site  inspections and preparations, site restoration, group site design, group site  construction, site assessments, property and facility management, as well  as housing unit deactivation and rehabilitation. In total, FEMA made  almost $3 billion in payments to Bechtel, Fluor, Shaw, and CH2M Hill from  September 2005 to January 2007. After much public criticism and  investigations of the costs claimed by the four contractors, FEMA  solicited proposals for new contracts for the maintenance and  deactivation (MD) of mobile homes and trailers and for group site  maintenance (GSM).", "Mississippi Maintenance and Deactivation Contracts: In November  2005, FEMA posted two solicitations indicating its intent to award multiple  contracts for the maintenance and deactivation of manufactured homes  and travel trailers. One solicitation was set aside for small businesses and  the other was designated for 8(a) business development concerns (small  businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged  individuals). The solicitations for the small business and 8(a) awards were  essentially the same, with each requiring prospective bidders to submit a  technical and a business proposal listing their price for each of 37 contract  line items. Additionally, in order to provide preference to local businesses,  FEMA notified bidders that the proposed total price for any nonlocal  business would be increased by 30 percent for price evaluation purposes.  In May 2006, FEMA awarded five contracts to small businesses and five to  8(a) business development concerns. Each award was an indefinite  delivery/indefinite quantity fixed price type contract with a 5-year term  and each had a guaranteed minimum of $50,000 and a maximum funding  limitation of $100 million. In total, nine businesses received these awards  because one business received two awards\u2013one as a small business and  one as an 8(a) business concern. In addition, of the 10 awards, 8 went to  businesses classified as local for price competition purposes and 2 went to  companies that FEMA deemed nonlocal. FEMA also awarded similar  maintenance and deactivation contracts in Louisiana, Alabama, and Texas.", "In May 2006, following award of the Mississippi MD contracts, FEMA  issued two task orders to each of the 10 awardees. The initial task order  for each contractor initiated a phase-in period for contract ramp-up. The  cost of each contractor\u2019s phase-in period was based on the amount agreed  to in their contract. FEMA obligated the amount for the initial phase-in  cost proposed by each MD contractor, which ranged from a low of $23,220  to a high of $6,111,000. The second task order provided an estimated  quantity and projected dollar amount for each of the contract line items  for the first 11 months of performance. Those task orders stated that the  estimated usage was a \u201cgood faith estimate on the part of the government  and was developed solely to arrive at an estimated total for the task  order.\u201d The amount obligated for each of those \u201cgood faith estimates\u201d was  between $19.2 million and $20.6 million, for a total obligation amount of  over $200 million. FEMA elected not to compete the task orders among the  10 contractors nor did they consider price or cost under each task order as  a factor in their source selection decision. However, both the MD contract  and the FAR state that a contracting officer must provide each contractor  with a fair opportunity to be considered for each order issued under  multiple task order contracts. The FAR further states that the contracting  officer may exercise \u201cbroad discretion\u201d in developing task order issuance  procedures, as long as these procedures are fair, included in the  solicitation, and factor in price or cost.", "Mississippi Group Site Maintenance Contracts: In May 2006, FEMA  posted its intent to award multiple contracts for group site maintenance.  These contracts were set aside exclusively for service disabled veteran- owned small businesses and were further limited to proposing firms  residing in or primarily doing business in Mississippi. The solicitation  required each submitter to provide a price for maintaining group sites at  various threshold sizes, including sites with less than 50 trailer pads, 51 to  100, 101 to 300, 301 to 600, and 601 or more. FEMA awarded these  contracts in September 2006 and also awarded similar group site  maintenance contracts in Louisiana.", "Temporary Housing Occupancy Extension: In April 2007, FEMA  extended the temporary housing assistance program for hurricane victims  living in trailers and mobile homes until March 2009. Beginning in March  2008, individuals residing in these units will pay a portion of the cost for  rent, which will begin at $50 per month and incrementally increase each  month thereafter until the program concludes on March 1, 2009. FEMA  also began allowing residents of its mobile homes and travel trailers to  purchase their dwellings at a fair and equitable price; however, on August  1, 2007, FEMA temporarily suspended sales while the agency works with  health and environmental experts to assess health-related concerns raised  by occupants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA\u2019s Issuance of Task Orders under MD Contracts Resulted in as Much as $16 Million in Waste", "paragraphs": ["FEMA wasted as much as $16 million because it did not allocate task  orders under the MD contracts to the companies with the lowest prices.

However, when we  reviewed the call center data, we found that the records related to  emergency calls were not complete and therefore we could not determine  whether the contractors submitted billings for valid emergency calls or  whether FEMA made payments for calls that met its emergency criteria.  Specifically, FEMA\u2019s database did not identify  the time and date the call was received. Although FEMA\u2019s call center  received 46,000 emergency calls from June 2006 through January 2007,  over 21,000 of these call records lacked a time designation. Therefore,  we could not ascertain whether calls should have been billed and paid  for as emergency repairs.   which contractor was assigned the call and which calls resulted in  billable services. Although FEMA\u2019s call center received 46,000  emergency calls, data we received from the contractors show that they  only billed FEMA for about 12, 045 emergency repairs. Therefore,  although we have FEMA\u2019s records on calls received and payments  made, we cannot reconcile this payment information with the  contractors\u2019 invoices.", "Despite these discrepancies, we were able to determine that FEMA spent  over $600,000 for emergency after-hours repairs on units that cannot be  found in FEMA\u2019s inventory. As previously stated, FEMA paid for 12,045  after-hours emergency calls on 7,310 housing units from June 2006 through  January 2007. When we compared the unit barcodes associated with these  7,310 units with the barcodes listed in FEMA\u2019s main database for tracking  the assignment and location of mobile homes and trailers, we were unable  to identify records for 1,732 of the 7,310 units. Records show that FEMA  made 2,780 improper or potentially fraudulent emergency repair payments  related to these 1,732 trailers. Using the contractors pricing information,  we calculated that these 2,780 payments totaled over $600,000."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Case Studies Illustrate Excessive Costs at Group and Commercial Sites", "paragraphs": ["Our four case studies show that FEMA\u2019s placement of travel trailers at  group and commercial sites can lead to excessive costs. FEMA placed the  temporary housing units on private properties to shelter individuals who  were rebuilding their homes; at FEMA-constructed group sites at leased  locations, such as stadium grounds and school fields; and at preexisting  commercial sites (e.g., trailer parks). With regard to the private sites,  FEMA only has to pay for installation, maintenance, and deactivation; the  trailer can be hooked up to the property\u2019s existing utilities, so no trailer  pad is required. With regard to the group sites, FEMA understandably has  had to pay extra for site construction and maintenance, security, leases,  and utilities. However, our case studies show that these expenses are  exacerbated by the fact that FEMA did not allocate work at the sites in a  cost-effective manner and has not reevaluated this allocation since the  sites were established. With regard to the commercial sites, FEMA has not  incurred the same operational expenses that it has at the group sites  because FEMA did not have to pay for pad construction and design and  does not have to pay the GSM contractors for site maintenance. However,  we found that FEMA\u2019s mismanagement of the commercial site we  investigated has lead to substantial waste.", "The majority of FEMA housing units in Mississippi are located on private  properties where individuals are rebuilding their homes. According to  FEMA, almost 14,000 of the 17,608 units currently in Mississippi are  located on private sites, while the remainder are located at group or  commercial sites. We estimate that, on average, FEMA will spend  approximately $30,000 for the life cycle of a trailer placed at one of these  private sites. As shown in figure 3, FEMA paid about $14,000 to purchase  each 280 square foot trailer and $12,000 to haul the trailer to the site and  install it, and will spend an additional $4,000 to maintain a private site  trailer through the March 2009 temporary housing occupancy extension.  Our estimate is likely understated because we did not have access to the  trailer maintenance and group site maintenance payments made to the  original four contractors. We also could not calculate MD phase-in costs,  nor could we project deactivation expenses because it is not certain which  of the current MD contractors will be responsible for deactivating the  trailers in 2009.", "In contrast, as shown in table 4 and the subsequent figures, FEMA could  spend from about $69,000 to $229,000 for trailers at the three group sites  we investigated, when factoring in all known expenses, including costs  incurred by the original four contractors for site design and construction  and unit installation. Part of the reason for these extreme expenses is that  FEMA failed to efficiently allocate work at the sites. For example, FEMA  wasted about $800,000 by inefficiently allocating trailers and pads and also  could not explain why it spent over $204,000 per year to lease one group  site when most of the other parks only cost about $30,000 per year to  lease.", "However, because data provided by FEMA contained numerous  discrepancies, we could not account for all the expenses incurred at these  sites. In particular, although we were able to determine the number of  trailer pads at each site, FEMA could not provide us with an accurate  trailer count. For purposes of our analysis, we assumed that the parks  were operating with a trailer on each available pad. We also did not have  accurate information about utility payments FEMA made for these specific  sites and the trailers. As with the trailers at the private sites, our estimate  is likely understated because we did not have access to the trailer and site  maintenance payments made to the original four contractors and because  we could not calculate MD phase-in and deactivation expenses. In  addition, we do not know how much it will cost to return the group sites  to their original condition, as required by the terms of the group site  leases.", "Port of Bienville Industrial Park in Hancock County: Figure 4 shows  the breakdown of expenses per trailer at this park through March 2009.", "Because there are only eight pads at Bienville, FEMA will spend about  $229,000 for each trailer at the park through the March 2009 occupancy  extension. Group site maintenance costs are dependent on the size of  the site\u2014\u201dsmall\u201d sites contain 50 trailer pads or less. In other words,  FEMA wastes money by operating sites with very few pads because the  GSM costs will be the same if a park has 1 trailer pad or 50. In this case,  FEMA spends over $576,000 per year\u2014$72,000 per trailer\u2014for site  maintenance. To save on this expense, FEMA could have assigned this  park to the GSM contractor with the lowest bid price to service a small  park. This contractor would only have charged FEMA about $76,000  per year to service Bienville\u2014$9,500 per trailer. When we asked FEMA  officials about the distribution of work at the sites, they told us that  they \u201cgrasped\u201d what pads they could get in the aftermath of the storm.

FEMA pays the GSM  contractor about $500,000 per year for maintenance at a large park, as  opposed to $244,000 to service a medium sized park with 100 pads or  less. Therefore, the additional two pads increase the GSM costs for this  park by almost $260,000 per year. To save on this yearly cost, FEMA  could have originally placed these two pads at another site with  available space\u2014-there are five group sites and one commercial site  located near Sunset Ingalls. When we asked FEMA officials about the  distribution of work at the sites, they told us that they \u201cgrasped\u201d what  pads they could get in the aftermath of the storm.

This lease amount is significantly higher than at the other 38  group sites, which typically range in cost from $250 to $7,500 per  month. We asked FEMA why they were spending so much to lease  this property in comparison to the other sites, they told us that did not  evaluate costs associated with group site leasing because the General  Services Administration (GSA) set up the leases. When we asked  representatives from GSA about the Ellzey lease, they told us that  $204,000 per year was a reasonable price because the site was located  on industrial property, but they could not tell us if a less expensive  option was considered.", "With regard to the commercial sites, table 5 shows the estimated cost  per trailer at one commercial park in Mississippi. FEMA could have  saved $1.5 million at this site if it had exercised an option to reassign or  contract separately for septic cleaning services.", "McLeod Water Park in Hancock County: Figure 7 shows the  breakdown of expenses per trailer at this park through March 2009.", "The MD contractor at this park charged FEMA $245 per septic service,  or more than 500 percent of what FEMA could have paid, to provide  septic cleanings to the approximately 61 trailers at the park. In total,  FEMA paid the contractor about $1.8 million for this service because  the cleanings were provided 3 times per week per trailer over the  course of a year. However, this contractor made a profit of almost   $1.5 million on these cleanings because it paid a subcontractor just   $45 per cleaning to actually perform the work. FEMA could have saved  this $1.5 million by awarding a separate contract for the septic cleaning  services with the less expensive subcontractor; the septic bladder line  item specifies that \u201cFEMA reserves the right to use other sources to  complete the work.\u201d However, FEMA did not exercise this option.

Although making this type of award is not  prohibited, the circumstances surrounding this case merit further  investigation.

Unlike the MD and GSM  contracts, the FEMA contract officer set aside this UFAS contract for sole- source negotiation with a local 8(a) firm. At the time of the UFAS award  process, 8(a) contracts could be awarded without competition if the  anticipated total value of the contract was less than $3 million. According  the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), an 8(a) contract may not be  awarded if the cost to the agency exceeds a fair market price. Further, the  FAR provides that prior to making sole-source 8(a) awards, a contracting  officer must estimate and justify the fair market value of the contract,  using cost analyses or other available data.

We also prepared case studies to determine the costs  associated with the placement of travel trailers at group sites and  investigated allegations of criminal and improper activity related to the  contracts.", "To investigate FEMA\u2019s issuance of task orders to the MD contractors, we  assessed whether the agency issued the task orders in a cost-effective  manner. We analyzed the costs associated with the five most expensive  contract line items. We analyzed MD contractor invoices and FEMA  receiving reports from June 2006 through January 2007 to find the total  number of units paid for by FEMA. For each of the 10 contractors, we  totaled the number of units paid for by FEMA for the preventative  maintenance, phase in, deactivation, septic bladder pumping, and  emergency after-hours repairs contract line items. We then totaled the  number of units and amount paid to all contractors for all listed contract  line items. To determine the five least expensive contractors, we divided  the total number of units for each line item by five, and then multiplied  that total by each contractor\u2019s line item cost. By adding up the cost of all  line items for each contractor, we were able to determine the five least  expensive contractors. Using these five contractors, we determined what  the total cost for each line item would have been if FEMA had awarded  these five the MD task orders. We then compared the new cost to the  original FEMA payments to figure potential savings for the line items.", "To investigate FEMA\u2019s invoice review process, we reviewed invoices and  backup documentation associated with the $28.5 million in payments  FEMA made for monthly preventative maintenance and the $2.2 million in  payments FEMA made for emergency after-hours repairs. With regard to  monthly preventative maintenance, we initially reviewed approximately 90  preventative maintenance invoices submitted by the MD contractors from  June 2006 through January 2007. Each of these invoices contained  approximately 1,000 to 3,000 monthly inspection billings. As a result of this  review, we identified billings for 12,000 inspections, totaling $2.2 million,  that did not contain any documentation to support that an inspection had  actually occurred.", "To provide an estimate of improper or potentially fraudulent payments  related to the remaining $26 million in preventative maintenance payments  FEMA made to the MD contractors, we drew a statistical sample of 250  units that were paid for by FEMA as receiving a preventative maintenance  inspection. We constructed the population of preventative maintenance  inspections using contractor back-up invoice documentation and monthly  contract status reports as well as FEMA receiving reports confirming  FEMA payments for unit maintenance from June 2006 through January  2007. We acquired preventative maintenance inspection forms from the  MD contractors and FEMA. Improper or potentially fraudulent payments  for unit maintenance include cases where the payment was made (1) for  preventative maintenance inspections on units not identified in FEMA\u2019s  database, (2) based on preventative maintenance inspection forms that did  not exist, and (3) based on inspection forms that did not contain an  occupant\u2019s signature denoting a full inspection occurred or that three  attempts to conduct an inspection were made. To assess the reliability of  the preventive maintenance inspections documentation from June 2006  through January 2007, we (1) reviewed existing documentation related to  the data sources and (2) examined the data to identify obvious problems  with completeness, accuracy, or duplicates. We determined that the data  were sufficiently reliable for the statistical sample. Because we followed a  probability procedure based on random selections, our sample is only one  of a large number of samples that we might have drawn. Since each  sample could have provided different estimates, we express our  confidence in the precision of our particular sample\u2019s results as a   95 percent confidence interval (e.g., plus or minus 5 percentage points).

To determine  whether FEMA made emergency after-hours repair payments for units that  do not exist in its inventory records, we compared the barcodes on the  7,310 housing units that received emergency repairs from June 2006 to  January 2007 with the barcodes listed in FEMA\u2019s main database for  tracking the assignment and location of mobile homes and trailers. We  were unable to identify records for 1,732 of these 7,310 units. Using  FEMA\u2019s payment records, we then determined that FEMA made 2,780  improper or potentially fraudulent emergency repair payments related to  these 1,732 trailers.", "To prepare case studies, we calculated the expenses associated with a  nonrepresentative selection of three group sites and one commercial site  in Mississippi. We used cost information issued by FEMA to calculate  expenses associated with trailer purchase, site design and construction,  and trailer installation. To identify the specific trailer barcodes located at  each case study site, we searched several databases provided by FEMA, as  well as data provided by the contractors for park address or occupant  name matches. Because FEMA could not provide us with a definitive  number of trailers at each site, for purposes of our analysis, we assumed a  best case scenario for FEMA: that the parks were operating with a trailer  on each available pad. Using the list of trailer barcodes we identified, we  analyzed the invoices submitted by the MDC contractor responsible for  each site, and the accompanying FEMA receiving reports to determine the  number and type of services performed on each trailer and paid for by  FEMA. The charges cover the period of June 2006 through January or  February 2007, depending upon each contractor\u2019s available data. We also  added in the following costs as provided by FEMA: group site contractor  costs for each site, including a portion of their phase-in cost, and monthly  security costs and monthly lease costs, if applicable. The one-time and  recurring costs were combined for each park, resulting in a total cost for  each park. To provide a general lifecycle cost for a FEMA trailer, we  estimated these totals through March 2009, which is the date FEMA stated  the travel trailer rental assistance program will end. To determine the  general costs for a FEMA trailer located on a private site, we identified  trailers noted as \u201cprivate\u201d in the FEMA databases, and selected the first  three for each MDC contractor. We then searched the contractor invoices,  covering the period of June 2006 through January 2007 and recorded and  totaled the charges for each barcode. The resulting totals were projected  for 1 year, and used as an estimate of the annual costs for maintaining a  trailer on a private site. We also projected the costs for these trailers  through March 2009.", "Our estimates are likely understated because did not have access to trailer  maintenance and group site maintenance payments made to the original  four contractors. We also could not calculate MD phase-in costs, nor could  we calculate deactivation expenses because it is not certain which of the  current MD contractors will be responsible for deactivating the trailers in  2009. In addition, we do not know how much it will cost to return the  group sites to their original condition, as required by the terms of the  group site lease. Results from nonprobability samples (case studies)  cannot be used to make inferences about a population, because in a  nonprobability sample, some elements of the population have no chance  or an unknown chance of being selected as part of the sample.
