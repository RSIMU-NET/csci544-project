GAO identified three factors that were key to matching needs and resources before product development began. First, developers employed the technique of systems engineering to identify gaps between resources and customer needs before committing to a new product development. Second, customers and developers were flexible. Leeway existed to reduce or defer customer needs to future programs or for the developer to make an investment to increase knowledge about a technology or design feature before beginning product development. Third, the roles and responsibilities of the customer and the product developer were matched, with the product developer being able to determine or significantly influence product requirements. In cases where these factors were not present at program launch, product development began without a match between requirements and resources. Invariably, this imbalance favored meeting customer needs by adding resources, which resulted in increased costs and later deliveries."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As you requested, this report examines how best practices offer improvements to the way the  Department of Defense defines and matches weapon system requirements to available resources such  as cost, schedule, and mature technologies.

DOD\u2019s annual  weapon system investment has increased from about $90 billion 3 years  ago to almost $100 billion for fiscal year 2001; over the next 5 years, DOD  plans to spend about $516 billion developing and acquiring weapon  systems. DOD would like to get the most out of this investment, and it has  set goals to develop new weapons in half the traditional time and within  budget. Historically, DOD has not received a predictable return on its  investment in major weapon systems as they have cost significantly more  and taken much longer to complete than originally estimated. When one  program runs into problems and needs more money than planned, it comes  at the expense of delaying or canceling other programs, which reduces  buying power and means less overall modernization. The ability to execute  a program more predictably within cost and schedule estimates would  lessen the need to offset cost increases by disrupting other programs. DOD  recognizes that changes are necessary to its acquisition practices to  achieve its modernization goals. Thus, it has advocated adopting the  practices of leading commercial firms.", "Our reviews over the past 20 years have likewise pointed to a need to adopt  new practices. We have seen many of the same problems recur in weapon  system programs\u2014cost increases, schedule delays, and performance  problems. On many occasions, we found that programs required more  resources\u2014time and money\u2014than were estimated for demonstrating  technologies, designing solutions, and providing more production  capabilities in order to meet customer expectations. Because customer  expectations for the system\u2019s performance were set when the decision was  made to invest in the system, adding resources became the primary option  for solving problems when they arose. Despite good intentions and some  progress, our ongoing reviews of DOD\u2019s weapon system acquisitions show  that these persistent problems remain. As a result, we undertook a body of  work that examines weapon system acquisitions issues from a different,  more cross-cutting perspective\u2014one that draws lessons learned from the  best commercial product development efforts to see if they can be applied  to DOD weapon system developments. In past years, leading commercial  firms have developed increasingly sophisticated products in significantly  less time and at lower costs.", "Our past work has shown that leading commercial firms expect their  program managers to deliver high quality products on time and within  budget. Thus, the firms have created an environment and adopted practices  that put their program managers in a good position to succeed in meeting  these expectations. Collectively, these practices comprise a development  process that is anchored in knowledge. The firms demand\u2014and receive\u2014 specific knowledge about a new product at key junctures in the process,  (see fig. 1).  cost, schedule, and There is a synergy in this process, as the attainment of each successive  knowledge point builds on the preceding one. Such a knowledge-based  process is essential to commercial firms getting better\u2014and predictable\u2014 cost, schedule, and performance outcomes. It enables decisionmakers to  be reasonably certain about critical facets of the product under  development when they need it. We have found that when DOD programs  have employed similar practices, they also experience good outcomes. This  knowledge can be broken down into three knowledge points:   when a match is made between the customer\u2019s needs and the available   when the product\u2019s design meets performance requirements, and   when the product can be produced within cost, schedule, and quality  targets.", "The most important knowledge point occurs at launch\u2014the point at which  the product developer makes a decision to commit (or invest) the  resources necessary to develop a new product that will meet customer  needs. This knowledge point makes it easier to reach the remaining two  knowledge points at the right time. Successful programs are launched only  when a product developer is confident that it has the resources\u2014 technology, engineering, and production knowledge, along with sufficient  time, and money\u2014to develop a product the customer wants. Significant  problems have occurred during development when programs were  launched without this match.", "We have reported on how a key resource of a developer\u2014advanced  technology\u2014can and must be readied to meet product requirements at the  time a product\u2019s development program is launched. In this report, we  address both sides of the match: how customer needs and product  developer resources can be managed so that a product developer can  predictably deliver a product the customer wants."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "How Product Requirements Are Set Is Key to Program Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["The decisions that are made in translating the ideas for a new product into  actual features and characteristics dictate the amount of resources\u2014 knowledge, time, money, and capacity\u2014that will be necessary to bring the  product to market. Thus, they may be the most highly leveraged of all  product development decisions. A product\u2019s requirements are based on  customers\u2019 expectations and justify the developer\u2019s investment of  resources to provide the desired capability. Requirements drive the amount  of capital, time, expertise, and technologies the developer must invest. In  the past, it has not been unusual for weapon system requirements to be set  at such a high level that the initial estimate of the resources necessary to  develop a responsive product proves insufficient, evidenced by cost growth  and schedule slippage. The case to justify the requirements is often so  stridently made that decisionmakers are in a relatively weak position to do  anything other than find more resources.", "For commercial firms and DOD, the basic process for formulating a  product\u2019s requirements is the same. Each begins with understanding the  customers\u2019 expectations. These expectations are then translated into  product requirements that include the job the product is to perform, the  functions or characteristics it is to possess, the practicality it must have,  and its reliability. Typically, the first understanding of customer  expectations exceeds what the developer can do within available  resources, because the developer has a limited amount of resources at its  disposal for product development. On one hand is knowledge\u2014the  technology and capabilities the developer has to engineer and manufacture  the product. On the other hand is the time and money the developer has to  develop additional knowledge, if need be, and to design, build, test, and  deliver the product. It is not unusual for a customer to want a  high-performing product that does not cost much or take too long to  develop. Such an expectation may exceed the developer\u2019s technology or  engineering expertise or may be more costly and time-consuming to create  than the customer is willing to accept. The developer must stay within its  means if the venture is to remain mutually beneficial. Table 1 characterizes  the divergent interests of the customer and the product developer.", "Given these different interests, a customer\u2019s wants and a product  developer\u2019s available resources must be matched to form an achievable set  of product requirements. On one hand, the product developer must develop  and produce the product within the time frames the customer needs or the  customer may find an alternative product or source. On the other hand, the  customer must not demand a product that requires so much money or time  to develop that it cannot be afforded or delivered when needed. There is a  delicate balance that must be achieved between these two divergent  interests before a product can be successfully developed and produced.", "On all product developments, there is an attempt to match expectations  with available resources to define the new product. A customer\u2019s  expectations and a product developer\u2019s resources are more closely  scrutinized during the matching process that attempts to bring the two  together. The outcome is a set of product requirements that represent an agreement that the product will meet the customer\u2019s wants and that the  developer can deliver the product within acceptable cost and schedule  estimates. The requirements then guide the development program. This  basic requirements setting process is illustrated in figure 2.", "The process of translating general customer expectations into a specific set  of product requirements involves information gathering, analysis,  negotiation, and agreement. In the commercial process, the customer and  the product developer negotiate requirements, matching expectations and  available resources into a documented set of product requirements prior to  committing resources to product development. During this negotiation, the  customer\u2019s relatively unconstrained wants are often reduced to a set of  performance characteristics that are achievable with available resources,  yet still meet the customer\u2019s needs. The commercial process is a two-way  communication between the customer and the product developer. For  example, an airline company may want a certain speed to maximize  revenue per passenger mile from a new aircraft. However, the product  developer may determine that the resources to develop an aircraft with that  speed are not available or must be increased dramatically. Both parties  then work through an iterative process of trades and negotiation to settle  on an aircraft with mutually acceptable performance and resource  requirements.", "The DOD process is somewhat more complex and involves  communications among at least four major players. On one end is the  customer, which is normally a military organization that belongs to a major  fighting force. On the other end is the product developer, usually a defense  firm that serves as the prime contractor for developing and producing the  weapon system. In between are two other players that actually negotiate  needs and resources to arrive at product requirements. One is referred to  as the user representative, which is an organization separate from the  customer but represents the customer and negotiates on its behalf. The  other player is the DOD program manager, a separate organization that, in  essence, represents the product developer. Figure 3 illustrates how these  different players interact in commercial and DOD requirement-setting  processes.", "Both commercial and defense organizations are concerned about how  much a product or weapon system is going to cost, how long it is going to  take to build, what resources will be needed to build and maintain it, and  whether it works properly. All of these concerns are translated into the  product\u2019s requirements. Unlike the commercial process, the DOD product  developer does not directly influence the product requirement prior to  launching product development. Once requirements are formalized in what  DOD refers to as the Operational Requirements Document, they are turned  over to the prime contractor, who actually begins product development."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The Chairman and the Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Readiness and  Management Support, Senate Committee on Armed Services, requested  that we examine various aspects of the acquisition process to determine  whether the application of best practices can improve program outcomes.

Our sources for such information include our  many reviews of individual weapon systems; studies from other sources,  such as the Defense Science Board; and discussions with defense experts,  including past and current DOD officials, defense industry representatives,  and analysts from private organizations that study defense issues. Before  beginning a review of a particular topic, we confirm with DOD officials that  the topic is one in which the potential for improvement is significant. Once  we have identified the topic, we use a case study approach because case  studies provide the in-depth knowledge needed to understand individual  practices, how they affect program outcomes, and why they are adopted. In  selecting case studies, we look for examples of excellent practices from  leading commercial firms, examples of typical or traditional practices from  DOD, and where possible, DOD examples that exhibit excellent practices.  In making our selections, we are careful to make sure that there is a link  between the practices themselves and the outcomes of the programs.", "To identify best practices for setting requirements on commercial products,  we reviewed literature and spoke with industry and academic experts to  find companies recognized for managing requirements to help deliver new  products that were both quicker to market and more advanced than their  predecessors.

Much of the requirement-setting activity prior to  initiating a program is devoted to proving the superior cost-effectiveness of  the preferred system over others, with less consideration given to the  resources that will be needed to develop the system. If user representatives  do not write requirements that will withstand scrutiny and prevail over  alternatives, the program could be killed and no capability is gained for the  customer. Costly, labor-intensive studies, such as analyses of alternatives,  are done to determine the best possible solution to meet the user\u2019s needs  and to beat the competition. At the same time, overall DOD funding  constraints put a high priority on affordability, making it important for  program sponsors to provide cost estimates that will fit within the funding  constraints. Instead of forcing trade-offs, challenging performance  requirements, when coupled with other constraints, such as cost or light  weight, can drive product developers to pursue exotic solutions and  technologies that, in theory, could do it all.", "To simplify requirements and foster trade-offs, DOD has adopted the  practice of identifying only a limited number of key performance  parameters\u2014\u201cmust-haves\u201d for the customer\u2014for each weapon system.  This practice may help to prioritize requirements. However, if the  parameters are not informed by systems engineering, given the pressures  inherent in the process, they still result in unrealistic demands made of  existing resources. For example, the Army\u2019s Crusader program had only  five key performance parameters, including characteristics such as  rate-of-fire, range, and speed, but they were dependent on about 500 other  subordinate performance requirements that were defined before systems  engineering was done by the product developer.", "The unique role of the requirement setter in DOD\u2019s acquisition process can  also put pressure on requirements. DOD\u2019s requirement setters are outside  of the acquisition community and often represent an operational function  such as air combat, artillery, or armor. They are not the actual user like an  operating air wing or Army brigade, but serve as a representative of the  user. Unlike the commercial world, where a customer\u2019s wants are  represented by someone within the product developer\u2019s organization,  DOD\u2019s requirement setters are, for the most part, separate and independent  of the customer, program manager, and the product developer. A user  representative can work directly with DOD science and technology  organizations and defense firms to obtain information about new  technology, and thus may be less willing to defer to a program manager\u2019s  advice on these issues. Also, while a customer is focused on current  problems and near-term performance, a user representative tries to look at  longer term needs. In fact, the fear that DOD may not procure another such  system for several years creates incentives for user representatives to  reach for the most capability possible because they do not know when or if  they will get another opportunity to develop and acquire the next weapon  system.", "The Comanche helicopter program is a good example of these pressures at  work.

The impact this change is having on Crusader\u2019s  requirements further illustrates how DOD incentives can drive  requirements and ultimately impact program outcomes. The preliminary  Crusader design \u2014which met all key requirements\u2014was considered too  heavy for the new, lighter force. In fact, the Army Chief of Staff said he  would like to have the Crusader\u2019s weight reduced to the point that twice as  many vehicles could be moved with the same amount of transport aircraft.  With the program\u2019s future at stake, the user representative, program  manager, and product developer are working together to reduce the overall  design weight of the system from 55 to 38 tons. Because of this new  priority, previously untraded requirements\u2014such as degree of crew  protection, time on the firing line, and the need for tracked vehicles\u2014are  now being examined to see if they can be reduced to save weight.", "A specific Crusader requirement is illustrative. In developing the original  set of requirements, the user representatives determined that the  Crusader\u2019s effectiveness would be maximized if the Crusader could avoid  having to leave its battle station to reload and refuel. To meet this  requirement, the resupply vehicle would have to reload and refuel the  howitzer at the battle station. This requirement necessitated that the  resupply vehicle be armored, tracked, and fully automated so that the crew  would not be exposed to enemy fire. This not only made for a more  effective howitzer but also distinguished the Crusader from other  candidates. In looking for weight reductions, the Army is considering  pulling at least some of the howitzers off station to reload and refuel. If it  relaxes that requirement, the resupply vehicle and crew can do its work  under safer conditions. In turn, the vehicle would not have to be as heavily  armored, automated, or tracked. In fact, the Army is considering using  existing trucks, which are far lighter and less expensive than a new  resupply vehicle.

As we reported  in May 2000, delaying this phase of the program until technologies are  mature would improve the chances that the Joint Strike Fighter will be  fielded as planned. However, despite not having the requisite knowledge  for the technologies, DOD has deemed the risks manageable and proposes  to proceed with the program as planned. Such a decision reinforces  traditional incentives and increases the likelihood for future problems."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Managing the setting of a product\u2019s requirements in a way that matches the  customer\u2019s needs with the developer\u2019s resources is critical for a successful  product development. This kind of success\u2014delivering weapons that meet  needs within predicted costs and time frames\u2014is essential if DOD is to get  what it wants from its huge modernization investment. The best practices  for balancing needs and resources before committing to a new product or  weapon system development are to (1) conduct systems engineering to  illuminate what has to be done to match the wants with the resources;  (2) establish fixed cycle times for an initial product within an overall  evolutionary approach to foster flexibility needed to make key trade-offs;  and (3) maintain parity between requirement setters and product  developers when translating customer needs into product requirements.  These practices provide for identifying gaps between wants and resources  as well as solutions\u2014whether by trading off needs or investing more  resources\u2014before setting requirements and starting development.", "The environment for commercial products provides incentives that  encourage these practices. Like DOD, commercial customers have an  initial advantage in that they have high expectations of a new product, they  do not have unlimited time and money, and ultimately, their needs have to  be met. While firms are motivated to offer a customer a product that meets  these needs, they are keenly aware that promising more than they can  deliver will ultimately disappoint the customer. Consequently, leading firms  consciously attempt to manage customer expectations and put themselves  in a good position to negotiate a reasonable set of product requirements.  They do this in several ways. First, because they are investing their own  resources to develop the product, they are at liberty to conduct systems  engineering early\u2014an investment they consider small relative to the overall  cost of developing a product. Second, they have a proven track record for  delivering products on time and making promised improvements to  succeeding versions of the product. Third, they play a prominent role in  setting and agreeing to product requirements. Together, these factors help  create the credibility, confidence, and trust that are essential to maintaining  the flexibility needed to match their resources with the customer\u2019s needs  before launching a new product development.", "Within DOD\u2019s traditional acquisition process it is difficult to gain  knowledge and maintain flexibility in requirements prior to committing  resources to an acquisition program. As a result, customer needs are  translated into product requirements that often make unreasonable  demands on available resources. There are several reasons for setting  weapon system requirements this way. Some are the following:   The mechanics of the program approval and funding process force a  sequence of events that keeps a product developer relatively uninvolved  in shaping requirements, compared with best practices, causing product  development to begin with cost and schedule targets untempered by  systems engineering knowledge.", "Unique or demanding requirements can help gain approval to fund a  new program because aiming too low can result in losing out to other  programs, thus denying any new capabilities.", "There is some mistrust in an evolutionary approach, specifically  regarding whether future improvements will be approved; consequently,  attempting to reach for the full capability in a single step can be seen as  a safer course of action.", "The challenging and long process to get requirements approved hardens  requirements setters against trade-offs\u2014in fact, the process of getting a  requirement approved can actually encourage additions to garner  support.", "Unlike the commercial world, DOD customers have proven to be  tolerant of cost and schedule increases once a program is underway.", "Seen in this light, while the pattern of weapon system requirements  outstripping planned resources is inefficient, it is not irrational; within the  DOD environment, this approach is successful in starting programs that  eventually provide superior capabilities. This approach also has negative  consequences. First, the additional time and money that must be invested  after launch still yield the same capability called for by the original  requirements, effectively lowering the buying power of the investment.  Second, the unplanned nature of the additional investment generally  requires weapon system quantities to be lowered or money to be taken  from other programs. Third, when a requirements setter is unwilling to  make trade-offs before launch but later elects to accept delivery delays to  meet those requirements, the implicit trade-off is to have the customer do  without any of the new capability for a longer period of time. The challenge  in adopting best practices, therefore, is to make them rational\u2014that is,  critical for success\u2014in the DOD environment. Meeting this challenge will  take changes in both the mechanics and the incentives of the requirements  setting and program approval processes.", "DOD\u2019s recently revised policies could make it possible for a better  matching of customer needs and developer resources before program  launch. While these policies are sound and merit support, they retain the  mechanics of the old policies. Namely, requirements must be set before a  program can be approved and a program must be approved before the  money can be obtained to pay the product developer to conduct systems  engineering. Such mechanics deny the knowledge needed to match wants  with resources before starting a program. Similarly, the new policies must  overcome the still extant pressures brought to bear on requirements setters  to aim high and become inflexible. It took unique circumstances\u2014starting  as Advanced Concept Technology Demonstrations and enjoying the  personal intervention of top DOD executives\u2014to create the incentives on  the Global Hawk and Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle programs for  making the trade-offs needed to match needs with resources. Even so, the  Global Hawk is struggling with pressures to reverse some of the trade-offs  and raise requirements. Other programs, such as the Joint Strike Fighter,  have requirements that outstrip resources, despite efforts to keep  requirements flexible and to treat the price of the aircraft as a requirement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To realign the mechanics of the requirements setting and program approval  processes to bring more knowledge into the process of setting  requirements, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense require that the  systems engineering needed to evaluate the sufficiency of available  resources\u2014knowledge, time, money, and capacity\u2014be conducted in time  to help identify and make the critical trade-offs that precede the  formalization of requirements. One option is to allow the award of well-defined systems engineering contracts to prospective product  developers\u2014contractors\u2014before the system development and  demonstration phase.", "To realign the incentives of the requirements setting and program approval  processes with the need to match available resources, we recommend that  the Secretary of Defense:  Reduce the pressures put on user representatives to set requirements  high to win the competition for program approval. One way to reduce  these pressures, drawing on the experiences of the Tactical Unmanned  Aerial Vehicle and Global Hawk, is to have higher level officials in the  services and DOD decide on the type of weapon system that is needed to  meet a valid need before the requirements setters begin detailed work  on framing a specific solution. Making such a decision earlier in the  process would ease the pressure on to set overly demanding and  inflexible requirements that will crush alternatives and win program  approval.", "Require, as a condition for starting the system development and  demonstration phase for a weapon system\u2014program launch\u2014that  sufficient evidence exists to show there is a match between a weapon  system\u2019s requirements and the resources the program manager has to  develop that weapon. Based on our current and past work on the best  practices of leading commercial firms, there is a key tool the Secretary  can use to define what resources DOD is willing to apply\u2014establishing  limits on the time it takes to complete system development, such as not  to exceed 5 years.

Specifically, DOD recognized that more knowledge in the setting of  requirements and the potential ability of the producer to meet those  requirements would provide a greater understanding of the time, cost, and  potential success of a program. DOD also recognized that the systems  development and demonstration phase can begin with a higher level  definition of requirements (that is, a higher level than the Operational  Requirements Document), which can be used by the requirements-setter  and the program manager, after some systems engineering work is done, to  facilitate trade-offs earlier and relieve some of the pressure on Operational  Requirements Document. Finally, DOD stated that the Acquisition Program  Baseline should require signatures from both the user and the resource  sponsor prior to program initiation signifying agreement that there is  sufficient evidence\u2014such as determined by systems engineering,  demonstration of technology maturity, and adequacy of funding\u2014that a  match between requirements and resources has been made."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
