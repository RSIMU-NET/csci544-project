GAO found that agencies often decide not to use ICASS services and self-provide support services--citing reasons of cost, programmatic needs, and greater control--which can lead to duplicative structures and a higher overall cost to the U.S. government. Although some agencies' reasons for self-providing services may be supportable, GAO found that agencies rarely made business cases for why they chose not to take ICASS services initially or withdrew from services later. In addition, service providers and customer agencies have undertaken few systematic efforts to consolidate services or contain costs by streamlining administrative support structures. Furthermore, GAO found that deterrents to consolidating and streamlining administrative structures largely outweigh the incentives. However, there are efforts, both internal and external to ICASS, that may address some of the obstacles that prevent ICASS from operating more efficiently. Based on the system's primary goals, ICASS is generally effective in providing quality administrative support services in an equitable manner, although not to the extent that it could be if certain impediments were addressed. GAO found that ICASS is simple and transparent enough for customers to understand its basic principles. Furthermore, most personnel agree that ICASS is more equitable than its predecessor. However, ICASS strategic goals lack indicators to gauge progress toward achieving them, and progress toward achieving posts' performance standards is not annually reviewed or updated. Other obstacles to maximizing ICASS include limits to overseas staffs' decision-making authority, which can diminish ICASS's goal of \"local empowerment.\" Finally, GAO found that training and information resources, which could enhance participants' knowledge and implementation of ICASS, are underutilized."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. government spent nearly $1 billion in 2003 to provide  administrative support services to more than 250 overseas posts  worldwide.

The Department of State (State) has the primary  responsibility for operating the system and employs approximately 18,000  workers to provide more than 30 basic administrative support services. A  primary purpose for developing ICASS was to achieve greater efficiencies  in the delivery of basic administrative support services to federal  employees at overseas posts. The system was also intended to ensure that  users of overseas facilities receive quality administrative support services,  that they each pay the costs associated with the amount of services they  use, and that all users have a say in determining how resources are  allocated. In light of rising budget deficits, it is important that overseas  employees receive administrative support services in the most cost- effective manner possible.", "Since ICASS was fully implemented in 1998, its performance has not been  systematically reviewed.

The Foreign Affairs Administrative Support (FAAS) system,  under which State paid fixed support costs and agencies paid the remaining  administrative support costs, was established in 1976. However, FAAS\u2019s  cost-allocation processes were opaque and customers felt that fees were  not in line with the quality of services received. During the 1980s and 1990s,  overseas posts experienced increases in staffing from nontraditional  foreign affairs agencies and demand for services.

ICASS seeks, in part, to contain or reduce  overall government costs for overseas administrative support services.  Service providers and customers are to select the most cost-effective  methods for providing services by choosing among competitive  alternatives, whether internal or external to the U.S. government.

Under ICASS, the customers and service providers at each  post are responsible for agreeing on service standards that define  quality, cost-efficient service at that post.

It also resolves issues and disputes raised by  Washington-based or overseas ICASS groups. The Assistant Secretary of  State for Administration permanently chairs the Executive Board, and  members generally include assistant secretary-level officers from  participating agencies. The interagency ICASS Working Group, which is  open to all agencies represented on ICASS Councils at overseas posts, is a  staff arm of the Executive Board responsible for presenting policy issues to  the board, making policy decisions when delegated to do so by the board,  resolving issues raised by posts, and reviewing and approving nonpost  costs and factors. The ICASS Service Center, an interagency-staffed office  organizationally located in State\u2019s Bureau of Resource Management, is  primarily responsible for overseeing worldwide ICASS operations,  including providing support to embassies and consulates on training,  financial, and budgetary matters and general guidance on implementing  ICASS. The Service Center also provides support to the Working Group and  the Executive Board in developing new policy, but the center has no policy- making authority of its own.", "Although general ICASS policy is set in Washington, overseas diplomatic  posts are responsible for decisions on implementing the system. At the  core of operational decision making is the post\u2019s ICASS Council. This is an  interagency body consisting of representatives from each of the agencies at  the post that receive ICASS services. Representatives to the ICASS Council  must be direct-hire U.S. citizen employees and are usually the local head of  the agency they represent. A Council Chair elected by the representatives  for a 1-year term heads the group. ICASS Councils are charged with  developing all local policies on what services will be available at the post;  how those services will be delivered; whether State, another agency, or a  contractor will provide the services; and how fees are established and  customers charged. The councils are also responsible for developing ICASS  performance standards for all services provided at their respective posts;  for annually reviewing service providers\u2019 performance and customer  satisfaction; and for updating standards, as needed. Although consensus  building is the preferred mode for decision making, voting is allowed on a  one funding-code, one-vote basis. However, agencies that are not  subscribed to a specific ICASS service may not vote on decisions that affect  that service.", "Although they are chiefly tasked with overseeing ICASS operations and  service delivery, the Deputy Chief of Mission and service provider  representatives also participate as ex-officio council members.

From the  very beginning of the program, agencies frequently chose not to take some  ICASS services available to them. In fiscal year 1998, the average rate of  non-State agencies\u2019 participation in available cost centers ranged from  about 31 percent to about 87 percent (see app. III). Decisions to not take  ICASS services at the program\u2019s onset may represent missed opportunities  to achieve economies of scale. When an agency opts out of a service it  needs, it often must provide that service either by creating new positions at  the post or securing the service from the local market. This results in a  duplication of services\u2014a situation where an agency creates an  administrative structure similar to, but apart from, what it could receive  under ICASS. There are often defensible reasons for an agency to develop  such a structure, such as demonstrated program needs or logistical  constraints. Less supportable duplication, however, exists when agencies  self-provide services without any apparent demonstrated need.", "The State Inspector General reported in 2000 that although self-provision  rather than subscribing to an ICASS service may save individual agencies  money, it can also result in increased costs for agencies that continue  taking the ICASS service, as well as for the U.S. government overall.   Officials in Washington and at posts said that adjustments to a post\u2019s ICASS  personnel are generally not made to compensate for the reduced ICASS  workload that occurs when agencies opt out of a cost center. As a result,  the ICASS costs associated with that cost center remain the same and must  be distributed among a smaller population of subscribers. In addition,  overall costs rise due to the new costs associated with the agency\u2019s self- provision of the service. For example, USAID in Dakar recently identified a  need to obtain vehicle maintenance services outside the ICASS structure  because the location of its new offices in relation to the ICASS vehicle  maintenance facility prevented USAID from getting convenient, timely  service. As a result, USAID developed and implemented a business plan to  contract with a local service station near its offices, which USAID officials  expected would reduce their fixed costs for this service from about $21,200  under ICASS in 2003 to about $7,400 in 2004 (see fig. 2).  However,  although USAID notified the post ICASS Council of its intention to  withdraw from the ICASS service, the reason for its doing so, and its  general plan to contract with a local vendor for its vehicle maintenance  needs, the agency did not provide details on how it would receive the  needed services, nor did the council request that information or discuss  whether USAID\u2019s new approach could be adopted postwide. Moreover,  despite a reduction in the workload associated with 13 USAID vehicles,  there was no change in the composition of ICASS staff responsible for  vehicle maintenance after USAID withdrew from the service. Thus, the  approximately $21,200 for labor and ICASS redistribution charges formerly  associated with USAID\u2019s bill would be distributed among agencies that  retain their service subscriptions. In addition, labor costs associated with  USAID\u2019s newly self-provided service represent increased overall  government spending because the agency now pays additional people (i.e.,  the local vendor) to provide a service it could otherwise receive from  existing embassy employees. Thus, total government costs for vehicle  maintenance in Dakar would rise by about $7,400."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Cite Cost, Unique Program Circumstances, Greater Control, and Lack of Need as Reasons for Self- Providing Services", "paragraphs": ["Agency officials in Washington and the field said the most common reasons  for not subscribing to a service are the cost of the service, agencies\u2019 unique  programmatic circumstances, agencies\u2019 desire to have greater control over  services, and a lack of need for some services.", "Agencies cited two cost-related reasons to seek administrative support  outside of ICASS. First, many agencies said that ICASS services are too  expensive, in part due to the high labor costs associated with U.S.  government employees hired to work overseas, and reported that they  could self-provide the same services for less money by hiring local labor.  Under ICASS, customers pay the salaries and benefits for both Foreign  Service officers and foreign nationals who provide administrative support  services. Figure 3 shows that in 2000, labor costs comprised over 60  percent of total ICASS costs. American direct-hire employees comprise  roughly 5 percent of ICASS employees but represent 30 percent of the total  labor costs. State estimates the average annual cost of maintaining a  Foreign Service officer at an overseas post to be about $346,000 per year.", "Second, agency officials reported that ICASS cost increases have forced  them to place greater emphasis on finding savings, including examining the  need to continue subscribing to some ICASS services. Total ICASS costs  rose 29.4 percent between 2001 and 2003, from $758 million to $981 million,  as a result of new security requirements following the terrorist attacks of  September 11, 2001; State\u2019s increased hiring of American personnel; new  services to be provided; and adjustments to the exchange rate, among other  reasons (see fig. 4). As a result, agencies have chosen to subscribe to fewer  ICASS services than in previous years (see app. III). Of the 23 agencies  located at 10 or more posts in both 2001 and 2003, 21 had lower  participation rates in 2003 than in 2001. Participation rate reductions  ranged from 1.4 to 6.6 percentage points. In addition, 18 of the 23 agencies  paying ICASS fees at 10 or more posts in both 1998 and 2003 had  participation rates that were lower in 2003 than in 1998, ranging from 0.7 to  14.1 percentage points. Because of rising costs and budgetary constraints,  the U.S. Commercial Service reduced its average subscription rate for all  services available at all posts at which it has a presence from 83.8 percent  in 2000, one of the highest rates for any agency, to 74.8 percent in 2003.", "Agencies also cited unique programmatic circumstances associated with  overseas programs that require them to self-provide services. For example,  Peace Corps officials in Dakar stated that the remote location of Peace  Corps volunteers throughout Senegal, combined with the need for staff in  Dakar to make routine visits to these remote locations, requires that the  office own, operate, and maintain a vehicle fleet separate from the ICASS  vehicle service. Similarly, a U.S. federal law enforcement officer in Vienna  said that all of his agency\u2019s overseas officers are authorized to maintain a  government-owned vehicle because they need immediate access to  transportation on a 24-hour basis. In addition, because USAID\u2019s offices in  Egypt and Senegal are in locations outside the respective main U.S.  embassies, these offices employ staff to provide administrative support  services, such as nonresidential building operations.", "Agencies also cited control as a factor for self-providing services. Some  customer agency officials perceived an implicit service delivery bias  toward State employees, saying State employees\u2019 needs are placed ahead of  others. Although we discovered no evidence\u2014hard or circumstantial\u2014 supporting this contention, agencies throughout the eight posts we  examined stated that they maintained their own vehicle fleets so they  would have immediate transportation access. In addition, unless an  ambassador requires all agencies at a post to participate in the furniture  pool, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) provides furniture for  its American workers outside of ICASS. Officials in Washington said this is  because DEA felt there was an implicit bias toward State personnel, both in  terms of priority of distribution and furniture quality. Supplying its  employees with furniture gave DEA greater control over both these aspects  and better met its employees\u2019 needs, according to the agency.", "Finally, some agencies choose to opt out of a service because they do not  actually need the service at post. For example, the Foreign Agricultural  Service processes payroll and travel services in the United States for  American employees overseas, and the Department of Defense has no need  to subscribe to personnel services for local staff in posts where it does not  employ foreign service nationals. In addition, some agencies occupy offices  provided by host country ministries and thus have no need for services  such as nonresidential maintenance or local guard services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fieldwork Revealed Numerous Redundant Structures", "paragraphs": ["Despite the reasons agencies cited for self-providing support services, in  our fieldwork, we found numerous cases of duplicative administrative  structures that seemed to be unnecessarily redundant. For example, State  and USAID operate two separate warehouses on adjacent properties in  Cairo, separated by a concrete wall (see fig. 5). Staff from both agencies  said the two warehouses could be run more efficiently if they were  consolidated, and staff from both agencies said they could take on the  work of the other. In Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, USAID and State provide  redundant services in 14 ICASS cost centers despite occupying buildings 30  feet apart on the newly built embassy compound. According to post  officials, these redundant support structures include shipping and customs,  cashiering, human resources, home fuel and water delivery, janitorial  services, warehousing, housing/leasing services, motor vehicle operations  and maintenance, procurement, travel services, budgeting and financial  planning, contracting, and housing maintenance. Furthermore, according  to the 2003 ICASS Global Database, USAID was not billed for information  management services, International Voice Gateway access, payrolling, and  personnel services for American and foreign national employees.

Although some  agencies\u2019 reasons for self-providing services outside the system may be  supportable, we found that their decisions to do so are generally made  without a disciplined business case based on analyses of alternatives,  including how the alternatives affect the individual agency, other agencies  at post, and overall government costs.

Issues to be discussed in the  notification include the reasons for withdrawing, where and how the  agency will obtain the service, whether the council should consider the  alternate service source for all member agencies, and any potential cost  savings.

In interviews at our case study  posts, ICASS Council members said that agencies informed the ICASS  Council before ending subscription to an ICASS service, as required, but  frequently did not present information beyond the requirements.  Furthermore, ICASS Councils at the posts we visited did not seek  information on whether agencies\u2019 service arrangements outside of ICASS  could be adapted for use by the rest of the ICASS customers at post.

The size and cost of building an NEC is directly  related to the number of staff set to occupy it and the type of work they will  perform. According to State, per capita building costs average about  $209,000 per office for space for top embassy management, $59,300 per  office in controlled access (or classified) space, $28,100 per office in  noncontrolled access (or nonclassified) space, and $4,900 per person for  nonoffice space.", "In 1999, a law was passed requiring that all U.S. agencies working at posts  slated for new construction be located on the new site unless they are  granted a special waiver.

Faced with budget  constraints and rising ICASS costs, agencies have been forced to discover  ways to reduce spending. In some cases, agencies\u2019 first choice has been to  opt out of ICASS services, either on orders from their respective  Washington headquarters or because of decisions made locally. For  example, to save money, the U.S. Commercial Service in Vienna has  withdrawn from numerous cost centers since 1998, including those for  budgeting and fiscal (1998), information technology support (1999),  administrative supply and vehicle maintenance (2001), International Voice  Gateway telecommunications (2002), and American personnel services  (2003). In other cases, agencies do try to work under the ICASS rubric; but  because they cannot fully engage in resource management, they become  frustrated and consider opting out. For example, in Dakar, USAID has  proposed pilot testing a new method for delivering residential maintenance  services, but it has been unsuccessful in gaining approval to conduct the  pilot test. Although USAID has not yet made a decision to withdraw from  that cost center, officials in Dakar expressed frustration over the high costs  associated with residential maintenance and indicated that withdrawal  from the service could be an option.", "In addition to agencies\u2019 self-interests, personal interests of post personnel  sometimes hinder reform efforts, particularly those related to streamlining  processes. At Embassy Bern, post management reported suggesting that  the American staff get local bank accounts and/or automatic teller cards,  which they said would have the dual effect of reducing costs associated  with check cashing\u2014$17 per check in Bern\u2014and allowing the current  cashier to be trained for work in other services that are understaffed. Post  officials stated, however, that customers resisted changing the service  because it would require them to leave the embassy to cash a check. As a  result, the post missed chances to reduce ICASS costs and improve service  quality by cross-training staff.", "ICASS requires that post councils and service providers work together to  choose the most cost-effective method for delivering services. This  requirement was designed to ensure selection of the best methods for  delivering services by examining all available competitive alternatives,  including those developed or adopted by customers who self-provide  services they could otherwise obtain through ICASS. In theory, this  requirement would lead to the most efficient delivery of ICASS services  because it would be in the interest of both customers and service providers  to discover the least expensive method for delivering services at the levels  needed by the post. However, as previously noted, post ICASS Councils  have not systematically considered the service options available to them.  Some post officials reported that program requirements demand too much  of their time to conduct analyses showing how the embassy as a whole  would benefit from new approaches to service delivery.

However, the system has not achieved  that goal because it has not led posts to eliminate unnecessary duplication  or to reengineer the processes by which they deliver administrative support  services. Although there are many supportable reasons for an agency to  self-provide services, we saw many instances where decisions to do so did  not appear to be based on valid business cases or other factors that led to  clearly demonstrated benefits. We also saw few instances of posts  systematically reviewing service delivery or searching for alternatives that  could make service delivery less costly, such as contracting for services  with local vendors, placing greater reliance on regionally supplied services,  making better use of technology, and systematically considering \u201cbest  practices\u201d developed and implemented by others. Consolidation and  streamlining did not occur because implementing innovative reforms  required great personal effort to effect a change in the status quo.

In addition, we conducted data analyses using data  from the ICASS Global Database, which was developed and maintained by  the ICASS Service Center and contains information for each ICASS cost  center at each overseas post on service subscription, workloads, billing,  service withdrawal, and other information necessary for operating the  system. To assess the reliability of the ICASS data, we (1) performed  electronic testing for errors in accuracy and completeness, (2) discussed  data reliability issues with agency officials knowledgeable about the data,  and (3) reviewed relevant reports from the State Office of Inspector  General and GAO and financial audits of the ICASS system.

The unit costs are based on  the salaries and benefits of service providers\u2019 employees, who include  both the staff actually delivering or providing the services as well as the  direct-hire American managers overseeing the services;  the furniture, equipment, and operating expenses necessary for  delivering the services; and   the total number of people serviced or the amount of service provided  by the employees associated with specific cost centers.", "Overall, ICASS is implemented in one of two manners. An ICASS Standard  post breaks the services into 32 cost centers, while an ICASS Lite post  consolidates the number of cost centers into 16 groups (see table 2).  Generally speaking, ICASS Lite tends to be used at small posts because the  management burden is lower than at Standard posts. ICASS Standard,  however, allows for greater flexibility to customers in choosing which  services they will take and avoiding paying for services they do not receive.  Agencies are required to subscribe to two cost centers\u2014the Basic Package  and the Community Liaison Office (CLO). The Basic Package cost center  provides services by State that agencies would benefit from, whether or not  they choose to use the services. Included in the Basic Package are  diplomatic accreditation to the host government;  licenses and special permits;  maintenance of the Emergency Evacuation Plan;  reciprocity issues with the host government on items such as car  imports, spousal employment, and reimbursement for value-added  taxes;  identification cards, accounts receivable and payable, and other check- in/check-out procedures;  welcoming kits for newly posted or temporary duty employees;  maintenance of post reports;  determination of exchange rates;  International School accreditation surveys, grant management, and  Suspense Deposit Abroad accounting and voucher processing;  support for employee recreation centers and commissary boards; and  support structures for visits by Very Important Persons.", "These items should be considered standard services at all posts, but  individual posts may add to the list. The CLO provides services to help  integrate employees and their dependents into the surrounding community.  For example, the CLO provides welcoming materials, assists family  members with employment and educational opportunities, and organizes  cultural activities, among many other services.", "The overhead cost center is designed to reflect costs that are not easily  confined to another cost center but are essential administrative activities.  Examples of overhead costs include ICASS awards, post office box rentals,  and postage. Overhead costs are distributed on the basis of each agency\u2019s  percentage of net cost of all services it receives in the remaining cost  centers.", "There are also other costs that agencies must pay for that are not  considered cost centers, per se. For example, ICASS personnel are both  service providers and service customers. As such, the ICASS \u201coffice\u201d is  treated as any other customer or entity at post in terms of generating costs  for the services it consumes. However, this \u201coffice\u201d is not billed because the  services it consumes are done so in the course of providing services to the  other customers. For example, when a vehicle mechanic drives an ICASS  motor pool vehicle to a parts supplier, he generates costs in the direct  vehicle operations cost center. These costs, which include overhead, are  distributed among customers on the basis of the proportion of total costs of  services and overhead that each agency generates in a given cost center. In  addition, costs associated with operations of the ICASS Service Center are  distributed to agencies\u2019 headquarters for general support given to posts  worldwide, or to specific posts for services that are uniquely provided to  them (e.g., post-dedicated ICASS training)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Participation in ICASS", "paragraphs": ["Table 3 shows the number of posts and ICASS participation rates for  agencies with direct-hire staff assigned to 10 or more posts in any year from  1998 through 2003.

As a result, our analysis simply states the average rate at  which agencies subscribe to available cost centers.", "However, we were able to control for cases in which agencies are located  in facilities outside of State-owned or State-leased facilities. Examples  could include instances when agencies own office facilities, as with some  USAID and Peace Corps offices, and when agency personnel are located at  host country ministries, among others. Agency personnel reported that in  such cases, they neither have the need for some ICASS services, nor would  the embassy provide these services.

We have modified our report to cite these legislative authorities. 2. We disagree with State\u2019s assertion that ICASS goals do not include the  containment or reduction of overall governmental costs. The Foreign  Affairs Handbook clearly states that posts form interagency ICASS  councils \u201cto eliminate waste, inefficiency and redundancy\u201d  (6 FAH-5 H-102.1), and that \u201cICASS provides the tools and incentives to  achieve significant reductions in support costs under the concept of a  U.S. Government that \u2018works better and costs less\u2019\u201d (6 FAH-5 H-103.2).  The handbook also states that \u201call mission agencies participate in the  management and delivery of services, as well as achievement of  economies of scale and elimination of costly duplication\u201d  (6 FAH-5 H-103.1 (a)), and that \u201cCouncils should not be reluctant to  challenge regulations which inhibit streamlining and cost reduction\u201d  (6 FAH-5 H-103.1 (b)). The handbook further states that \u201cthe Council  and providers together share the responsibility and accountability for  achieving the most cost efficient and streamlined quality administrative  services at post\u201d (6 FAH-5, H-307.1).", "The principle of voluntary service subscription serves multiple  purposes, including ensuring that agencies receive and pay for only the  services they need and providing flexibility for agencies when they  need services they cannot conveniently receive through ICASS, among  others. In addition, the principle was designed as the mechanism  whereby agencies could use market forces to reduce ICASS costs and  improve services. Customers\u2019 ability to opt out of services would  provide the incentive for customers and providers alike to cooperate in  discovering the most cost-effective means for service delivery.  Moreover, competitive alternatives that are advantageous to all  agencies at a post were to be shared by the agency that discovered the  alternatives and reviewed by the ICASS Council and service providers  for their potential adoption postwide. The handbook states, \u201cRather  than simply withdrawing from an ICASS service to take advantage of  better or cheaper services, agencies should bring the alternative to the  attention of the full Council for consideration by all agencies. Factors  such as the effect on career staffs or economies of scale can then be  considered mission-wide\u201d (6 FAH-5 H-307.6 (a)). 3. We said the system is simple enough that most customers understood  the basic structures and tenants of ICASS. We believe that if overseas  staff receive training appropriate to their role in ICASS, the current  system is simple enough for them to operate. We feel the complexity of  the system is appropriate for balancing the somewhat contradicting  principles of cost, equity, and simplicity. A less complex system may be  less costly to operate, but may also be less equitable because customers  may pay for services they don\u2019t actually use. A system more closely  resembling cost accounting would be more equitable in the sense that  customers pay only for the services they actually use, but it would also  be more costly because it would require higher workload burdens and  more specialized skills for the employees that operate the system.", "Our discussion of the new temporary duty personnel policy makes no  assertion why so few posts have chosen to adopt it. As of August 2004,  three of our eight case study posts have adopted the new policy,  including Embassies Cairo, Dar es Salaam, and Lima. Those that have  not adopted the policy stated that the number of long-term temporary  duty personnel they receive are so few that they do not create a burden. 4. On March 28, 2003, USAID notified the Dakar ICASS Council that  effective October 1, 2003, USAID would no longer receive vehicle  maintenance services. During our fieldwork in Dakar in December  2003, post officials stated they were unaware whether a reassessment  of staffing needs related to changing workload requirements had been  conducted. In July 2004, a post official confirmed the other post  officials\u2019 earlier statements that no reassessment of staffing needs was  made at the time USAID notified the council of its intention to  withdraw, although one vehicle mechanic was temporarily reassigned  to service generators to fill an immediate need in facilities  maintenance. The official also confirmed that USAID has not yet  disclosed to the council the savings it expected to achieve or has  actually realized under its outsourcing arrangement. The official did  confirm that 10 vehicles have been added to the vehicle maintenance  service, but he did not know when those vehicles were added in  relation to USAID\u2019s withdrawal. We believe that the addition of these 10  vehicles, whenever they were added, does not detract from our  argument that overall government costs rose as a result of (1) the  failure to reassess how changing workload requirements affected  staffing needs at the time USAID announced it would withdraw from  the service and (2) the failure by all at post to assess whether USAID\u2019s  competitive alternative could result in reduced costs for all agencies at  post. 5. We do not blame State for ICASS cost increases from 2001-2003.", "According to data and officials from the ICASS Service Center, there  are three primary reasons why costs increased between 2001 and 2003:  State\u2019s hiring under the Diplomatic Readiness Initiative, infrastructural  improvements, and wage and price increases. Under ICASS, salaries  and benefits for State officers who administer ICASS at overseas posts,  such as those in the General Services Offices, are shared among  multiple agencies.", "When services are added to ICASS, the participants in these services  share the associated costs. State is correct that there have been some  services added to ICASS for which State had previously paid, including  $20 million annually for mail pouching services and $15 million for  computer system and cabling upgrades. Adding these services to ICASS  resulted in increased cost to non-State agencies, although not  necessarily to the government as a whole. However, we did not intend  to imply these services were added without the consent of agencies on  the ICASS Executive Board. 6. We believe that there may be other legitimate reasons for not enrolling  in ICASS services, including logistical considerations (i.e., an agency\u2019s  proximity to the service provider); whether an agency\u2019s headquarters  provides the service; or whether the agency even needs the service,  among others. We generally support the voluntary nature of ICASS but  believe that detailed, objective analyses are needed to assess whether  an agency should obtain services from ICASS. 7. Although customers at posts we visited indicated they were generally  satisfied with the overall quality of ICASS services, they were not  satisfied with the cost. Comments on a draft of this report from many  non-State agencies demonstrate that they are not satisfied with the  costs of ICASS services. (See apps. VI-XIII.) 8. We believe that the Foreign Affairs Handbook grants ICASS Councils  more authority over ICASS resources than simply approving annual  ICASS budgets. The handbook states the following: \u201cCustomer agencies, as stakeholders with a greater voice in the  management of shared administrative services, are empowered to  collectively seek innovative ways to reduce costs and improve services.  To these ends, the Council may streamline administrative processes or  reshape the administrative workforce. Decisions might include  downsizing, delayering and flattening of the staff organization; use of  qualified local hire specialists in lieu of higher cost U.S. based staff; and  alternative agency or contract service providers. The Councils may also  consider use of the services of U.S. Embassies and Agencies in other  countries where costs are lower\u201d (6 FAH-5 H-307.2 (a)).", "The handbook further states these decisions should be made in close  consultation with service providers \u201cin light of management or cost  studies developed by or at the request of the Council\u201d and \u201cto facilitate  this process, the service provider will be expected to provide the  Council financial breakdowns, staffing patterns, and operational  studies as requested\u201d  (6 FAH-5 H-307.2 (b)). We believe these clauses  provide customer agencies with the authority to review how ICASS  services are delivered, including whether services are provided in- house or from an external source, and the number and type of embassy  staff needed. However, the handbook also states councils \u201cshould avoid  micromanagement of the service provider activities\u201d because the  councils are not intended to serve as supervisors of \u201cthe administrative  service provider in the day-to-day details of operations\u201d  (6 FAH-5 H-307.3 (b)). A State official with the ICASS Service Center  said micromanagement of service provider personnel is strongly  discouraged, and that councils generally can affect instances only when  new positions are being added. That is, examinations of how and by  whom services are provided are considered micromanagement on the  part of the council, and are discouraged, as we demonstrated with the  USAID Dakar proposal to pilot test a new method for providing  residential maintenance. Thus, based on the handbook, State  administrative officers\u2019 management practices, and illustrations such as  the one previously mentioned, we concluded that ICASS councils have  little ability to fully manage ICASS resources. 9. We agree with the principles behind the working capital fund and  would encourage posts to make greater use of it. Our purpose was only  to report the perceptions among post personnel that they would lose  funding in the long run if they made frequent use of the fund. We did not  conduct analyses to determine whether that belief was based on  verifiable evidence. 10. We modified the report text, where appropriate, to incorporate this  additional information and suggested wording. 11. We made no comments on the merits of moving to a unified housing  and furniture pool. We did not intend to criticize or challenge the  ambassador\u2019s authority as the Chief of Mission or as the President\u2019s  representative. We have revised the section to clarify that we are not  expressing an opinion on Chief of Mission authority; rather, we are  saying that differing authorities can overrule ICASS decisions and that  both customers and providers at posts reported that these instances  can negatively affect the morale of some ICASS participants. 12. We agree that centralization of certain functions is necessary to instill  order on the system. Our intended point is that some providers and  customers perceive centralization as limiting post flexibility, and, as  such, some post officials question the degree by which they are truly  empowered to operate the system in the best manner for the post."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments from the U.S. Agency for International Development", "paragraphs": ["The following is GAO\u2019s comment on the U.S. Agency for International  Development\u2019s letter dated June 28, 2004.

Moreover, when an agency opts out and ICASS does not take  action to adjust costs, such as reducing support staff to reflect the  reduced workload, the operation becomes less efficient and more  costly to the remaining users. 3.

We did not intend to blame duplication on agencies that have  withdrawn from ICASS services. We presented the Dakar vehicle  maintenance example to illustrate how decisions by one agency can  affect all agencies at post. We faulted USAID neither for the reason nor  for the action of opting out of the service. We did note, however, that  USAID did not share detailed information (i.e., its business plan) on the  new means by which they would receive the service. We also noted that  neither the council nor the service provider requested that USAID share  this information. As a result, the Dakar ICASS Council missed an  opportunity to review whether the post could adopt the USAID  approach to the betterment of all agencies. We recommended that  business cases be made not only to help agencies determine whether an  alternative arrangement is better for themselves, but also to help local  ICASS Councils determine whether more cost-effective service  arrangements could be applied postwide. 3.

It is for this reason we conclude and recommend that  agencies should work to reduce unnecessary duplication of  administrative structures. 4. Our determination that ICASS customers are generally satisfied with  the quality of services they receive was based on a global survey, local  customer satisfaction surveys at our case study posts, and more than  100 interviews with ICASS customer and service provider personnel at  those posts. We do cite service cost as the main complaint with the  system. 5. We believe implementing our recommendations could result in a more  streamlined, cost-effective means for delivering necessary  administrative support services. We did not conduct an assessment of  the benefits and costs of creating an independent agency responsible  for delivering overseas administrative support services."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Department of Defense\u2019s letter  dated July 2, 2004."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1. We did not intend to underemphasize cost control, and we modified the  report to add more emphasis to the importance of cost containment.  We stated that labor is the largest ICASS cost and that agencies cite  high labor costs associated with American direct-hire ICASS personnel  as a reason for self-providing services. Our recommendation to  increase the system\u2019s accountability by streamlining operations is  designed to encourage cost control and service provider rightsizing.  2. The Foreign Affairs Handbook requires ICASS Councils to (1) monitor  service performance and costs, concentrating on overall performance  against standards and (2) prepare an annual written assessment on the  quality and responsiveness of the services furnished by the service  provider based upon the agreed-upon performance standards  (6 FAH-5 H-301.4 (f) and (g)). We believe that councils that do not  evaluate their service providers miss important opportunities to  measure service provider performance and to address items that could  make service delivery more cost-effective. 3. We modified the text to clarify that many agencies decided not to  subscribe to some ICASS services. 4. We support Chief of Mission authority at post and did not mean to  imply that ICASS is outside of that authority. Our main point was that  ICASS authorities sometimes become subordinate to other authorities,  and we modified the text of the report to more clearly reflect this  observation. 5. We did not mean to imply that all ICASS decisions and policies should  be made or be negotiable at the post level. We intended to highlight  some ICASS customers\u2019 concern that ICASS lacks flexibility to adapt to  meet unique local needs, thus limiting the local council\u2019s ability to make  decisions that optimize service provision at post. 6. We agree with the department that individual posts have the authority  to determine whether they wish to implement the new policy for long- term temporary duty personnel. Our discussion of the new temporary  duty personnel policy makes no assertion as to why few posts have  chosen to adopt it. Three of our eight case study posts have adopted the  new policy (Embassies Cairo, Dar es Salaam, and Lima). Officials at  those posts that have not adopted the policy stated that temporary duty  personnel do not result in an undue burden on their respective posts. 7. We agree that there may be legitimate reasons for agencies to opt out of  ICASS services, and we reflect this throughout the report. 8. Several department field staff stated that they either had not had ICASS  training before arriving overseas or that training in their ICASS roles  and responsibilities was not sufficient."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Department of Homeland  Security\u2019s letter dated June 29, 2004."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1. We generally support the voluntary nature of the ICASS program  because agencies\u2019 needs differ. Therefore, we did not intend to suggest  that agencies should be forced to use ICASS services. However, we  believe that there are opportunities to achieve more economies of  scale, and that there are instances of unnecessary and wasteful  duplication. Our recommendations are designed to reduce duplication  where this would be in the best interests of the government and to  encourage agencies to prepare business cases to support decisions to  obtain services outside of ICASS.   2. We agree that ICASS operations at some posts are more transparent  than at others, but we did not find evidence that services were being  managed to the benefit and priorities of State and the detriment of  other agencies at the posts we visited. However, we believe that our  recommendations regarding system accountability and training should  help address this concern. 3. The salary and benefit costs of State employees who provide support  services to all agencies are shared by all agencies that receive the  services. For example, costs to employ a foreign national driver are  charged to the agencies that receive services from the driver, while  costs to employ an American Financial Management Officer are divided  among the agencies that make use of financial services the manager  provides. We support this practice largely because it is consistent with  the overall rightsizing concept of agencies paying the full cost  associated with their overseas presence. 4. Agencies can choose whether to participate in an ICASS service. If an  agency does not participate and, therefore, does not pay for a service,  that agency should not receive the service. Otherwise, the agencies that  have chosen to participate in the service would effectively be  subsidizing the cost of providing the service to the agency that did not  participate but still wanted the service. There are ICASS provisions for  cases where an agency that wishes may receive partial services for a  reduced cost, as well as methods for an agency to make direct  payments for use of a service that benefits that particular agency.", "5.

Our report focuses on the delivery and costs of support services, and  we do not examine in detail the annual ICASS budget process.   Nonetheless, several agencies reported that this process is problematic  because it requires that agencies predict costs and request funding well  before they know what their actual costs are likely to be, and agencies  have little flexibility in paying for cost increases resulting from  unforeseen events that occur subsequent to their funding requests.  Although we do not address this issue on our report, we believe it is  something the ICASS Executive Board could consider when  implementing our recommendations. 3. We agree that agencies should be notified in advance of changes in  policy and staffing that would affect their contributions. However,  implementation of the proposed Capital Security Cost-Sharing Program  would be separate from ICASS, and therefore we made no assessment  of its merits or governance structures.

We faulted  USAID neither for the reason nor for the action of opting out of the  service. We did note, however, that USAID did not share detailed  information (i.e., its business plan) on the new means by which they  would receive the service. We also noted that neither the council nor  the service provider requested that USAID share this information. As a  result, the Dakar ICASS Council missed an opportunity to review  whether the post could adopt the USAID approach to the betterment of  all agencies. We recommended that business cases be made not only to  help agencies determine whether an alternative arrangement is better  for themselves, but also to help local ICASS Councils determine  whether more cost-effective service arrangements could be applied  postwide. 2.
