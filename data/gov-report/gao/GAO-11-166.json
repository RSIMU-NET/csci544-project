The Recovery Act provided $2.1 billion for Head Start and Early Head Start, primarily to expand services. GAO addressed four questions: (1) How have Head Start and Early Head Start grantees used Recovery Act funds, including for expanding enrollment? (2) What challenges have grantees encountered in spending Recovery Act funds? (3) How has the Office of Head Start (OHS) monitored the use of Recovery Act funds? (4) How has the quality of jobs data reported by Recovery Act recipients, particularly Head Start grantees, changed over time? In this report, GAO also updates the status of open recommendations from previous bimonthly and recipient reporting reviews. To address these questions, GAO interviewed grantees, analyzed federal agency and recipient reported data, and interviewed officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Grantees reported using Recovery Act funds to expand enrollment and staff in a variety of ways, but new enrollment was lower than anticipated and reported enrollment numbers may not always be reliable. Grantees received funds to increase enrollment from about 890,100 to an additional 60,600; reported enrollment increased by 55,100 by the end of September 2010. Grantees GAO interviewed used different definitions of \"enrollment,\" which OHS does not verify, introducing some unreliability in reporting. Grantees nationwide reported adding significant numbers of staff, but the portion of teachers who met recently increased standards slightly declined. Grantees experienced challenges in spending first-year Recovery Act funds, including delays in receiving grants and preparing facilities for expanded services, and received mixed messages about what to do with unobligated funds. By the end of the first year of Recovery Act funding, expansion grantees had expended at least 60 percent of their awards. Also, more than half of the grantees GAO interviewed said they were unclear about the policy regarding unobligated first-year funds. Because OHS did not clearly communicate its policy to regional offices, grantees adopted varied spending practices that may not always have directed expansion funds toward programs' highest, current priorities. OHS has engaged a contractor to conduct the large volume of monitoring visits required 1 year after expanded operations begin, but has not always incorporated some risk indicators in planning reviews. OHS has also been conducting other monitoring efforts, including mandatory 1-year visits for Early Head Start expansion grantees. These 1-year reviews include additional coverage of grantee governance and financial management. In response to prior GAO findings of fraudulent enrollment and attendance and enrollment discrepancies among some Head Start grantees, all monitoring visits to new grantees will be implemented as \"surprise\" visits. A few grantees awarded expansion funds had been earlier identified as high risk by their regional offices, and the HHS Inspector General identified several financial management deficiencies among four of the expansion grantees it reviewed. However, information on identified risks was not always available to OHS reviewers. OHS plans to scope and staff its 1-year reviews of Recovery Act grantees based primarily on their prior experience with Head Start and Early Head Start and whether the grantees have recently received a triennial review. GAO's analysis of the data reported by recipients in Recovery.gov, including jobs funded, shows results similar to previous reporting periods. For example, GAO continued to see a small number of reports for which data issues could prevent linking related reports across quarters. Analysis of Head Start recipient data showed that an earlier concern with calculating full-time equivalent jobs is being addressed. Further, in response to September 2010 Office of Management and Budget guidance on transparency of narrative descriptions, OHS reported that additional agency reviews resulted in recipients clarifying their reports."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends OHS verify the definition of enrollment, clearly communicate it to grantees along with policies for extending the use of Recovery Act funds, and incorporate known risks into review planning.

These funds have  been used to support and preserve services in a wide range of areas  including health, education, transportation, and child development. In  particular, the Recovery Act provided $2.1 billion for Head Start and Early  Head Start, primarily to expand the program from about 890,100 to about  an additional 60,600 children and families.

OHS officials explained that several  factors slowed the process of making Early Head Start awards, such as the  high volume of applications. The prolonged award-making process  contributed to a low drawdown (expenditure) rate. It also put pressure on  grantees because OHS shortened the period designated for start-up in  some cases.", "Like typical Head Start and Early Head Start grants, expansion grantees  receive funding 1 year at a time partly to ensure that grantees expend  funds prudently.

Obligated funds must be expended within 90 days of the close of the  budget period. For Recovery Act grants, this means that grantees generally  have until December 29, 2010, to expend funds obligated before  September 29, 2010.", "Second, to use unobligated funds in a future budget period, grantees must  receive approval from an OHS regional office to \u201ccarry over\u201d unobligated  funds.

Under the home-based program option, children and  families receive visits from Early Head Start staff in their homes, and meet  periodically for socialization activities.

Table 2 shows the growth in selected program  features from 2009, before the awarding of Recovery Act funds, through  August 2010, after the funds were awarded. For example, grantees  reported adding 15,571 full- or part-time staff, including classroom  teachers and home-based visitors.

The number of FTEs being lower than the  number of total staff grantees reported adding (see table 2) may be due to  several factors, such as some of the newly hired staff working part-time,  which counts for one staff position but only for a fraction of an FTE;  differences in the reporting periods covered; and the fact that some  grantees reporting staffing levels did not receive Recovery Act expansion  grants.

In contrast to expansion  grantees, grantees nationwide drew down at least 86 percent of Recovery  Act cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) and quality improvement (QI) funds  by the beginning of November. For expansion grantees, drawdown rates  among individual grantees varied considerably. About 14 percent of  grantees had drawn down 50 percent or less of their expansion awards,  while 62 percent of grantees had drawn down more than 75 percent of  their awards by the beginning of November. Grantees have until December  29, 2010, to expend all obligated funds for the first budget year of the  grant.

Instead, central office officials referred to reports  that would be submitted by grantees or knowledge of specific grantees  among regional office staff. Current and historical drawdown information  are kept by a different office within HHS and are not routinely aggregated  or reported to OHS, even though current data are accessible.", "Grantee expenditure patterns generally reflected when they had received  awards. Head Start grantees drew down more total first-year award funds  by the beginning of November 2010 (at least 82 percent) than Early Head  Start grantees (at least 70 percent), who received awards later. Further,  Early Head Start grantees that received expansion awards earlier drew  down more first-year award funds than those that received later Early  Head Start awards. Early Head Start grantees that received awards in  November 2009 averaged a drawdown rate of at least 83 percent, while  those who received awards in February 2010 averaged a drawdown rate of  at least 70 percent.", "Different types of grantees drew down funds at different rates, as shown in  table 4. Some of the Early Head Start expansion funds went to programs  that serve two specific populations: American Indian and Alaska Native  programs enrolling children and families from federally recognized tribes  or native Alaskan children and families, and Migrant and Seasonal Head  Start programs enrolling children of migrant farm workers. Drawdown for  grantees serving American Indian and Alaska Native communities was at  least 48 percent by the beginning of November 2010, as shown in table 4.  OHS officials attribute this slow rate to the fact that some tribes advance  tribal funds to pay for services and are reimbursed retroactively.", "Grantees themselves attribute low drawdown rates to delays in receiving  grants, difficulties in preparing facilities, and other challenges, as  discussed above. Five of the seven grantees we interviewed that did not  expect to obligate all first-year funds cited the delay in receiving first-year  grant awards from OHS as a challenge in expending first-year Recovery  Act expansion funds. As shown in figure 7, OHS began making Head Start  awards more than 6 months after the Recovery Act was enacted, and Early  Head Start awards were granted even later.", "Among grantees attributing delays to the preparation of facilities, one  grantee cited the unanticipated need for time to commission and complete  architectural drawings of the planned facility. This grantee and another  that was constructing new facilities experienced difficulty completing the  paperwork to obtain approval from OHS to proceed with construction.

In particular, officials at seven grantees did not expect to obligate  all first-year funds by the end of the fiscal year, and five of these were  unclear about the carryover policy.", "Given the unique nature of the Recovery Act\u2019s one-time, 2-year funding,  grantees were unclear as to whether or not HHS\u2019s typical carryover policy  would apply. For typical, ongoing grants, the carryover policy is explained  in HHS\u2019s Grants Policy Statement, which states that grantees may request  to carry over unobligated funds in the next year of their grant. HHS sets  the policy for all grantees, while regional offices typically evaluate and  approve grantees\u2019 requests for carryover. However, regional offices did not  consistently communicate a clear policy for Recovery Act funds. For  example, in June 2010, the head of one region publicly urged grantees to  expend all first-year funds within the fiscal year because the official was  uncertain about whether or not carryover would be permitted. According  to a grantee in another region, OHS staff told officials that it was likely  that the grantee would be able to carry over unobligated funds for use in  the following year. Officials at one grantee told us that the regional office  changed its guidance on carryover. Specifically, the grantee reported that  in June 2010, they received verbal assurances that they would be able to  carry over funds into the next fiscal year. According to these officials,  nearly 3 months later, the grantee was told that carryover would not be  permitted. Grantee officials representing two different regions told us that  OHS regional office contacts refused to state the carryover policy \u201cin  writing.\u201d One senior official from an OHS regional office confirmed that  this was the office\u2019s practice. An OHS official representing a different  regional office stated that the office had not sent any e-mails or provided  any written guidance on carryover to grantees as of September 2010.", "Regional offices conveyed inconsistent messages to grantees because the  OHS central office did not communicate its carryover policy clearly or  early to regional offices. Officials at the OHS central office explained to us  that the policy for carryover had not changed for Recovery Act grants.  Further, the officials told us that if grantees had unexpended funds at the  end of fiscal year 2011, OHS could approve grantees\u2019 request to extend the  time period, or the funds would be returned to the U.S. Treasury.  Nevertheless, a senior official at one regional office indicated that they  were waiting for information about carryover from the central office. A  representative told us in July 2010 that the region was expecting guidance  from the central office, which was not received until mid-September\u2014 about 2 weeks before the close of the fiscal year\u2014and came verbally, not  in written form. At that time, the regional official reported that Recovery  Act carryover requests would be permitted in a manner consistent with  normal policy, with the possibility of some additional flexibility to approve  grantee requests.", "Head Start grantees need clear information about how and when they are  expected to obligate and expend federal funds so that they can plan to use  funds responsibly to achieve program goals. Under normal Head Start  policies, grantees are expected to have obligated all funds for that year  within the annual budget period or to apply in writing to carry over  unobligated funds to the next year. Grantees have access to information  on carryover and the consequences of failing to adhere to the deadlines, as  both are explained on an OHS Web site. As a result, grantees can plan  accordingly.", "Grantees\u2019 uncertainty about whether to \u201cuse or lose\u201d Recovery Act grant  funds contributed to varied spending practices that may not always have  targeted expansion funds toward meeting programs\u2019 highest current  priorities.

Others among the 14 expansion grantees we contacted expended  funds on large items that they did not originally plan to purchase. For  example, one grantee told us they changed plans in order to purchase four  buses, a van, and staff training in the closing months of the fiscal year. On  the advice of the regional office, one grantee purchased a minivan to  transport home-based participants to health appointments and regularly  scheduled socialization activities. One grantee planned to construct a  playground to be used as an \u201coutdoor learning environment\u201d at a cost of  about $295,000. Another planned to use funds to construct a socialization  room for home-based Early Head Start participants on the same site as the  grantee\u2019s other Head Start program, at a cost of about $43,000.

OHS had awarded  Danya a noncompetitive contract modification in September 2009 for close  to $7 million to provide support for first-year monitoring visits to Recovery  Act Early Head Start expansion grantees. Under this contract as modified,  Danya was to develop a plan to integrate the Recovery Act expansion  grantee visits into the national monitoring schedule, plan to expand  recruitment of Early Head Start reviewers, and begin to develop  information technology support for handling the increased volume of  grantee reviews. HHS contracting officers justified the decision not to  compete the contract modification, stating that there was insufficient time  for another company to plan for monitoring Recovery Act expansion  grantees. OHS also estimated that awarding the contract to a contractor  other than Danya would cost $11 million in duplication of effort.  Subsequently, however, in accordance with the Recovery Act, HHS  officials competed their entire monitoring contract in January 2010 to  implement the monitoring visits that Danya had planned, as well as non- Recovery Act visits, worth $38 million each year. As the only company to  bid for the contract, Danya was awarded the contract for both Recovery  Act and non-Recovery Act monitoring on April 28, 2010.

For example, the  Knowledge Management Repository would have compiled grantee review  data and evidence, and information about reviewers\u2019 expertise. In  February 2010, however, this project was postponed indefinitely.  According to OHS officials, they decided to postpone the project,  determining that this function should be implemented internally. They  stated the work completed by Danya will be used in a future data  management system.

Among 24 grantees that OHS identified as high risk  that were reviewed by the OIG, five received Recovery Act expansion  funds in fall 2010 (three for Early Head Start, one for both Early Head Start  and Head Start and one for Head Start). According to OHS officials, the  OHS central and regional offices identified high risk grantees in their  regions and referred them to the OIG for review.

OHS stated that no expansion funds were awarded to  grantees that were identified for health and safety performance violations,  although at least one of the grantees that received an unfavorable health  and safety review from the OIG received an expansion grant. OHS  officials explained that in making funding decisions, OHS looked at the  grantees\u2019 reviews and spoke with staff in the regional offices to determine  if the grantees should receive expansion grants. In conducting these  reviews, the OIG identified several financial management deficiencies  among four expansion grantees for which reports had been issued,  including: uncertainties about continued financial viability; non- competitive agreements that advantaged the grantee; overcharging the  Head Start program for administrative costs or charging it for unallowable  or unsupported costs; and a weak system and internal controls related to  accounting, personnel, procurement and property management.

For the 1-year reviews  of Recovery Act grantees, OHS added questions to the Monitoring Protocol  to enhance coverage of topics such as grantee governance and financial  management, staffing, training and technical assistance funding, and  education services. Other questions are directed at grantees implementing  new programs. For example, one new question asks reviewers, \u201cHas the  grantee drawn down an appropriate amount of funds, given where it is in  the start-up process?\u201d Targeted reviews for established grantees that have  recently received a triennial review will cover matters related to Recovery  Act spending and Early Head Start expansion.

Prime recipient report records include a review flag on  whether or not the federal agency reviewed the record during the data  quality review time frames. As we have noted in past reports, our analyses  of this agency review field, in conjunction with other fields and our  discussions with agency officials, have indicated potential problems and  inconsistencies. It appears that this continues to be the case with Head  Start reports, only 17 percent of which were marked as having been  reviewed by the agency. However, agency officials stated that all reports  were reviewed. Another data field on the recipient report shows whether  or not a correction was initiated; analysis of that field indicates it is likely  that additional agency reviews took place.

Agency officials stated that following the December 2009 Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) memorandum clarifying the FTE  definition, all grants associated with COLA/QI were reviewed with respect  to the reporting of FTEs. Agency officials reviewed these grants and  communicated to recipients that the cost-of-living increases were not to  count toward the FTE totals. We reviewed the FTEs reported to determine  if Head Start recipients were no longer reporting cost-of-living increases as  FTEs. In examining the impact on the FTE figures before and after this  clarification guidance was issued, we observed a significant drop in the  number of COLA/QI FTEs reported in all reporting periods following the  updated guidance. We further observed that for the fifth round of  reporting, over 60 percent of these COLA/QI recipient reports showed no  FTE value. For the remaining reports showing FTEs, we looked to see if,  in the 20 reports with the greatest number of FTEs, the fields describing  the award, project, and job creation explained their FTE counts.

The expansion grants also created or  retained a number of jobs during the country\u2019s economic slowdown. Still,  even as the Recovery Act directed an infusion of funds into the economy,  it also increased the importance of accountability for their use. In light of  the Recovery Act\u2019s pledge of unprecedented transparency and  accountability for federal grants, the ability of OHS to measure the results  of expanded Head Start funding is critical. While grantee recipient  reporting figures indicate that staffing levels have increased with Recovery  Act funds, data on the number of children and families enrolled in Head  Start and Early Head Start are less clear. OHS\u2019s plan to require that  reviewers compare attendance with enrollment reports offers some  clarification, but until OHS clearly communicates a consistent definition  for \u201cenrollment,\u201d the cumulative enrollment reports will continue to mean  different things for different grantees.

The fact that Early Head Start grants arrived later than expected\u2014further  accelerating expenditures\u2014increased the risk of ineffective choices on the  part of grantees. The absence of clearly communicated guidance on  whether they could carry funds from one year to the next and the lack of  consistent monitoring of their spending plans likely left grantees feeling  pressured to spend funds on near-term priorities in the belief that  application to longer-term but potentially more important issues would not  be possible. As a result, some children may have received significantly  different levels or a lesser quality of service than their program managers  might have otherwise planned or provided. Unless this confusion is  remedied, OHS may miss opportunities to foster the best outcomes with  Recovery Act expansion funds.", "Without consistently sharing the results of risk management meetings,  risks are more likely to be overlooked and a central OHS strategy for  managing risk\u2014including risks in management of new funds\u2014does not  achieve its full potential.

We conducted follow- up interviews with nine grantees that we visited previously in nine  localities in four states for a previous report on the Recovery Act. For  these interviews, we used an interview protocol that focused on progress  made in providing services, spending Recovery Act funds, plans for  carryover, and reporting on Recovery.gov. Additionally, we spoke with  seven grantees in seven other states that we identified by analyzing  Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) expenditure data to  identify grantees with drawdown rates below 5 percent as of July 16, 2010.  For these interviews, we used an interview protocol that addressed use of  Recovery Act funds, reasons for low spending rates, carryover guidance,  and regional office interaction.

Sixty-one individuals participated in focus  groups, representing a variety of programs, including existing Head Start  and Early Head Start grantees and grantees entirely new to the Head Start  and Early Head Start programs. For most focus groups, we recruited  participants from those attending Head Start-related conferences. The  focus groups discussed challenges faced in implementing their expansion  grants, among other topics.

We did not validate individual  grantees\u2019 enrollment reports by comparing them to actual enrollment  records. We found instances in which grantees\u2019 funded enrollment was  attributed incorrectly or in which grantees\u2019 total funded enrollment was  incorrect.

To provide more direct focus on Recovery Act programs to help  ensure that smaller programs with higher risk have audit coverage in  the area of internal controls and compliance through the Single Audit,  OMB updated its Single Audit guidance in the OMB Circular A-133,  Audits of States, Local Government, and Non-Profit Organizations  Compliance Supplement in July 2010. This compliance supplement  requires auditors to consider all federal programs with expenditures  of Recovery Act awards to be considered programs with higher risks  when performing standard risk-based tests to select programs to be  audited. The compliance supplement also clarified information to  assist auditors in determining the appropriate risk levels for programs  with Recovery Act expenditures. This is the second year that OMB  has included guidance in the compliance supplement to address some  of the higher risks inherent in Recovery Act programs. The most  significant of these risks are associated with new programs that may  not have the internal controls and accounting systems in place to help  ensure that funds are distributed and used in accordance with  program regulations and objectives. OMB and the federal cognizant  agency for audit have conducted several training and outreach  activities for the audit community regarding the importance of the  new audit requirements for Recovery Act programs.", "Since most of the funding for Recovery Act programs will be  expended in 2010 and beyond, we continue to believe that it is  essential that OMB provide direction in Single Audit guidance so that  some smaller programs with higher risk would not be automatically  excluded from receiving audit coverage based upon the requirements  in the Single Audit Act. In recent discussions with OMB officials, we  communicated our concern that future Single Audit guidance provide  instruction that helps to ensure that smaller programs with higher  risk have audit coverage in the area of internal controls and  compliance. OMB officials agreed and stated that they plan to  continue including similar language in the Compliance Supplement  and performing outreach trainings throughout the duration of the  Recovery Act.  2.  To address the recommendation for taking additional efforts to  encourage more timely reporting on internal controls for Recovery  Act programs for 2010 and beyond, OMB commenced a second  voluntary Single Audit Internal Control Project (project) in August  2010 for states that received Recovery Act funds in fiscal year 2010.  Similar to the prior project (which did not get started until October  2009), one of the project\u2019s goals is to achieve more timely  communication of internal control deficiencies for higher-risk  Recovery Act programs so that corrective action can be taken more  quickly. Specifically, the project encourages participating auditors of  states that received Recovery Act funds to identify and communicate  deficiencies in internal control to management 3 months sooner than  the 9-month time frame currently required under OMB Circular No. A- 133. The project also requires that management provide, 2 months  earlier than required under statute, plans for correcting internal  control deficiencies to the cognizant agency for audit for immediate  distribution to the appropriate federal agencies. The federal agency  is then to have provided its concerns relating to management\u2019s plan  of corrective actions in a written decision as promptly as possible and  no later than 90 days after the corrective action plan is received by  the cognizant agency for audit. According to OMB officials, 13 states  had volunteered to participate in the project as of November 15, 2010.  Each participating state is to select a minimum of four Recovery Act  programs for inclusion in the project and at the completion of the  2010 project, OMB plans to assess the project\u2019s results.", "We assessed the results of the first OMB Single Audit Internal Control  Project for fiscal year 2009 and found that it was helpful in  communicating internal control deficiencies earlier than required  under statute. We reported that 16 states participated in the first  project and that the states selected at least two Recovery programs  for the project. We also reported that the project\u2019s dependence on  voluntary participation limited its scope and coverage and that  voluntary participation may also bias the project\u2019s results by  excluding from analysis states or auditors with practices that cannot  accommodate the project\u2019s requirement for early reporting of control  deficiencies. Overall, we concluded that although the project\u2019s  coverage could have been more comprehensive, the analysis of the  project\u2019s results provided meaningful information to OMB for better  oversight of the Recovery Act programs selected and information for  making future improvements to the Single Audit guidance. We believe  that OMB needs to continue taking steps to encourage timelier  reporting on internal controls through Single Audits for Recovery Act  programs.  3.  OMB officials have stated that they are aware of the increase in  workload for state auditors who perform Single Audits due to the  additional funding to Recovery Act program and corresponding  increase in programs being subject to audit requirements. OMB  officials stated that they solicited suggestions from state auditors to  gain further insights to develop measures for providing audit relief.  However, OMB has not yet identified viable alternatives that would  provide relief to all state auditors. For state auditors that are  participating in the second OMB Single Audit Internal Control  project, OMB has provided some audit relief. Specifically, OMB  modified the requirements under Circular No. A-133 to reduce the  number of low-risk programs that must be included in some project  participants\u2019 assessment requirements for smaller programs for  Single Audits for fiscal years 2010 and 2011. As expenditures of  Recovery Act funds are expected to continue through 2016, it is  important that OMB look for opportunities and implement various  options for providing audit relief in future years.  4, 5.  With regard to issuing Single Audit Guidance in a timely manner, and  specifically the OMB Circular A-133 Compliance Supplement, OMB  officials have stated that they intend to issue the fiscal year 2011  compliance supplement by March 31, 2011. The team of federal  officials who assisted in the development of the OMB Circular A-133  Compliance Supplement met in August 2010\u2014a few weeks earlier  than in prior years\u2014for its annual kick off meeting. At that meeting,  the team set a goal of issuing the 2011 compliance supplement by  March 31, 2011, and discussed revised production schedules and  deadlines needed to accommodate the earlier issuance date. We will  continue to monitor OMB\u2019s progress to achieve this objective.", "6, 7.", "In October 2010, OMB officials stated that they have discussed  alternatives for helping to ensure that federal awarding agencies  provide their management decisions on the corrective action plans in  a timely manner, including possibly shortening the time frames  required for issuing management decisions by federal agencies to  grant recipients.

OMB officials acknowledged that the results of the  2009 OMB Single Audit Internal Control Project confirmed that this  issue continues to be a challenge. They stated that they have met  individually with several federal awarding agencies that were late in  providing their management decisions in the 2009 project to discuss  the measures that the agencies will take to improve the timeliness of  their management decisions.", "In March 2010, OMB issued guidance under memo M-10-14, item 7,  (http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/memoranda_20 10/m10-14.pdf) that called for federal awarding agencies to review reports  prepared by the Federal Audit Clearinghouse regarding Single Audit  findings and submit summaries of the highest-risk audit findings by major  Recovery Act programs by September 30, 2010, as well as other relevant  information on the federal awarding agency\u2019s actions regarding these  areas. OMB officials have stated that they plan to use this information to  identify trends that may require clarification or additional guidance in the  compliance supplement. OMB officials also stated that they are working  with the Recovery Act Accountability and Transparency Board to develop  metrics for determining how federal awarding agencies are to use  information available in the Single Audit. As of November 2010, according  to OMB officials, the project is in the planning phase and the specific  metrics are still being considered. OMB anticipates that the metrics may  be available in January 2011 and that the metrics could be applied at the  agency level, by program, to allow for analysis of Single Audit findings and  other measures to be determined. One goal of the metrics project is to  increase the effectiveness and timeliness of federal awarding agencies\u2019  actions to resolve Single Audit findings.

DOT further explained that  limitations in its data systems, coupled with the magnitude of Recovery  Act funds relative to overall annual federal investment in transportation,  would make assessing the benefits of Recovery Act funds difficult. DOT  indicated that, with these limitations in mind, it is examining its existing  data availability and, as necessary, would seek additional data collection  authority from Congress if it became apparent that such authority were  needed.
