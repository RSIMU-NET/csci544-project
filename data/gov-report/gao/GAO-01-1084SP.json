Posner Managing Director, Federal Budget Strategic Issues In the 1990s the Congress laid out a statutory and management framework  that provides the foundation for strengthening government performance  and accountability. The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA),  a major component of this framework, required agencies to establish  missions, goals, and performance measures as well as clearer linkages  between resources and results. We recognize that, while many agencies  have made significant progress in implementing GPRA, much remains to be  done to better integrate and infuse performance information in  management decision-making, including budgeting. This was made evident  in a recent GAO survey in which we found that fewer than 50 percent of  federal managers surveyed said they used performance information to a  great or very great extent to set program priorities or allocate resources.", "To expand the use of performance information in budgeting, this year the  President proposed a major initiative that involves:  an emphasis on fully integrating budget and performance information;  calculating the full cost of programs and activities; and  increasing the quality, usefulness, and amount of performance  information in the President\u2019s Budget.", "As part of this initiative, OMB\u2019s spring planning guidance to Cabinet  departments and selected major independent agencies included a list of  outcomes and related outputs and required the departments and agencies  to provide integrated budget and performance information for the listed  outcomes and outputs in their fiscal year 2003 performance plans.", "Efforts to more clearly link resources to results in federal agencies are not  new, and we have had the opportunity to learn from previous efforts. Since  1950, the federal government has attempted several governmentwide  initiatives designed to better align spending decisions with expected  performance\u2014what is commonly referred to as \u201cperformance budgeting.\u201d  GAO studied performance budgeting initiatives, such as Zero-Base  Budgeting, Management by Objectives, and Planning-Programming- Budgeting-System, and found that performance budgeting should not be  viewed in simplistic terms\u2014that is, resource allocation cannot be  mechanically linked to results. We concluded that the promise of any  performance budgeting initiative lies in its potential to infuse performance  information more explicitly into budgetary deliberations, thereby changing  the terms of debate from simple inputs to outputs and outcomes.", "The purpose of this draft is to supplement the well-established legal and  regulatory structure for federal budgeting by presenting an initial  framework that describes the practices an agency could use to link  performance information to the budget process\u2014what we are calling  \u201cresults-oriented\u201d agency budget practices. Results-oriented agency  budget practices are the activities, processes, and capacities that can help  an agency to incorporate performance information into its internal budget  deliberations and requests for funding and to identify opportunities to  make better use of available resources to accomplish agency goals.", "The next phase of our work in this area is to showcase successful  applications of these practices. Therefore, we will be identifying agencies  that have shown innovation in implementing one or more of these practices  to share with the budget community."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["We developed an initial set of results-oriented agency budget practices by  reviewing literature on performance management and budgeting and  speaking to budget experts. Although some of the literature we reviewed  focused on executive branch departments and agencies, much of it focused  on the congressional budget process or on the budget processes of state  and local governments and other countries. Where applicable, we adapted  the information to describe how performance information could be used  for budget formulation and implementation in federal agencies. We also  drew on GAO reviews and other studies of agency budgeting. To  supplement the literature we spoke to budget experts inside and outside of  GAO about results-oriented agency budget practices.", "To test our initial findings from the literature and budget experts, we  conducted a case study of budget formulation and implementation  practices at the Small Business Administration. The case study helped us  to refine the practices and begin to understand how the practices fit  together as a framework.", "Finally, to obtain an operational perspective on the framework, we invited  input from a panel of senior agency budget officials who commented on the  importance of the practices for achieving agency goals and the challenges  to implementing those practices. The panel consisted of seven senior  budget officials from a judgmentally selected sample of federal agencies.  The panelists represented one commission, two independent agencies, and  four agencies from three departments. For the panel discussion, we  provided the panelists with a questionnaire and asked them to rate each  practice in terms of how important it is to an agency in achieving the  agency\u2019s goals and note if they thought the practice was difficult to carry  out. We focused the panel discussion on areas where there was greater  disagreement about the importance of a practice for helping to achieve  agency goals or where the panelists believed a practice was difficult to  carry out. We revised the framework to reflect the panelists\u2019 operational  perspective and described the practices in greater detail."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Framework for Results-Oriented Budget Practices in Federal Agencies", "paragraphs": ["The framework is organized into four themes that emphasize different  dimensions of results-oriented agency budget practices.

Themes 2  and 3 focus on an agency\u2019s capacity to produce reliable budget estimates  and to relate performance, budget, spending, and workforce information in  a credible and useful manner. Theme 4 focuses on agency effectiveness and  efficiency by emphasizing that an agency should continuously improve its  programs and operations and seek approaches to maximize limited  resources. Figure 1 depicts the framework for results-oriented agency  budget practices.", "For each theme we lay out a series of agency practices\u2014consisting of  activities, processes, and capacities\u2014that are intended to describe how an  agency could better inform its budget decision-making and find ways to  make better use of available resources to accomplish agency goals.", "We view the practices as desirable dimensions of budgeting that could be  implemented in many different ways by agencies. The characteristics and  circumstances that make organizations different from one another must be  recognized when considering the applicability of the practices.", "In appendix I, we provide a more detailed description of the practices.  Where relevant we have also noted specific laws, regulations, or other  guidance that relate to the practice and apply to federal agencies generally.", "The framework does not reflect every aspect of the budget process. For  example, there are other aspects of budget law and guidance, such as those  related to fund control and accountability, that we treat as givens. Similarly,  we assume that agencies will comply with appropriations and other laws  and guidance and respond to OMB and department directions in  formulating and implementing their budgets.", "The practices do not include those aspects of the budget process that are  the primary responsibility of the department, such as coordinating the  preparation of budget requests within the department. The framework is  oriented toward agency rather than department budget practices because  there is a closer connection between performance and the day-to-day  management of resources at the agency level. However, since agency  budgets are the building blocks of departmental budgets, some aspects of  the framework may also apply at the department level.", "Finally, the framework is an attempt to describe the contribution that the  budget function can make to an agency\u2019s capacity to manage for results. It  is not intended to be a comprehensive treatment of all the management  functions that contribute to agency results.

Infusing performance information into  budgetary deliberations may improve the agency\u2019s ability to manage for  results by increasing the likelihood that resource allocation decisions will  reflect performance concerns. For example, performance information  should be used to support claims for resources, to evaluate those claims,  and to make decisions on tradeoffs between competing needs.", "For both budget formulation and implementation, Theme 1 practices  emphasize communication and feedback between agency management and  its program and other offices about the resources needed to achieve agency  performance goals and objectives. During budget formulation, agency  management should provide context in the form of general guidance to  program managers on proposed agency goals, existing performance  issues, and resource constraints.", "Theme 1:  Performance Informs Budget Formulation and Implementation For budget formulation, agency management:   provides general guidance to program officials on agency goals, performance issues, and resource requests input from program officials on the relative priority of new and existing programs and proposed changes to funding levels based on a review of changes in costs, performance issues, and other relevant factors;   uses the input on relative priorities, changes in costs, performance issues, and other factors to weigh competing needs and decide funding levels for existing and new programs; communicates management\u2019s decisions to program officials; and provides an opportunity to appeal the decisions; coordinates with other entities to achieve common goals and avoid duplication; justifies its budget request both within the agency and externally (e.g., with the department, the Congress, OMB) in terms of how requested funds will contribute to the accomplishment of agency informs its staff of departmental, OMB, and congressional actions on the budget request and obtains feedback from program officials on the implications of those actions for agency goals.", "For budget implementation, agency management:   provides guidance to program officials on changes in agency goals, performance issues, and requests updated information from program officials on the relative priority of new and existing programs and proposed changes to funding levels based on a review of changes in costs, performance issues, and other relevant factors;   uses the input on relative priorities, changes in costs, performance issues, and other factors to weigh competing needs and decide existing and new program funding levels; communicates its decisions about funding allocations; and provides an opportunity to appeal the decisions;   allocates funding in a timely manner; routinely monitors performance, spending, and budgetary resources and adjusts allocations as necessary to maximize performance against goals;   uses input from program officials on how changes in funding allocations will affect performance; coordinates program requests for postappropriations budget changes, requests input from program officials on the implications of those changes for agency goals, and communicates the results.", "Because program managers are in a position to understand the  performance implications of different funding levels, management should  obtain their input on desired funding levels based, in part, on how the  funding addresses current and potential performance gaps and the relative  priorities of their activities. Agency management should then use this  information to evaluate competing needs and to determine funding levels  to request and provide program managers an opportunity to appeal its  decisions.", "In formulating the budget request, agency management should also seek  input from outside the agency on issues affecting the agency\u2019s  performance. For example, the agency should coordinate with other  entities with similar or complementary goals. The agency should justify its  budget request in terms of how requested funding levels contribute to  achieving agency goals and should inform staff of budgetary actions so that  agency management can elicit feedback on performance issues. Similarly,  when requesting postappropriations budget changes, the agency should  communicate the results to program managers and determine the  implications, if any, for achieving agency goals.", "During budget implementation an agency needs to reconcile appropriated  funds and congressional priorities with its earlier budget request and  current operating needs. For example, agency management should update  its guidance on program goals, performance issues, or resource constraints  to reflect significant changes since the formulation of the budget. An  agency may need to revisit the priorities established during budget  formulation to make informed decisions about how to allocate funding that  may be more or less than requested. Similar to formulation, agency  management should then use this information to evaluate competing needs  and determine final program funding levels.", "To help managers meet their goals, after appropriations are enacted, the  agency should allocate in a timely manner funds needed for program  operations.

An agency\u2019s costs and  budgetary resources will change from year to year based on a variety of  factors. Often, agencies must grapple with the challenge of achieving  performance goals with flat or declining budgetary resources and  increasing costs. Theme 2 practices focus on providing decisionmakers  with reliable estimates of program costs and budgetary resources to build  credible requests for the resources an agency needs to achieve its goals.", "Theme 2 :  Produces Reliable Estimates of Costs and Resources   bases its budget estimates on reasonable assumptions about factors affecting program costs or budgetary resources; looks back to assess the accuracy of previous estimates and, if necessary, makes appropriate adjustments to its estimating methods; considers how its policy, program, and funding decisions may affect spending or budgetary resources for other programs within the agency; considers the short- and long-term funding implications of its program or policy decisions.", "The practices in this theme are premised on the notion that agencies that  base their budget estimates on the most up-to-date and reasonable  assumptions will be better equipped to make tradeoffs between covering  cost increases and meeting other programmatic needs. Those that ignore  persistent differences between estimated and actual costs or budgetary  resources will face greater uncertainty and have less time to plan for  potential funding imbalances. Furthermore, agencies that make an effort to  identify how funding decisions that affect one area of spending or  budgetary resources might also affect other areas will have more  information with which to address unanticipated funding or performance  issues that may arise.

At a minimum, GPRA requires an agency\u2019s  performance plan to cover each program activity in the President\u2019s budget  request for that agency. To meet this requirement and to make progress  toward the goal of integrating agency performance plans and budget  requests, OMB guidance states that agencies should display, by GPRA  program activity, the funding being applied to achieve the performance  goals and indicators for that activity.

An alternative to altering the  budget structure is to use cost accounting concepts to capture how  appropriated funds are spent according to agency goals. For example, an  agency could define its goals as cost objects and distribute the agency\u2019s  direct and indirect administrative and program costs against those cost  objects through such methods as direct time charging or other valid cost  allocation methods.", "An extension of an agency\u2019s capacity to relate its budget structure to its  goals is the capacity to relate and use budget, accounting, workforce, and  performance information to formulate and implement the budget. The  ability to relate accounting to budget information is fundamental to  maintaining control of and accountability for appropriated funds. The  capacity to relate performance to budget and accounting information  entails establishing a predictable and verifiable relationship between  programs, goals, performance indicators, budgets, and spending and being  able to report this information in an integrated manner for use by  management.

Ideally, an agency might rank the competing needs based on their  relative contributions to achieving goals. Note that formulation of an agency\u2019s  budget request is an iterative process in which requested resources are subject to  external scrutiny and change as the agency\u2019s request is first weighed against other  department programs and priorities and the department\u2019s request is weighed  against other executive branch priorities. Therefore, input obtained from program  officials is considered a first step and many other levels of review and decision- making occur before final decisions are made.", "After collecting and considering program input and making decisions based on the  input, the agency communicates in writing its decisions about the funding levels  being requested for each program.

Regardless of these  requirements, however, an agency\u2019s costs and budgetary resources change from  year to year based on a variety of factors, and agencies must grapple with the  challenge of achieving performance goals while finding funding for programs with  increasing costs or declining resources. Agencies that base their budget  estimates on the most up-to-date and appropriate assumptions will be better  equipped to make tradeoffs between covering these cost increases and other  programmatic needs. An agency should thoroughly explore the factors that are  most likely to affect program costs and budgetary resources, such as inflation,  personnel costs, and program demand.
