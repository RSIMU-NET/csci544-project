All eight agencies conduct regulatory activities to promote consumer product safety, such as rulemaking, standard setting, risk assessment, enforcement, and product recalls. In addition, at least 12 other agencies play a support role in consumer product safety in various areas, such as public health and law enforcement.", "Oversight of consumer product safety is fragmented across agencies, and jurisdiction overlaps or is unclear for certain products. In some cases, agencies regulate different components of or carry out different regulatory activities for the same product, or jurisdiction for a product can change depending on where or how it is used. For example, NHTSA regulates hand-held infant carriers when used as car seats, but CPSC regulates the carriers when used outside of motor vehicles. Agencies reported that the involvement of multiple agencies with various expertise can help ensure more comprehensive oversight by addressing a range of safety concerns. However, agencies also noted some inefficiencies, including the challenges of sharing information across agencies and challenges related to jurisdiction. For example, GAO found that the jurisdiction for some recreational boating products can be unclear and the potential exists for confusion regarding agency responsibility for addressing product safety hazards. Coast Guard officials said they work informally with CPSC when the need arises but that these interactions are infrequent. Without a more formal coordination mechanism to address jurisdictional uncertainties some potential safety hazards may go unregulated. In addition, the Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) oversees the markings of toy and imitation firearms to distinguish them from real firearms, which may be an inefficient use of resources because it does not leverage NIST's primary expertise related to scientific measurement. According to NIST, this function may be better administered by CPSC, which oversees the safety and performance of toys. However, this would require a statutory change.", "Agencies reported that they collaborate to address specific consumer product safety topics, but GAO did not identify a formal mechanism for addressing such issues more comprehensively. Independent agencies, such as CPSC, are not subject to the Office of Management and Budget's planning and review process for executive agencies. Additionally, no single entity or mechanism exists to help the agencies that collectively oversee consumer product safety. GAO has identified issues for agencies to consider in collaborating, such as clarifying roles and including all relevant participants. Because no mechanism exists to help agencies collectively address crosscutting issues, agencies may miss opportunities to leverage resources and address challenges, including those related to fragmentation and overlap identified in this report."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider (1) transferring oversight of the markings of toy, look-alike, and imitation firearms from NIST to CPSC, and (2) establishing a formal collaboration mechanism to address comprehensive oversight and inefficiencies related to fragmentation and overlap.

Further, as  globalization and technological advances expand the range of products  available in U.S. markets, the challenge of regulating the thousands of  product types has become increasingly complex. The Consumer Product  Safety Commission (CPSC) is charged with protecting the public from  unreasonable risk of injury or death associated with the use of thousands  of types of consumer products. However, many other federal agencies  also have various roles and responsibilities related to consumer product  safety oversight. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  (NHTSA), U.S. Coast Guard (Coast Guard), Food and Drug  Administration (FDA), and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),  among others, have jurisdiction over products such as automobiles and  other on-road vehicles and their equipment, including tires; boats; drugs;  cosmetics; medical devices; and pesticides.

As part of a  mandate that requires GAO to identify federal programs, agencies,  offices, and initiatives with duplicative goals and activities within  departments and government-wide, GAO reviewed federal oversight of  consumer product safety. Specifically, this review examines (1) which  federal agencies oversee consumer product safety and their roles and  responsibilities, (2) the extent and effects of fragmentation, overlap, or  duplication, if any, in the oversight of consumer products, and (3) how do  consumer product safety oversight agencies coordinate their activities  and to what extent does that address any identified negative effects of  fragmentation, overlap, or duplication.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed relevant laws and regulations,  as well as literature and our past reports on consumer product safety;  fragmentation, overlap, and duplication; and mechanisms for interagency  collaboration (see a list of related GAO products at the end of this report).  To identify agencies that conduct consumer product safety oversight and  to delineate their roles and responsibilities, we reviewed the following  sources: (1) laws related to consumer product safety, as well as Federal  Register notices for proposed and final rulemaking from August 2008 to  October 2013; (2) the Consumer Product Safety Commission\u2019s web link  to federal agencies with jurisdiction over consumer products; (3) our past  reports; and (4) agency members of CPSC-identified interagency working  groups. We then disseminated a questionnaire to the agencies we  identified to (1) confirm their roles and responsibilities and (2) identify any  other relevant agencies with whom they coordinate. We also asked  questions about what types of statutory authority the agency has, its  mission, other agencies with which it coordinates, barriers to coordination,  and knowledge of any potential fragmentation, overlap, or duplication in  oversight. We disseminated 33 questionnaires in total and obtained and  analyzed at least one response from each of the 33 entities. We also  interviewed federal agency officials and industry groups to gather  information on the extent of fragmentation, overlap, and duplication, their  benefits and challenges, and how coordination may help to address any  negative effects.

The  Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, mandates FDA  to, among other things, conduct pre-market reviews of the safety of all  new drugs, as well as pre-market approval of some medical devices.", "Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act provides for the  federal regulation of pesticides. While various versions of a federal  pesticide statute have been in place since 1910, Congress enacted  substantial amendments to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and  Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) in 1972. Under the current version of  FIFRA, pesticides must generally be registered (licensed) by EPA  before they may be sold or distributed in the United States. EPA may  register a pesticide if it finds, among other things, that use of the  pesticide will not generally cause unreasonable adverse effects on the  environment. When EPA registers a pesticide, it approves directions  for use of the pesticide, which must appear on the product label and  be followed by users of the pesticide.", "The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 established  an agency which, under the Highway Safety Act of 1970, later  became the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act authorizes NHTSA  to, among other things, promulgate federal safety standards for motor  vehicles and equipment.", "The Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971 authorizes the Coast Guard  (within the Department of Homeland Security) to, among other things,  establish minimum safety standards for recreational vessels and  associated equipment and to require the installation or use of such  equipment.

CPSC is authorized to protect the public against  unreasonable risks of injury associated with consumer products in  general, and also to administer other laws such as those governing  fabric flammability, hazardous substances, child-resistant packaging,  refrigerators, pool and spa safety, and toy safety.

All eight agencies  reported conducting rulemaking, standard-setting, and enforcement  activities. As an example of rulemaking, CPSC recently issued a final  rule establishing a safety standard for strollers and infant carriages.  CPSC issued the rule in response to a provision of the Consumer  Product Safety Improvement Act, which required CPSC to promulgate  consumer product safety standards for durable infant or toddler  products. The rule incorporates by reference the most recent  voluntary standard developed by ASTM International, a standard- setting organization. The standard includes requirements for improved  test methods of various parts (e.g., brakes, wheels) and warning label  clarifications. In an example of enforcement, PHMSA inspects  consumer commodity shipments. PHMSA staff stated that they  coordinate with other agencies to identify where hazardous  substances are coming from and where they are going. In another  enforcement example, under the Toxic Substances Control Act, EPA  can initiate civil actions to seize an imminently hazardous substance,  mixture, or any article containing such a substance or mixture.", "Risk assessment. Six of the eight agencies reported conducting risk  assessments, whereas PHMSA did not and the Coast Guard reported  that its authority in this area is unclear. As an example of risk assessment, EPA recently conducted an assessment for a flea and  tick pet collar using the insecticide propoxur. EPA\u2019s risk assessment  found, in some but not all use scenarios, unacceptable risks to  children from exposure to propoxur pet collars. EPA noted that small  children may ingest pesticide residues when they touch a treated cat  or dog and subsequently put their hands in their mouths. EPA and the  manufacturers agreed to do a voluntary cancellation of the product  based on concerns that the residue on animals can be dangerous for  children. The Coast Guard noted that its authority to conduct risk  assessments is unclear. A Coast Guard official explained that  statutory authority allows the Coast Guard to establish whether,  according to their reasonable and prudent judgment, a defect creates  a substantial risk of personal injury.", "Product recalls. Six of the eight agencies reported having regulatory  authority to recall certain products under their jurisdiction, whereas  NRC and PHMSA did not. As an example of a product recall, an  official from the Coast Guard noted that the agency works with  manufacturers and conducts between 10 and 20 recall campaigns  annually of recreational boats, equipment originally installed on boats,  and limited equipment installed after purchase. The Coast Guard  officials recently worked with Honda, which has stopped  manufacturing personal watercraft, when the company found it had a  problem with boats it manufactured from 2002 through 2008. The  manufacturer is now recalling these boats for possible fuel tank  failure. The Coast Guard stated that it does not actually conduct the  recalls but records the recalls and monitors the progress that the  manufacturer completes in the performance of the recalls. According  to the agency, once regulatory noncompliance or a substantial risk  defect is discovered, the manufacturer normally voluntarily registers  the recall campaign with the Coast Guard and performs the recall in  accordance with statutory requirements and the Coast Guard  regulations regarding recall notification. By statute, the manufacturer is required to notify the first purchaser, subsequent purchasers if  known to the manufacturer, and the dealers and distributors. Based  on the progress reports submitted to the Coast Guard by the  manufacturer, the Coast Guard decides when it is practical to close  the recall campaign. According to the agency, the Coast Guard has  the authority to require a manufacturer to perform a recall, but this  authority has rarely been used.", "In addition to the regulatory activities listed earlier, agencies reported  other oversight activities they undertake. Specifically, CPSC noted that it  can also collect data and conduct informational campaigns. NHTSA also  stated that it can conduct consumer informational programs. For example,  NHTSA noted the New Car Assessment Program, under which it  conducts vehicle crash and rollover tests to encourage manufacturers to  make safety improvements to new vehicles and provide the public with  information on the relative safety of vehicles (e.g., through a safety rating  using a five-star scale). Additionally, EPA noted its statutory authority to  conduct licensing of pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide,  and Rodenticide Act, as amended."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "At Least 12 Agencies Play an Indirect Role in Consumer Product Safety Oversight", "paragraphs": ["Based on our analyses of information obtained through the  questionnaires and interviews with agency officials, we identified at least  12 agencies that play an indirect role in the oversight of consumer  product safety. We categorized an agency as having an indirect role if it  met one of two criteria: (1) it did not conduct any of the five regulatory  activities described in the previous section, but described other activities  that supported consumer product safety oversight; or (2) it initially  described a role in regulating consumer products, but in subsequent  interviews, did not self-identify as a consumer product safety oversight  agency. An indirect role can include such activities as conducting  underlying research to support regulatory activities and providing public  health expertise, among others. We describe the overall work of these  agencies and the specific roles that they play in relation to consumer  product safety in detail in appendix III. The 12 agencies are the National  Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST); Federal Communications  Commission (FCC); Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA);  National Institutes of Health (NIH); Health Resources and Services  Administration (HRSA); Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC); Federal Aviation Administration (FAA); National Transportation  Safety Board (NTSB); Occupational Safety and Health Administration  (OSHA); U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP); Bureau of Alcohol,  Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF); and Federal Trade  Commission (FTC).", "These 12 agencies supported product safety in at least one of the  following areas: (1) public health expertise; (2) law enforcement; (3)  workplace safety; (4) transportation safety; and (5) other activities.", "Public health expertise. NIH, HRSA, and CDC reported providing  public health expertise. For example, the National Institute of  Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), within NIH, manages the  National Toxicology Program, which studies substances in the  environment, including substances used in personal care products,  household products, foods, and dietary supplements, to identify any  potential harm they might cause to human health. One example of a  substance over which NIH and CPSC have coordinated is diisononyl  phthalate (DINP). Phthalates are a group of chemicals used to make  plastics more flexible and more difficult to break. The National  Toxicology Program has provided CPSC with access to its scientific  expertise and research on DINP. It also served on and provided  DINP-related analysis to the Chronic Hazard Advisory Panel on DINP.  This panel advised CPSC on whether DINP in consumer products  poses a chronic hazard.", "Law enforcement. CBP, ATF, and FTC reported involvement in law  enforcement. For example, FTC investigates and can take action  against companies that engage in unfair or deceptive acts or practices  in or affecting commerce, which can include making deceptive safety  claims. One example where FTC has played a role in consumer  product safety is through an administrative action it took against a  manufacturer that falsely claimed that football mouth guards prevent  concussions. FTC\u2019s settlement order with the manufacturer prohibits  the company and its owner from, among other things, misrepresenting  the health benefits of any mouth guard or other athletic equipment  designed to protect the brain from injury. FTC has also taken other  actions related to the safety of consumer products. For example, it  has challenged several after-market braking devices that called  themselves antilock brake systems (ABS) but that did not, in fact,  function as well as factory-installed antilock brakes.", "Workplace Safety. CDC\u2019s National Institute for Occupational Safety  and Health (NIOSH) and OSHA reported responsibilities for workplace  safety. For example, NIOSH conducts and publishes research on the  occupational hazards associated with the use of tools (such as nail  guns) and materials (such as spray foam insulation and methylene  chloride). NIOSH\u2019s research focuses on worker safety, but consumers  may benefit because they may purchase the same products for use in  and around the home. In the case of nail guns, NIOSH stated that it  had identified causes of worker injuries, developed recommendations  to improve worker safety, and published the information in a variety of  media and formats, including a joint publication with OSHA, to make it  widely available. Sometimes, a manufacturer may end up making  improvements to a product as a result of NIOSH\u2019s research, which  may enhance consumer safety. NIOSH also conducts rulemaking,  standard setting, and product recalls of respirators for use by workers,  which also may be purchased by consumers.", "Transportation safety. FAA and NTSB reported responsibilities for  transportation safety. For example, NTSB investigates every civil  aviation accident in the United States and significant accidents in  other modes of transportation\u2014railroad, highway, marine, and  pipeline. As part of its investigations, NTSB makes safety  recommendations to other federal agencies on a variety of topics,  including their oversight of any specific consumer products involved in  the accidents. In the past, NTSB has made recommendations to  NHTSA to improve the visibility of brake and turn lights and to modify  performance and testing requirements for passenger-side air bags.  More recently, NTSB has made recommendations to FAA to improve  the safety of amateur-built aircraft.", "Other activities. NIST, FCC, and FEMA\u2019s U.S. Fire Administration  reported involvement in other activities that support consumer product  safety oversight. For example, with the increasing use of  nanomaterials, NIST stated that it has collaborated with CPSC to  measure and better understand the release of nanotechnology-based  products and exposure pathways. According to NIST, in these  collaborations, it has provided unique measurement expertise, for  example, for determining the quantities and properties of  nanoparticles released from flooring finishes and interior paints and  their subsequent airborne concentrations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Fragmented and Overlapping Oversight Can Help Agencies Leverage Expertise but Also Creates Inefficiencies", "paragraphs": ["We found that oversight of consumer product safety is fragmented across  multiple agencies with some overlap occurring\u2014for example, when  agencies regulate different uses of the same product.

Fragmentation and overlap can  help provide more comprehensive oversight by allowing agencies to  leverage one another\u2019s expertise, resources, and authorities, but they can  also create inefficiencies. In particular, NIST\u2019s role as regulator for the  markings of toy and imitation firearms may be an inefficient use of  resources because it may not leverage the agency\u2019s primary mission and  expertise, which are related to scientific measurement.

In contrast, CPSC  regulates the parts of food containers or preparation articles that do  not come into contact with food, as well as certain chemical  substances. An example of a product with overlapping regulation is  spoons intended for use by infants. The substances making up the  portion of the spoon that comes into contact with the food would  generally be regulated by FDA to ensure the safety of substances in  the spoon that may migrate into the food. However, if the spoon had a  plastic coating, it could also be subject to CPSC\u2019s limits on the use of  certain phthalates in children\u2019s products.

FDA and CPSC indicated that they did not coordinate on the  proposed rule for toy laser products, but according to FDA officials,  the agencies collaborated on a draft guidance document concerning  this rule that was issued in August 2013. FDA also noted that the  agency has organized a multiagency Laser Communications Working  Group to educate consumers about laser safety.", "Regulatory jurisdiction for some products changes depending on where or  how the product is used, which can result in overlapping oversight, as in  the following examples.", "Infant car seats/hand-held infant carriers (CPSC, NHTSA): Infant  car seats can be used to protect a child inside a moving vehicle, but  some (which are also called hand-held infant carriers) can also be  used to carry an infant outside of a vehicle and can attach to strollers.  CPSC regulates hazards associated with the use of infant carriers  outside of a motor vehicle, including soft infant carriers, framed  carriers worn on caregivers\u2019 backs, and hand-held infant carriers, as  part of their jurisdiction over durable infant and toddler products.  Overlap with NHTSA occurs with hand-held infant carriers that are  also used as car seats and are therefore considered \u201cmotor vehicle  equipment\u201d for the purpose of NHTSA\u2019s jurisdiction. For example,  infant car seats sold for purposes that include motor vehicle use are  considered child-restraint systems and must be certified as meeting  federal motor vehicle safety standards. In December 2013, CPSC  issued a final rule, which incorporated an existing voluntary standard  for hand-held infant carriers. For example, this standard includes  warning label requirements to address suffocation and restraint- related hazards, as well as testing procedures to ensure that the  carrier handle automatically locks. NHTSA and CPSC indicated that  they had coordinated on the rulemaking. For example, CPSC said that  the agency had worked with NHTSA to assess the effectiveness of  existing standards for hand-held infant carriers and to ensure that the  warning label to address strangulation hazards does not interfere with  NHTSA\u2019s label for air bags.", "Adult portable bed rails (CPSC, FDA): CPSC and FDA regulate  portable bed rails for adult use. These are rails that are not part of a  bed\u2019s original design, but can be installed against or adjacent to adult  beds to protect people from falling and to assist them as they get in  and out of bed.

FDA noted that for consumers, there is little difference  between the adult portable bed rails regulated by FDA or CPSC in  terms of the physical product. FDA and CPSC have been working with  manufacturers, health care practitioners, and consumer  representatives since 2013, to develop a voluntary consensus  standard for adult portable bed rails through an organization that  develops standards (ASTM International). This voluntary standard  would apply to all portable adult bed rails whether they are regulated  by FDA or CPSC and should help ensure that there are no gaps in  oversight of the safety of portable bed rails for adult use. The effort to  establish a voluntary standard for bed rails was ongoing as of  September 2014. CPSC and FDA also noted that they maintain an  interagency working group that addresses the issues associated with  adult portable bed rails.

They explained that both sets of requirements have been  incorporated into industry standards (standard 87-1 of the American  Pyrotechnic Association), which PHMSA in turn has incorporated into  its regulations governing the approval and transport of fireworks.  Additionally, ATF enforces explosives laws and licenses  manufacturers to use explosives, including in consumer fireworks.", "Mobile phones and other wireless devices (FCC, FDA): FCC and  FDA share regulatory responsibilities for mobile phones and other  wireless devices. Although FCC does not directly regulate the safety  of mobile phones and wireless devices, it sets limits on the amount of  radiofrequency energy these devices can emit and certifies that  devices sold in the United States comply with FCC requirements.  According to FDA, the agency, as part of its oversight of radiation- emitting products, ensures that mobile phones and other wireless  devices do not emit radiofrequency energy at a level that is hazardous  to the user. FDA also stated that as a health expert agency, its  expertise was significant in developing the radiofrequency exposure  limits from which the FCC radiofrequency emission limits are derived,  and it is FDA that would have the jurisdiction to determine whether a  product is unsafe. For example, while FDA does not review the  safety of mobile phone devices before they are marketed, it can  require manufacturers to replace or recall mobile phones that are  shown to emit radiofrequency energy at a level that is hazardous. As  we previously reported, FCC said it relies heavily on the guidance and  recommendations of federal health and safety agencies when  determining the appropriate exposure limit for radiofrequency  energy.

Consumer  product safety encompasses complex topics and often requires a range  of expertise to address the breadth of products and potential safety  hazards (e.g., manufacturing, transport, effects on the environment, or  use in different settings). As a result, it may be impractical for any single  agency to oversee consumer product safety alone. For example, CPSC  staff noted that in the area of nanomaterials, no single agency has the  resources to tackle the potential human health and environmental risks.  Moreover, some agencies noted that each agency brings a different  mission or focus to addressing consumer product safety problems. For  example, CPSC staff noted that while CPSC and EPA both conduct risk  assessments as part of their oversight of generators, EPA\u2019s focus is on  how much pollution a generator emits into the environment, while CPSC  focuses on the safety implications of how consumers use generators  around their homes. CPSC staff noted that risk assessments from other  agencies can serve as an additional check on their own safety  assessments.", "As part of providing more comprehensive oversight of consumer product  safety within a fragmented and overlapping regulatory structure, agencies  noted that they leverage one another\u2019s expertise, resources, and statutory  authorities. For example, we previously reported that in 2009, CPSC led a  task force to address hazards associated with high hydrogen sulfide  emissions from imported defective drywall (i.e., sheetrock used in  construction), which crossed the jurisdiction of several federal agencies.  Members of this task force brought their areas of expertise to this effort.  For example, CPSC coordinated with EPA to conduct an elemental  analysis of the drywall components; HUD\u2019s role was to develop guidance  for the identification and remediation of problem drywall in homes; CDC\u2019s  role was to assess the health effects and develop a public awareness  campaign; and CBP\u2019s role was to help identify imports of defective  drywall.", "Because agencies have different missions and areas of expertise, they  also have access to different data and information sources, and some  agencies noted that sharing this information can increase their knowledge  of product safety issues. For example, NHTSA noted that they share  complaint and injury data associated with the use of hand-held infant  carriers in motor vehicles with CPSC during joint investigations to inform  CPSC\u2019s oversight of these products when used outside of motor vehicles.  Some agencies stated that given their current regulatory authorities, they  may need to rely on other agencies\u2019 authorities to address certain  problems with unsafe products. For example, PHMSA noted that they do  not have the authority to recall a product once it is in the possession of  consumers, so they would rely on an agency such as CPSC or FDA to  remove products from commerce that are under their respective  jurisdictions.", "While agencies noted some benefits to the current regulatory structure for  consumer product safety, fragmentation also creates some inefficiencies,  including challenges related to communication among federal agencies  and with industry and consumers and to the ability to identify and respond  to new and emerging product hazards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Communication and Coordination Can Be Difficult When Oversight Involves Multiple Agencies", "paragraphs": ["Some agencies indicated that it can be difficult to find the right people  with whom to coordinate if agencies or their staff have no pre-existing  working relationships, if relationships change (such as through staff  turnover), or if the agencies are large.

For example, CPSC had  issued a rule on child-resistant packaging for over-the-counter and  prescription drug products containing specified levels of the drug  imidazoline in 2012. FDA officials said that the agency had not received  adequate notification of the content of the rulemaking as it progressed,  although CPSC initially made requests to FDA for data related to the  issues covered by the rulemaking. FDA had concerns about certain  provisions in the imidazoline packaging rule and felt that the final rule  could have benefited from direct input from FDA. FDA staff noted that one  way in which agencies learn about other agencies\u2019 rulemaking activities is  through a planning and review process for draft rules led by the Office of  Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) Office of Information and Regulatory  Affairs (OIRA). This planning and review process can also be a way to  resolve disputes among agencies. However, independent agencies, such  as CPSC, are not subject to OIRA\u2019s interagency planning and review  process. As a result, entities other than independent agencies, such as  FDA would not see rules proposed by CPSC as part of this process.  However, CPSC noted that while it does receive draft rules from some  agencies (mostly from EPA) during the OIRA planning and review  process, the timing of the review would probably be too late to address  major issues. FDA stated that agencies may consult with one another  outside of the OIRA planning and review process.", "In another example, FDA expressed concern that CPSC\u2019s 2010 rule  establishing requirements for cribs might eliminate cribs with drop-side  rails that are necessary for medical purposes outside of hospital  settings. In response to CPSC\u2019s crib requirements, FDA is developing a  proposed rule to regulate the safety and effectiveness of pediatric cribs,  while allowing for the use of drop-side rails. FDA said they expect to issue  the proposed rule in fall 2014. According to FDA staff, the agency has  been coordinating with CPSC on how to publicly communicate their crib  requirements.

Additionally, multiple agencies have regulatory  jurisdiction for the packaging of certain household substances to ensure  that children cannot easily open them. Under the Poison Prevention  Packaging Act, CPSC oversees child-resistant packaging for household  substances, including cosmetics and drugs, except for substances that  are defined as pesticides by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and  Rodenticide Act (e.g., antimicrobial or antibacterial products). EPA  regulates the child-resistant packaging of pesticides used in residential  settings. EPA\u2019s standards for child-resistant packaging are required by  law to be consistent with CPSC\u2019s requirements under the Poison  Prevention Packaging Act and according to EPA\u2019s website, EPA and  CPSC worked together to develop reference guides for the public on their  respective child-resistant packaging requirements. However, oversight  over child-resistant packaging for antibacterial or antimicrobial body- cleansing products is unclear. EPA indicated that they do not regulate  child-resistant packaging for antibacterial or antimicrobial body-cleansing  products that contain the chemical Triclosan, which is also found in  pesticides, because these products are regulated by FDA as over-the- counter drugs and not as pesticides by EPA. According to CPSC  officials, the agency has not had occasion to consider whether it has  jurisdiction over child-resistant packaging for antibacterial or antimicrobial  body-cleansing products containing Triclosan even though CPSC\u2019s  authorities under the Poison Prevention Packaging Act include over-the- counter drugs.", "Moreover, as new products enter the consumer marketplace or when new  uses or users arise for existing products, agencies face questions of  jurisdiction. For example, CPSC staff noted that there are potential  jurisdictional questions about products that could be used in both  workplace and home settings, particularly as consumers have greater  access to products that were previously limited to industrial settings, such  as certain lawnmowers and power tools. According to CPSC, if an  industrial product is used by consumers on more than an occasional  basis, the agency may have the authority to regulate it as a consumer  product. To make this determination, CPSC said it would have to  consider\u2014on a case-by-case basis\u2014a variety of factors, including the  use of the product by consumers and the associated hazards, as well as  how the product is marketed, priced, and distributed. While OSHA  typically regulates the use of products in workplace settings, CPSC can  recall consumer products if OSHA standards do not adequately address a  product\u2019s hazards.

For  example, senior program officials in CDC\u2019s National Institute for  Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) told us that NIOSH and FDA  both regulate a certain type of respiratory protective device and that this  overlap increases time and costs for manufacturers in having to meet  different requirements. NIOSH certifies respirators as meeting certain  requirements for use in workplace settings, such as construction sites, to  protect workers from dust and small particles; these respirators can also  be sold to consumers. FDA regulates respirators for use in health care  settings as medical devices (i.e., surgical N95 respirators). FDA  regulation of surgical N95 respirators includes premarket clearance  requirements. FDA indicated that its clearance involves two steps: (1)  First, FDA recommends that respirators be certified by NIOSH for use in  occupational settings. (2) Second, once NIOSH has certified the  respirators, FDA then begins its process for clearing them to be marketed  in the United States as surgical N95 respirators. According to NIOSH, the  impact on manufacturers includes the delay for the introduction of new  products intended to provide respiratory protection, as well as barrier  protection for health care workers, due to the time involved to apply to  NIOSH for certification and then to FDA for clearance. According to  NIOSH, manufacturers also incur costs for each application submitted to  FDA and NIOSH, which includes processing fees imposed by the  agencies as well as the commitment of personnel and other resources to  assemble and monitor the applications and interface with the agency  reviewers.

For example, CPSC and  NHTSA have websites for consumers to report and search for safety  concerns related to the use of hand-held infant carriers and car seats,  respectively. FDA also posts phone numbers on its website for  consumers to report safety concerns with FDA-regulated products in each  state. However, FDA said that their staff are trained to refer consumers to  the appropriate agencies for concerns about products that are not under  FDA\u2019s jurisdiction.

In our  discussions and follow-up with agencies, agency staff cited challenges  such as resource constraints, training port personnel on regulatory  standards related to imported products, and using different terminology.  For instance, EPA noted that working with other agencies to gain  agreement required time and energy. NHTSA explained that because it  has no personnel assigned to the various ports of entry, the agency is  dependent on CBP personnel to ensure that imported motor vehicle  equipment complies with applicable standards. NHTSA stated that it has  a close working relationship with CBP and provides periodic training to  CBP personnel both in-person at the ports and electronically. However,  NHTSA noted that due to the variety of automotive products offered for  importation and the turnover of CBP port personnel, NHTSA repeats  training at ports that handle the highest volume of products it regulates.  FDA staff stated that agencies may use different terminology, making  communication difficult. In addition, earlier we discussed challenges  related to fragmentation and overlap that also relate to coordination and  collaboration. These challenges include staying informed about the  regulatory activities of other agencies related to, for example, child- resistant packaging for over-the-counter and prescription drug products;  coordinating on jurisdictional issues, for example, those related to  packaging for certain household substances, including cosmetics and  drugs; and considering options to share data rather than purchasing the  same data under multiple contracts.", "In past work, we have noted that interagency mechanisms or strategies to  coordinate programs that address crosscutting issues may reduce  potentially duplicative, overlapping, and fragmented efforts. In October  2005, we identified practices that can help enhance and sustain  collaboration among federal agencies, and in September 2012, we  identified key considerations for implementing collaborative  mechanisms. More specifically, we concluded that while collaborative  mechanisms differ in complexity and scope, they all benefit from certain  key features such as having clear roles and responsibilities and involving  all relevant participants. Additionally, our prior work found that agencies  that articulate their agreements in formal documents can strengthen their  commitment to working collaboratively and that written agreements are  most effective when they are regularly updated and monitored. We  noted that not all collaborative arrangements need to be documented  through written guidance and agreements, particularly those that are  informal. However, we have found that at times it can be helpful to  document key agreements related to the collaboration.", "Additionally, the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA)  Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA) establishes a framework aimed at  taking a more crosscutting and integrated approach to focusing on long- term outcome-oriented goals and improving government performance.", "GAO-12-1022 and GAO, Managing For Results: GPRA Modernization Act  Pub.

For instance, federal  agencies can use their strategic and annual performance plans as tools to  drive collaboration with other agencies and other partners and establish  complementary goals and strategies for achieving results. Moreover,  there are requirements that agencies discuss collaborative efforts in their  strategic and performance plans. In both documents, agencies must  describe how they are working with other agencies to achieve their own  goals as well as cross-agency priority goals. Additionally, in the  performance plan, agencies are to identify the various organizations,  program activities, regulations, policies, and other activities that contribute  to each of their goals, both within and external to the agencies.

Although we previously noted that OMB\u2019s Office of Information and  Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) has an interagency process for planning and  reviewing draft rules within the executive branch, this process does not  include independent regulatory agencies such as CPSC. Moreover, some  independent regulatory agencies have stated their opposition to greater  involvement by the President in setting their rulemaking requirements,  such as the preparation of cost-benefit analyses and submission of  rulemakings to OIRA for prior review.

Fragmented and overlapping  oversight among various agencies results in a number of challenges for  the oversight of consumer product safety, including communication  difficulties, inefficient use of resources, and unclear roles resulting in  potential regulatory gaps. In particular, the role of NIST as regulator for  the markings of toy and imitation firearms in section 5001 of title 15 of the  U.S. Code (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 5001) is inefficient because such a role may not  leverage the agency\u2019s primary mission and expertise in the area of  scientific measurement. Transferring this authority to another agency  would require a statutory change. In another example of a challenge  associated with fragmented oversight, it is unclear whether some boating  products fall under the jurisdiction of the Coast Guard or CPSC. In the  absence of a formal mechanism to facilitate coordination and clarify roles  and responsibilities, as indicated in our work on collaboration, some  products that may present a safety risk may go unregulated.", "In addition, while agencies reported collaborating using a variety of  mechanisms to address specific topics, we did not identify a mechanism  to facilitate more comprehensive collaboration. The inefficiencies we  identified in this report suggest the need for greater collaboration, which  in turn could help reduce some negative effects of fragmentation and  overlap. Also, there may be instances where more formal arrangements  would be beneficial. Due to the range of oversight areas and activities, no  single agency is able to address a problem alone. Additionally,  independent agencies such as CPSC are not subject to the executive  branch planning and review process under OMB. Our body of work on  collaborative practices and GPRAMA suggests that agencies need to  consider taking a more crosscutting and integrated approach to  addressing consumer product safety oversight. A broad interagency  collaborative mechanism could help the agencies that are collectively  responsible for the oversight of consumer product safety to address some  of the key issues identified in our work on collaborative practices, such as  clarifying agency roles and responsibilities, ensuring that all relevant  participants have been included, and appropriately documenting key  agreements on collaboration. Formal collaboration\u2014both between two  agencies to address a specific issue and across multiple agencies to  provide comprehensive oversight\u2014can be useful in strengthening agency  commitments in working together.

Specifically,  concerning the matter that Congress consider transferring certain  oversight responsibilities from NIST to CPSC, CPSC suggested that we  clarify that we are referring to requirements under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 5001 and  stated that it would be willing to accept responsibility for oversight of the  markings of toy and imitation firearms provided that the transfer of  authority from NIST includes a corresponding increase in appropriations.  To clarify the matter, we added a reference to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 5001 to the  conclusions and matter. NIST stated in its technical comments that it  supports the transfer of the oversight of the markings of toy, look-alike,  and imitation firearms from NIST to CPSC and that the report was  consistent with NIST\u2019s position regarding oversight of toy guns and  imitation firearms. CPSC also stated that it would be comfortable with the  establishment of a formal collaboration mechanism to address oversight  in areas of shared or fragmented jurisdiction provided that such an  approach does not compromise the agency\u2019s independence. With regard  to the recommendation that the U.S. Coast Guard and CPSC establish a  formal approach to coordination (such as a memorandum of  understanding) to strengthen the oversight of associated equipment  related to recreational boats, CPSC indicated that they support, and plan  to pursue, this recommendation.
