CMS depends on hundreds of information technology (IT) systems to help manage the Medicare program. With year 2000 systems renovations successfully completed, CMS has focused on modernizing its IT systems. The agency's information systems are crucial to carrying out Medicare's core missions of claims processing and payment, program oversight, and administration of participating health plans. Medicare's major systems are aged, however, and many are incompatible with one another. To address these problems, CMS intends to modify, replace, or redesign systems on which key Medicare missions depend. CMS plans to make incremental system improvements while maintaining current functions and accommodating changes mandated by legislation. The agency's IT planning and management processes--intended to increase the likelihood that new systems will be successful and cost-effective--have shortcomings. The agency's blueprint documenting its existing and planned IT environments, also known as its enterprise architecture, is missing essential detail in critical parts, including well-documented business functions, information flows, and data models. CMS is trying to strengthen its planning and has developed guidance for an improved management process, but will need to make considerable effort to ensure that modernization stays on track. These weaknesses in IT planning and management are part of larger agency management challenges. Resource gaps, both in funding and staff expertise, threaten the success of planned IT improvements. At the same time, CMS has made little use of performance measures to ensure accountability and increase the likelihood of achieving results."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Today, as the Congress focuses attention on ways to modernize the Medicare program, its management by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), formerly called the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), has become a primary concern. The Congress has raised questions about whether the agency has adequately implemented new payment methods, worked effectively to safeguard program payments, and provided adequate oversight of the quality of care provided to beneficiaries\u2014among other issues. As the nation\u2019s largest health insurer, Medicare enrolls about 40 million elderly and disabled beneficiaries and provides more than $200 billion in health care benefits annually. CMS depends on hundreds of information technology (IT) systems to provide information to manage this massive program and manages a large repository of health care data. Information on beneficiary enrollment and use of services, provider payments, and program expenditures resides in the numerous databases and processing systems run by CMS and the private companies with which it contracts. However, some of these systems are old and are difficult to update, to respond to program changes.", "With Year 2000 system renovations successfully completed, CMS has focused its attention on modernizing its IT systems. These systems are integral not only to processing and paying claims efficiently, but also to generating information that can inform policy decisions affecting payments, coverage, and quality of care. Through modernization, CMS seeks to better manage its data, be more responsive to legislative initiatives, and support efforts to improve health care for its beneficiaries.", "Because of your interest in examining ways to improve Medicare\u2019s management, you asked us to evaluate efforts to modernize CMS\u2019 IT systems. Accordingly, this report (1) describes aspects of CMS\u2019 current IT environment and projects CMS has under way to improve its systems, (2) examines the agency\u2019s IT planning efforts and IT management processes, and (3) discusses the challenges that need to be addressed to meet the agency\u2019s IT goals. To address these questions, we reviewed federal requirements and guidance on IT planning and management processes, CMS\u2019 IT planning and procedure documents, and our prior work and relevant reports issued by the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Office of Inspector General and CMS. We also interviewed CMS officials about the agency\u2019s current information systems and planned IT efforts. (See app. I for a detailed description of our scope and methodology.) A list of related GAO products is included at the end of this report. We performed our work from April 2000 through August 2001 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Medicare program\u2019s day-to-day operations rely on numerous large- scale information systems, which house or process information on, among other things, beneficiaries\u2019 enrollment and utilization of services, claims, and payments to providers. These systems serve Medicare\u2019s traditional fee- for-service component, which enrolls the bulk (about 85 percent) of the program\u2019s beneficiaries, and the managed care component, which enrolls the rest.", "CMS\u2014along with about 50 insurance companies with which it contracts to process Medicare claims\u2014operates these systems. Contractors use one of Medicare\u2019s several standard systems to process fee-for-service claims. Fiscal intermediaries are contractors that process part A claims (claims for hospital services and care provided by other institutional providers, such as skilled nursing facilities), while carriers are contractors that process part B claims (claims for physician care and other covered expenses, such as laboratory services). The fiscal intermediaries use one of two standard systems to process part A claims; the carriers use one of four standard systems to process part B claims. These contractor-run standard systems review claims to ensure that all required fields are complete, conduct utilization checks to determine whether the services provided correspond to the beneficiary\u2019s diagnosis, and calculate the payment amount for the claim. Contractors sometimes modify the standard claims processing systems they have adopted to address local claims processing needs, such as determinations as to whether claims are payable given their local medical coverage policies. Contractor-processed claims are then transmitted to a CMS-operated prepayment validation and authorization system. This system\u2014called the Common Working File (CWF)\u2014screens the priced claims for consistency with rules, eligibility for coverage, and duplication with previously processed claims and then approves, adjusts, or denies payment accordingly.", "In the early 1990s, HCFA launched a large systems modernization initiative to replace Medicare\u2019s multiple, contractor-operated claims processing systems with a single, more technologically advanced one. It was envisioned that the new, single-system computing environment would result in simplified program administration and reduced administrative costs, comply with Year 2000 standards, and improve the agency\u2019s ability to spot improper billing practices. However, this initiative failed through a series of planning and development missteps.", "When the contract for this initiative was terminated in August 1997, Medicare was left with numerous independent systems that needed Year 2000 modifications. The Year 2000 work delayed other planned IT initiatives, including the consolidation of Medicare\u2019s standard claims processing systems\u2014an initiative designed to reduce maintenance costs and some inconsistencies across the different contractor systems.", "CMS is now refocused on modernizing its IT environment to better implement congressionally mandated payment policy and other modifications and on modernizing its information systems. Critical responsibilities for leading these IT efforts reside with the agency\u2019s Chief Information Officer (CIO), who heads CMS\u2019 Office of Information Services (OIS). Under the CIO\u2019s direction, OIS is responsible for managing the acquisition and operation of CMS\u2019 information systems that are enterprisewide\u2014those affecting the agency as a whole. It is also responsible for setting agencywide IT policies with which the agency\u2019s three major organizational units, or programmatic \u201ccenters\u201d\u2014such as the Center for Medicare Management and the Center for Beneficiary Choices\u2014and its other administrative offices must comply in their efforts to develop systems to support statutory and administrative program requirements.", "In addition to OIS, other units share responsibility for various aspects of CMS\u2019 IT activities. CMS\u2019 programmatic centers and its administrative offices are generally charged with developing, acquiring, and maintaining systems that are specific to their individual missions, under the CIO\u2019s guidance and direction.

Through the computerized screening of claims, the contractors seek to ensure that beneficiaries are properly enrolled in the program and that any changes to their status are promptly updated. The contractors also seek to ensure that payments are made only to health care professionals who are authorized to bill Medicare and that the amount paid for, and the services delivered to, a beneficiary are consistent with program rules.", "In a static environment, efficiently processing almost a billion claims from almost a million hospitals, and other health care providers each year would be task enough. However, the Medicare claims processing systems are subject to frequent modifications to reflect regular annual updates, new policies, and changes in statutory requirements. In recent years, when major Medicare legislation added new benefits and created new payment methods to improve the program\u2019s fiscal health, many system changes had to be implemented. According to the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, which represents many of Medicare\u2019s contractors, in calendar year 2000 contractors received 719 formal change orders\u2014more than two and a half times the number received in fiscal year 1998. These orders are instructions sent by CMS for contractors to modify their claims processing systems.", "Implementing changes can be complicated and resource-intensive. Even though there are six standard systems, contractors have their own systems, in addition, to perform certain claims administration functions.", "As a result, for some changes, individual contractor sites require separate programming solutions. In addition, as systems have been altered over the decades, the alterations have not always been properly documented. Thus, implementing new changes, in some instances, takes considerable time and programming expertise.", "The difficulties of implementing changes complicate CMS\u2019 efforts to respond to new legislative requirements. Changes required by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) provide a recent illustration. In 2000, when the BBA-mandated prospective payment method for home health services was implemented, the standard systems had to adopt a complex claims pricing logic, requiring the retrofitting of systems that were designed to use a much simpler set of payment rules. For a time, some providers reported that claims that should have been promptly paid were inappropriately denied or suspended for further review."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Systems Hinder Providing Timely, Relevant Data for Program Management", "paragraphs": ["Program monitoring and oversight is another critical agency function that is fundamental to ensuring that Medicare beneficiaries have access to quality health care services and that the program is paying claims properly. This function is particularly important to guard against unintended effects as payment methods undergo change. BBA and subsequent legislation gave CMS significant tools to adjust its payment methods, but inadequacies in CMS\u2019 information systems have made it difficult to implement these measures and to track the effect of program changes.", "For instance, monitoring the effectiveness of program policies requires obtaining timely and accurate information about the services beneficiaries receive and the payments made to their providers. However, CMS\u2019 IT systems have often been of little help. The reason is that several of CMS\u2019 key databases\u2014such as its National Claims History (NCH) database, which maintains the electronic files of Medicare\u2019s paid claims\u2014are structured in a way that makes the quick retrieval of beneficiary utilization and provider payment information difficult. Retrieving data from hundreds of millions of claims and generating statistics to answer policy questions requires special programming for each query and may take months.", "Similarly, the design and stand-alone nature of the various systems that maintain Medicare\u2019s financial information limit CMS\u2019 ability to respond promptly to financial status questions, such as how much money in overpayments is owed to Medicare. To answer such questions, CMS must rely largely on its claims administration contractors\u2019 systems, which produce a fragmented, rather than coherent, picture of the financial matter at hand. These problems have been exacerbated by lapses in ensuring data quality. At times, CMS has used data from separate systems that were neither updated on the same schedule nor subsequently reconciled. As a result, CMS lacks key financial information needed to properly manage the program. For example, the Medicare fee-for-service accounts receivable net balance was more than $3.7 billion at the end of fiscal year 2000. However, CMS could not generate a complete and up-to-date list of delinquent debts that it could use to monitor the efforts of its contractors to refer such debts for collection."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS\u2019 IT Systems Fall Short of Meeting Information Needs of Medicare Managed Care", "paragraphs": ["A third critical management function involves the oversight of Medicare+Choice\u2014Medicare\u2019s managed care component. In Medicare+Choice, health plans compete for Medicare beneficiary enrollees by offering additional benefits\u2014such as coverage for outpatient prescription drugs\u2014at low or no premiums. To give beneficiaries managed care choices, CMS has to collect and disseminate information about plans to inform beneficiaries and then be able to record and maintain information on the beneficiaries\u2019 enrollment choices, once they have enrolled in plans. CMS also collects and analyzes information to ensure that payments to managed care organizations are appropriate.", "The agency\u2019s managed care functions are currently supported by a \u201cfamily\u201d of systems, and these systems, in turn, interface with other application systems and databases. Some of the systems were developed a decade ago and have been modified many times to meet increasingly complex requirements and growing capacity demands. The current systems are labor-intensive to modify and validate and do not respond promptly to beneficiary enrollment and health plan inquiries. According to CMS officials, the underlying structure of these systems limits the extent to which additional modifications are possible.", "Properly adjusting plan payments is another area in which CMS\u2019 current systems do not provide adequate support to the agency. BBA required the agency to refine its managed care rate adjuster to better reflect patients\u2019 health status. The adjustment is designed to pay health plans appropriately when they enroll a disproportionate number of healthier or sicker than average beneficiaries. Calculating this adjustment requires data on enrollees\u2019 use of medical services, known as encounter data. However, CMS\u2019 existing systems are not organized to maintain service utilization data at the individual enrollee level, thus impeding efforts to modify the rate adjuster as required."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS Has Begun to Redesign Some Current Systems and Develop New Ones", "paragraphs": ["In 1998, HCFA developed a strategic vision for agencywide IT modernization in which modular units that perform different functions would be interconnected with central databases.

This structure is designed to reduce redundancy in data maintenance and modification efforts and improve data consistency and quality. CMS\u2019 current plans for implementing modernization improvements include making incremental changes to some systems while replacing others with more advanced technology.", "Already under way are CMS efforts to consolidate its standard claims processing systems to ease the burden of modifying multiple systems. CMS is reducing the number of standard processing systems from six to three\u2014one for fiscal intermediaries, one for other carriers, and one for Durable Medical Equipment Regional Carriers (DMERC). (See app. II for more detail on this consolidation.) According to CMS officials, reducing the number of standard systems will reduce maintenance costs and inconsistencies across the different contractor systems and simplify making program changes.", "CMS is also planning to redesign the CWF, the critical prepayment system in the overall claims process. Prior to paying a claim, the contractors submit their claims to the CWF to check whether the claim is for a valid beneficiary and whether the beneficiary is entitled to the service, in order to authorize the claim for payment. Several key activities are fully dependent on the effectiveness and operational quality of the CWF, including program safeguard checking, query resolution, and compiling information on approved claims for parts A and B services.", "In other modernization efforts, CMS intends to substantially improve its ability to monitor the care provided to beneficiaries and payment integrity in Medicare\u2019s fee-for-service component. One project is to replace Medicare claims history files with a modern database that can be readily queried and can generate up-to-date information quickly. The new system\u2014the National Medicare Utilization Database (NMUD)\u2014will use advanced database management software to enhance and speed data access. CMS tested the ability of an NMUD prototype to answer complex questions about beneficiaries\u2019 use of services and provider payments and found that it could respond\u2014in a matter of hours\u2014to queries that had taken weeks to answer using CMS\u2019 previous technology.", "With regard to fiscal management, CMS has a system development initiative under way to improve its underlying financial reporting systems.

An effective IT investment management process is critical to ensure that resources are used as effectively as possible. Federal requirements and guidance direct agencies to manage their IT projects as a portfolio of investments. This involves developing a process that (1) establishes project selection criteria and quantifies the benefits and risks of each project, (2) ensures that projects continue to meet mission needs and provides senior management with progress reports that detail each project\u2019s cost, quality, and timeliness, and (3) includes a project evaluation phase that can inform future project selection and management.

As of January 2001, 102 of the 183 IT projects under way were classified by CMS as complex and expensive (levels C and D). (See table 1.) Because they take longer to implement and are more costly, they pose a greater risk to the agency. The rest were classified as lower cost or short-term projects\u2014such as systems maintenance and 1-year purchases and leases (levels A and B). A little over 40 percent of level C and D projects are managed directly by OIS. The rest are managed primarily by the center or administrative office responsible for the program activity to which the project is linked, while OIS maintains an oversight and technical assistance role. For example, the Office of Financial Management has primary responsibility for nearly half of non- OIS level C and D projects because they generally relate to maintaining or improving systems that provide financial management or program integrity information.", "CMS\u2019 process for selecting and managing these substantial projects falls short of recognized commercial and public sector best practices and guidance in the following ways.", "Despite the importance of involving senior-level management in reviews of project cost, quality, and timeliness, executive-level monitoring of critical IT projects at CMS is uneven. CMS\u2019 Executive Council, in conjunction with its Financial Management Investment Board (FMIB), serve as its IT investment review board as required by federal law. The FMIB reviews project funding requests annually when it defines funding priorities and makes its annual funding recommendations to the Executive Council, and the Executive Council is briefed on the progress of some of the projects. The CIO receives monthly status reports on about a third of the major projects OIS manages. However, neither the FMIB nor the CIO routinely receives status reports on projects managed by the agency\u2019s program units, particularly such critical projects as the development of the system needed to maintain information on Medicare+Choice plans. Without their systematic involvement, senior managers will not be able to make timely and appropriate decisions if cost, schedule, and performance outcomes are not achieved.", "CMS has not formally defined criteria for project funding. The agency\u2019s FMIB bases its decisions on high-level criteria that are used for selecting IT investments. These criteria are focused on meeting mission needs, but do not include explicit cost, schedule, benefit, or risk criteria\u2014 considerations that would be helpful in making trade-offs among investments competing for limited resources.

For example, CMS plans to have the CIO Technical Advisory Board perform technical reviews of projects at the end of the design phase and before testing is performed, but the details of this process have not been finalized. In addition, CMS implemented a new version of its IT investment database in November 2000 with enhancements intended to improve its usefulness in tracking project spending and performance.

As the agency\u2019s mission has grown over the years, its discretionary dollars that fund IT and other operations to adminster its programs have been stretched thinner. Budget pressures have forced the Congress to make difficult decisions to limit agencies\u2019 discretionary spending. Like many other federal agencies, CMS has been operating with a discretionary budget to administer its programs that has only slightly increased over the past 10 years. Yet, during the last decade, mandatory spending on Medicare benefit payments has doubled, and CMS\u2019 overall and IT workload increased appreciably. This is due mainly to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and BBA requirements and new non-Medicare programmatic responsibilities, such as the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). BBA alone had 335 provisions requiring CMS to make substantial changes to the Medicare program. In 1998\u2014a key BBA implementation year\u2014the agency was doing this work with about 1,000 fewer employees than it had in 1980. In fiscal year 2000, Medicare\u2019s operating costs represented less than 2 percent of the program\u2019s benefit outlays, far below the percentage for private or nonprofit insurers, even after accounting for differences in the functions each performs.", "CMS\u2019 IT projects compete for resources with other agency responsibilities of national importance, some of which are also lacking in funds and staff. For example, in the area of nursing home quality, CMS has made negligible use of its most effective oversight technique\u2014a federally conducted nursing home inspection to assess how well state inspectors have identified serious deficiencies in nursing facilities. Conducting these independent inspections, known as comparative surveys, is important to check the quality of state inspections because some state inspectors have missed significant problems. However, CMS has lacked sufficient staff to perform an adequate number of these checks. CMS\u2019 ability to oversee the performance of its Medicare claims administration contractors is similarly constrained. After weaknesses in contractors\u2019 performance of critical activities to assure accurate payment were detected, in fiscal year 2001, the agency requested funding for 100 additional positions to focus on key contractor oversight activities, such as monitoring claims processing and reviewing payments made to providers.", "With the many program priorities in CMS\u2014including maintaining current systems\u2014allocating funds for IT improvements is a difficult juggling act. Currently, HIGLAS, which is CMS\u2019 planned financial management system now under development, is one of the agency\u2019s top IT priorities. It is expected to have the capacity to aggregate financial information that now resides in the stand-alone claims processing systems of the contractors. The agency allotted an additional $10 million to HIGLAS for its development in fiscal year 2001 to purchase and customize needed software. At the same time, funding had to be decreased or eliminated entirely for other systems, including the Provider Enrollment, Chain and Ownership System (PECOS), a centralized national provider enrollment database; NMUD; and the Contractor Management Information System (CMIS), a contractor monitoring database. (See table 2 for discussion of the role these systems are designed to play in modernizing Medicare.) Delays in developing these systems have considerably slowed efforts by CMS and its contractors to conduct Medicare program monitoring and policy development activities more competently and efficiently.", "Because CMS must make trade-offs that affect its ability to manage the Medicare program, having a process to manage its IT and other programmatic investments can help ensure that the most critical activities are funded. The development of CMS\u2019 database for beneficiaries\u2019 use of services\u2014NMUD\u2014is a case in point. CMS originally allotted $600,000 to the NMUD project for fiscal year 2001. However, this amount did not reflect the funds needed to build in the capacity to assemble and maintain beneficiary encounter data used in Medicare+Choice to fulfill the BBA requirement for a health-based risk adjuster. Once staff recognized the necessity of storing encounter data, CMS redistributed IT funds to support developing a component in NMUD that had the capacity to assemble and maintain those data in a user-friendly format.", "One of the difficulties of trying to conduct long-term improvement projects is that unexpected new priorities requiring immediate attention, such as new program requirements with short implementation time frames, can push longer term projects to the end of the funding queue. For example, due to an unexpected spike in claims processing and appeals workloads, CMS staff told us that claims administration contractors would either need to be allocated more funding than anticipated in fiscal year 2001 or the contractors would have to shift funds from other functions, such as their provider and beneficiary education efforts, to address added claims processing and appeals workload. Statutory mandates often have hidden systems costs that can become ongoing expenses for which the agency does not get additional funding. For example, while adding an improved risk adjuster for Medicare+Choice appeared to be a small legislative provision, maintaining information for the risk adjuster will end up costing the agency about $20 million to $30 million per year as a new, ongoing cost."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Human Capital Challenges Could Slow Modernization Efforts", "paragraphs": ["The success of CMS\u2019 efforts to modernize its systems and implement effective planning and management processes hinges on its ability to build, prepare, and manage its IT workforce.

However, as noted, CMS lacks a complete architecture and migration plan to detail its current capacity and proposed IT needs. Without such information about its needs, CMS will have difficulty determining the skills needed to accomplish its IT modernization.

To ensure greater rigor in the execution of its systems renovation and development, the agency must develop key IT planning documents and requisite processes that are currently lacking. This includes further developing the enterprise architecture documentation, particularly the agency\u2019s information flows and data elements. However, this cannot be accomplished by OIS alone. The agency\u2019s top leadership must engage the efforts not only of the technical staff in OIS but also of staff members in program and administrative units to complete its enterprise architecture plans. The participation of key program and administrative staff members is particularly important to establish the processes needed to ensure data reliability and relevance. In conjunction with CMS\u2019 other units, the CIO needs to develop a migration plan that will prioritize and sequence IT projects so that officials throughout the agency understand the roadmap they are following to move toward a modernized IT environment.", "CMS must also tighten project review, approval, and evaluation procedures, ensuring that the selection and management of IT projects receive adequate attention from senior officials agencywide. Selection and management would be strengthened when CMS develops and uses written criteria to prioritize project selection, requires technical reviews, and has an adequate agencywide process for monitoring the status of projects. In addition, CMS is not currently realizing the full value of lessons learned from its modernization efforts because it does not have a systematic process to evaluate them. Such an evaluative process could help the agency capitalize on successes and avoid obstacles in developing its next generation of projects. Furthermore, while CMS has been taking steps to assess its workforce skills, it still needs to complete its assessment of IT staffing needs and identify and fill skill gaps.
