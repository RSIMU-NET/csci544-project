However, GAO also found that some of these veterans experienced delays related to the processing of their enrollment applications, contacting them to schedule appointments, and completing comprehensive mental health evaluations. These delays were similar to some GAO had identified in previous work pertaining to veterans' access to care nationwide.", "For the sample of veterans' medical records that GAO reviewed, VAPIHCS referred nearly all specialty care to non-VA providers within VHA's timeliness goal, but the time taken to provide care was variable and sometimes lengthy.

GAO found VAPIHCS did not always manage referrals to the military treatment facility in a timely way and there was inconsistent guidance describing the roles and responsibilities of the VAPIHCS staff involved in the process. These weaknesses may have contributed to the amount of time it took for veterans to receive specialty care services.", "GAO also found that VAPIHCS faces challenges recruiting and retaining physicians. As of October 2017, 17 of approximately 100 VAPIHCS physician positions were vacant, as were several other types of health care providers. Some of the challenges VAPIHCS faced are unique to the Pacific Islands, such as the availability of only one local medical school from which to recruit, along with travel burdens and a high cost of living that may discourage physicians from relocating there. Other challenges were similar to those GAO has previously identified as faced by VA medical centers across the country, such as differences in interpretation of hiring and recruiting policies. VAPIHCS officials said they use several strategies to help recruit and retain physicians, including VHA strategies used by other VA medical centers such as financial incentives and an educational debt reduction program. Although they described limits to the success of some of these strategies, they have not evaluated their effectiveness. Without completing an evaluation of its strategies, VAPIHCS may not be optimizing its resources to improve its hiring efforts and may continue to struggle with physician shortages."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO makes four recommendations, including that VAPIHCS improve monitoring of referrals to one DOD facility and evaluate the effectiveness of physician recruitment and retention strategies.

While some outpatient specialty care is  provided at the Spark M. Matsunaga VAMC and the 10 clinics, VAPIHCS  primarily provides outpatient primary and mental health care services.  Unlike most VAMCs, the Spark M. Matsunaga VAMC does not include an  inpatient hospital. For most inpatient and other specialty care, veterans  are referred to local military treatment facilities through joint venture and  sharing agreements with the Department of Defense (DOD) or to non-VA  providers in the community. In particular, VAPIHCS partners with Tripler  Army Medical Center (TAMC) through a joint venture in Hawaii and U.S.  Naval Hospital Guam (NHG) through a sharing agreement, and also  offers veterans access to non-VA providers in the community through the  Veterans Choice Program (Choice Program).", "In recent years, we and the VA Office of the Inspector General (OIG)  have expressed concerns about veterans\u2019 ability to access timely medical  care and VHA\u2019s oversight of its appointment scheduling practices.

However, we also found that TriWest did not follow the  requirements for mailing letters for 3 of the referrals when it was  unable to reach the veterans by phone. If TriWest is unable to reach a  veteran after calling a minimum of three times over 4 business days, a  letter is to be mailed to the veteran on the 7th business day after  receiving the referral notifying them that they have 10 business days  from the date of the letter to contact TriWest to schedule an  appointment. For these 3 referrals, TriWest mailed a letter, but did not  do so until one day later than the required 7th business day after  receiving and accepting the referral.", "We found that after reaching the veteran, TriWest staff scheduled  appointments for 17 of the 25 referrals within the 5 business  days required for scheduling an appointment after the veteran  opts in to the Choice Program. (See table 8.) We found varying  reasons that may have delayed the scheduling of an appointment. For  example, some records showed that TriWest staff did not begin to call  a provider until 4 or more days after they reached the veteran and  confirmed they wanted to utilize, or opt in to, the Choice Program to  receive care. In addition, some providers required time to review the  veteran\u2019s medical record before scheduling the appointment with  TriWest.", "We found that 20 of the 30 veterans referred to Choice Program  providers received care within VHA\u2019s 30-day timeliness goal that  VA used to evaluate TriWest\u2019s performance under its contract.  TriWest has an overall timeliness goal from VHA to provide veterans  care through Choice Program providers, although the way this was  calculated changed during our review due to changes in their practice  and modifications to the contract. The 20 veterans that received  care within the timeliness goal did so within an average of 14 days.  The 10 veterans that did not receive care within the 30-day timeliness  goal waited between 31 and 126 days (an average of 62 days).  Veteran preferences and specific provider tendencies sometimes led  to delays in scheduling, causing care to be completed outside VHA\u2019s  timeliness goal. For example, our review of TriWest records found that  two veterans in Guam noted that they preferred to stay on island for  their ophthalmology referrals, rather than flying to Honolulu, and the  non-VA Guam orthopedist sometimes took a week or more to review  a veteran\u2019s file before scheduling the appointment with TriWest.", "The 30-day timeliness goal that VA used to evaluate TriWest\u2019s  performance captured a portion of the overall amount of time that it took  for these veterans to receive care. We found that the number of days  from the referral\u2019s creation to the date that veterans received care from  Choice Program providers varied by clinic, and ranged from 19 to 239  days, with the average being 75 days. (See table 9.) This range and  average includes circumstances outside of TriWest\u2019s control; for example,  four veterans in our sample chose to reschedule their appointments  for a later date. One veteran from American Samoa was originally  scheduled for an appointment within 40 days of the referral\u2019s creation  date; however, the veteran chose to reschedule the appointment and,  in doing so, it took a total of 166 days for the veteran to be seen.  three other veterans experienced delays in care after VAPIHCS  initially sent their referrals to TAMC or NHG and later redirected the  referrals to the Choice Program. VAPIHCS referred one veteran from  Guam for specialty care at NHG. However, when VAPIHCS  discovered that NHG could not provide care to the veteran, the  veteran\u2019s referral was redirected to the Choice Program 88 days after  the referral creation date.

These weaknesses may have  contributed to the amount of time it took for veterans to receive care, or  resulted in the veteran not receiving care.", "Military Treatment Facility Referral  Process  After the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)  Pacific Islands Health Care System  (VAPIHCS) staff review a referral and decide  care should be rendered at a military  treatment facility, there are two different  processes for sending the referral to Tripler  Army Medical Center (TAMC) or Naval  Hospital Guam (NHG). If it is determined that  a veteran needs care at TAMC, VAPIHCS  staff review and send the referral to TAMC\u2019s  VA Referral Center. There, TAMC staff enters  the referral information into DOD\u2019s electronic  medical record system and completes the  appointment scheduling process. If it is  determined that a veteran needs care at NHG,  VAPIHCS staff review and send the referral to  designated staff on Guam who have access to  enter the referral directly into NHG\u2019s electronic  medical record. After the designated staff on  Guam enter the referral into the system, NHG  staff are then responsible for scheduling the  veteran\u2019s appointment.", "Some referrals sent to NHG were incorrectly canceled by VAPIHCS  staff. Specifically, in addition to the 10 completed referrals we reviewed,  we also examined 5 referrals sent to NHG that were subsequently  canceled by VAPIHCS staff responsible for referral management, but with  no indication of appointments ever being scheduled. The reason for  cancelations recorded in the veterans\u2019 medical records was that the  referrals had been open for more than 90 days; however, this practice is  not in alignment with VHA policy. According to VHA policy confirmed by a  VHA official, canceling a referral is an action taken by the receiving  service to alert the sending provider that additional information is needed,  or to correct an obvious error in the referral; a referral should not be  canceled due to the length of time the referral has been open without care  being provided. VHA policy also states that canceled referrals older than  90 days are not to be resubmitted by the sending provider; instead, the  sending provider must reassess the patient\u2019s needs, as the clinical  circumstances may have changed, and create a new referral, as  necessary. Based on our review, it is unclear why VAPIHCS staff  responsible for referral management were not following VHA policy for  canceling referrals, whether it was because they did not understand the  policy or for other reasons. Federal internal control standards require  management to review processes in a timely manner to ensure that  control activities are appropriately designed and implemented. Because  our review found that in some cases VAPIHCS staff were not following  VHA\u2019s referral policy, it is important for VAPIHCS to determine why staff  are not adhering to the policy and take needed steps to ensure  compliance. Ultimately, in our review of the veterans\u2019 medical records, we  did not find documentation that these veterans received the  recommended care included in the canceled referrals. Additionally, we did  not find evidence that four of the five referrals had been updated and  resubmitted, or that any new referrals had been submitted in their place,  which may have delayed needed care; or that the five affected veterans  were contacted by VAPIHCS to understand why appointments had not  been scheduled.", "Inconsistent guidance exists describing the roles and  responsibilities of VAPIHCS staff involved in the NHG referral  process. We identified different VAPIHCS guidance that provided  inconsistent descriptions of the referral process with NHG. For example, a  VAPIHCS flowchart depicting the referral process states that, after  review, the referral is to be sent to a VAPIHCS staff member embedded  within NHG to enter the referral information into NHG\u2019s electronic medical  record. However, language in the referral itself states that, after review,  the referral is sent to Guam clinic staff to enter into NHG\u2019s record.  Federal internal control standards call for management to assign  responsibility and delegate authority to achieve an agency\u2019s objectives.", "A VAPIHCS official stated that the embedded member within NHG  entering in referrals in NHG\u2019s electronic medical record was an interim fix  and that there are plans in place for those responsibilities to be  transferred to NHG staff. Specifically, VAPIHCS and NHG officials  reported that NHG plans to hire two staff members to manage the referral  process, but as of December 2017, these 2 staff members had not yet  been hired due to budgetary constraints. Whether or not NHG hires  additional staff, it is important for VAPIHCS to clarify and document the  roles and responsibilities of their staff for sending, managing, and  monitoring referrals to NHG. Without such clarification, there is the risk for  confusion about responsibilities for entering referrals into NHG\u2019s  electronic medical record, which could potentially create delays in  appointment scheduling and veterans\u2019 receiving care.", "VAPIHCS did not always manage referrals to NHG in a timely way.  Our review found instances throughout the NHG referral process where  lack of timely referral management by VAPIHCS staff may have  contributed to delays in veterans receiving care. VHA policy states that  the referral process should include appropriate staff to manage referral  notification, disposition, scheduling and completion; and designate staff to  run referral reports, which must be reviewed at least weekly to resolve  issues. In addition, federal internal control standards state than an  organization should establish and operate monitoring activities to  determine appropriate corrective actions on a timely basis.", "One factor that contributed to the lack of timely referral management was  that VAPIHCS does not effectively monitor the referrals sent to NHG.", "First, VAPIHCS staff did not always monitor the availability of services  at NHG with the frequency necessary to ensure the timeliness of  referral management. NHG is to provide VAPIHCS with a list of  available outpatient services no less than quarterly so VAPIHCS can  determine if a referral for a specific service can be made to NHG; we  confirmed that NHG provided these lists quarterly during our review  time frame. However, VAPIHCS staff did not monitor whether services  remained available after sending referrals to NHG in a timely manner.  For example, one veteran in our review was originally referred to NHG  in late November 2016, but it was not until VAPIHCS staff followed up  on the referral in early February 2017 that they were informed that  NHG could not accommodate the veteran at that time and that they  instead should refer the veteran to a non-VA provider. This may have  contributed to delay in care for the veteran by more than 2 months.", "Second, VAPIHCS staff did not ensure that referrals were entered into  NHG\u2019s electronic medical record system in a timely manner to begin  the appointment scheduling process; under the process agreed to by  VAPIHCS and NHG, it is the responsibility of designated VAPIHCS  staff to enter referrals into the NHG electronic medical record system.  For example, VAPIHCS staff referred one veteran for care to NHG in  November 2016. However, it was not until December 2016\u2014one  month later\u2014that VAPIHCS staff checked on the status of the referral.  Finding no evidence of actions taken to schedule an appointment,  staff added a reminder for the embedded VAPIHCS staff member at  NHG to enter the referral into NHG\u2019s electronic medical record, to  restart the appointment scheduling process.", "Third, VAPIHCS staff did not always manage referrals to ensure the  timely disposition and scheduling of appointments. Among the five  canceled referrals that we reviewed, we found VAPIHCS staff noticed  appointments had not been scheduled only when they reviewed the  referrals months later. For example, of the five referrals VAPIHCS  sent to NHG, one referral, sent in mid-November 2016, was canceled in early  February 2017 after VAPIHCS staff found no evidence that an  appointment had or would be scheduled. another referral was sent in late November 2016. After VAPIHCS  staff reviewed the referral and found no evidence that an  appointment had or would be scheduled, they noted that the  referral was 101 days old and canceled it in late January 2017.", "VAPIHCS staff referred another veteran to NHG in mid-March  2017. After VAPIHCS staff reviewed the referral and found no  evidence that an appointment had or would be scheduled, they  noted that the referral was almost 4 months old and canceled it in  June 2017.", "VAPIHCS\u2019 lack of timely referral management was also due to poor  communication between VAPIHCS staff and NHG. Federal internal  control standards state that an organization should communicate with  external bodies to receive the necessary quality information required to  achieve the entity\u2019s objectives. A VAPIHCS official stated that VAPIHCS  staff do not have the same level of communication with NHG as they do  with TAMC, which has its own staff to schedule veteran appointments and  communicate that information back to VAPIHCS on a weekly basis,  including if they cannot schedule a veteran. Instead, the official stated  that VAPIHCS staff have to independently monitor the status of referrals  to NHG, or ask the embedded VAPIHCS staff member at NHG to  complete referral research for them. In addition, our review of the referral  notes for these veterans found no evidence of communication between  VAPIHCS staff and NHG staff regarding NHG\u2019s efforts to schedule  appointments for veterans before VAPIHCS staff canceled them.  Furthermore, we also found no evidence of communication regarding  outreach by NHG staff to VAPIHCS staff to discuss any scheduling  difficulties, such as being unable to contact a veteran.", "Because VAPIHCS relies on NHG to provide inpatient and specialty care  services for veterans from Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern  Mariana Islands, it is essential that referrals sent to NHG are managed in  a timely manner, including verifying the availability of services and  ensuring referrals are entered into NHG\u2019s electronic medical record  system, as well as communicating with NHG about the status of veterans\u2019  appointments.

Having an adequate physician workforce is key to ensuring  veterans\u2019 timely access to health care. Overall, there were at least 17  physician vacancies out of approximately 100 positions across VAPIHCS  as of October 2017, as well as several more vacancies for other types of  health care providers, some of which have been unfilled for some time.  For example, Guam clinic staff told us that at one point between October  2016 and March 2017, the period of our medical record review, the clinic  had 1.8 primary care physician full-time equivalents even though it was  authorized for 4. VAPIHCS officials told us they are constantly trying to  recruit physicians for their facilities.", "Recruitment and Retention Challenges Unique to VAPIHCS. Through  our review of relevant literature and interviews with VAPIHCS officials, we  learned that physician recruitment is challenging for VAPIHCS in the  following ways, particularly because of its geographic remoteness:", "There is one local medical school and limited local providers  from which VAPIHCS recruits. The University of Hawaii\u2019s John A.  Burns School of Medicine is the only local medical school across  Hawaii, Guam, and American Samoa from which VAPIHCS recruits  physicians.", "The islands of American Samoa, Guam, and Hawaii all include  counties, facilities, or populations designated as Health  Professional Shortage Areas, which indicate health care provider  shortages in primary, dental, or mental health care. These  designations indicate a limited number of local physicians for  VAPIHCS to target in the event of a vacancy. A 2015 University of  Hawaii study further highlighted these shortages. It found that the  Hawaiian Islands had a deficit of more than 600 physicians, with a  projected shortage of between 800 and 1,500 physicians by 2020.  This requires VAPIHCS to focus its recruitment efforts on medical  schools and physicians located on the mainland United States.", "Travel options for VAPIHCS staff and their families are limited.", "Finding physicians that are willing to relocate to such remote locations  is difficult, according to VAPIHCS officials. In prior work, we found that  other VAMCs experienced challenges recruiting physicians who were  reluctant to practice in rural or geographically remote areas. This  challenge is likely more pronounced for VAPIHCS, given the location  of its clinics. Both American Samoa and Guam are thousands of miles  from the mainland United States and travel to and from these islands  requires significant time and money. For example, American Samoa  only has two direct commercial flights a week (on Mondays and  Fridays) and Guam has only a daily direct commercial flight to  Honolulu. While the Hawaiian Islands are more accessible to the  mainland, they are still geographically isolated relative to the rest of  the United States, and face some of the same travel challenges as  American Samoa and Guam.", "Residents face a high cost of living, limited community  resources, and trade-offs associated with island living. While  other regions of the country face similar challenges, they may be  more pronounced living on an island where alternatives are limited.  The cost of living in Hawaii is higher than the nationwide average, and  VAPIHCS officials told us that the real estate market in Hawaii is  extremely expensive. These officials also said that physician  candidates have raised concerns about the quality of the public school  system in some areas of the islands, which could add a potential  expense of sending their children to private schools and thus deter  them from accepting employment. Other concerns include, for  example, the lack of a veterinarian on American Samoa. According to  an official, VAPIHCS lost a candidate who had agreed to relocate to  the island until learning of the lack of veterinary services.", "Technical issues due to locations. One physician in American  Samoa told us that it can take almost 1.5 hours to access the web- based program VHA offers for voice-activated dictation of medical  notes, and thus, instead, he often uses services offline, although  doing so means he has to enter his notes into VA\u2019s medical record at  a later time. Guam clinic staff, including physicians, also face unique  challenges due to working across the International Date Line from the  Spark M. Matsunaga VAMC. Specifically, the Guam clinic information  technology system operates off of a server located in Honolulu that is  20 hours, or almost a day, behind Guam. Veterans being treated in  Guam are essentially being treated in the \u201cfuture\u201d according to VA\u2019s  server in Honolulu, as the date of a health care appointment in Guam  is always one day ahead of the server in Honolulu. For example, if a  Guam physician sees a patient on Monday at 3:00 pm, it is 7:00 pm  on Sunday in Honolulu. As a result, physicians must wait until the next  day to retroactively complete clinical notes. Officials also said that  physicians are frustrated working in a system that may require  multiple days to complete clinical notes, and that this issue has  impacted physician recruitment and retention. Guam clinic staff also  said that, due to the time change, they only have about 16 business  hours per week that the clinic is open that overlap with business hours  of VAPIHCS officials working in Honolulu, which limits the amount of  time physicians at the Guam clinic can consult with other VAPIHCS  physicians or administrators in Honolulu.", "Recruitment and Retention Challenges across VHA. VAPIHCS has  encountered some of the same physician recruitment and retention  challenges that we have previously found are common across VHA,  although some of these challenges may be compounded by the Pacific  Islands\u2019 geographic remoteness. For example:", "Differences in interpretation of recruiting and hiring policies may  have contributed to lengthy recruiting times. In prior work, we  found that differences in VAMC officials\u2019 understanding of some of  VHA\u2019s recruitment and hiring policies contributed to lengthy  recruitment and hiring processes. We also heard differences in  policy interpretations during our discussions with VAPIHCS officials  for this review. For example, some officials mentioned that a physician  vacancy must be posted to USAJobs; however, VHA\u2019s hiring  authorities allow facilities to hire physicians for positions without  regard to civil service requirements, such as requiring public notice of  the vacancy. Some VAPIHCS officials also mentioned having to wait  to post a position until after the predecessor had vacated it, while  another official correctly noted that the recruitment process to replace  a departing physician can begin before the position is vacated. Failure  to understand VHA\u2019s hiring authorities and use an expeditious hiring  process most suitable for a particular vacancy may contribute to the  length of the recruitment process.", "Lack of interoperable electronic medical record systems between  VA and DOD. We have reported for more than a decade that VA and  DOD lack interoperable electronic medical record systems that permit  the efficient electronic exchange of patient health information. VA  and DOD partly addressed the lack of interoperability by utilizing a  web-based Joint Legacy Viewer to facilitate information-sharing for VA  and DOD patients, including those at VAPIHCS, NHG, and TAMC.  The Joint Legacy Viewer provides VAPIHCS physicians with access  to clinical notes on a veteran being treated at a military treatment  facility. However, VAPIHCS and DOD officials told us that there are  challenges using the Joint Legacy Viewer, including the absence of  robust information found in electronic medical records, the need for  physicians to toggle between multiple applications to obtain a patient\u2019s  full history, slow networks, and reduced worker productivity as a result  of operating several different systems simultaneously.

Officials also said they promoted  VAPIHCS\u2019 unique relationship with DOD through its joint venture with  TAMC in Honolulu as an incentive for moving to Hawaii.

VAPIHCS  did not offer any other financial incentives that year.", "Education Debt Reduction Program. Through the Education Debt  Reduction Program, VHA reimburses qualifying education loan debt  for employees, including physicians, in hard-to-recruit positions. In  fiscal year 2017, three primary care physicians in VAPIHCS had  applications approved for this program. Each recipient was awarded,  on average, $17,000. VAPIHCS officials said the program was  generally considered a \u201cgreat recruiting tool,\u201d but that its success was  inconsistent given uncertainties regarding the amount of funding that  would be available to the facility in a given year. Funds for the  Education Debt Reduction Program, which are centrally managed by  VHA\u2019s Healthcare Retention and Recruitment Office, are based on the  availability of funds and demand each year.

These best practices  include, for example, leveraging increased pay rates when recruiting  physicians, engaging with the VISN recruiter for hard-to-fill vacancies,  and identifying interview questions and an interview panel before  recruitment begins. VAPIHCS officials reported that they do not use  other best practices such as utilizing VA\u2019s human resources program  for tracking recruitment actions and having a dedicated physician  recruiter because they already have an alternate practice in place or a  practice does not match their needs, among other reasons. However,  officials told us they plan to examine whether there are opportunities  to leverage any of these remaining best practices.", "As noted, in a prior report we recommended that VHA should conduct a  comprehensive, system-wide evaluation of the physician recruitment and  retention strategies used by VAMCs to determine their overall  effectiveness, identify and implement improvements, ensure coordination  across VHA offices, and establish an ongoing monitoring process.  However, because VAMCs are primarily responsible for managing their  own employee recruitment and retention programs and given the unique  and ongoing challenges VAPIHCS has experienced with recruiting and  retaining physicians, it is also important for VAPIHCS to similarly evaluate  whether the strategies it uses are effective.

For example, according to VAPIHCS  officials,  there is only one dermatologist on Guam practicing at NHG, and there  is only one gastroenterologist in the community providing certain  services;", "Kauai has a shortage of oncologists;", "Maui has a shortage of cardiologists; and", "American Samoa has a shortage of almost all types of specialty care  providers because it only has one hospital\u2014the Lyndon B. Johnson  Tropical Medical Center\u2014to provide medical care to its approximate  55,000 residents. VAPIHCS officials said the hospital is lacking many  specialty services. According to VA, it does not authorize non-VA care  there because the hospital receives funding from other federal  agencies to provide medical services. Additionally, the hospital is not  accredited for safety and quality. TriWest officials reiterated that  there are virtually no specialty providers available on American  Samoa for them to contract with; as of July 2017, there was only one  Choice Program provider contracted on the island. As a result,  essentially all eligible veterans must travel to Hawaii for specialty care  services.", "Significant travel required of veterans. Because many of the islands  lack certain specialty providers, VAPIHCS officials said that veterans  often must fly elsewhere to obtain care. While travelling such distances  helps improve veterans\u2019 access to health care services, it also creates  challenges. For example, such travel requires time away from their  homes and families, which may be particularly difficult for veterans in poor  health. The time and distance required for travel can also be quite  significant\u2014for example, veterans from American Samoa, Guam, and the  Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands must travel thousands of  miles by plane to receive services in Honolulu. A Guam veterans group  said that veterans were frustrated with having to fly 8 hours to Hawaii for  health care services. In instances where the necessary services are  beyond those available in Honolulu, veterans must fly to the mainland  United States for care\u2014a flight from Honolulu to California adds about 5  hours. The flight times are even longer for veterans travelling from  American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands,  and Guam. Figure 2 illustrates the locations of veterans enrolled in  VAPIHCS and the distances and flight times they may need to travel to  receive care.", "According to VAPIHCS data, most VAPIHCS veterans travelling for health  care services over the years have received care in Honolulu, although  some have had to travel to the mainland United States for subspecialty  care or highly specialized care such as organ transplants. Eligible  veterans are provided reimbursement for travel-related expenses under  VHA\u2019s Beneficiary Travel Program. In fiscal year 2017, VAPIHCS  provided beneficiary travel funds to 348 veterans from American Samoa  and 92 veterans from Guam to travel to Honolulu for care, for a total of  678 trips. During this same year, 15 veterans traveled to the mainland  United States for care. VAPIHCS reported that, overall, 830 VAPIHCS  veterans used beneficiary travel benefits to travel to Honolulu or the  mainland United States for care that year. This represents approximately  2 percent of the total number of veterans (51,213) who received some  type of care through VAPIHCS in fiscal year 2017. Veterans are  responsible for paying for travel if they are ineligible for travel benefits and  travel is required to receive care. The significant costs associated with  travel among the Pacific islands\u2014flights, lodging, meals\u2014could be cost  prohibitive for these veterans and, as a result, they may be unable to  access VA or non-VA health care services off island.", "Limitations with telehealth services. Veterans face challenges  accessing health care services due to limitations with telehealth services.  For example, VAPIHCS officials told us there are limitations with the  availability of internet services on the islands of Guam and American  Samoa. This could lead to disruptions\u2014or even cancellations\u2014of  veterans\u2019 telehealth appointments. For example, VAPIHCS officials  shared that damaged cables in the Pacific Ocean due to natural disasters  and equipment failure on the part of internet service providers on the  islands have led to disrupted and cancelled appointments for veterans. In  March 2018, VAPIHCS reported that it had increased bandwidth and  purchased new equipment to help support its telehealth efforts.  Additionally, the extent to which a veteran can receive telehealth in his or  her home versus the local clinic may depend upon the licensure of the  provider delivering care. If a veteran is receiving telehealth services while  he or she is physically located in a clinic, under federal law, the provider  is not required to be licensed in the state in which the facility is  located. When the patient is receiving telehealth services at home,  however, a state may require that the provider be licensed in the state in  which the patient is located. An official said that this is currently  hampering VAPIHCS\u2019 telehealth expansion efforts into the home."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VAPIHCS Uses Several Strategies to Improve Veterans Access to Health Care, including the Use of Travelling Providers and Increased Use of Telehealth", "paragraphs": ["VAPIHCS has utilized a system of travelling VAPIHCS providers and is  working to improve its use of telehealth services to better ensure  veterans\u2019 timely access to care, among other strategies, according to  VAPIHCS officials.", "Use of travelling providers. VAPIHCS officials reported that travelling  providers enable VAPIHCS to better ensure access for veterans who are  not eligible for beneficiary travel, and reduce the travel burden on  veterans who are. Furthermore, they noted that it can be more cost  effective for VAPIHCS to send a travelling provider to an island on a set  schedule than it is to fly veterans to Honolulu for care. These providers  also help expand access by providing specialty care that is in short supply  or missing entirely in some communities. For example, a VAPIHCS  optometrist travels to American Samoa for one week each month,  according to officials, because there is no board-certified optometrist on  the island. In addition, the travelling providers offer veterans the  opportunity to receive specialty care from a VA provider.", "Officials said they adjust the travelling providers\u2019 schedules to reflect  changes in service availability in the local communities. Table 11  illustrates the types of VAPIHCS travelling providers and the frequency  with which they visit different clinics, as of December 2017.", "Increased use of telehealth services. Even though internet service on  the Pacific Islands is not always reliable as previously noted, VAPIHCS  has been increasing its use of telehealth services to improve veterans\u2019  access to health care services. In fiscal year 2017, VAPIHCS reported  that 3,046 VAPIHCS veterans utilized clinic-based telehealth services  compared to 1,299 veterans in fiscal year 2011, an increase of more than  134 percent.", "VAPIHCS launched two new telehealth hubs in June 2017:", "According to VA officials, VAPIHCS was 1 of 8 VAMCs selected to  establish a hub, or center for delivery of teleprimary care from the  VAMC to distant clinics within its system. According to VAPIHCS  officials, the teleprimary care hub in the Spark M. Matsunaga VAMC is  currently providing services to veterans at the Guam clinic and is  exploring opportunities to provide teleurgent care in partnership with  VAPIHCS\u2019 call center. Officials further noted this would allow  telehealth staff to provide veterans with \u201calmost instant access\u201d to  health care services and, if successful, help improve veterans\u2019 timely  access to care by increasing the number of appointments at the  clinics that could be dedicated to more complex concerns. VAPIHCS  officials also said that the teleprimary care hub would also be used for  long-term coverage for clinics with provider vacancies.", "Similarly, VAPIHCS was one of 11 VAMCs selected to establish a  telemental health hub. According to VAPIHCS officials, this hub is  currently serving veterans at the Oahu, Guam, and Molokai clinics  and one of the Hawaii clinics (Hilo), with plans to expand services to  the Kauai clinic in the future.", "Overall, officials said that feedback from veterans using these hubs has  been \u201coverwhelmingly positive,\u201d as veterans appreciate receiving care  from VAPIHCS providers, the privacy afforded by telehealth, and not  having to travel for their services. The number of telehealth users in  VAPIHCS is likely to continue increasing as a result of these new hubs.", "While feedback has been positive, VAPIHCS officials said they have  experienced some challenges with the launch of these hubs, including the  time and date difference between Guam and Honolulu where the staff for  both hubs are located. Staff from the hubs had to adjust their schedules  to support Guam\u2019s hours given that only 16 business hours per week  overlap between the two islands. Having sufficient space in the clinics for  telehealth services is another challenge. To address this, one official said  they are encouraging veterans to hold video visits with their providers  from their homes if clinical exams are not required during their  appointments.", "Improvements to clinical space. Because sufficient examination and  treatment space is lacking in many of its clinics, VAPIHCS is in the  process of building new or expanding existing clinics to increase the  number and type of services available to veterans. According to a  VAPIHCS official, as of August 2017, VAPIHCS has plans to replace six  of its existing clinics and open one new clinic. These new clinics are  expected to be open by fiscal year 2020. For example, the American  Samoa clinic will be expanded to include additional space for mental  health consultations and group meeting spaces, while the Guam clinic will  be expanded to include additional primary and mental health care clinic  space. This may help address a concern of the Guam veterans group we  spoke with in Guam, who said the clinic was too small and did not offer  sufficient patient privacy. According to VAPIHCS officials, VAPIHCS\u2019 new  clinic, expected to open in 2020, is to be located on the island of Oahu  and will be a multi-specialty outpatient clinic offering many different  services, including primary care, mental health, telemedicine, women\u2019s  care, dental care, a pain clinic, physical and occupational therapy,  prosthetic, laboratory and pathology, pharmacy, and imaging services.", "Improvements to the beneficiary travel process. VAPIHCS is in the  process of updating its process for arranging beneficiary travel, which  ultimately could improve veterans\u2019 access to care. Under the old process,  officials told us that much of the responsibility for coordinating veterans\u2019  travel fell on nursing and administrative staff, creating stress and reducing  the amount of time nurses could spend on providing patient care. As a  result, VAPIHCS decided to centralize its beneficiary travel process in the  Office of Beneficiary Travel in Honolulu. The goal, according to VAPIHCS  officials, is to remove the clinic staff from the process\u2014thereby increasing  the amount of time dedicated to their clinical duties\u2014and instead  encourage veterans to work directly with the staff in Honolulu to arrange  their travel. As of September 2017, VAPIHCS was still in the process of  implementing this new process. VAPIHCS also created a task force to  improve the process for arranging travel for American Samoa veterans  needing care off-island. As a result of their efforts, VAPIHCS officials  reported in December 2017 that they had managed to reduce the time  clinic staff in American Samoa dedicated each day to addressing travel  issues from an average of 408 minutes to 64 minutes.", "Communicating with veterans about VA and Non-VA services.  VAPIHCS uses a variety of mechanisms to communicate with veterans  about access to VA and non-VA health care services. Veterans are  introduced to these services through New Veteran Orientations that are  offered at some of the clinics. VAPIHCS also gives newly enrolled  veterans handbooks that are specific to the clinics where they enrolled.  VAPIHCS also communicates with veterans through town hall meetings,  health forums, its Facebook page, television and radio shows, and  community events. For example, staff from the American Samoa clinic  told us that they partner with a local television station to host a 30-minute  monthly segment to educate veterans about available VA services.  VAPIHCS officials reported they had planned to conduct approximately  170 outreach events, spanning 9 islands and targeting about 6,000  veterans, for fiscal year 2017. VAPIHCS officials told us that they try to  provide culturally appropriate communications with veterans of the  different Pacific Islands. For example, they said they are planning to  translate materials into Samoan for veterans from American Samoa. They  also recognize that many veterans prefer face-to-face interactions with  VA officials rather than receiving information electronically; for example,  the Hawaiian tradition known as \u201ctalk story\u201d focuses on informal  conversations and sharing information with friends in the community."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["VAPIHCS has generally provided primary and mental health care within  VHA\u2019s timeliness goals for most veterans reviewed, but there are  weaknesses in the referral process for specialty care services. Because  most specialty care services are provided to veterans outside of VA  through DOD providers or through non-VA providers in the community, it  is crucial that VAPIHCS improve its management of these referrals to  ensure adherence to VHA policy. Without improvements to adherence to  VHA policy in the referral process, inconsistent guidance on roles and  responsibilities, and lack of timeliness of referral management, these  weaknesses are likely to persist, and may add to the amount of time it  takes for some veterans to receive care, or may result in some veterans  not receiving care at all.", "In addition, maintaining an adequate clinical workforce to meet the health  care needs of veterans is necessary to ensuring veterans\u2019 timely access  to care. Doing so is particularly important for VAPIHCS given the unique  challenges it faces in recruiting and retaining physicians in the  geographically remote Pacific Islands. It is therefore critical that VAPIHCS  identify and use the most effective recruitment and retention strategies  offered by VHA. However, VAPIHCS has not evaluated the strategies that  it has used to determine if they are the most optimal or if other available  strategies would be more effective. Without completing such an  evaluation, VAPIHCS does not know if it is optimizing its resources to  improve its hiring efforts and ameliorate long-standing physician  shortages."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following four recommendations to VA:  1.  The Secretary of VA should ensure that VAPIHCS review its referral  process for referrals to DOD providers, including referral cancellation,  to determine why VHA policy is not being adhered to and make  changes as needed. (Recommendation 1)  2.  The Secretary of VA should ensure that VAPIHCS clarify guidance to  clearly define and document roles and responsibilities for VAPIHCS  staff involved in the referral process with NHG. (Recommendation 2)  3.  The Secretary of VA should ensure that VAPIHCS improves the  monitoring of referrals and communication with NHG to ensure the  timely management of referrals to NHG, including verifying the  availability of services for veterans; ensuring referrals are entered into  NHG\u2019s electronic medical record system; and obtaining information  about the status of scheduling appointments for veterans.  (Recommendation 3)  4.  The Secretary of VA should ensure that VAPIHCS evaluates the  effectiveness of strategies it currently uses to promote physician  recruitment and retention, including how the strategies could be  improved. The plan should also include an assessment of whether  additional strategies currently offered by VHA would be beneficial.  (Recommendation 4)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to VA and DOD for review and  comment. VA provided written comments, which are reproduced in  appendix I. In addition, both VA and DOD provided technical comments,  which we have incorporated as appropriate.", "In its written comments, VA concurred with three of our four  recommendations and provided information on its plans to address them.  VA partly concurred with our recommendation for VAPIHCS to improve  the monitoring of referrals and communication with NHG to ensure the  timely management of referrals to NHG. For this recommendation, VA  agreed that it should improve its monitoring of referrals by verifying the  availability of services at NHG for veterans and obtaining the status of  their appointments to be scheduled, and noted that VAPIHCS is  developing a standard operating procedure that includes, among other  things, monitoring referrals weekly to resolve issues.", "However, VA did not agree with ensuring referrals are entered into NHG\u2019s  electronic medical record system as part of its monitoring efforts and  stated that it does not have the authority to do so. During our review, we  found that designated VAPIHCS staff on Guam have access to, and are  responsible for entering referrals directly into, NHG\u2019s electronic medical  record. Only after VAPIHCS staff enter referrals directly into NHG\u2019s  electronic medical record did NHG staff assume responsibility for  scheduling veterans\u2019 appointments. We confirmed this practice through  interviews with VAPIHCS and DOD staff and through our review of a  sample of referrals sent to NHG, which showed that VAPIHCS staff had  entered the referrals. Furthermore, the sharing agreement between  VAPIHCS and NHG documented the arrangement for VAPIHCS staff to  be granted access to NHG\u2019s electronic medical record. As long as  VAPIHCS staff continue to be responsible for entering referrals into  NHG\u2019s electronic medical record system, we believe that it is also their  responsibility to monitor the status of these referrals, including ensuring  that referrals are entered correctly and timely. Because VAPIHCS relies  on NHG to provide inpatient and specialty care services for veterans from  Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, it is  important for VAPIHCS to monitor the entire referral management  process to ensure that veterans receive needed care in a timely manner.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees and the Secretaries of Veterans Affairs and Defense.
