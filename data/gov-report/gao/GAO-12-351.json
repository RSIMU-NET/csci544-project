New screening procedures include the designation of three different levels of risk of fraud, waste, and abuse, with categories of providers and suppliers assigned to limited, moderate, and high-risk levels\u0097and those in the highest level subject to the most rigorous screening. For example, providers and suppliers in all three risk levels must undergo licensure checks, while those in moderate- and high-risk levels are subject to unannounced site visits. In addition, CMS implemented new application fees for some providers and suppliers. CMS also added two new Medicare contractors, an automated screening contractor and a site visit contractor, to conduct enhanced enrollment screening and site visits. CMS officials said that they expect the new automated screening contractor to identify additional data sources against which to screen, such as financial, tax, and business data sources. CMS\u0092s implementation of some additional enrollment screening procedures is still in progress. For example, by the end of 2012, CMS plans to contract with two Federal Bureau of Investigation-approved contractors to conduct fingerprint-based criminal background checks of high-risk providers and suppliers. In addition, the agency plans to extend the requirement for surety bonds to high-risk providers and suppliers beyond those already required of suppliers of durable medical equipment, orthotics and supplies.

New  screening procedures that define conditions for provider and supplier  enrollment in Medicare include CMS\u2019s determination of different levels of  screening according to the risk of fraud, waste, and abuse with respect to  categories of providers or suppliers, and a new application fee for some  types of providers. CMS also published a regulation consistent with its  existing practice, requiring providers and suppliers to include their NPI on  all enrollment applications and claims, and added two new Medicare  contractors\u2014an automated screening contractor and a site visit  contractor\u2014that are intended to conduct enhanced enrollment screening  and site visits.", "To strengthen the screening activities already conducted by CMS\u2019s  contractors, PPACA required that the level of screening applied to each  category of provider and supplier be based on their assessed risk of  fraud, waste, and abuse and that screening procedures for Medicare  providers and suppliers be explicitly established. On February 2, 2011,  CMS published a Final Rule to implement these new screening  procedures. The Final Rule requires, among other things, that the A/B  MACs and the NSC conduct enrollment screening based on categories of  providers and suppliers and levels of risk.levels\u2014limited, moderate, and high\u2014to categories of providers and  suppliers based on determinations of which categories were at a greater  risk for fraud, waste, and abuse. (See table 1.) A/B MACs and the NSC  designate the appropriate screening level in PECOS for each enrolling  provider and supplier upon submission of an application. Screening levels  are designated based upon CMS guidance. As of October 2011, A/B  MACs and the NSC had entered the screening level information in  PECOS for all providers and suppliers that submitted an application.", "CMS assigned these new risk  CMS stated that it assigned these categories of provider and supplier risk  levels based on the agency\u2019s experience with claims data used to identify  potentially fraudulent billing practices, as well as on the expertise of its  contractors charged with investigating and identifying instances of  Medicare fraud across providers and suppliers. The agency also based  these risk levels on prior findings in reports by GAO and HHS OIG. In  addition, CMS will adjust the screening level of an individual provider or  supplier from \u2018\u2018limited\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018moderate\u2019\u2019 to \u2018\u2018high\u2019\u2019 based on other factors,  such as whether the provider or supplier has had its Medicare billing  privileges revoked, has been terminated or is otherwise precluded from  billing Medicaid, or has been subject to any final adverse action within the  past 10 years such as license revocation or suspension, or certain felony  convictions.", "Based on these new risk levels, providers and suppliers are subject to  different screening procedures, with those in the high-risk level subject to  the most rigorous screening. While PPACA requires that all categories of  providers and suppliers be subject to licensure checks, it gave CMS  discretion to establish a risk-based application of other screening  procedures. CMS determined that providers and suppliers in all  categories also must continue to undergo existing enrollment checks  using various data sources to verify certain information such as Social  Security number, NPI, HHS OIG exclusion, and taxpayer identification  number. According to CMS\u2019s new risk-based screening, moderate- and  high-risk providers and suppliers additionally must undergo unscheduled  or unannounced site visits, while high-risk providers and suppliers also  will be subject to fingerprint-based criminal background checks.", "PPACA required HHS, for the first time, to impose an application fee on  each institutional provider and on suppliers. In response, effective   March 25, 2011, CMS, in its Final Rule, required all institutional providers  and suppliers enrolling in Medicare, adding a practice location, or  revalidating their enrollment to pay a $505 application fee. PPACA  specifies that amounts collected as the result of the application fee shall  be used for program integrity efforts, including to cover the cost of  enrollment screening and to carry out other screening. However,  PPACA permits CMS to grant a hardship exception for institutional  providers and suppliers on a case-by-case basis if the agency determines  that the imposition of the application fee would cause a hardship.  According to CMS officials, an institutional provider or supplier working  with underserved populations or engaged in extensive charity work would  be a possible candidate for a hardship exception. CMS has instructed its  contractors in guidance on March 23, 2011, not to process any Medicare  enrollment applications without the proper application fee having been  paid or a hardship exception approved.about application fee payments by institutional providers and suppliers\u2014  CMS transmits information  which are made through an electronic payment system\u2014to the A/B  MACS or the NSC via PECOS.", "PPACA required HHS to promulgate a regulation for the inclusion of an  NPI on all Medicare applications and claims by all providers and suppliers  that qualify for an NPI\u2014a practice that was already in effect. regulation was published as an interim Final Rule on May 5, 2010, and  was effective July 6, 2010. Prior to the PPACA requirement for a  specific regulation, CMS had required contractors to confirm that  providers and suppliers included their NPI on Medicare enrollment  applications and claims. Since 2006, the agency has required that  enrollment applications include an NPI and since 2008 providers and  suppliers have been required to report their NPI on Medicare claims.", "PPACA, \u00a7 6402, 124 Stat. 119, 753-763 (codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7k). provider or supplier meets Medicare eligibility criteria such as valid  licensure, accreditation, and a valid NPI, and is not on exclusion lists,  such as the HHS OIG list of providers and suppliers excluded from  participating in federally funded health care programs. This screening  process results in a report to the A/B MACs and NSC that indicates the  screening components that the applicant passed and also screening  components flagged for additional review. The A/B MACs and NSC,  which remain responsible for enrollment and revalidation, obtain  documentation from the provider or supplier on any flagged information  that requires additional review to determine if the applicant meets  Medicare enrollment or revalidation requirements. In addition to  conducting screening at enrollment and revalidation, the automated  screening contractor conducts checks of certain screening information on  an ongoing basis. For example, the automated screening contractor is  responsible for validating licensure status at least weekly. Previously, A/B  MACs and the NSC were responsible for manually reviewing state- provided licensure information monthly to determine if any enrolled  Medicare providers\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 licenses had been revoked, suspended,  or otherwise inactivated in the last 60 days.", "CMS officials said that the automated screening contractor is developing  an individual risk score for each provider or supplier. This individual risk  score is similar to a credit risk score. The contractor\u2019s risk scores may be  used eventually as additional risk criteria that determine screening  activities for providers and suppliers.", "CMS officials said the new automated screening contractor provides a  centralized point for Medicare enrollment screening and allows for a  national view of provider and supplier information, rather than the more  limited regional view that the A/B MACs provided previously. For  example, the automated screening contractor has been able to access  information about providers and suppliers who operate across geographic  regions. In addition, CMS officials said that the agency has taken a  centralized approach to automated screening of enrollment data because  of weaknesses observed in enrollment screening efforts, which were due  generally to the large number of providers and suppliers for which the A/B  MACs and the NSC had to manually screen applications and the lack of  efficient access to data sources containing enrollment information.  According to CMS officials, they expect the new automated screening  contractor to improve the integrity of the enrollment and revalidation  processes by automating the data checks and integrating new data  sources. For example, CMS has directed the automated screening  contractor to identify additional data sources for screening checks, such  as financial, tax and business, and geospatial data sources.", "Additionally, in December 2011, CMS contracted with a site visit  contractor to perform nationwide physical site visits for all providers and  suppliers, except DMEPOS suppliers, in the moderate- and high-risk  screening categories in all states and six U.S. territories. The site visit  contractor began conducting site visits and making site visit reports  available electronically through a portal accessible to CMS and its other  contractors in February 2012. These site visits previously were performed  by the A/B MACs. The A/B MACs will order any required on-site visits  through the site visit contractor, which will schedule and conduct them  and provide the results to the appropriate A/B MAC. However, the NSC  will continue to conduct site visits related to provider enrollment of  DMEPOS suppliers.", "CMS requires two types of site visits: routine and rapid response.  According to CMS, routine site visits involve a physical location  verification and collection of required data elements using predefined  checklists. Rapid response site visits are triggered by an alert of possible  fraudulent activity, and may require the same elements as a routine site  visit but with rapid reporting and response due to the alert. Except for  DMEPOS suppliers, the national site visit contractor collects site visit  information at the physical provider or supplier site using defined  questionnaires and gathers photographic evidence for transmission to  CMS. The data elements required during routine and rapid response site  visits include validation of the physical location of the provider or supplier,  including capturing global positioning system coordinates of the site,  photographs of the door of the provider or supplier office, and signage of  the office. The contractor is required to conduct site visits and deliver  completed site visit reports within a specified time period. Depending on  the request from CMS or an A/B MAC, the contractor will make site visits  within 30, 15, or 7 days, for routine visits, or within 36 hours for rapid  response visits. CMS estimated that in the first year of the contract, the  site visit contractor would conduct nearly 60,000 site visits within 30 days,  almost 5,000 site visits within 15 days, almost 1,000 site visits within   7 days, and about 30 rapid response site visits. CMS officials said the  national site visit contractor is expected to provide consistency of site  visits across the country and, similar to the automated screening  contractor, reduce the A/B MACs\u2019 workloads."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several New Screening Procedures Remain in Progress", "paragraphs": ["CMS\u2019s implementation of some enrollment screening procedures  authorized by PPACA remains in progress, including efforts to (1) extend  surety bond requirements to additional providers and suppliers,   (2) conduct fingerprint-based criminal background checks of high-risk  providers and suppliers, (3) require enrolling providers and suppliers to  disclose additional types of information, and (4) require compliance and  ethics programs for providers and suppliers.", "CMS is in the process of drafting a proposed rule to extend the surety  bond requirement to certain providers and other suppliers. Previously,  surety bonds generally had been required only for DMEPOS suppliers.  Specifically, CMS officials said that they are seeking comments on  extending surety bonds to home health agencies and independent  diagnostic testing facilities (and, potentially, outpatient rehabilitation  facilities) and that they expected to issue a proposed rule to require  surety bonds as conditions of enrollment for certain other types of  providers in the fall of 2012. PPACA extended CMS\u2019s authority to impose  surety bonds on certain additional providers and suppliers, based on a  determination about their level of risk. The surety bond would be in an  amount commensurate with the provider\u2019s or supplier\u2019s billing volume, but  not less than $50,000. CMS officials also said they are considering giving  a new supplier provisional enrollment and then setting the amount of the  surety bond after a review of billing activities.", "While CMS is considering extending surety bonds to additional providers  and suppliers, a 2011 HHS OIG report stated that CMS did not have  finalized procedures for recovering DMEPOS overpayments through  surety bonds, and therefore, as of July 2011, no overpayments had been  recovered through surety bonds since October 2, 2009, the date the  surety bond requirement became effective. However, in January 2012,  CMS released guidance on claims against surety bonds for DMEPOS  suppliers. The guidance states that the surety\u2014a company that  provides the surety bond \u2014is liable for any overpayments incurred during  the term of the surety bond and that the surety must pay CMS within   30 days of receiving written notice of an overpayment. CMS\u2019s guidance  also advises DME MACs on how to collect overpayments incurred during  the term of a surety bond. CMS officials said that they expect that many  of the requirements for obtaining and maintaining DMEPOS surety bonds  can be easily applied to home health agencies and independent  diagnostic testing facilities.", "CMS officials said the agency was working with the Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI) to gain access to its criminal background information  for use in conducting fingerprint-based criminal background checks of  high-risk providers and suppliers. PPACA authorized, but did not require,  the use of criminal background checks in its risk-based provider and  supplier screening. In order to conduct criminal background checks, CMS  officials said they will contract with FBI channelers, whose contracts were  recently recompeted by the FBI; CMS officials said that as of December  2011, 20 contracts were approved and 13 had been awarded by the  FBI. CMS plans to contract with two channelers, one to conduct background checks and one to handle provider and supplier  fingerprinting. CMS officials said they are developing a scope of work to  solicit among the FBI-approved channelers and expect to have contracts  in place before the end of 2012. CMS officials also said that they plan to  develop guidance to further define A/B MAC and NSC responsibilities and  work flow of these checks.", "CMS officials said the agency was developing and reviewing regulations  to address the requirement for increased disclosures for enrolling or  revalidating Medicare providers and suppliers. PPACA requires providers  and suppliers to disclose any current or previous affiliation with another  provider or supplier that has uncollected debt; has been or is subject to a  payment suspension under a federal health care program; has been  excluded from participation under Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP; or has  had its billing privileges denied or revoked at the time of initial enrollment  or revalidation of enrollment. CMS officials noted that the development of  these regulations is complicated by many issues that need to be  addressed, such as provider and supplier concern about what information  will be collected, what CMS will do with information once it is collected,  and how to address concerns about maintaining the privacy and security  of the information. CMS officials said the agency did not meet its own  time frame for publishing a regulation to address this PPACA provision by  November 2011 and they are not certain when the regulation will be  published.", "CMS officials said that the agency was studying criteria found in HHS  OIG model plans as it worked to address the PPACA requirement that the  agency establish the core elements of compliance and ethics programs  for providers and suppliers. PPACA required that Medicare providers  establish compliance programs that contain the core elements  established by CMS in consultation with the HHS OIG. In general, a  compliance program is the internal set of policies, processes, and  procedures that a provider organization implements to help it act ethically  and lawfully. In this context, a compliance program is intended to help  provider and supplier organizations prevent and detect violations of  Medicare laws and regulations.

Although PECOS information has been routinely updated by CMS\u2019s A/B  MACs and the NSC using multiple national and state data sources,  limitations in these data sources and in the frequency with which updates  are made may lead to delays in, or failures to, accurately update  information in PECOS, resulting in payments to ineligible providers or  suppliers. As a result of the provisions in PPACA, CMS has begun to  supplement its previous provider enrollment activities with new  procedures and contracts that have the potential to improve the accuracy  and timeliness of information stored in PECOS. In particular, CMS\u2019s new  enrollment screening and site visit contracts shift some provider  enrollment activities from the A/B MACs and NSC to centralized national  contractors. CMS anticipates that the new screening contractor will  improve the accuracy and timeliness of updates to the provider  enrollment information in PECOS by automating the process and using  additional data sources for enrollment screening. In addition, CMS  expects that the new site visit contractor will enable the agency to  conduct routine and targeted site visits of certain providers and suppliers  in categories considered at greater risk for submitting improper or  potentially fraudulent Medicare claims. Our previous work has found, and  we recommended, that contractor monitoring is needed to ensure that  CMS and its contractors identify and address the causes of improper  payments.
