Since the 2008 market downturn, these pension costs have grown--thereby increasing DOD contract costs--and recent changes in rules for calculating pension costs have raised the prospect of further cost increases. Given this possibility, GAO assessed how (1) contractor pension costs are determined; (2) DOD ensures the contractor pension costs it pays are appropriate; (3) DOD contractors' defined benefit pension plans compare with plans sponsored by similar companies; (4) pension costs have affected DOD contract costs and the factors that contributed to these pension costs; and (5) the harmonization of CAS with ERISA will affect the amounts DOD will pay in pension costs in coming years. To do this, GAO analyzed defined benefit pension plans for the largest contractors; interviewed contractor and DOD officials; and reviewed relevant laws and regulations, including changes made to harmonize CAS with ERISA."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Labor costs are included in the prices contractors negotiate with the Department of Defense (DOD), and include pension costs as these are a normal element of employee compensation. Contractors make two sets of calculations for their defined benefit pension plans, following two sets of standards: (1) Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which determine how pension costs are allocated to government contracts; and (2) Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which establishes the minimum contribution required to fund plans. In 2008, revised ERISA rules altered the minimum funding requirements, causing CAS costs and ERISA contributions to diverge further apart. ERISA contributions have therefore greatly exceeded CAS pension costs reflected in contract prices. In December 2011, almost 4 years after ERISA changes took effect, the CAS Board, which is part of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), made changes to CAS that harmonized them to ERISA in order to gradually reduce the difference between the two calculation methods.", "DOD centralizes its technical expertise for management and oversight of defined benefit pension plans. DOD contracting officers at the corporate level negotiate pension costs with contractors and receive technical support from a team of DOD actuaries. DOD audits projected and actual costs for contracts, including pension costs, to ensure they are allowable, allocable, and reasonable. The Federal Acquisition Regulation requires that employee compensation, including pensions, be reasonable. However, the pension costs used for compensation reviews can be affected not only by the value of benefits earned by employees, but also by factors such as asset returns and interest rates. Also, oversight processes do not clearly assign responsibility for assessing the reasonableness of pension benefits, including those for executives.", "GAO analyzed the defined benefit plans of the 10 largest DOD contractors and found that nearly all of the contractors--as well as a peer group of companies--maintain some sort of tax-qualified, defined benefit plan for their employees. The largest contractors invest in similar types of pension plan assets as their peer group, and do so somewhat more conservatively. GAO also found that CAS pension costs reported by the contractors grew considerably over the last decade, from less than $500 million in 2002 to almost $5 billion in 2011, although not all of these costs were allocated to DOD contracts. Contractor CAS pension costs grew as the market downturn increased unfunded liabilities.", "Although pension cost projections are highly sensitive to economic assumptions, both contractors and DOD officials expect CAS pension costs to increase starting in 2014 due to harmonization. The CAS discount rates used to value liabilities will now be tied to the more volatile ERISA-based rates, making it harder to forecast future CAS pension costs and reducing the consistency of cost projections used in contract pricing. DOD issued limited guidance on projecting ERISA-based discount rates for CAS calculations, but lack of specificity in the guidance can lead to great variation among the rates contractors use. Moreover, when a contractor curtails a plan, DOD and the contractor must settle pension costs; however, the discount rates used for settlements were not updated as part of harmonization, meaning liabilities will be calculated differently under CAS and ERISA rules. A schedule has not been set for addressing this issue."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Secretary of Defense clarify responsibility for and guidance on assessing pension reasonableness and determining discount rates for pension cost projections.

This could hamper DOD\u2019s efforts  to ensure the reasonableness of the total compensation offered to  contractor executives.", "CAS pension costs associated with defined benefit plans have grown  substantially over the past decade, and can be expected to grow larger  and more volatile with the harmonization of CAS to ERISA. We found that  in this environment, DOD contractors, like their peer group, have limited  employee entry to defined benefit plans. Defined benefit pension costs  are highly sensitive to economic assumptions, and even a small change  in conditions can have significant consequences. Increased volatility due  to harmonization challenges the consistency of contract forward pricing.  Under the previous rules, CAS discount rates were more stable and  predictable, and therefore effective for consistent forward pricing. DOD  has recognized the desirability of using long-term average rates in CAS  calculations in order to smooth the impact of pension cost swings over  time, and the need to provide more guidance to its acquisition  organizations on the discount rates contractors should use. While DOD  has stated that this guidance would be forthcoming, details are yet to  emerge, and the longer it takes to issue the guidance, the longer DOD is  likely to see a broad range of discount rates and large variation in forward  pricing rates. Further, while harmonization changed how contractors will  calculate their CAS pension costs, it did not update CAS 413 to  harmonize the discount rates used for settling up in the event of a plan  curtailment. The current interest rate environment means that a plan  being curtailed would have significantly lower liabilities than if it had  continued accruing new benefits, complicating settlements between  contractors and the government."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense take the following four  actions:", "Assign responsibility for oversight of the reasonableness of pension  plans offered by contractors, specifically the value of benefits earned  by participants;", "Provide guidance on how to measure the value of pension benefits  that participants earn in a given year to get a complete picture of total  compensation for contractor employees;", "Provide guidance on the extent to which defined benefit plans should  be included in assessments of the reasonableness of executive  compensation packages; and", "Provide specific guidance to acquisition organizations, including  DCMA and DCAA, on the discount rate or rates that would be  acceptable for contractors to use in calculating pension costs for  forward pricing purposes.", "In order to better align with the harmonized CAS 412, we recommend that  the CAS Board set a schedule for revising the parts of CAS 413 dealing  with settlement of pension plan curtailments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency and Third- Party Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD, OMB, PBGC, the Department  of the Treasury, and the 10 large DOD contractors covered by our review.

We also  interviewed DOD officials with cognizance for negotiation and oversight of  pension costs at the corporate level for each of the 10 selected large  contractors, including the DCMA Corporate Administrative Contracting  Officer (CACO), and DCAA officials including regional audit managers,  resident auditors, and pension technical specialists.

We also interviewed corporate-level DCMA  officials with cognizance for the seven smaller contractors, and where  available collected recent DCAA audit reports and CIPR Center reports  related to pensions at those contractors.", "To compare the defined benefit pension plans of large DOD contractors  to those sponsored by similar companies, we selected a peer group of 15  companies not among the largest DOD contractors based on analysis of  contractor audited financial statements. Many of the contractors list a  peer group they use to benchmark executive compensation in their  financial statements. These peer companies may be selected for  generally comparability in terms of company size, industry, or operations  as well as their overall competitiveness with respect to similar employee  skill sets and talent. Eight of the largest DOD contractors publish lists of  their peers and we selected the 15 most prevalent companies (not  including the DOD contractors themselves) that appeared across all eight  lists. For both the contractors and the peer group, we analyzed annual  reports and proxy statements for fiscal year 2011 to identify the status of  pension plans and understand how pension plan assets are allocated.", "To identify trends in CAS pension costs, for the nine largest contractors  with defined benefit plans we reviewed pension plan documents such as  CAS valuation reports (generally certified by qualified and credentialed  actuaries), summary plan descriptions, and CAS disclosure statements.  We collected contractor data on incurred CAS pension costs from 2002 to  2011. Our analysis of CAS valuation reports identified sources of current  unfunded liabilities and CAS pension cost, as well as the difference  between ERISA-required contributions and what the contractors have  calculated as CAS pension cost. Note that for one large contractor, we  excluded most pension data associated with a business that was recently  spun off, in which the transaction included parts of several defined benefit  pension plans. This was done in order to make the contractor\u2019s past and  projected pension cost data more comparable. CAS pension costs  provided by contractors may or may not reflect their PBGC premiums.  Where we were able to identify the premiums separately from other  pension costs, their relative size was insignificant.", "To understand how pension costs make their way onto DOD contracts,  we selected divisions at the five largest contractors based on DOD  contract obligations for fiscal year 2011, and at each division selected a  weapon system program, which together represent a mix of military  services and platform types.

We interviewed DOD officials with cognizance at the division- level for the five selected divisions, including the DCMA Divisional  Administrative Contracting Officer (DACO) and local auditors. For the  five divisions, where available we collected contractor data on each  division\u2019s incurred pension costs from 2005 to 2011, and within each  division, the individual programs\u2019 incurred costs from 2005 to 2011.
