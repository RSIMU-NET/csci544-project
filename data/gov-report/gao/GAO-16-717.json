By inducing widespread  movement of armed poachers and traffickers, ivory and rhino horn trade  also exacerbates border insecurity, particularly across porous borders,  according to the ODNI report.

USAID also works at the  national level and with rangers and law enforcement personnel  throughout the supply chain to strengthen capacity. In June 2015, USAID  committed to starting more than 35 new CWT projects in 15 countries.  Initiatives that address the supply side of wildlife trafficking include,  among others, support for the Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool  (SMART), a free software tool that enables village scouts and rangers to  instantly capture GPS and observational data in the field, enhancing  conservation efforts. According to USAID, for many years, rangers have  collected monitoring data on paper that had to be sifted through to find  relevant information, limiting its usefulness for planning and analysis. With  SMART, rangers can digitally record and analyze information on poaching  encounters, areas patrolled, and wildlife sightings to make protected area  management more effective and efficient. For example, USAID has  equipped and trained more than 400 rangers in the Democratic Republic  of the Congo and Republic of the Congo on the use of GPS units, hand- held computers for data collection, and SMART. As a result, according to  the Task Force\u2019s 2015 APA, SMART patrols are now providing credible,  actionable data on wildlife presence and threats, which park managers  use to deploy ranger teams to high-intensity poaching areas. According to  this assessment, as of March 2016, more strategic patrols and other  measures across eight landscapes in the two countries resulted in the  destruction of nearly 1,800 snares and traps, the confiscation of 2,800  firearms, the arrest of 416 poachers, and numerous seizures of elephant  tusks and other wildlife products.", "In the countries we visited, USAID officials told us that USAID takes a  holistic approach to CWT at the national and community level, with efforts  aimed at improving livelihoods, governance, and security. Project sites  we visited faced common issues, including poverty and conflict, which  provide fertile conditions for poaching. USAID aims to address these root  causes in parallel with CWT efforts by focusing on improving equity,  transparency, and livelihoods in local communities. For example, to  incentivize villagers who live in and around range areas to protect wildlife,  USAID works to establish programs that increase revenue generated  from wildlife tourism and safaris. The community is then to share the  income and use it to meet public demand for health care, education, and  other critical needs. The following are illustrative examples from our  fieldwork.", "In Kenya, USAID has provided assistance to the NRT for years,  according to a USAID official, and in September 2015 signed an  agreement worth approximately $20 million over 5 years that aims to  reduce wildlife trafficking as one of five key goals. According to USAID  officials and NRT representatives, the trust has contributed to bringing  peace, stability, and reduced poaching in regions of northern Kenya.  For example, according to NRT representatives, the rate of illegal  killing of elephants declined from 81 percent in 2012 to 46 percent in  2014. USAID and NRT representatives told us that while the area  protected by the trust is vast and poaching remains an ongoing  concern, the overall success of its CWT effort has been driven by a  combination of supportive donors, strong security capabilities, and  governance mechanisms that communities perceive to be fair,  equitable, and transparent. As a result, they said that communities  realize the benefits of tourism and receive revenue from wildlife and  therefore are motivated to protect it.", "In South Africa, USAID supports the Resilience in the Limpopo Basin  Program, a $14.5 million effort started in 2012 aimed at improving the  transboundary management of an area that spreads over parts of  South Africa, Botswana, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe. Almost half of  the area is within South Africa, which relies heavily on the basin to  support agriculture, industry, and tourism. Protected areas across the  basin, including Kruger National Park, exhibit a unique biodiversity  and are home to several vulnerable species for which poaching is a  key threat. One of the program\u2019s three primary objectives is to  conserve biodiversity and sustainably manage high-priority  ecosystems. According to USAID and implementing partner officials,  one activity with that aim involves improving the livelihoods of villagers  who live around Kruger National Park by increasing income  opportunities from wildlife, thus strengthening the incentive for them to  protect wildlife. For example, they said that USAID helped villagers  work with park authorities to clarify agreements on how to share  revenue generated from wildlife in the area, ultimately resulting in  more transparency and increased income for the villagers.", "In Tanzania, USAID supports Promoting Tanzania\u2019s Environment,  Conservation, and Tourism, a $14.5 million 5-year project that aims to  enhance the country\u2019s capacity to combat wildlife poaching and  trafficking as one of its focal areas. Started in April 2015, the project  aims to improve the abilities of park, customs, and judiciary authorities  by, for example, training customs officials on the detection of wildlife  products. In addition, in September 2015, USAID launched the  Endangered Ecosystem of Northern Tanzania (EENT) Project, which,  according to USAID, plans to provide $12.4 million over 5 years to  support and secure the long-term conservation and resilience of more  than 6 million acres of wildlife habitat. One of EENT\u2019s four strategic  goals is to improve wildlife protection and land and habitat  management. EENT implementing partners emphasized the  importance of an integrated and holistic approach and told us that  they are working with communities to improve livelihoods, develop  conservation incentives, and build capacity. According to  representatives of these implementing partners, one activity that has  made a positive impact is strengthening security, particularly through  the use of canine patrols, which significantly enhance detection and  tracking capabilities (see fig. 10). We observed an exercise  demonstrating that properly trained dogs can follow a scent in the field  and quickly and accurately lead rangers to the source. According to  the implementing partner representatives, the addition of canine units  has enabled rangers to find, identify, and arrest poachers who  otherwise would have escaped detection."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Agencies Also Contribute to CWT", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the co-chair agencies and USAID, more than a dozen other  federal agencies, departments, or offices contribute to CWT efforts.  Department of Defense (DOD) officials, for example, told us that DOD  plays a role in CWT through its capacity-building efforts. For example,  DOD has provided training to partner nations\u2019 enforcement agencies in  various skills and tactics, including those involved in countering public  corruption, running basic criminal investigations, and conducting border  patrols to counter illicit trafficking. Specifically, in March 2015, DOD  personnel, with State Africa Bureau funding, delivered antipoaching  training in weapons-handling procedures, combat marksmanship,  patrolling, offensive tactics, land navigation, and mounted operations for  more than 40 Tanzanian rangers in the Selous Game Reserve. In  addition, in Gabon, DOD trained Gabonese park rangers in infantry  tactics to enhance their capacity to thwart trafficking in ivory and other  wildlife products. DOD officials told us that they are continuing to  explore ways in which DOD can help address wildlife trafficking,  particularly in Africa.", "DHS officials told us that, like DOD, DHS contributes to CWT through  capacity building, providing training to partner nations, and working  alongside foreign counterparts to support CWT investigations and  enforcement initiatives. For example, in March 2016, DHS\u2019s Customs and  Border Protection provided, with funding from USAID and DOD, elephant  ivory- and narcotics-sniffing canine units and trained handlers for the air  and sea ports in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. We met with Tanzanian port  officials who indicated that having dogs on site would improve their ability  to detect smuggled wildlife products in shipping containers. Also, in 2015,  according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s Homeland  Security Investigations officials, the attach\u00e9 in Pretoria supported the  South African Police Service on covert operations involving a proposed  sale of a drug that is often used to immobilize elephants, rhinos, and  other large mammals. They said that the operations led to the arrest of  five wildlife poaching conspirators, some with links to transnational  organized criminals, and the seizure of items used in the proposed killing  of a rhino.", "For its part in CWT, Department of the Treasury (Treasury) officials told  us that the department analyzes available information and, if applicable,  exercises U.S. sanctions authorities against individuals and entities that  engage in wildlife trafficking. For example, in March 2016, Treasury  designated the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army as subject to Executive Order  13667, which blocks any and all transactions involving the U.S. property  of persons contributing to the conflict in the Central African Republic. In  making this designation, Treasury noted that the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army  had engaged in illicit diamonds trade, elephant poaching, and ivory  trafficking for revenue. In addition, Treasury represents the United States  as an observer to the Eastern and Southern Africa Anti-Money  Laundering Group and, as a member of the Asia/Pacific Group on Money  Laundering, two of nine Financial Action Task Force-style regional bodies  that uphold international standards on anti-money laundering and  countering terrorism financing. Treasury officials told us that due to  mission priorities, limited staff resources are dedicated to CWT issues,  although the Implementation Plan designates Treasury as the lead or a  participating agency in 8 of the 24 objectives. However, if a significant  amount of relevant information emerges on wildlife trafficking, Treasury  officials said they could take immediate action."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "State and USAID Generally Monitor the CWT Programs We Reviewed in Accordance with Widely Accepted Standards; Both Agencies Have Yet to Conduct CWT- Specific Evaluations", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "State and USAID Generally Follow Monitoring Standards for the Four CWT-Related Programs We Reviewed", "paragraphs": ["We found that State and USAID generally follow selected elements of  widely accepted monitoring standards for CWT-related programs in the  countries we visited\u2014Kenya, South Africa, and Tanzania.

We identified the widely accepted  monitoring standards through a review of Standards for Internal Control in  the Federal Government; the Government Performance and Results Act  (GPRA) Modernization Act of 2010; and Uniform Administrative  Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal  Awards.", "Table 2 summarizes our overall assessment of the select CWT programs\u2019  monitoring activities. Appendix I provides greater detail on our selection  and analysis of these programs.", "For the four programs we reviewed, we found that State and USAID  generally follow the nine key elements of widely accepted monitoring  standards listed in table 2, with some exceptions. Both agencies\u2019  programs fully implement procedures to periodically collect and analyze  data on performance indicators, define roles and responsibilities of  personnel responsible for monitoring, and submit periodic and annual  reports. Fully adhering to these three elements of widely accepted  monitoring standards helps enable the agencies to promote data-driven  analysis and regular reporting of results, which could help identify any  needed course corrections in a timely manner.", "We found that the USAID program in Kenya partially implements the  element of ensuring appropriate qualifications for staff conducting  monitoring, while the State programs in Kenya and South Africa and the  USAID program in Tanzania fully implement this element. Implementing  this element helps to ensure that staff have the expertise to exercise  sound judgment in overseeing the programs.", "We also found that all four programs at least partially implement the  element of creating a monitoring plan and at least partially implement the  element of identifying funding sources for monitoring; USAID\u2019s program in  Tanzania was the only one of the four that fully implemented both these  elements of the monitoring standards. Three of the four programs partially  created a monitoring plan or partially identified funding sources for  monitoring, based on documentation we received. For example,  documentation for the two programs that partially created monitoring  plans provided some detail on how performance would be monitored  through activities such as establishing time lines and tracking  performance indicators; however, the documentation contained little or no  information on how responsible parties within the agencies, such as a  grants officer or grants officer representative, would ensure a systematic  review of monitoring efforts. In addition, we found that both of State\u2019s  programs only partially identify funding sources, because program  documentation lacked funding information specific to monitoring activities.", "As table 2 (above) shows, the results of our analysis for the remaining  three elements of monitoring standards were mixed. Only USAID\u2019s  program in Tanzania fully implemented all three by (1) implementing data  quality assurance procedures on performance indicators, (2) validating  the implementing partner\u2019s performance through site visits and other  activities, and (3) considering monitoring information in making  management decisions. Conducting data quality procedures helps  provide assurance that the likelihood of significant errors or  incompleteness is minimal and that the data can be used for their  intended purposes. Site visits, along with other methods of verification,  can help address or avoid problems that programs sometimes  experience, such as delays in program start-up, untimely submission of  progress or financial reports, or allegations of misuse of funds. In Kenya,  each agency\u2019s program only partially implemented this element. For  example, State\u2019s program in that country provided reports of telephone  audits but no additional documentation such as photographs or other  evidence to support validation of program implementation. Considering  performance information in making management decisions facilitates  program improvement by providing data-based evidence for making  adjustments.", "USAID\u2019s Toolkit for Periodically Collecting  and Analyzing Data on Performance  Indicators   USAID created an impact measurement  toolkit in 2015 to be a primary resource to  improve action and accountability in USAID\u2019s  efforts to combat wildlife crime at the  programmatic level. According to a USAID  official, the Promoting Tanzania\u2019s  Environment, Conservation, and Tourism  (PROTECT) program was the first to apply the  toolkit in designing its monitoring and  evaluation plan, which includes baseline  values and targets for each indicator and a  time line for specific monitoring and evaluation  activities. A representative of PROTECT told  us that the monitoring and evaluation plan will  be revised each year to preserve flexibility.  For example, one revision already made was  to reduce the number of performance  indicators originally proposed in the program\u2019s  monitoring and evaluation plan to improve  program results.", "Agencies are taking steps to measure progress. One example is the CWT  toolkit, which USAID created in 2015 (see sidebar). USAID officials  stated that they hope the toolkit serves as a resource for other Task  Force agencies as well.

Officials also indicated that they plan  to conduct evaluations of major CWT-specific activities when these are  completed.

State was not able to  identify any CWT-related programs with an available evaluation report.", "We found that of the six evaluation reports we reviewed, none included  CWT-related efforts as a primary goal or objective of the evaluation.  Generally, we found that the six evaluated broader conservation goals of  each program without focusing on specific CWT-related activities.  However, some of the evaluation reports provide limited CWT  information. For example, the evaluation report for the Scaling-Up  Conservation and Livelihoods Efforts in Northern Tanzania Project  indicated that the project had accomplished its goal to continue building  capacity for an antipoaching unit in two of its wildlife management areas.  This specific output was tied to the program\u2019s broader goal to deliver  transformational conservation and economic impact. Another example is  the Africa Biodiversity Collaborative Group, a coalition of U.S.-based  international conservation organizations that operate field programs in  Africa. The evaluation report stated that the group had been highly  effective in creating new conservation partnerships, some of which led to  faith leaders uniting against illegal wildlife trade. The Spatial Monitoring  and Reporting Tool for law enforcement was cited as an example  showing how one of the program\u2019s innovative conservation practices had  been more widely adopted in Africa as a result of the group\u2019s  collaborative work, which helped to ensure that wildlife patrols were  carried out."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CWT Task Force Lacks Performance Targets, Making Effectiveness Difficult to Determine", "paragraphs": ["While the interagency Task Force, co-chaired by State, DOI, and DOJ,  provides some information about progress, it lacks performance targets,  making effectiveness difficult to determine at the strategic level. The  Implementation Plan and the 2015 Annual Progress Assessment (APA)  describe objectives, metrics, and accomplishments. Under three strategic  priorities, the Implementation Plan identifies 24 objectives and ways to  measure progress for each. For example, one objective is to develop and  broadly disseminate cost\u2010effective analytical tools and technological  solutions to support wildlife trafficking investigations and prosecutions.  The plan outlines two ways to measure progress for this objective: new inspection and interdiction technologies developed and applied,  and  forensic tools, capacity, and networks developed.", "In reporting on progress related to this objective, the APA states that  USAID launched the Wildlife Crime Tech Challenge to generate new  science and technology solutions for detecting transit routes,  strengthening forensic evidence, reducing consumer demand, and  tackling corruption along the supply chain. According to the  announcement of winners, one awardee in South Africa developed a  product that enables the tracing of rhino horn through individualized DNA  profiling, thus providing a means of linking a sample of trafficked product  back to a specific crime. Such information describes accomplishments  that relate to objectives, but the Task Force does not provide targets, in  the APA or elsewhere, that would enable comparison of actual  performance against planned results.", "As we have previously reported, a fundamental element in an  organization\u2019s efforts to manage for results is its ability to set performance  goals with specific targets and time frames that reflect strategic goals and  to measure progress toward its performance goals as part of its strategic  planning efforts. Such performance measurement allows organizations  to track progress in achieving their goals and gives managers crucial  information to identify gaps in program performance and to plan any  needed improvements. In addition, according to Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government, managers need to compare actual  performance against planned or expected results and to analyze  significant differences. Furthermore, internal control helps managers  achieve desired results through effective stewardship of public resources.  Having targets would allow the Task Force to more fully demonstrate the  commitment articulated in its Implementation Plan: to continually evaluate  progress, both by assessing the extent to which the Task Force is able to  achieve the specific objectives identified in the plan and by looking more  broadly at the effectiveness of those objectives toward achieving strategic  priorities and the ultimate goal of ending wildlife trafficking.", "The Task Force identified a range of reasons why it does not have  targets, including that many potential indicators are metrics with limited or uneven  results cannot be attributed solely to U.S. government actions and are  dependent on continued combined global effort;  results often require years to document accurately;  availability of data from the key developing countries; and  reporting against metrics could downplay the contributions of other  stakeholders, divert resources, and either risk oversimplification or  confuse audiences with complicated explanations of the limitations of  quantitative targets.", "We have highlighted strategies in our past work that agencies can use  when faced with the challenge of having limited control over external  factors that can affect a program\u2019s outcomes. These strategies include  selecting a mix of outcome goals over which the agency has varying  levels of control; using data on external factors to statistically adjust for  their effect on the desired outcome; and disaggregating goals for distinct  target populations for which the agency has different expectations.  Additionally, to help interpret the results of performance measures, we  have also emphasized in our past work the importance of communicating  adequate contextual information, such as factors inside or outside the  agency\u2019s control that might affect performance.", "In addition, Task Force agencies have provided performance targets for  efforts facing similar challenges to measuring and reporting results.
