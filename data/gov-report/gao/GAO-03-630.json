It created the Bank  Insurance Fund and the Savings Association Insurance Fund, which are  responsible for protecting insured bank and thrift depositors, respectively,  from loss due to institutional failures.  The act also created the FSLIC  Resolution Fund to complete the affairs of the former FSLIC and liquidate  the assets and liabilities transferred from the former Resolution Trust  Corporation.  It also designated FDIC as the administrator of these funds.   As part of this function, FDIC has an examination and supervision program  to monitor the safety of deposits held in member institutions.", "FDIC insures deposits in excess of $3.3 trillion for about 9,400 institutions.   Together the three funds have about $49.5 billion in assets.  FDIC had a  budget of about $1.2 billion for calendar year 2002 to support its activities  in managing the three funds.

FDIC has addressed key access control, application  software, system software, and service continuity weaknesses previously  identified.  Specifically, FDIC   limited access to certain critical programs, software, and data;  reduced the number of users with physical access to computer facilities;  enhanced its review procedures of system software changes;  strengthened its procedures for reviewing changes to application   expanded tests of its disaster recovery plan; and  defined the roles and responsibilities of its information security officers.", "In addition to responding to previously identified weaknesses, FDIC  established several other computer controls to enhance its information  security.  For example, it enhanced procedures to periodically review user  access privileges to computer programs and data to ensure that access is  granted only to those who need it to perform their jobs.  Likewise, FDIC  strengthened its physical security controls by establishing criteria for  granting access to computer center operations, and developed procedures  for periodically reviewing access to ensure that it remained appropriate.", "Further, FDIC enhanced its system software change control process by  developing procedures requiring technical reviews of all system software  modifications prior to their implementation.  In addition, it established a  process to periodically review application software to ensure that only  authorized computer program changes were being made.

Effective mainframe access controls should be designed to  restrict access to computer programs and data, and prevent and detect  unauthorized access.  These controls include access rights and  permissions, system software controls, and software library management.", "While FDIC restricted access to many users who previously had broad  access to critical programs, software, and data, instances remained in  which the access granted specific users was still not appropriate.  A key  weakness in FDIC\u2019s controls was that it did not adequately limit user  access, as described below.", "Nineteen users had access to production control software that would  allow them to modify software outside the formal configuration control  process.  This risk was further heightened because FDIC was not  maintaining audit logs of software changes. Without such logs,  unauthorized software changes could be made to critical financial and  sensitive systems, possibly without detection.  This software was  especially vulnerable because it could allow an unauthorized user to  bypass security controls.  Further, an excessive number of users had  access to 14 of 19 production job control systems we reviewed, allowing  them to obtain exact details of production programs and data, which  could then be used to gather information to circumvent controls.", "An excessive number of users had access that allowed them to read user  identifications (IDs) and passwords used to transfer data among FDIC  production computer systems.

Regular assessments, assist management in  making decisions on necessary controls by helping to ensure that security  resources are effectively distributed to minimize potential loss.  And by  increasing awareness of risks, these assessments generate support for the  adopted policies and controls, which helps ensure that the policies and  controls operate as intended.  Further, Office of Management and Budget  Circular A-130, appendix III, prescribes that risk be assessed when  significant changes are made to the system but at least every 3 years.", "FDIC has not fully developed a framework for assessing and managing risk  on a continuing basis.  While it has taken some action, including developing  a framework of assessing risk when significant changes are made to  computer systems and providing tools for its security managers to use in  conducting risk assessments, it has not developed a process for conducting  these assessments.  Our study of risk assessment best practices found  that a process for performing such assessments should specify (1) how the  assessments should be initiated and conducted, (2) who should participate,  (3) how disagreements should be resolved, (4) what approvals are needed,  and (5) how these assessments should be documented and maintained.  In  response, FDIC\u2019s acting CIO said that the corporation is taking steps to  develop risk assessment guidance.", "Testing and evaluation. A program that assesses the effectiveness of  policies and controls includes processes for monitoring compliance with  established information system control policies and procedures and testing  the effectiveness of those controls.  During the past year, FDIC has taken  steps to establish such a program of testing and evaluation.
