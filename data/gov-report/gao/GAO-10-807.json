The Act requires recipients to be accountable for how these funds are being used and what is being achieved. To help attain the level of transparency needed for accountability, recipients are to report quarterly on their award activities and expected outcomes. This information is available to the public on Recovery.gov, the government's official Recovery Act Web site. This report covers three Education programs funded by the Recovery Act. It (1) describes what the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of Education (Education) did to facilitate implementation of requirements for recipients to describe the use of funds and (2) assesses the extent to which award descriptions are transparent It also describes reported fund uses for a sample of subrecipients. GAO reviewed requirements for reporting in the Act as well as guidance provided by OMB and Education. GAO assessed the transparency of descriptions for the three education programs on Recovery.gov."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Both OMB and Education provided guidance to recipients on how to meet the Recovery Act requirement that they report quarterly on the amount and use of the funds they have received. OMB's guidance was generic for all agencies and instructed recipients to report narrative information that captures the overall purpose of the award, describes projects or activities, and states the expected results. Education's guidance was supplemental and program specific to its formula grants that pass through states as the prime recipient to subrecipients, which are local educational agencies (LEA) and institutions of higher education. However, the Recovery Act reporting system does not provide specific narrative fields for collecting information on how each subrecipient is using the funds. Instead, the states are tasked with reporting on fund use throughout the state, and the reporting system limits the amount of narrative information states may enter. For states with many subrecipients, including detailed information on how each subrecipient is using the funds would be extremely challenging, if not impossible. To ease the reporting burden for prime recipients, Education's guidance provided recipients with suggested standard language for use in important narrative fields. GAO determined that 9 percent of the descriptions fully met our transparency criteria; that is, they had sufficiently clear and complete information on the award's purpose, scope and nature of activities, location, cost, outcomes, and status of work. Most descriptions did not include sufficient information on local fund use. Specifically, while 13 percent had most but not all information, the remaining 78 percent contained much less information and only partially met attributes for transparency. We did not find any descriptions that did not include at least some of the information needed to inform the public. Descriptions limited to Education's standard language were less transparent than those with specific information on the programs and activities subrecipients conducted in the state. For example, officials from seven Texas LEAs told us they used ESEA Title I Recovery Act funds for technology purchases for at-risk students, although the information in Texas' project description uses only the standard language. Guidance on reporting requirements for Recovery Act grants that pass through a prime recipient to a subrecipient should balance the need for transparency with the reporting burden and these system limitations. While most states cannot provide information on how each subrecipient is using its funds, providing more information than Education's standard language, such as an overview analysis of how localities are spending the funds, could help the public gain a better understanding of how the funds are being used."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Secretary of Education, in consultation with OMB, remove the suggested language for the project description field from its guidance and instruct states to include information, to the extent possible, on how the funds are being used and potential project outcomes or results."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) was  enacted in response to the economic crisis facing the nation.  One area of  particular need was the nation\u2019s public schools, which faced the potential  of significant teacher layoffs and substantially reduced resources. To help  relieve some of the fiscal strain on public schools, the Act provided nearly  $100 billion in fiscal year 2009 for elementary, secondary, and  postsecondary education programs. The Administration has stated that the  short-term influx of additional funding is an historic opportunity to  improve American education. Given the sizable amount of funding  provided, it is anticipated that the Act will be carried out with an  unprecedented level of transparency to allow the public to understand how  the funds are being spent and what is being achieved.", "Congress has emphasized the need for accountability and transparency in  the expenditure of Recovery Act funds and has made it a central principle  of the Act. Accordingly, the Act contains numerous provisions to increase  transparency and accountability over spending. Section 1512 of the Act  requires recipients of Recovery Act funded grants, contracts, or loans to  provide quarterly reports containing certain information. For example,  recipients are required to report information on each project or activity,  including descriptive information on the uses of Recovery Act awards. The  Act also required a Web site to be created and maintained where the public  could see information reported by Recovery Act recipients as well as  agency-reported information on Recovery Act spending.   This official  government Web site, Recovery.gov, allows users to search the site for  information about individual Recovery Act awards in their neighborhood  and throughout the country. The Web site contains information on each  reported award, such as award amount, location, and description of  activities funded.", "In response to your request, we assessed the extent to which the  descriptions of the uses of funds published on Recovery.gov transparently  describe how funds are being spent and what outcomes are expected. More  specifically, we (1) described what the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) and the Department of Education (Education) did to facilitate the  implementation of Recovery Act requirements for recipients to describe  the use of funds and (2) assessed the extent to which the descriptive  information made available on Recovery.gov meets GAO\u2019s transparency  criteria. Our review covers three programs administered by Education\u2014 the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund (SFSF) ($48.6 billion); Title I, Part A of  the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended (ESEA)  ($10 billion); and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, as  amended (IDEA) Part B ($11.7 billion). Collectively, funding for these  programs accounts for approximately $70.3 billion of the $275 billion in  Recovery Act funding distributed through contracts, grants, and loans.", "To understand how OMB and Education are implementing Recovery Act  requirements concerning recipient reporting, we reviewed the Act\u2019s  reporting requirements as well as related guidance established by OMB, the  Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board (Recovery Board), and  Education. We also met with OMB, Education, and Recovery Board  officials. To assess the extent to which descriptions were transparent, we  reviewed all prime recipient award records on Recovery.gov as of April 30,  2010, for SFSF education stabilization funds, ESEA Title I, Part A, and  IDEA Part B for school aged children. Similar to the transparency review  we conducted in May 2010, we reviewed key required fields on  Recovery.gov that describe the uses of Recovery Act funds, including  project name, award description, quarterly activities/project description,  place of performance, award amount, and project status (extent to which  the project was completed). We also reviewed an additional field on  Recovery.gov\u2014 description of jobs created\u2014in which prime recipients  were advised by Education to briefly describe the types of jobs created or  retained. In addition, because the education programs in our review  provide states with formula grants that the states then distribute to their  local educational agencies (LEA) or institutions of higher education (IHE),  we also reviewed the number, amount, and location of subawards cited on  Recovery.gov in order to ascertain the overall scope or magnitude of each  grant award. Overall, we reviewed all fields to determine if the reported  information collectively contained information on the general purpose,  nature, location, amount awarded, status, outcome, and scope of the  project necessary to make the use of funds transparent to the public. We  also considered the extent to which information in the fields was clear and  understandable.", "We also gathered local-level information about grant award fund use from a  nongeneralizable subsample of 150 LEAs (or 50 LEAs per education  program included in our review) from a national survey we administered  during March\u2013April 2010. (For our national survey, we selected a stratified  random sample of 575 LEAs from the population of 16,065 LEAs.) In  addition, we met with state and selected local officials responsible for  recipient reporting in 15 states and the District of Columbia. We discussed  with these officials the procedures for compiling and reporting information  on the use of Recovery Act funds and how information on these awards is  made available to the public. We conducted this performance audit from  February 2010 through July 2010 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives.

In addition,  the Act created the Recovery Board and required it to establish and  maintain a user-friendly, publicly available Web site (Recovery.gov) to  foster greater accountability and transparency in the use of Recovery Act  funds. The Act directs that the Web site function as a gateway to key  information relating to the Recovery Act and provide links to other  government Web sites with related information.

Because OMB and Education guidance instructs prime recipients to  include information about subrecipients in the information they report on  FederalReporting.gov, a state is required to report information that  captures the overall purpose of the award, including how subrecipients  have used the funds. Information required about each subrecipient is  limited to basic information, such as award amounts and place of  performance. Our May 2010 report notes that this practice is not consistent  with the requirement in the Act to report a detailed list of all projects and  activities, each having its own name, description, completion status, and  potential outcomes. In addition, we reported that requiring information on  status, outcomes, or other items without information on subrecipient  activities may convey an incomplete impression of how funds are being  used.", "Furthermore, FederalReporting.gov restricts the amount of information  prime recipients can report. Prime recipients are allowed to input up to  4,000 characters for each narrative field. While this limitation may not  affect grants that provide funds for limited projects and activities, some  states have thousands of subrecipients for each of these three education  grants. For example, California\u2019s SFSF grant has over 1,500 subrecipients.  Providing detailed information on how each subrecipient is using the funds  within the character limitation would be extremely challenging, if not  impossible for some states. Because of these complexities, OMB officials  allowed individual federal agencies to provide program-specific guidance  that was tailored to the awards made under their programs, if the agency  determined such guidance was necessary. They noted, however, that while  information on subrecipient activities and fund uses may not be specifically  included on Recovery.gov, the information included in the prime recipient  reports should, as a whole, represent the entire grant, including  subrecipient information.

Education  officials reported they provided this information to recipients to ease the  burden of Recovery Act reporting. For example, each prime recipient is  required to submit information each quarter for over 60 data elements for  each Recovery Act grant it receives. Since the Act funded multiple formula  grants to states, many were required to submit as many as nine reports  totaling up to approximately 540 required data elements.  Several state  officials told us that including subrecipient information in their reporting  required additional resources and time. For example, Colorado officials  told us that summarizing information from nearly 300 separate subrecipient  reports was their biggest challenge in compiling and reporting on the data  required by section 1512.", "In its tip sheets, Education provided suggested standard language that  recipients could use when reporting on three of the four narrative fields.  Education officials told us they provided the language for the project name,  award description, and quarterly activities/project description fields in  order to balance the reporting burden with transparency by providing  information on the grants without requiring each recipient to develop its  own information. The only narrative field without this language was the  description of jobs created. Officials told us that information in the  description of jobs created field needed to be individualized for each grant  and therefore standard language would not be appropriate for that field.

Specifically,  the description of the award notes that the funds were used for continued  support of the state\u2019s Extended Learning Opportunities program, which  served 8,018 economically disadvantaged students across 90 campuses  statewide. The state also reported on a number of outcomes from its  Recovery Act ESEA Title I, Part A fund use, including student improvement  over the course of the program, as well as jobs created.", "Thirteen percent of descriptions by states included most, but not all  information needed to allow the public to understand how Recovery Act  education funds were being used. For example, Kentucky\u2019s information for  its Recovery Act ESEA Title I, Part A award met all elements of our  transparency criteria except for outcomes (see table 4). Specifically,  Kentucky\u2019s description reported that its LEAs primarily used these funds  for job retention across a number of occupational types. However, while  the purpose of these funds is clear, \u201cto improve the teaching and learning of  targeted low performing students and schools,\u201d it is not clear what specific  outcomes had resulted or were expected to result from their fund use (for  example, averting staff layoffs, preventing teacher furloughs, or  maintaining current class size).", "Most states (78 percent) only partially met our transparency criteria  because their description contained much less information and met only a  few attributes of our criteria. For example, Alaska\u2019s description does not  provide sufficient information on what project activities were supported  and what outcomes resulted from the use of these funds to enable the  public to understand how it is using Recovery Act funds (see table 5). While  Alaska does provide jobs-related information in terms of the number of  jobs created or retained, the information is not clear as to whether or not  job creation or retention was the only or primary use of its Recovery Act  SFSF education stabilization funds.", "We found that for all three education programs, descriptions that contained  only Education\u2019s suggested standard language were less transparent than  those that entered information specific to the program and activities  conducted in their states. Education\u2019s reporting guidance provided  standard language for the quarterly activities/project description field but it  did not contain instructions or guidance for recipients to describe how  funds were being used by subrecipients. For example, the suggested  language for the ESEA Title I, Part A program instructed states to enter  \u201cImprove teaching and learning for students most at risk of failing to meet  State Academic Achievement Standards.\u201d While the use of such language  by states may facilitate the process of reporting their section 1512 data (i.e.,  reduce the reporting burden), it does not provide information on what  funds are being spent on (e.g., professional development, technology, or  testing assessments) and it provides the public with little information on  how funds are being used at the local level.

Stabilization funds for education distributed under the Recovery Act must  first be used to alleviate shortfalls in state support for education to local  educational agencies and public institutions of higher education. States  must use 81.8 percent of their SFSF formula grant funds to support  education (these funds are referred to as education stabilization funds) and  must use the remaining 18.2 percent for public safety and other  government services, which may include education (these funds are  referred to as government services funds). After maintaining state support  for education at fiscal year 2006 levels, states must use education  stabilization funds to restore state funding to the greater of fiscal year 2008  or 2009 levels for state support to LEAs and public IHEs. When distributing  these funds to LEAs, states must use their primary education funding  formula, but they can determine how to allocate funds to public IHEs.

We also reviewed reporting guidance established by OMB,  the Recovery Board, and any supplemental guidance and technical  assistance developed by Education for the three programs covered in our  review. We met with OMB, Education, and Recovery Board officials to gain  an understanding of the reporting requirements and systems.", "To assess the extent to which descriptions of awards transparently  described how funds were being used, we utilized a GAO transparency  assessment methodology developed for our May 2010 report on Recovery  Act transparency.  This assessment was based on the requirements of the  Recovery Act; OMB\u2019s guidance, including OMB\u2019s Recipient Reporting Data  Model; the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006;  and professional judgment. We considered descriptions of awards  transparent if they conveyed, in a manner understandable to the general  public, a basic understanding of the activities to be carried out and the  expected outcomes. This effort was meant to be an assessment of  transparency only with regard to the specific reporting fields we reviewed,  not to Recovery.gov as a whole or to the Administration\u2019s efforts to make  this information available frequently and in a timely manner.", "In assessing transparency, we reviewed all prime recipient award records  on Recovery.gov as of April 30, 2010, for the three education programs  covered in this review. Similar to the transparency review we conducted in  May 2010, we reviewed the required fields on Recovery.gov that describe  the uses of Recovery Act funds, including project name, award description,  and quarterly activities/project description. In addition to these fields, we  reviewed the description of jobs created field. For this field, prime  recipients were advised by Education to briefly describe the types of jobs  created or retained. Education officials told us that this field may contain  important information that would help the public understand how states  are using their Recovery Act funds. In addition, as reported in our  December 2009 bimonthly report, we found that creating and retaining jobs  was the top use of funds for all three of the programs we reviewed. Finally,  because the education programs in our review provide states with formula  grants that state education agencies (SEA) pass through to LEAs, we also  reviewed the number, location, and award amount of subawards reported  on Recovery.gov by prime recipients.", "To apply our transparency criteria, we discerned if the information on  Recovery.gov contained the following specific attributes:  general purpose of the award (e.g., retaining funding for K-12 schools or   nature of activities being conducted (e.g., purchases of educational  technology and training of instructional support staff),  location (where award activities are being conducted; e.g., school  district or city),  status (percentage complete),  outcome (what is expected to be achieved; e.g., increased student  achievement reflected by higher test scores), and  scope (i.e., number of schools or students covered by project).", "Using these seven attributes and our professional judgment, we assessed  information in the selected data fields for understandability, clarity, and  completeness. Two analysts independently reviewed information on each  award from the selected fields and then compared results to reach a  consensus on whether the description fully met, significantly met, partially  met, or did not meet the transparency criteria. If they could not agree, a  third analyst reviewed the award information without regard to the original  determinations and made a deciding assessment. Descriptions that were  understandable, clear, and complete met our transparency criteria.  Descriptions that contained information for almost all the attributes cited  above (purpose, nature of activities, location, and so on) \u201csignificantly met\u201d  our transparency criteria, while those that contained some information  were considered to \u201cpartially meet\u201d our transparency criteria. Descriptions  that contained little or no information did not meet our transparency  criteria. Finally, for the recipient reports we reviewed, we performed a  number of electronic edit checks on the awards for the prime recipients,  including any associated subrecipients, to determine whether there were  possible anomalies in the award information. We also discussed data  reliability issues with OMB and Education to ensure data quality.", "In addition to the review described above, we met with federal officials and  state and local officials responsible for recipient reporting in 15 states and  the District of Columbia included in our bimonthly review to discuss the  procedures for compiling and reporting information on Recovery Act funds  and how information on awards is made available to the public.", "To obtain national-level information for our bimonthly review on how  Recovery Act SFSF education stabilization funds; ESEA Title I, Part A  funds; and IDEA Part B for school-aged children funds were used at the  local level, we designed and administered a Web-based survey of local  educational agencies (LEAs) in the 50 states and the District of Columbia.  We surveyed school district superintendents across the country to learn  how Recovery Act funding was used and what impact these funds had on  school districts. Given that few descriptions fully met our transparency  assessment, we included on this survey several questions related to how  LEAs were using funds from these three programs. We conducted our  survey between March and April 2010, with a 78 percent final weighted  response rate. We selected a stratified random sample of 575 LEAs from  the population of 16,065 LEAs included in our sample frame of LEAs  obtained from Education\u2019s Common Core of Data in 2007-2008. We selected  a nongeneralizable subsample of 50 LEAs per education program we  reviewed (150 LEAs total) to provide illustrative information on how LEAs  are using their Recovery Act funds. We took steps to minimize nonsampling  errors by pretesting the survey instrument with officials in 5 LEAs in  January and February 2010.", "We did not determine whether federal agencies or prime recipients selected  the awards discussed in this report to ensure that the awards met the  requirements of the Act or whether the recipients met the Act\u2019s eligibility  requirements.
