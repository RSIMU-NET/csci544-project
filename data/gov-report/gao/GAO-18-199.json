GAO examined (1) what NRC and recent key scientific reviews have reported about the effects of ingestion of arsenic on human health, (2) the extent to which FDA and USDA have managed the risk to human health from arsenic in rice, and (3) the extent to which FDA has coordinated with USDA and other federal agencies on actions to manage the risk. GAO analyzed a 2013 NRC report on inorganic arsenic, 14 reviews of scientific studies on the human health effects of ingesting arsenic published from January 2015 to June 2017, and agency documents; interviewed agency officials; and compared good practices with actions FDA and USDA took to manage risk and that FDA took to coordinate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The National Research Council (NRC) of the National Academy of Sciences, in 2013, and more recent key scientific reviews reported evidence of associations between long-term ingestion of arsenic and adverse human health effects, such as cardiovascular disease. Many of the studies NRC reviewed as part of its survey of the scientific literature examined the ingestion of arsenic in drinking water, but others looked at arsenic from all sources, including dietary sources such as rice. NRC stated that evidence suggests that food, particularly rice, may be a significant source of inorganic arsenic, the more toxic of the two forms of arsenic; however, consumption of rice and levels of arsenic in rice vary widely, making it difficult to estimate arsenic intake from rice. NRC identified stronger evidence for some health effects at higher levels of arsenic\u2014defined by NRC as 100 parts per billion or higher in drinking water\u2014than at lower levels, which are more common in the United States, and noted that research on the health effects of ingesting lower levels of arsenic is ongoing.", "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) have taken actions to manage the risk of arsenic in rice to human health, including assessing the type and prevalence of health effects that may result from long-term ingestion of arsenic in rice. FDA also has taken action to publicly communicate and report on the risk. In 2016, FDA issued a risk assessment about the human health effects from long-term ingestion of arsenic in rice and draft guidance recommending industry not exceed a level of 100 parts per billion of inorganic arsenic in infant rice cereal. FDA noted it issued this guidance because infants face a higher risk owing to their less-varied diets. However, FDA has not updated the risk assessment, which was informed by a review of scientific studies published before February 2015, or finalized the draft guidance. In prior work, GAO has found that sharing risk information and incorporating stakeholder feedback can help organizations identify and better manage risks, as well as increase transparency and accountability to Congress and taxpayers. FDA officials stated that they may update the risk assessment based on newly-available information and consider public comments before finalizing the draft guidance. However, FDA officials could not provide a specific timeline for either. By developing such a timeline, FDA could help clarify when it will take action and improve the transparency of its decisions.", "FDA coordinated with USDA and other federal agencies on actions to manage the risk of arsenic in rice to varying extents. For example, FDA and USDA coordinated on developing arsenic detection methods for rice to a limited extent, although both agencies have crosscutting strategic goals for developing detection methods for foodborne contaminants, including arsenic. GAO has noted in prior work that developing interagency mechanisms to coordinate crosscutting issues may reduce potentially duplicative efforts. FDA and USDA officials stated that they coordinated on an informal basis but have no mechanism for coordinating more formally. By developing a coordination mechanism, FDA and USDA could enhance their ability to use their resources efficiently and avoid potentially duplicative efforts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making five recommendations, including that FDA develop a timeline for updating its risk assessment and finalizing its draft guidance and that FDA and USDA develop a coordination mechanism for developing methods to detect foodborne contaminants, including arsenic.

It exists in two general forms, organic and inorganic.  Both can be harmful to human health, but inorganic arsenic is generally  considered to be the more toxic form. Inorganic arsenic has been  classified as carcinogenic to humans by the International Agency for  Research on Cancer. According to the Department of Health and Human  Services\u2019 (HHS) Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry,  exposure to arsenic generally occurs through contaminated groundwater  and the ingestion of foods containing arsenic compounds. The Agency  for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry identified rice as a  predominant dietary source of arsenic. Partly because of the flooded  conditions under which rice is typically grown, rice may be more  susceptible to arsenic contamination than other crops. In 2009, the  European Food Safety Authority noted that exposure of infants to arsenic  in rice products is a concern because such products are often used in  foods for infants and because infants and young children have a higher  food intake relative to their body weight than adults.", "The safety and quality of the U.S. food supply, both domestic and  imported, are governed by a complex system stemming from at least 30  federal laws that are administered by 15 federal agencies. HHS\u2019s Food  and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture  (USDA) are the principal agencies working to protect the food supply from  risks, such as contamination. FDA is responsible for ensuring the safety  of virtually all domestic and imported food products, with the exception of  meat and poultry, processed egg products, and catfish, which are the  responsibility of USDA\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service. Other  agencies within USDA also play a role in food safety. For example,  USDA\u2019s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and National Institute of  Food and Agriculture (NIFA) sponsor food safety research. In addition,  the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the statutory  responsibility for, among other things, ensuring that the pesticides used  on food crops do not endanger public health. EPA has been updating its  assessment of the health hazards of inorganic arsenic in the Integrated  Risk Information System\u2014an important source of toxicity information for  federal agencies. The National Research Council (NRC) of the National  Academy of Sciences has reviewed EPA\u2019s approach to updating its  toxicological assessment of inorganic arsenic and issued a report in 2013  that provided key guidance and a preliminary survey of the literature on  inorganic arsenic.", "For more than 4 decades, we have reported on the fragmented federal  food safety oversight system, which has caused inconsistent oversight,  ineffective coordination, and inefficient use of resources. In January 2007,  because of risks to the economy and to public health and safety, we  added transforming federal oversight of food safety to our list of areas at  high risk for fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement, or most in need of  transformation. In our February 2017 update to that list, we noted that  HHS, USDA, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) have  taken some positive steps to address fragmentation in the federal food  oversight system but that additional steps are needed. In January 2017,  to address ongoing fragmentation, we recommended that the Executive  Office of the President, in consultation with relevant federal agencies and  other stakeholders, develop a national strategy to improve the food safety  oversight system. In addition, we have found shortcomings with FDA\u2019s  oversight of seafood, dietary supplements, and other matters.

We identified the reviews by  conducting a literature search of research databases, such as PubMed  and Toxline, and selected English-language reviews that met certain  criteria, such as relying on human, rather than animal, studies. We  assessed the scientific and statistical credibility, reliability, and  methodological soundness of the reviews and excluded reviews for which  we could not clearly determine the methodology.", "To determine the extent to which FDA and USDA have managed the risk  to human health from arsenic in rice, we examined relevant provisions in  the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended; the Federal  Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996; and other laws,  regulations, and policies. We also reviewed our prior work on enterprise  risk management and used the essential elements for managing risk that  it identified. We identified information on agency actions for managing  the risk from arsenic in rice by collecting documentation and interviewing  officials from FDA and USDA, and we reviewed the information in light of  the requirements, policies, and elements. We assessed FDA\u2019s and  USDA\u2019s reported actions to determine the extent to which each agency\u2019s  actions aligned with the essential elements for managing risk. In  assessing FDA\u2019s and USDA\u2019s actions against these essential elements,  we used the terms \u201cconsistent\u201d and \u201cpartially consistent\u201d to reflect the  extent to which each agency\u2019s actions aligned with an essential element.  We also interviewed 17 stakeholders, including university researchers,  representatives of a consumer organization, and representatives of the  rice industry, including rice mills and farms, to obtain their views on the  extent to which FDA\u2019s and USDA\u2019s actions managed this risk. We  identified stakeholders based on suggestions from agency officials and  other stakeholders; through our site visit to Arkansas\u2019 rice agricultural  research and production areas and rice mills; and the stakeholders\u2019  unique perspective or qualifications, such as membership in the NRC  Committee on Inorganic Arsenic. The views we obtained in these  interviews are not generalizable to all university researchers or consumer  or rice industry organizations but they provide illustrative examples of the  views of such stakeholders.", "To determine the extent to which FDA coordinated with USDA and other  federal agencies on actions to manage the risk from arsenic in rice, we  identified actions for which coordination would be expected. Specifically,  we identified actions for which the agencies shared similar goals in their  strategic plans or relevant expertise. For these actions, we examined  whether FDA developed interagency collaborative mechanisms. We had  previously reported that such mechanisms could facilitate coordination  between agencies. We also examined whether FDA considered a key  issue we had identified when implementing one of these mechanisms: to  clarify the roles and responsibilities of participating agencies. We selected  this key issue because it was relevant to the challenges FDA and the  other agencies faced.

It commonly  enters the body through ingestion of food or water. Most data reported for  arsenic in food describe the levels of total arsenic because analyses that  provide information about the forms of arsenic present are more difficult  to perform, and relatively few laboratories are able to perform these  analyses. Data on the levels of specific forms of arsenic, however, are  becoming increasingly important because, according to the Agency for  Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, the two forms have different  toxicities, with inorganic arsenic being considered the more toxic form.  Further, foods may have different proportions of organic and inorganic  arsenic as well as different levels of total arsenic. According to the  European Food Safety Authority, plants generally contain low levels of  both total and inorganic arsenic, but rice may contain significant levels of  total arsenic and inorganic arsenic. Levels of arsenic in groundwater, a  major source of drinking water in many parts of the world, may be high in  some areas; essentially all the arsenic in drinking water is inorganic  arsenic.", "The form and level of arsenic in rice may vary depending on the  geographic region where rice is grown, conditions under which rice is  grown, variety of the rice, and rice milling practices. In the United  States\u2014where, according to USDA, approximately 80 percent of the rice  consumed domestically is grown\u2014rice is primarily grown in six states:  Arkansas, California, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and Texas. In  2016, the latest year for which USDA data were available, about 47  percent of the rice grown in the United States was grown in Arkansas,  and about 21 percent was grown in California.", "The amount of arsenic rice absorbs varies by geographic region because  of differing levels of arsenic in the soil and other factors. Arsenic levels in  the soil vary both naturally and as a result of human activity. Natural  processes that contribute to arsenic levels in the soil may include bedrock  weathering, because arsenic is present in many rock-forming minerals.  Human activities that contribute to arsenic levels in the soil may include  the use of arsenic-based pesticides and animal drugs, the mining and  smelting of metal, and coal combustion. Figure 1 shows the results of a  2013 U.S. Geological Survey sampling of soils to measure the levels of  arsenic in the contiguous United States. In addition, the figure shows  the outlines of rice-growing counties based on 2016 data from USDA.", "Compared to other plants, rice absorbs more arsenic from the  environment, in part because of the physiology of rice. For example, rice  may readily absorb certain compounds of arsenic because, among other  reasons, these compounds are similar in size to compounds containing  silicon, an essential nutrient for rice. The conditions under which rice is  grown may also cause it to absorb more arsenic than other plants. For  instance, rice is often grown in flooded fields to control pests, grasses,  and diseases, among other reasons. However, flooded conditions may  promote the formation of arsenic compounds that may be easily absorbed  by the rice plant. Even under the same growing conditions, some varieties  of rice tend to have higher levels of arsenic in their grain, on average,  than others, owing to a need for longer growing periods, among other  factors. In addition, the concentrations of the two forms of arsenic may  vary within the rice grain. While organic arsenic may be distributed  throughout the rice grain, most of the inorganic arsenic is found in the  bran layer. As seen in figure 2, the process of milling rice removes the  bran layer; thus, levels of inorganic arsenic in white, or milled, rice may be  lower than those in brown, or whole grain, rice."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies\u2019 Responsibilities for Rice", "paragraphs": ["A number of federal agencies are responsible for ensuring the safety and  quality of rice and for assessing the human health effects of ingestion of  arsenic in rice.

Specifically, FDA is responsible for determining whether food,  including rice, is deemed to be adulterated (i.e., whether it bears or  contains any poisonous or deleterious substance that may render it  injurious to health). Under its regulations, FDA may issue guidance to  establish a level of a contaminant that a food should not exceed. FDA  would consider case-by-case whether a food that contains the  contaminant is adulterated. For example, in 2013, FDA issued draft  guidance for arsenic in apple juice, on the basis of its risk assessment  that estimated the long-term cancer risk posed by inorganic arsenic.  According to FDA, its Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition is  responsible for regulatory and research programs that address the health  risks associated with foodborne contaminants and is aided in this role by  the Office of Regulatory Affairs, which is responsible for field-based  activities such as inspections, sampling, and testing of regulated  products. The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition also conducts  industry outreach and educates consumers, among other things.", "Other agencies within HHS may also conduct research, collect data, and  provide information on the health effects of arsenic. For example, the  National Institutes of Health (NIH) sponsor research on the health effects  of ingestion of arsenic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC) administer the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,  which, among other things, collects data about diet and exposure to  certain substances, such as arsenic.

Within USDA, ARS and NIFA conduct and sponsor research, to, among  other things, maintain an adequate, nutritious, and safe supply of food to  meet human nutritional needs and requirements. NIFA also distributes  capacity grants that support research and extension programs at land- grant universities, which provide science-based information to farmers.  The Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 authorizes the Federal Grain  Inspection Service (FGIS) to establish quality standards, including  standards for rice. FGIS also offers inspection services for rice farmers  and processors upon request. The Risk Management Agency manages  the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, which offers crop insurance to  farmers for over 100 different crops, including rice. For the 2018 crop  year, the rice crop insurance provisions generally require that the rice be  flood-irrigated (i.e., intentionally covered with water at a uniform and  shallow depth throughout the growing season).", "Other agencies play a role in managing the risk of arsenic. EPA regulates  the presence of certain substances, such as arsenic, in drinking water  under the Safe Drinking Water Act and conducts toxicological  assessments. In 2001, EPA issued a rule limiting the level of arsenic in  drinking water to 10 parts per billion (ppb) to protect consumers from the  health effects of long-term exposure. Under its Integrated Risk  Information System program, EPA conducts assessments that provide  toxicity values\u2014such as for increased cancer risk due to lifetime ingestion  of a specified quantity of a substance. In accordance with congressional  direction, EPA submitted a plan for developing a draft assessment and  preliminary assessment materials for inorganic arsenic to NRC for review.  In 2013, NRC released an interim report, which provided guidance to EPA  and included a preliminary survey of the scientific literature.

In addition, FDA has been using laser  ablation, the process of removing a material from a solid using a laser  beam so that it can be measured, as a way to study arsenic distribution in  rice.", "From 2011 through 2014, FDA conducted targeted sampling of more than  1,400 rice-based foods\u2014including rice, rice beverages, cereals, and  snacks\u2014for inorganic arsenic. This targeted sampling and a literature  review of articles published before February 2015 informed a risk  assessment of arsenic in rice that FDA issued for public comment in April  2016. Specifically, the risk assessment used the results of the targeted  sampling to identify levels of inorganic arsenic in rice and examined  available scientific information to provide quantitative estimates of lung  and bladder cancer risk\u2014that is, the number of expected lung and  bladder cancer cases per million people that may be attributable to long- term ingestion of inorganic arsenic in rice and a qualitative assessment of  other adverse health effects. The risk assessment also analyzed  alternative approaches to reducing the risk of arsenic in rice, such as  instituting limits on the allowable level of arsenic in various rice-based  foods, limiting the amount and frequency of consumption of rice, and  cooking practices.", "FDA\u2019s actions have helped assess the risk of arsenic in rice, although  some stakeholders we interviewed have identified limitations to FDA\u2019s  actions. For example, one rice producer noted that because FDA\u2019s  current detection method is time-consuming and expensive, it is not  widely used\u2014companies only use it when tests for total arsenic reveal  that the levels exceed the limit for inorganic arsenic that their customers  request. Some stakeholders noted that the evidence FDA used to assess  the risk of the ingestion of low levels of arsenic, which may be more  relevant for rice consumption, is more uncertain.", "USDA agencies have also taken actions to assess the risk by conducting  research to develop faster and less expensive methods to detect  inorganic arsenic in rice. In 2016, ARS developed a method using hydride  generation, which uses an acid to convert the inorganic arsenic into a gas  that can be detected by an instrument. ARS officials stated that they have  conducted research on the hydride generation method for more than 5  years and were able to further refine the method with funding from the  Rice Foundation. Stakeholders from the rice industry and a university  researcher we interviewed noted that, while the hydride generation  method is faster and cheaper than FDA\u2019s current detection method, it is  too time-consuming and expensive for commercial purposes. For  example, rice mills could not keep pace with trucks lining up to unload  rice if they use the hydride generation method. However, ARS officials  stated that researchers may use it if they need to analyze thousands of  samples and are willing to trade off some accuracy for speed and cost. In  addition, FGIS conducted some of its own development work on the  Arsenator. Agency officials said that they began research on the  Arsenator to help provide a rapid and inexpensive method of detecting  inorganic arsenic at FGIS official testing locations that could include rice  mills but have suspended their efforts because representatives of the rice  industry have told them that these tests are not necessary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Responding to the Risks", "paragraphs": ["FDA and USDA have taken actions to respond to the risk of arsenic in  rice. In 2016, FDA issued draft guidance, which proposed an action level,  recommending that the rice industry not exceed a level of 100 ppb  inorganic arsenic in infant rice cereal, and FDA has conducted research  on cooking methods that may reduce arsenic. In its draft guidance, FDA  stated that it used its risk assessment, among other considerations, to  identify the level of inorganic arsenic in infant rice cereal. FDA further  noted that it selected 100 ppb because of the potential for human health  risks associated with inorganic arsenic and because such a level is  achievable with the use of current good manufacturing practices\u2014 specifically, selecting sources of rice or rice-derived ingredients with lower  inorganic arsenic levels. FDA officials told us that they focused on infant  rice cereal because infants are at a higher risk of experiencing some of  the health effects of ingesting inorganic arsenic, such as  neurodevelopmental effects, and because the diet of infants is less varied  than that of adults. FDA officials noted that the proposed guidance sets a  limit for infant rice cereal that is generally consistent with the limit set by  the European Commission and that other types of rice sold in the United  States also generally meet the Codex Alimentarius standards.", "University researchers and a group representing consumers we  interviewed stated that FDA\u2019s draft guidance is a good first step, but that  FDA should establish limits for arsenic in other rice products, such as rice  crackers and other foods that children eat. FDA officials noted that the  next most susceptible group would likely be toddlers and young children,  but because their diet is more diverse than that of infants, rice-based  foods make up a smaller portion of their diet. FDA requested public  comments on certain aspects of the draft guidance, such as its feasibility,  and noted that when it is finalized, it will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking  on this topic. The public comments were due to FDA in July 2016,  although FDA noted that the public may comment on its guidance at any  time. University researchers and stakeholders from the rice industry we  interviewed stated that FDA\u2019s draft guidance has become a de facto  industry standard for infant rice cereal. In 2016, FDA also published  research on the effect that cooking methods, such as cooking rice in  excess water, may have on reducing the level of arsenic in rice. FDA  officials told us that they provided advice to consumers on cooking  methods that could reduce arsenic in rice on the FDA website but said  FDA will not direct manufacturers to change the cooking instructions for  rice because the alternative methods may reduce the nutritional value of  the rice.", "Within USDA, ARS and NIFA have sponsored published and ongoing  research that can help respond to the risk, such as research on ways to  reduce the uptake of arsenic by rice through new rice varieties, water  management practices, and soil additives, as well as research on the  genetic mechanisms underlying the uptake and transport of arsenic in the  rice plant. For example, ARS has been conducting research on rice  varieties that can improve yield and grain quality, including lower levels of  arsenic, at the Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center in Arkansas  for more than 30 years. In 2016, university and ARS researchers  published a study showing that growing rice using a water management  practice called alternate wetting and drying could decrease the levels of  arsenic. Under this practice of growing rice, shown in figure 3 below,  fields are periodically drained and re-flooded during the growing season.", "ARS officials stated that the alternate wetting and drying water  management practice has been adopted to a limited extent in Arkansas,  but pointed out that other benefits, such as reducing water use, may have  been more influential to its adoption than the lowering of arsenic levels.  They noted that there are a number of challenges that may preclude  widespread use, including inadequate water-pumping capacity and the  lack of crop insurance coverage for the practice. In addition, in 2015,  university researchers and an ARS researcher, with a grant from NIFA,  published a study on the effects of adding iron oxide to the soil on the  levels of arsenic in rice; they found that iron oxide resulted in significant  reduction of arsenic for the two varieties of rice that the study examined."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Monitoring Risks", "paragraphs": ["FDA, which is responsible for ensuring the safety of rice and rice-based  foods, has taken actions to monitor the risk of arsenic in rice.

In fiscal years 2015 and  2016, FDA monitored the risk of arsenic by assessing the levels in rice  and rice-based foods under this compliance program, and FDA officials  told us that they plan to continue to do so in fiscal years 2017 and 2018.  FDA officials told us that they generally test the rice for total arsenic but  have recently analyzed some samples for inorganic arsenic based on  factors such as the level of total arsenic found. FDA considers whether to  conduct follow-up actions, including enforcement actions, on a case-by- case basis. As a result of its monitoring in 2016 and 2017 FDA  considered, but did not take, two enforcement actions for arsenic in infant  rice cereal. FDA officials stated that the inorganic arsenic level in one  case was close to the 100 ppb limit and within the margin of error of the  detection method, and in the second case, FDA determined during its  follow-up to the initial sample that the manufacturer destroyed the  remaining product.", "USDA agencies have not monitored arsenic in rice. The Food Safety and  Inspection Service is USDA\u2019s regulatory agency for food safety, but  officials have told us they have not taken actions in this area because rice  is not under the agency\u2019s jurisdiction. ARS maintains a food composition  database, but it does not monitor rice for contaminants such as arsenic  because, according to ARS officials, that is not the database\u2019s purpose.  FGIS officials stated that they do not have an arsenic testing program for  rice at this time.

FDA has requested comments and received 22 public  comments from 17 individuals and organizations on both documents. The  comments have addressed a range of issues, including the methodology  FDA used in its risk assessment; the 100 ppb limit and scope of the  agency\u2019s draft guidance; and the effectiveness of the agency\u2019s  communication to the public. However, FDA has not publicly issued  versions of the guidance or the risk assessment that address these  comments.

For  example, FDA officials told us that they plan to consider newly-available  information, such as any updates to EPA\u2019s Integrated Risk Information  System assessment for inorganic arsenic, and may update the risk  assessment as a result. With regard to public comments, FDA officials  told us that they do not intend to make any changes to the approach or  findings of the risk assessment and that they are still considering whether  to make changes to the draft guidance as a result of public comments.  FDA officials stated that they are still reviewing comments and that,  before publication, the guidance would have to undergo interagency  review. FDA officials also stated that the agency is not required to provide  a response to comments in the final guidance. Further, FDA officials  stated that the agency does not need to finalize the guidance in order to  sample foods for a contaminant or to take enforcement action when  contamination may pose a health hazard.", "Stakeholders we interviewed stated that updating the risk assessment  and finalizing the draft guidance would improve FDA\u2019s communication of  the risk. For example, some stakeholders we interviewed told us that the  information used in the risk assessment\u2014both regarding the health  effects of arsenic and the levels of arsenic in rice\u2014may need to be  updated to incorporate the results of more recent research. Further, two  stakeholders we interviewed\u2014one representing the rice industry and the  other representing consumers\u2014noted that it is not clear to them what  actions FDA can take based on the draft guidance. However, FDA  officials could not give us a timeline for when they plan to update the risk  assessment or finalize the guidance. By developing a timeline for  updating the risk assessment on arsenic in rice to incorporate any newly- available information, FDA could help clarify when it will take action.

From May 2015 through July 2015, USDA  conducted its first review of these documents and provided FDA with  comments. USDA had offered to provide FDA with feedback on versions  of the risk assessment on several occasions earlier in the process, but  FDA did not accept USDA\u2019s offers, according to a USDA official. As  discussed below, FDA chose to engage USDA later in the process.", "In their comments, USDA officials expressed concerns regarding  uncertainties and data limitations in the risk assessment and draft  guidance on arsenic in infant rice cereal. USDA also raised questions  about whether sufficient data on the link to adverse health effects existed  to warrant the draft guidance. Furthermore, USDA stated that because  the documents focus solely on rice, instead of addressing risks to the diet  as a whole, FDA needs to share clear, consistent, and understandable  messages with the public to alleviate fear and misunderstanding related  to the risk posed by arsenic in rice. According to USDA officials, FDA did  not adequately address their comments in the revised documents,  including FDA\u2019s communication strategy.

We identified information on agency actions for managing the risk from  arsenic in rice by collecting documentation and interviewing officials from  FDA and USDA and we reviewed the information in light of the  requirements, policies, and elements. We assessed FDA\u2019s and USDA\u2019s  reported actions to determine the extent to which each agency\u2019s actions  aligned with these elements. In assessing FDA\u2019s and USDA\u2019s actions  against these essential elements, we used the terms \u201cconsistent\u201d and  \u201cpartially consistent\u201d to reflect the extent to which each agency\u2019s actions  aligned with an essential element. A determination of \u201cconsistent\u201d meant  that the agency provided evidence that it had taken major actions in  alignment with that essential element. A determination of \u201cpartially  consistent\u201d meant that the agency provided evidence that it had taken  some actions in alignment with that essential element.", "We also interviewed 17 stakeholders to obtain their views on the extent to  which FDA\u2019s and USDA\u2019s actions managed the risk, including university  researchers (academics) specializing in relevant fields such as  epidemiology and soil chemistry, representatives of a consumer  organization, and representatives of the rice industry, including rice mills  and farms. We identified stakeholders based on suggestions from agency  officials and other stakeholders; through our site visit in Arkansas\u2019 rice  agricultural research and production areas and rice mills; and based on  the stakeholders\u2019 unique perspective or qualifications, such as  membership in the NRC Committee on Inorganic Arsenic. The views we  obtained from these interviews are not generalizable to all university  researchers or consumer or rice industry organizations but they provide  illustrative examples of the views of such stakeholders. Table 1 lists  information about the 17 stakeholders we interviewed.", "To determine the extent to which FDA has coordinated with USDA and  other federal agencies on actions to manage the risk to human health  from arsenic in rice, we identified relevant actions and examined whether  FDA developed interagency collaborative mechanisms, which we have  previously reported could help to facilitate coordination between  agencies. To identify actions for which the agencies shared similar goals  in their strategic plans or relevant expertise and for which FDA would be  expected to coordinate with USDA and other federal agencies, we  reviewed relevant provisions in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic  Act, as amended; the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act  of 1996; other relevant laws, regulations, and policies; the current  science and research strategic plan for FDA\u2019s Center for Food Science  and Applied Nutrition and current strategic plans for USDA\u2019s Agricultural  Research Service (ARS) and Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS);  and information about the agencies\u2019 missions from their websites. These  actions were the development of FDA\u2019s risk assessment and draft  guidance on arsenic in rice and FDA\u2019s and USDA\u2019s efforts to develop  detection methods for arsenic in rice. We interviewed FDA officials and  reviewed documentation they provided to identify the other federal  agencies and offices with which FDA coordinated the development and  review of its risk assessment and draft guidance on arsenic in infant rice  cereal and the development of methods for detecting arsenic in rice.  These agencies and offices included ARS, the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),  FGIS, National Institutes of Health\u2019s National Institute of Environmental  Health Sciences, the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019  Assistant Secretary for Legislation and Office of the Assistant Secretary  for Planning and Evaluation, Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB)  Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, the Small Business  Administration\u2019s Office of Advocacy, and the U.S. Trade Representative.", "To determine the extent to which FDA coordinated its risk assessment  and draft guidance on arsenic in rice with USDA and other federal  agencies, we obtained and reviewed FDA\u2019s framework for conducting risk  assessments; reviewed agencies\u2019 comments on these documents;  interviewed FDA officials regarding FDA\u2019s efforts to coordinate with other  agencies; and interviewed officials from the Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention; EPA; the National Institutes of Health; OMB; the Small  Business Administration\u2019s Office of Advocacy; and USDA regarding the  nature of their comments, their experiences coordinating with FDA, and  the extent to which FDA addressed their comments.", "To examine the extent to which FDA and USDA coordinated the  development of arsenic detection methods, we obtained and reviewed  documents, including those describing the detection methods that FDA,  ARS, and FGIS have developed or have under development, and we  interviewed officials from these agencies regarding their efforts to develop  these methods and coordinate their development efforts. We also  interviewed officials from these agencies to gather their views on the  effectiveness of these coordination efforts. We then examined whether  FDA had interagency collaborative mechanisms for the development of its  risk assessment and draft guidance, and its efforts with USDA to develop  arsenic detection methods. We also examined whether participating  agencies clarified their roles and responsibilities. Our prior work identified  this as a key issue for agencies to consider when implementing  coordination mechanisms. We selected this practice because it was  relevant to the challenges the agencies faced.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2016 to March  2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
