The Asian Development Bank and the European Union have been the major multilateral donors. The donors' main development objectives, according to the planning documents, have been to alleviate poverty and to set the Pacific Island nations on the path to economic self-sufficiency. To achieve these objectives, these donors focus their assistance in key areas, such as education, policy reform, and infrastructure. The United States could draw several lessons from the donors' experiences for providing assistance as well as the strategies and approaches the donors have adopted. These lessons could provide valuable insights for the United States as it negotiates additional economic assistance to the Federal States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. On the basis of the donors' experiences, GAO observed that (1) assistance strategies may involve trade-offs in expectations of aid effectiveness if other objectives for providing assistance take priority over development objectives; (2) assistance strategies may involve trade-offs between effectiveness and accountability, on the one hand, and administrative costs, on the other hand; (3) effective assistance depends on a good policy environment in the recipient country to create the conditions for sustainable development; (4) strategies tailored to the individual needs of the recipient country might have greater chances of succeeding because they offer recipients opportunities for stronger ownership of the program; (5) flexible strategies enable donors to adapt their assistance to changing circumstances and provide incentives for development achievements; (6) well-designed trust funds can provide sustainable sources of assistance to Pacific Island nations with limited growth options; and (7) sectorwide approaches, although generally untested in the Pacific, depend on recipient government commitment and ability."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["From fiscal years 1987 to 2001, the United States gave at least $2.6 billionin economic assistance to the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands.

The Compact provided for assistance to the two Pacific Island nations over a 15-year period, starting in 1986. Currently, the United States is negotiating with the two countries to extend the economic assistance provisions of the Compact, which are set to end in late 2001. To address concerns that (1) the countries remain highly dependent on U.S. assistance; (2) the assistance has not significantly improved conditions in the countries; and (3) the expenditures have received little oversight, the U.S. negotiator is considering the use of different assistance strategies than those in the current agreements.", "To assist the Congress in its review of the proposals for providing economic assistance that are under consideration in the negotiations, you asked us to identify useful lessons from the experiences of other donors in the Pacific.

With few exceptions, such as Papua New Guinea and Fiji, the island nations have small economies and limited natural resources, and most are highly vulnerable to natural disasters, environmental problems, and the impacts of climate change. Their remote location, poor access to commercial and capital markets, and limited institutional capacity hinder economic development. In many islands, the public sector is disproportionately large, the private sector is poorly developed, and there is a shortage of trained personnel to meet development challenges. Finally, rapid urbanization, population growth, and inadequate infrastructure are outstripping the countries\u2019 ability to meet basic health and education needs. (See fig. 1 for a map of most of the island nations and territories in the Pacific region.)", "Virtually all of the Pacific Island nations, including the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), receive development assistance. (See app. III for a description of the recipient nations and the assistance they receive.) In addition, at least seven island territories in the Pacific (including New Caledonia) receive direct government assistance from their associated governments and, in some cases, a small amount of development assistance from other donors. Five of the small island nations\u2014Kiribati, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu\u2014are \u201cleast developed countries,\u201d according to the United Nations, meaning that they have special development needs.", "In 1986, the United States entered into a Compact of Free Association with the FSM and the RMI, both of which were part of the U.N. Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands administered by the United States. The United States agreed, in part, to provide economic assistance to these countries to help them in their efforts to become economically self-sufficient. A portion of the Compact assistance to the RMI is also used for payments to landowners related to the U.S. military presence at the Kwajalein Atoll. The Department of the Interior has responsibility for administering economic assistance to the two countries. This funding represented a continuation of U.S. financial support that had been supplied to these areas for almost 40 years after World War II. The two nations have also received support in the form of direct government services, such as U.S. Postal Service and National Weather Service assistance, and grants and loans from U.S. domestic agencies. From fiscal years 1987 through 2001, total U.S. support to the islands\u2014Compact assistance and other U.S. assistance\u2014is estimated at more than $2.6 billion. The economic assistance provided to the two countries through the Compact of Free Association expires in late 2001. However, the Compact provides funding for an additional 2 years if negotiations on further assistance are not completed by that time.", "In June 2000, the Department of State\u2019s negotiator for the Compact of Free Association testified that the general approach to the new negotiations with the FSM and the RMI includes sector grants and trust fund contributions, in place of the financial transfers provided in the first 15 years of the Compact, to improve accountability for the use of funds.State concurred with our finding that the FSM, the RMI, and the United States provided limited accountability over Compact expenditures from 1987 to 1998."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Aid Donors Provided About $11 Billion in Aid to Pacific Island Nations", "paragraphs": ["From 1987 through 1999, the seven top donor countries and organizations provided about $11 billion, or 93 percent, of all development assistance to help Pacific Island nations.

The major bilateral donors, except for Japan and New Zealand, have concentrated their assistance on relatively few Pacific Island nations. For example, between 1987 and 1999, about 75 percent of Australia\u2019s assistance to the region went to Papua New Guinea, which is the largest country in the region, and about 91 percent of U.S. assistance went to the FSM, the RMI, and Palau. The multilateral donors also concentrated on a few recipients. The EU and the ADB gave about 65 percent and 55 percent of their assistance, respectively, to their top two recipients\u2014Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands for the EU and Papua New Guinea and Samoa for the ADB. Two major donors, the United Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), significantly reduced their presence in the Pacific in the 1990s. The programs of two other donors, New Zealand and Japan, were under review in those countries at the time we prepared this report. The purpose of the New Zealand review is to examine how the development assistance program can best meet the long-term development needs of the recipients, given that most of the recipient countries will be dependent on aid indefinitely. The purpose of the program review in Japan is to look for opportunities to improve Japan\u2019s budget deficit.", "Many Pacific Island nations are dependent on a single donor for most of their assistance. Seven of the 14 recipient countries received more than 50 percent of their aid from a single donor from 1987 through 1999. For example, the FSM and the RMI received 93 percent and 89 percent of their assistance, respectively, from the United States, according to our analysis. In addition, aid is concentrated between donors and recipients linked by free association agreements. The five Pacific Island nations with free association status\u2014the FSM, the RMI, and Palau, which are freely associated with the United States, and Niue and the Cook Islands, which are freely associated with New Zealand\u2014received an average of 84 percent of their aid from their top donor, while the other seven recipients received an average of 37 percent of their aid from their top donor."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Donors\u2019 Objectives", "paragraphs": ["According to documents of the major donors, their principal development objectives are to alleviate poverty in the region and help the island nations become more self-sufficient.

In 1998-99, Australia allocated 35 percent of its aid for education and training, 20 percent for economic reform and governance, 15 percent for health, 15 percent for environment and natural resources, 5 percent for private sector development, and 10 percent for other areas. Similarly, to achieve its objectives, New Zealand supports projects around six strategies: security and governance, civil society, gender equality, social development, the environment, and business.

The officials expect that, under the best circumstances, most countries will need assistance for the foreseeable future to achieve improvements in development. According to an ADB report, \u201ct is widely understood that the smallest and least-endowed island states will need to be assisted by free transfers of resources indefinitely, if they are to maintain standards of welfare that the donors of the aid can bear to look at.\u2026\u201d", "Two major donors\u2014the United Kingdom Department for International Development and USAID\u2014chose to cut their bilateral programs significantly in the 1990s, due to changed priorities and agency budgetary reasons. The United Kingdom switched from a bilateral program to a regional program in 1995 that focused on three countries\u2014Kiribati, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu\u2014where the need was greatest. According to a Department for International Development official at the regional office in Fiji, the United Kingdom now expects to end the regional program by 2004, as part of a worldwide change in the agency\u2019s focus, and will provide support to the region through multilateral donors. USAID ended its bilateral program in the South Pacific in 1994, due to agency budgetary reasons, and now provides modest assistance for a regional environmental program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Multiple Motivations for Providing Assistance Have Led to Different Expectations for Aid Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["In providing assistance to the Pacific, most of the major donors combine their development interests with other motivations, according to officials and documents of the donor agencies. These other motivations include historic ties between the donor and the recipient (such as former dependencies), foreign policy interests, and strategic interests. Australia\u2019s large commitment of assistance to Papua New Guinea, for example, responds to development needs in the country but also reflects the historical relationship and the development assistance program as agreed through a treaty with its former territory. For New Zealand, the development assistance program is one pillar of its foreign policy and is intended to contribute to stability and harmony in the South Pacific. Finally, U.S. assistance to the FSM and the RMI, through the Compact of Free Association, is one of three elements (political, economic, and defense) of the Compact. The defense element includes a right granted to the United States by the FSM and the RMI to deny access by third countries for military use.", "While multiple motivations do not inherently conflict with development interests, other interests, in some cases, have taken precedence over the effectiveness and accountability of the development assistance. According to Australian, New Zealand, and State officials, for example, the donor countries initially chose to provide unrestricted budget support to former territories as a means of separating themselves from colonialist administration. In the case of the Compact with the FSM and the RMI, State counseled Interior to be lenient in reviewing the use of Compact funds in the early years of the Compact because State placed a high priority on maintaining friendly relations with the FSM and the RMI. By 1993, however, the United States began placing greater emphasis on the effectiveness and accountability of the assistance due, in part, to the end of the Cold War. Finally, according to Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials, Japan generally selects development projects from the requests of Pacific Island nations. The criteria for evaluating a specific request include, for example, the extent to which the project will be seen as a Japanese contribution but do not include an evaluation of the project need or sustainability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Donors Also Strive to Balance Aid Effectiveness, Accountability, and Cost", "paragraphs": ["In addition to recognizing that their development assistance may be intended to achieve multiple objectives, the donors have used a range of assistance strategies in striving to reach a desired balance of aid effectiveness, accountability, and administrative cost. The donors have used at least six different strategies to deliver their development assistance to the Pacific Island nations. These strategies include technical assistance, such as the ADB\u2019s funding of the economic advisory team in the FSM;   project assistance, such as Japan\u2019s road improvement projects in the RMI;   program assistance, such as the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s job training program in the FSM;   budget support, such as New Zealand\u2019s support for government operations   sectorwide programs, such as Australia\u2019s pilot program to support the health sector in Papua New Guinea; and   contributions to trust funds, such as Australia\u2019s, New Zealand\u2019s, and the United Kingdom\u2019s contributions to the Tuvalu Trust Fund, which is intended to provide self-sustaining revenue.", "These strategies often provide different levels of donor control over their assistance, according to officials with USAID, the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Australian Agency for International Development. Technical assistance and project assistance, for example, enable donors to exercise a high level of control and accountability by participating directly in funded activities, while unrestricted budget support and some forms of trust fund contributions allow donors little or no control over their assistance because the donor is only providing cash to the recipient. Reduced control over assistance is associated with more uncertainty in achieving the aid objectives and ensuring accountability. Yet, donors also acknowledge that the higher level of control involves greater administrative costs. Thus, there are trade-offs between donor control and costs, on one side, and expected effectiveness and accountability, on the other. The following examples illustrate these trade- offs:   New Zealand and Australia have cut the amount of budget support they provide as an assistance strategy in an effort to improve the effectiveness of their assistance. They found from their experience that (1) budget support did not achieve the intended development objectives and (2) these funds were largely unaccounted for. In 1997, New Zealand eliminated all of its annual budget support to the Cook Islands and focused on technical and project assistance after New Zealand found that the Cook Islands government was misusing funds and had built a large and inefficient public sector. Similarly, the Australian Agency for International Development gradually eliminated its annual budget support to Papua New Guinea from 1990 to 2000 and replaced it with more than 100 separate project grants, because Australia could not identify specific development benefits linked to its cash transfer. At that time, Australia believed that project assistance, which it refers to as \u201cjointly programmed activities,\u201d would give it more control over development activities. According to an Australian official, delivering budget support to Papua New Guinea required only 1 to 2 staff in 1990; but, by 2000-01, the Australian program supported more than 100 projects and required 73 staff from the Australian Agency for International Development, 30 Papua New Guinea staff, and at least 1 contractor for each project.", "The Australian Agency for International Development, the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and USAID have also faced trade- offs in adopting policies on the use of development assistance to pay for recurring expenses\u2014that is, the annual government operations and maintenance costs\u2014to improve the effectiveness of their aid. On the one hand, the donors are concerned that providing assistance for recurring expenses provides a disincentive to recipients to become more self- sufficient, and that recipients may choose to use assistance to pay for operating costs that are not related to development. The donors noted that recipients might decide to defer maintenance with the expectation that donor assistance will always be available. On the other hand, the donors are concerned that the projects they helped develop are not maintained or staff and supplies are not provided, and, thus, the assistance does not have a sustainable impact. The FSM, for instance, depends on U.S. assistance to meet 98 percent of its educational operating expenses, according to a November 2000 ADB report on a proposed loan to the FSM. Officials at Interior said the Compact economic assistance was expected to pay for recurring expenses as well as program expenses and capital improvements. To address their concerns, Australia and New Zealand adopted a joint policy in 1992 to define acceptable and unacceptable uses of assistance for recurring expenses. In addition, USAID has a policy on recurrent cost problems, which calls for funding of recurrent costs under narrow conditions, such as having a carefully phased plan for shifting the cost burden to the recipient government."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Donors Are Adopting Strategies to Improve Effectiveness in Light of Long-term Aid Dependence and Trade- offs", "paragraphs": ["The major donors are exploring or have adopted assistance strategies designed to improve aid effectiveness while reacting to the context of providing aid in the Pacific region\u2014long-term aid dependence; trade-offs among multiple motivations for assistance; and trade-offs to balance cost, effectiveness, and accountability."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Strategies That Promote Good Governance", "paragraphs": ["Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the ADB have adopted strategies that promote the development of good governance policies in the recipient countries.

Australia, for example, supports efforts to develop a rule of law. The New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade believes that good governance is critical to dealing with such issues as drug trafficking, money laundering, Internet scams, and migratory diseases. The ADB, as one example of a donor that embraces this principle, shifted its strategy in 1995 to focus on economic policy and good governance issues. Between 1995 and 1998, the ADB supported reform efforts in seven Pacific Island nations to improve policy environments, including fiscal reform programs in the FSM and the RMI, which led to reductions of 37 percent and 33 percent, respectively, in the size of their public sectors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Strategies Tailored to Local Development Conditions and Needs", "paragraphs": ["In 2000, the ADB adopted a new development strategy for the Pacific that takes a subregional approach, underscoring the differences between various Pacific Island nations.

For example, the ADB lists the RMI and the FSM in different categories. The strategy for the RMI, which is an island atoll nation with severe development disadvantages emphasizes the use of trust funds to support sustainable financing of basic services and development of niche markets such as tourism. In contrast, the strategy for the FSM, which falls into the category of countries with a higher skill base, good growth prospects, and moderate resource potential, focuses on physical infrastructure and private sector development to promote economic growth.", "According to the ADB\u2019s strategy, the implementation of its previous strategy in 1996 provided several lessons, including the need (1) for the Pacific Island nations to have stronger ownership of policy and reform programs and (2) to design development strategies that take account of local cultures and capacities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Strategies That Incorporate Flexibility", "paragraphs": ["Flexible strategies are allowing donors to use their assistance as incentives and disincentives. Australia recently created two development incentives within its strategies that can provide funds for activities outside the annual program plan. One incentive, a fund for Papua New Guinea, has two components: one, a policy component to encourage and reward the effective implementation of the government development policy, and, two, a program component to fund organizations that have track records of good program management. Another incentive, the Policy and Management Reform initiative in the Pacific, allocates funds competitively to countries on the basis of demonstrated commitment to reform. Australia provided assistance from the fund to Vanuatu, for example, to reinforce a new government\u2019s commitment to economic and public sector reform.", "Flexibility in their strategies also enabled Australia and New Zealand to stop delivering assistance under undesirable circumstances. New Zealand, for example, suspended funding to the governments of Fiji, in response to a coup, and to the Solomon Islands, in response to civil unrest, while maintaining the assistance to community organizations so that aid for basic human services could continue. Australia also suspended some of its funding to Fiji due to political unrest and, in the Solomon Islands, refocused its aid on peace, security, and basic needs when ethnic conflict disrupted the country and the delivery of the aid program in mid-2000. According to New Zealand officials, flexibility is a key in selecting an assistance strategy, because it allows donors the ability to adjust programs over time as priorities and development needs change. Australia\u2019s Pacific Islands Development Strategy, 1999-2001 recommends that the donor avoid locking in commitments to rigidly designed projects to minimize the risk that the donor is not able to adjust the aid when priorities or other critical circumstances change."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Strategies Are Based on Donor Coordination", "paragraphs": ["All of the major donors have highlighted their donor coordination efforts to improve the efficiency of delivering assistance and reduce the burden of multiple donor requirements on recipients. Australia and New Zealand, for example, are studying options for harmonizing their programs to streamline their own operations and to increase their overall effectiveness. They believe that harmonization could also minimize the impact of multiple donor requirements on the recipient government. According to a World Bank official, the different reporting and other requirements of up to 18 different organizations providing assistance to the health sector in the Solomon Islands are stretching the capacity of the Solomon Islands government. In addition, the ADB hosts regular donor consultation meetings to discuss the development assistance needs of individual recipients and to coordinate assistance to avoid duplication. Finally, Australian officials said donor coordination is most effective if the recipient countries lead the coordination effort. Where the countries lack the capacity to lead the coordination effort, the donors should assist them to strengthen the coordination functions.

A 1999 report prepared for the ADB noted that two trust funds in the Pacific, the Tuvalu Trust Fund and the Kiribati Revenue Equalisation Reserve Fund, have been successful but that several others were less successful due, in part, to fraud, poor management, unclear objectives, and risky investments. The report stated that the Tuvalu and Kiribati funds were successful primarily because they were designed to protect the investment capital from misuse. As a result of its contribution to the Tuvalu Trust Fund in 1987, the United Kingdom ceased its annual budget support to Tuvalu, because the trust fund provided the means to balance the budget. According to the consultant who prepared the report to the ADB, other funds, such as the Nauru Phosphate Royalties Trust, have been less successful, because the funds were not designed to ensure good management and to protect the fund\u2019s capital from being spent.

In exchange for giving up control over the projects, Australia gained a voice in developing the national strategy and allocating resources for health projects. The approach also encouraged Papua New Guinea to become a major stakeholder in the development process, following a generally believed principle that aid is more effective when developing countries determine their own needs and strategies for meeting them. The Australian pilot project is small scale and has not yet been evaluated. According to an Australian official, the sectorwide approach will cover about 25 percent of all of Australia\u2019s assistance to Papua New Guinea by 2002.

Often, donors have multiple motivations for providing assistance, such as historical links, which could have different standards for effectiveness and accountability. For example, the U.S. priority on maintaining friendly relations with the FSM and the RMI during the early years of the Compact, in order to protect strategic interests in the region, contributed to limited accountability requirements for the financial assistance and the degree of oversight.", "Assistance Strategies Involve Trade-offs Between Cost, Effectiveness, and Accountability.", "In general, choosing a strategy involves balancing donor interests in aid effectiveness and accountability with the higher administrative costs of donor involvement.

The ADB\u2019s new subregional approach to assistance, on the basis of differences in resources and growth potential, highlights the need for accommodating the different needs of the Pacific Island nations and suggests different strategies for the FSM and the RMI. By addressing local needs and accounting for local cultures, the assistance strategies are more likely to ensure the political commitment of the recipient and are more likely to achieve outcomes. The ADB\u2019s approach contrasts with the current structure of Compact assistance for the FSM and the RMI, which generally applies the same objectives and strategies for the two countries.", "Flexible Strategies Are Important to Adapt Assistance to Changing Circumstances and Needs.", "Flexibility in assistance strategies is enabling the donors to respond to changing conditions in the Pacific. Flexibility not only allows donors to curtail assistance if the funds are not used effectively or properly, but it also permits donors to (1) adjust strategies to meet changing needs, such as transferring resources from one sector to another, and (2) provide rewards or incentives for good performance. The United States\u2019 assistance to the FSM and the RMI through the first 15 years of the Compact was distributed according to a negotiated formula that did not allow changes in the distribution of the funds. Moreover, Interior officials believed that the provision of assistance with the \u201cfull faith and credit\u201d of the United States, combined with a lack of controls typically available with domestic grant assistance, severely limited the ability to change funding levels, even in cases of misuse of funds.", "Well-designed Trust Funds Can Provide a Sustainable Source of Assistance and Reduce Long-term Aid Dependence.", "Successful trust funds in the Pacific can be designed to maintain and protect the fund value through prudent investment and management. Independent economic advisers, as required in the Tuvalu Trust Fund agreement, can also provide guidance to the government on the most effective use of fund proceeds. If the funds produce sufficient annual revenue to meet recipient budget needs and the revenues are used wisely, as has been the case with the Tuvalu Trust Fund, donors may have opportunities to reduce their annual assistance levels.

We relied on the committee\u2019s conversion of official development assistance into 1998 U.S. dollars. Our analysis of the committee\u2019s data found several inconsistencies, such as no reported development assistance to the FSM and the RMI before 1991.

From our analysis of U.S. assistance to the FSM and the RMI, we know that the official development assistance excludes assistance such as educational Pell Grants given directly to students and U.S. Department of Agriculture housing loans. We included official development assistance provided to territories in the Pacific, when reported by the committee, but we excluded the portion of the assistance that the territories received from their national governments because it often is a transfer of domestic funds. For example, we did not include the amount that New Zealand gave to Tokelau because Tokelau is a territory of New Zealand; however, we did include the amount of assistance that Australia gave to Tokelau. The committee\u2019s database did not report official development assistance to some territories, such as American Samoa.

A key advantage of a trust fund for donors is its cost-effectiveness in reducing the administrative costs associated with individual projects or aid cycles. The advantages of a trust fund for recipients are the abilities to (1) improve the coordination, consistency, and sustainability of overall development efforts; (2) reduce administrative efforts linked with obtaining assistance and preparing reports on the use of donor resources; and (3) coordinate disbursements of assistance with institutional capacity to manage the assistance.", "Finally, according to a USAID working paper on endowment funds (trust funds), several lessons are available from USAID\u2019s involvement in funding more than 35 endowment funds. These lessons include the need for adequate financing to establish the fund, the strategic use of matching funds to leverage the U.S. contribution, and the importance of fund independence from government or secular interests. The principal conclusions from the review of USAID endowment funds were that (1) under the appropriate conditions, such funds can be a viable option for providing long-term, sustainable development; (2) using funds can be an important strategy for increasing the capabilities of development partners; (3) strong institutions that are well managed and have successful track records are an essential prerequisite to funding; and (4) by their nature, funds involve less USAID monitoring and oversight than other types of activities because of built-in safeguards. These safeguards include (1) USAID involvement in the design of the fund agreement, (2) USAID approval of the initial Board of Directors and possibly appointment of a board member, (3) annual audits and performance reports, and (4) a requirement that all funds be invested in financial instruments offered in the United States through a U.S.-based financial intermediary.

In addition, donors believe that poor coordination has contributed to multiple donor agendas and reporting systems, which has complicated the development process for recipient countries.", "Sectorwide approaches are expected to achieve greater coherence in the use of aid by allowing recipient governments to assume ownership for the planning and implementation of all activities within a specific sector. If the donor projects are not set within a coherent plan and budget, the result can be an effort that is expensive to manage and in which there is wasteful duplication, uneven coverage, inconsistent approaches, and poor sustainability of projects.", "The principal characteristic of a fully developed sector program is that all significant funding for a designated sector should support a single sector policy and expenditure program, under the recipient government\u2019s leadership. By requiring recipients to develop their own sector strategies, the assumption is that sectorwide approaches will enhance country ownership. A condition for assuming ownership, however, is the presence of sound policies, such as reasonable macroeconomic and budget policies; a supportive environment for private sector development; and a role for the public sector that is consistent with the government\u2019s management and financial capacity. Donors may have to work closely with the recipients to develop the needed policy environment. An Australian Agency for International Development document noted that there are five stages in moving toward a process of progressively strengthening government sector management. The progression depends on achieving milestones related to improved effectiveness in government budget management. The stages range from the first step, in which a donor provides project-based assistance and implementation within an agreed policy framework, to the fifth step of supporting a sector program with a common financing mechanism. Another benefit of having a coherent sector strategy under the recipient government\u2019s leadership is that donors support the sector under a common framework, thus minimizing the problems of poor coordination.", "Two reports identified the following conditions for making sectorwide approaches successful:   Sectorwide approaches are more relevant for countries and sectors in which donors\u2019 contributions are large enough to create coordination difficulties. These approaches are less desirable if aid is only a small share of the budget.", "Sectorwide approaches are potentially more useful when applied to those sectors in which there exists greater agreement among donors and recipients regarding the need for a strong government role in the financing, planning, and delivery of services, hence the dominance of health and education.", "Supportive macroeconomic and budget frameworks must be in place because there is a longer time frame.", "Donors should not dismiss out of hand sectorwide approaches due to a perceived lack of recipient capacity.
