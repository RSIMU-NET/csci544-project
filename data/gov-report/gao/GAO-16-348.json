The AOC manual states it is agency policy to promote competition, and federal internal control standards state that agencies should establish mechanisms to track and assess performance against their objectives. While the AOC monitors data to track the number of sole-source contracts awarded, other analyses are limited. GAO's analysis of the AOC's data found that the agency competed approximately 50 percent of its contract obligations for the past 3 fiscal years\u2014compared to 65 percent for the overall federal government. By examining the factors driving the number of sole-source awards or level of competition across different product types, AOC may be better positioned to identify where additional management attention may be needed to maximize competition.", "The AOC uses a variety of approaches to monitor contractor performance on its projects, with contracting officers and their technical representatives being the primary officials responsible for providing oversight.

Contracting plays a central role in helping AOC  achieve its mission. In fiscal year 2015, AOC received $600.3 million to  fund its operations and over half of that was used to procure goods and  services to meet various needs. These procurements range from large  renovation projects like the restoration of the U.S. Capitol Dome and  Cannon House Office Building to meeting more routine needs, such as  maintenance and custodial services.

To gain insight into the extent to which AOC is  awarding and implementing its contracts and task or delivery orders  consistent with its own internal policies and procedures, we used data  from AOC\u2019s financial management system to select a non-generalizable  sample of 21 contracts and orders with obligations during fiscal years  2013 through 2015.  We chose contracts and orders from this timeframe  to allow us to gain insights into AOC\u2019s recent contracting practices  including any changes or trends. The sample represents a mix of goods  and services including construction, engineering, and custodial services  for AOC projects of varying sizes. To assess the reliability of the data  from the AOC\u2019s financial management system, we (1) reviewed  information about the data and the system that produced them, and (2)  compared certain data elements to information from the contract files we  sampled. Based on these steps, we determined that the data from AOC\u2019s  financial management system were sufficiently reliable for the purposes  of this review. For the sample of 21 contracts and orders, we reviewed  applicable market research reports, acquisition plans, justifications and  approvals for sole-source awards to determine the extent to which AOC\u2019s  practices were consistent with its guidance. We also met with contracting  officials responsible for these contracts to confirm our understanding of  information in the contract files. In addition, we interviewed AOC officials  from the Acquisition and Material Management Division (AMMD), who are  responsible for developing, implementing, and ensuring compliance with  AOC\u2019s contracting policies and procedures.

AMMD is the primary office responsible  for developing contracting policies and procedures, appointing contracting  officers, and awarding and overseeing contracts. Requirements for goods  and services are identified by AOC\u2019s operational units, which consist of  various jurisdictions and offices that handle the day-to-day operations  including the support, maintenance, and operations of buildings as well as  construction and renovation projects.  While AMMD has the primary  responsibility of awarding and administering contracts, AMMD often  works with the AOC\u2019s jurisdictions and offices to assist in monitoring the  progress of contracts awarded to support AOC\u2019s various projects, such as  the restoration of the Capitol Dome.", "From fiscal years 2011 through 2015, AOC obligated, on average, $326  million annually to procure goods and services.

For example, both  AOC and executive branch agencies are subject to the Buy American Act  and the Contracts Disputes Act of 1978.  Additionally, in some instances  AOC has adopted certain procurement policies and regulations it would  not otherwise be subject to. For example, although not subject to the  Small Business Act, AOC worked with the Small Business Administration  to establish a small business subcontracting and set-aside program to  help the AOC more fully utilize small businesses. In addition, AOC has  adopted certain characteristics and clauses of the FAR. For example,  AOC incorporates FAR clauses related to contract changes, inspections,  differing site conditions, availability of funds, and terminations. According  to AOC officials, incorporating FAR clauses into AOC contracts offers  significant benefits because the contract clauses have been drafted and  reviewed by subject matter experts across the government and are  familiar to government contractors.

Further, AMMD officials  stated that another reason they started requiring acquisition plans was to  help enforce acquisition timeframes agreed upon by the office that  needed the acquisition and contracting officers. According to officials, the  requiring offices consistently missed important deadlines, oftentimes  resulting in lengthy acquisition cycles.  As a result, AMMD implemented  the requirement for written acquisition plans to help alleviate this problem.  AMMD officials believe that requiring written acquisition plans has helped  shorten acquisition timeframes.

The contracting officer on one of those projects, the  Refrigeration Plant Revitalization project, stated that while not required, a  written acquisition plan was completed due to the cost, complexity, and  visibility of the project. The AOC\u2019s contracting manual requires that a  written plan be completed well in advance of when an acquisition is  needed but does not establish timeframes for how far in advance  acquisition plans should be completed. AMMD officials noted that the  nature and complexity of the acquisition\u2014such as a new or recurring  requirement\u2014determines the extent of advance preparation needed to  develop the acquisition plan.

We  found that AOC employs a number of different ways of conducting market  research that reflect what is in the contracting manual. For instance, AOC  will often invite vendors to a potential construction worksite before  publicizing a solicitation. This helps AOC identify potential qualified  vendors and also allows vendors an opportunity to learn more about the  requirement and determine if they want to make an offer on a project. We  found that AOC held industry days for 5 of the 21 contracts and orders we  reviewed for projects such as the Cannon Renewal project, the Dome  Restoration project and the replacement of the skylight in the Hart  Building, among others. Another example of market research that AOC  performed was the use of a \u201csources sought\u201d notification to determine the  capabilities of the marketplace.

And third, they had an active process  for referring matters that might lead to a suspension or debarment to the  appropriate agency official.", "Consistent with the findings from our prior work, in a September 2012  management letter, the AOC Inspector General proposed that AOC  develop a suspension and debarment process as a means to deal with  \u201cunscrupulous or ineffective contractors.\u201d According to AOC officials, the  agency declined to implement that recommendation, largely because  without being subject to the FAR, AOC believed it could only debar  contractors from doing business with AOC, and it was thought that the  small number of actions anticipated would likely not justify the cost of  developing a new process. However, we do not believe that this is a  convincing reason. GAO, which is also a legislative branch agency,  established a suspension and debarment process in 2012. For our  process, we follow the policies and procedures on debarment and  suspension contained in the FAR. Our process identifies new roles and  responsibilities for existing offices and officials within the agency. As part  of our process, we would report on the list of excluded parties, the names  of all contractors we have debarred, suspended, or proposed for  debarment. Although debarment, suspension, or proposed debarment of  a contractor taken by GAO would have mandatory application only to  GAO, listing a contractor on the excluded parties list provides an  indication to other federal agencies that they need to thoroughly assess  whether the contractor is sufficiently responsible to be solicited or  awarded a contract. In addition, one of the advantages of a suspension  and debarment process is that an agency can address issues of  contractor responsibility and provide the agency and contractors with a  formal process to follow. When we shared our experience with them,  officials at AOC did not identify any reasons why a similar approach could  not be taken at their agency."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["With more than half of AOC\u2019s budget authority currently being spent on  contracting, acquisition clearly plays a central role in achieving AOC\u2019s  mission. AOC has taken initial steps to establish an efficient and effective  acquisition function by issuing the AOC contracting manual. The manual  will help promote full and open competition in AOC\u2019s procurement  process. AOC is taking action to improve the quality of its market  research which, in turn, can help enhance competition. The agency only  recently started to collect competition data to inform its progress, but AOC  is not fully using these data to determine the extent of its overall  competition efforts and identify areas where additional focus is needed to  ensure the agency is obtaining competition to the maximum extent  possible. AOC is using several tools to provide oversight and hold  contractors accountable; however, it lacks suspension and debarment  processes that could help further protect the federal government\u2019s  interests. Given the high-profile nature of AOC\u2019s mission, because of the  congressional clients AOC serves, and the buildings it is responsible for,  such a process would help to ensure that contracts are awarded only to  responsible sources. Implementing policies and procedures for  suspension and debarment would build upon AOC\u2019s existing  accountability framework and would further foster an environment that  seeks to hold the entities they deal with accountable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To further enhance the acquisition function, we recommend that the  Architect of the Capitol take the following two actions:", "Explore options for developing a more robust analysis of AOC\u2019s  competition levels, including areas such as the trends in competition  over time, the use of market research to enhance competition, and the  types of goods and services for which competition could be increased;", "Establish a process for suspensions and debarments that is suitable  for the AOC\u2019s mission and organizational structure, focusing on  policies, staff responsibilities, and a referral process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to AOC for review and comment.

We selected a non-generalizable  sample of 21 contracts and orders, during this timeframe to obtain  insights into AOC\u2019s recent contracting practices. To narrow our focus on  which contracts to include in our review, we identified contract actions for  AOC\u2019s largest and most complex projects, which the AOC defines as any  project estimated to cost $50 million or more over the life of the project\u2014 the Cannon House Office Building Renewal Project, Cogeneration Plant  Project, Capitol Dome Restoration Project, and the Refrigeration Plant  Revitalization Project. As Table 2 below shows, the sample represents a  mix of large and small dollar awards and types of products and services  procured to support various projects across AOC.", "We excluded any transaction related to real estate rental or electric power  payments. We assessed the reliability of AOC\u2019s financial management  system data by (1) reviewing existing information about the data and the  system that produced them, and (2) comparing reported data to  information from the contract files we sampled. Based on these steps, we  determined that the data obtained from AOC\u2019s financial management  system were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this review.", "To examine AOC\u2019s policies that guide its acquisition function, we  reviewed its contracting policies and procedures and compared them to  what is outlined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). While the  FAR does not apply to the AOC, it reflects practices widely used  throughout the executive branch of the federal government. We focused  our review on competition, acquisition planning, and market research as  our prior work has shown that these activities are critical to building a  strong foundation for successful acquisition outcomes. We reviewed prior  GAO reports to identify generally accepted contract management  practices for market research, acquisition planning, and competition. We  reviewed market research reports, acquisition plans, justifications and  approvals for sole-source awards, solicitations, and independent  government cost estimates for the contracts and orders in the sample.  We analyzed these documents to determine the extent to which  acquisition planning and market research was consistent with AOC\u2019s  guidance. To supplement information obtained from contract files within  our sample, we met with contracting officers and contracting officer  technical representatives to confirm our understanding of information in  the contract files. We also interviewed officials from the Acquisition and  Material Management Division on the policies and procedures that guide  the acquisition function.", "To provide insights about the extent to which AOC competes contracts it  awards, we used procurement data from AOC\u2019s financial management  system for fiscal years 2013 through 2015 to calculate its competition  rate. Unlike other federal agencies, AOC does not report its procurement  data to the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS- NG), which is the government\u2019s procurement database. To provide a  basis of comparison, we calculated the governmentwide competition rate  using data from FPDS-NG. For both AOC and governmentwide, we  calculated the competition rate as the total dollars obligated annually on  competitive contract actions as a percentage of total dollars obligated on  all contract actions during fiscal years 2013 through 2015. This includes  obligations on new contracts, orders, and modifications of existing  contracts. Typically, FPDS-NG codes task and delivery orders from  competitive single-award contracts as also being competed. In contrast,  AOC classifies task and delivery orders derived from a competed single  award contract as not competed even though the base contract was  competed. In contrast, AOC classifies task and delivery orders derived  from a competed single award contract as not competed because the  orders are not available for competition, according to an AOC official. We  adopted AOC\u2019s classification of these orders as not competed. As a  result, our determination of AOC\u2019s competition rate may be understated.  However, AOC and GAO officials agreed the difference is likely not  substantial given the small number of single award contracts at AOC. We  compared AOC\u2019s efforts to assess its competition levels against  acquisition best practices and Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government, which call for continually tracking spending to gain  insight about how resources are being used and using the information to  assess how agency\u2019s objectives are being achieved.", "To determine how the AOC oversees contractor performance, we  reviewed the same sample of 21 contracts and orders, reviewed AOC  project management guidance, and interviewed relevant officials.  Specifically, we used the sample to gain insight into how AOC oversees  contractor performance and resolves any disagreements that may arise  during the performance of the contract. We reviewed documentation in  the files such as relevant clauses, notices to comply, letters of concern,  contractor performance reports, and other key documents used for  monitoring and compliance purposes. We also reviewed AOC contracting  policies and project management guidance on how the AOC monitors  contractor performance. In addition, we reviewed prior GAO work to  identify tools available to agencies to monitor and take actions to address  or correct deficiencies regarding contractor performance. We also  interviewed AOC contracting officials and contracting officer\u2019s technical  representative about their experiences in monitoring contractor  performance. We interviewed officials from the Planning and Project  Management division, contracting officers, and contracting officer  technical representatives to understand how they ensure compliance with  the terms of contracts and resolve disagreements that may arise. We  reviewed AOC\u2019s contracting procedures to determine whether AOC had a  process in place to address contractor performance and ensure it  engages with responsible contractors and used previous GAO work on  suspension and debarment as the basis for assessing AOC\u2019s efforts.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2015 to April 2016 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
