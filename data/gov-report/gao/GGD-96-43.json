This report responds to your request and evaluates the six studies cited in the KPMG Peat Marwick report as well as two other recent studies of the credit.

The credit has never been a permanent part of the tax code. Since its enactment on a temporary basis in 1981, the credit has been extended six times and modified four times.", "The research tax credit has always been incremental in nature. Taxpayers receive a credit only for qualified research spending that exceeds a base amount. Beginning in 1981, taxpayers could reduce their tax liability by 25 percent of qualified research that exceeded a base amount that was equal to the average research expenditure of the 3 previous years or a base amount that was equal to 50 percent of the current year\u2019s expenditures, whichever was greater.", "The Tax Reform Act of 1986 modified the credit by reducing the rate to 20 percent of qualified spending above the base amount and more narrowly defining qualified expenditures. The credit was changed again in 1988 to require that taxpayers reduce their deductions for research expenditures by an amount equal to 50 percent of the credit they claim. In 1989, this amount was increased to 100 percent of the credit they claim.", "The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 changed the method for calculating the base amount. The base calculated as the average expenditure of the 3 previous years was replaced by a base amount equal to the ratio of total qualified research expenses to total gross receipts for 1984 through 1988, multiplied by the average amount of taxpayer\u2019s gross receipts for the preceding 4 years. This base change removed the link between increases in current spending and future base amounts that had reduced the incentive to undertake additional research spending under the prior method for calculating the base."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Early Studies of the Credit\u2019s Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["The evaluation of the effectiveness of the credit requires first estimating the additional research spending stimulated by the credit. Ideally, this additional spending should then be evaluated according to the net benefit it produces for society. However, this net social benefit is difficult to determine because it depends on how the research of some companies affects the costs and products of other companies. Some researchers who have studied the credit have instead calculated a \u201cbang-per-buck\u201d ratio, the amount of spending stimulated per dollar of revenue cost. Once a decision has been made to provide some form of credit, this ratio is a relevant criterion for assessing alternative designs.", "Most early studies of the research tax credit found that, although the credit may have stimulated some additional research spending, the effect on spending was relatively small. For example, Edwin Mansfield in his 1986 study asked a random sample of corporate officials to assess the effect of the credit on research spending and estimated from their responses that the additional spending induced by the credit equaled about one-third of the revenue cost. Robert Eisner, et al., in 1984 compared the growth of research spending that qualified for the credit and spending that did not qualify in 1981 and 1982, and found no positive impact of the credit on the growth of research spending.", "Other early studies relied on estimates of the responsiveness of research spending to reductions in its price to arrive at similar conclusions. Because the credit is effectively a reduction in the price of research, the greater the responsiveness of research spending to price reductions, the more additional spending the credit is likely to stimulate. Economists measure the responsiveness in terms of the \u201cprice elasticity\u201d of spending, which shows the percentage increase in spending that would result from a 1-percent reduction in the after-tax price of research and development (R&D).", "In 1989, we reported that the best available evidence indicated that research spending is not very responsive to price reductions. Most estimates of the price elasticity of spending fell in the range of \u20130.2 to \u20130.5, implying that a 1-percent reduction in the price of research would lead to between a 0.2 percent and 0.5 percent increase in spending.", "In our 1989 report, we used Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data to estimate that between 1981 and 1985, the credit provided companies with a benefit of 3 to 5 cents per dollar of additional spending. This benefit to companies is equivalent to a reduction in the price of research. Combining these price reductions with the range of elasticity estimates, we estimated that the credit stimulated between $1 billion and $2.5 billion of additional research spending between 1981 and 1985 at a cost of $7 billion in tax revenue. Thus, we estimated that each dollar of taxes forgone stimulated between 15 and 36 cents of research spending."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reviews of Recent Studies of the Credit\u2019s Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["Reports on the research tax credit by KPMG Peat Marwick and by the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) include reviews of studies of the credit\u2019s effectiveness that were issued since our 1989 report.

Specifically, the report concludes that the recent studies show that one dollar of credit stimulates about one dollar of R&D spending in the short run, and as much as two dollars in the long run. According to the KPMG Peat Marwick report, the recent studies KPMG Peat Marwick reviewed provide better estimates of the effectiveness of the credit than earlier studies because they analyze longer data series and because they use what it considered to be better methodologies for analyzing the effect of the credit. The OTA report reviewed the same recent studies as KPMG Peat Marwick and observed that the available literature generally reports that the credit stimulates about one dollar of additional spending per dollar of revenue cost. However, OTA pointed out that the studies contain data and methodological uncertainties.

Our second objective was to identify the factors other than spending per dollar of revenue cost that determine the credit\u2019s value to society.", "To meet our first objective, we reviewed the six studies cited by the KPMG Peat Marwick report and two studies that the report did not cite that we identified from our review of the literature on the credit and from our interviews with authors of research tax credit studies.

Of the eight studies we reviewed, three supported the claim that one dollar of credit stimulated about two dollars of additional research spending. Another study, which did not directly evaluate the research tax credit, reported estimates of the responsiveness of research spending to other tax incentives. These estimates appear to be consistent with the claim that the credit stimulates spending that exceeds its revenue cost.", "However, two studies reported that the credit stimulated spending that was less than its revenue cost, and another two of the studies reported estimates of additional spending that do not appear to support the claim that spending exceeded revenue cost. One of these latter studies does not compare additional research spending to revenue cost but does report an estimate of additional spending that is likely to be less than the revenue cost. The other study reported that additional spending exceeded revenue cost through 1985 but reported estimates of additional spending that were likely to be less than the revenue cost after 1985.", "Most of the recent studies used more sophisticated methods than prior studies when analyzing the effectiveness of the credit.

This incentive depends on a company\u2019s ability to earn credits by having qualified research spending that exceeds the base amount and on a company\u2019s ability to claim its credits by having sufficient taxable income. We concluded from our own comparison of tax return data with COMPUSTAT data and from studies by other researchers that differences in the measurement of research spending and taxable income make COMPUSTAT an unreliable proxy for tax return data when analyzing the credit. Because studies that use the public data cannot accurately determine the credit\u2019s incentive, they may not accurately measure the amount of spending stimulated by the credit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limitations of the Studies\u2019 Methods for Measuring Tax Incentives", "paragraphs": ["Three studies that analyzed the credit at the industry level may not accurately measure the credit\u2019s incentive. Analysis at the industry level of aggregation does not reflect the different incentives the companies face and their different responses to these incentives. Industries include firms that earn no credit because their spending is less than the base amount or claim no credit because they have no tax liability. An analysis at the industry level that assigns the same incentive to all these firms would not capture these differences and is not likely to produce very precise measures of the credit\u2019s effect on research spending.", "The eight studies all used measures of the tax incentive that did not incorporate important interactions with other features of the tax code. For example, studies that measured the tax incentives by reductions in the cost of research and development due to tax policy changes did not include all the research and development provisions of the tax code. In addition to the credit, the cost of R&D depends on other tax code provisions like those governing the allocation of research expenses between foreign sources and the United States. The studies included some of these provisions but not others. Including all relevant provisions of the code may change the estimates of the research credit\u2019s effectiveness.", "The estimates in several of the studies were highly sensitive to assumptions made about the data and taxpayer behavior. For example, one study\u2019s estimate of the responsiveness of spending to tax incentives was reduced by half when more firms were included in the sample studied or the assumptions were changed on how taxpayers allocate research and development expenses between domestic and foreign sources. Other studies that differed in terms of how they measured the tax incentive produced significantly different estimates of the spending stimulated by the credit.

The amount of spending stimulated per dollar of revenue cost depends on how the design of the credit affects the incentive to increase research spending and on how the design affects the revenue cost. Only one of the recent studies estimated the effectiveness of the credit for years after its redesign in 1989, and the author of that study is not confident of her results for the post-1989 period.", "Some reviewers have implied that the recent studies\u2019 estimates of the responsiveness of research spending to price reductions\u2014the price elasticity of spending\u2014are equivalent to the amount of research spending stimulated by the credit per dollar of revenue cost. They said that using an empirical estimate that a 1-percent reduction in the price of R&D will lead to a 1-percent increase in research spending implies that one dollar of credit will lead to one dollar of additional spending. However, these may not be equivalent estimates because the amount of research spending stimulated by the credit per dollar of revenue depends on the design of the credit as well as the responsiveness of spending to price reductions.", "For example, the credit\u2019s effect on spending and revenue cost will depend on whether it is designed as a flat credit, which applies to total research spending, or as an incremental credit, which applies only to spending that exceeds a base amount. For the same responsiveness of spending to price reductions, a flat credit with a 10 percent rate should stimulate roughly the same amount of spending as an incremental credit with the same rate because both credits provide the same 10 percent effective reduction in the price of research. However, the flat credit would allow a company to earn a credit equal to 10 percent of its total qualified research spending, while the incremental credit would give the company a credit equal only to 10 percent of the difference between its current qualified spending and some base spending amount. Consequently, the 10 percent flat credit would have a higher revenue cost and, therefore, a lower bang-per-buck than the 10 percent incremental credit.", "Incremental credits that differ from one another in terms of how base spending is defined can also differ substantially in terms of how much spending they stimulate per dollar of revenue cost. The bang-per-buck of the current incremental credit may be significantly different from that of the credit that existed prior to 1990. As we reported in our May 1995 testimony, the redesign of the credit in 1989 should have increased the size of the incentive provided per dollar of revenue cost. However, as we also reported in our testimony, there is evidence that the incentive provided by the redesigned credit had eroded over time and that the revenue cost of the additional spending stimulated by the credit had increased."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Factors Determining the Research Tax Credit\u2019s Value to Society", "paragraphs": ["The value of the research tax credit to society cannot be determined simply by comparing the amount of research spending stimulated by the credit versus the credit\u2019s revenue cost. To fully evaluate the credit\u2019s effect, one would have to (1) estimate the total benefits gained by society from the research stimulated by the credit; (2) estimate the resource costs of doing the research; (3) estimate the administration, compliance, and efficiency costs to society resulting from the collection of taxes (or the borrowing of money) required to fund the credit; and (4) compare the benefits to the costs. Simply knowing how much additional research spending the credit stimulates does not tell you the value of that research to society. Similarly, the amount of revenue needed to fund the credit does not tell you the total cost to society of the credit.", "There is a general consensus among economists that research is one of the areas where some government intervention in the marketplace may improve economic efficiency. From society\u2019s point of view, individual companies may invest too little in research if the return on their investment is less than the full benefit that society derives from the research. If the research leads to new products, reduces costs or increases productivity for other companies and consumers throughout the economy, the benefits to society may exceed the return on investment of the companies that conduct the research. Therefore, companies may not do as much research as society finds desirable, and government policy to encourage research may be viewed as appropriate.", "However, as the Joint Committee on Taxation and OTA have noted, it is also possible to decrease economic efficiency by encouraging too much spending on research. Because not all research generates social benefits that exceed the returns to companies conducting the research, encouraging more research may not be economically efficient. It would be very difficult to determine, given the difficulty of measuring the social benefit, whether the research tax credit increases or decreases economic efficiency.

Although the authors agree that COMPUSTAT data are not the best data, they disagree among themselves about the importance of this issue. We acknowledge that statistical methods can be used to help address this issue of measurement error, but the success of these methods is difficult to assess. We conclude that, because the most appropriate data were not used in these studies, uncertainty remains about the responsiveness of spending to the credit.", "The methodological limitations that we identified were not addressed in the comments of all the authors because they were not relevant to every study. The authors who did comment disagreed about the importance of the methodological limitations. One author who addressed the importance of correctly incorporating the features of the tax code said she believed that some of the studies\u2019 estimates of the effect of the credit were overestimated because the method of estimation excluded tax preferences available for investments other than research. Another author commented that the sensitivity of the estimates to assumptions about taxpayer expectations accounted for the difference in estimates across the studies. However, two authors who agreed with our identification of the methodological limitations in their work did not believe that the limitations had a significant effect on their estimates. Finally, the authors who commented agreed that analyzing the credit at the firm level rather than at the industry level produces more accurate estimates. However, one author said that he did not believe that his industry level estimates would change significantly if they were based on analysis at the firm level.", "As explained in appendix I, we found that estimates reported in the studies varied significantly when authors employed different assumptions about the data and taxpayer behavior.

In any case, the estimates of all the studies that we reviewed would be more reliable if they were based on IRS data.", "The tax price variables and the dummy variables used in the studies to capture the incentive provided by the credit depend on companies\u2019 ability to earn credits and claim them against their tax liabilities. COMPUSTAT and NSF data do not accurately reflect credits earned and claimed.", "The ability to earn credits depends on the relationship of qualified research spending to the base amount. COMPUSTAT and NSF data do not accurately reflect this relationship because both data sources include spending that does not qualify for the credit. Most notably, spending reported by COMPUSTAT includes spending overseas that would not be qualified research spending. In our 1989 report, we compared COMPUSTAT data with tax return data and concluded that COMPUSTAT data are not a suitable proxy for tax return data when analyzing the credit. For example, when we compared the growth rate of COMPUSTAT research spending with qualified research spending for a sample of firms contained in both the COMPUSTAT database and IRS files, we found that the rates varied considerably over the period 1981 through 1985. Qualified spending grew 1.46 times as fast as COMPUSTAT spending in the 1980 to 1981 period, but only 0.72 times as fast in the 1983 to 1984 period. The relationship between spending and the base using COMPUSTAT may not accurately reflect the relationship using tax data, and, therefore, both tax price variables and dummy variables are likely to be inaccurate.", "The ability to claim credits depends on the tax status of the firms. COMPUSTAT contains information on taxable income and loss carryforwards, but studies have shown that COMPUSTAT does not always accurately or consistently reflect IRS data. Furthermore, COMPUSTAT data contain no information on the general business credit, which limits the ability of companies to claim the credit. Again, because both the tax price variables and the dummy variables depend on the ability of firms to claim the credit, we conclude that they will be measured inaccurately when based on COMPUSTAT data.", "The reliability of the Baily and Lawrence studies and the Mamuneas and Nadiri study is also limited by the level of aggregation at which the data are analyzed. Their analyses of the credit at the industry level are unlikely to produce very precise measures of the credit\u2019s effect. Their analyses do not reflect the different incentives that companies face and the different responses to these incentives. Industries will include firms that earn no credit because their spending is less than the base, firms that cannot claim the credit because they have no tax liability, and firms subject to the 50-percent base limitation. A measure that assigns the same incentive to all these firms will not capture these differences and is not likely to yield precise or reliable estimates of the credit\u2019s effect.", "The reliability of the studies that we reviewed is also limited by the methods used to measure the incentive provided by the credit. The studies use measures of the tax incentive that do not incorporate important interactions of the research tax credit with other features of the tax code. For example, Hines studies the effect of the section 1.861-8 allocation rules on research spending but does not analyze the effect of other features of the tax code such as the research tax credit. Hall, on the other hand, analyzes the research tax credit but does not incorporate the section 1.861-8 allocation rules in her study. Hall believes that including the rules in her analysis would not make \u201can enormous difference\u201d because the firms subject to the rules probably represent only a small part of her sample. However, she does say that including the rules would make her estimates more precise. Hines states that it is \u201cdifficult to know for sure\u201d the effect on his estimates of including interactions with other features of the code.", "The estimates in some of these studies are also uncertain because they are sensitive to assumptions made about the data and taxpayer behavior. Hines\u2019 estimate of the effect of tax policy on spending is reduced by half when he includes more firms in his sample or changes his assumptions about how companies allocate R&D expenses. Hall notes that estimation at the firm level involving investments like R&D is difficult and sensitive to assumptions made when specifying the models. This sensitivity of the results is also illustrated by the three studies using dummy variables where differences in the approach to modeling taxpayer behavior and measuring the effect of the credit yield very different estimates. Although some of the studies attempt to measure the degree of this sensitivity and correct for it, the success of these efforts is difficult to assess.", "The authors of these studies themselves, in many cases, advise that their results be used with caution and recognize that their estimates would benefit from further research. For example, when describing her estimates of the spending induced by the credit, Hall states that \u201cit needs to be kept firmly in mind that my tax estimates are not likely to be as good as those constructed using IRS data.\u201d She also mentions, in the 1992 version of her paper, that her analysis \u201cneeds more investigation for robustness over time and industry.\u201d When discussing the limitations imposed by not including interactions with other aspects of the tax code, Hines notes that his results should be used with caution because of these \u201crestrictive assumptions built into the estimated R&D responses to tax changes.\u201d", "The current version of the credit has not been studied extensively, and little is known about the actual incentives provided by the current credit. The research tax credit was fundamentally restructured in 1989. Hall\u2019s study, which spans the years 1977 through 1991, is the only study we reviewed that covers any tax years after the credit was changed. However, her data contain only 2 years\u20141990 and 1991\u2014under the revised credit structure. Hall notes that her estimate of additional spending for these years amounts to about 10 percent of the total R&D and that this \u201camount is almost too large to be credible . . . and deserves further investigation as more data become available.\u201d She indicated that her estimates of additional spending may be less reliable because she did not have data on the tax status of firms after 1991 that were needed to measure the incentive provided by the revised credit."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "General Government Division, Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": ["James Wozny, Assistant Director, Tax Policy and Administration Issues Kevin Daly, Senior Economist Anthony Assia, Senior Evaluator The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.
