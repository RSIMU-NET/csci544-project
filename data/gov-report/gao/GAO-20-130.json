The General Services Administration (GSA) and OMB track and report two RTF cost performance measures: estimated costs avoided and average cost per square foot. GAO found that the method for estimating costs avoided was reasonable. However, the average cost per square foot was not accurate for the federally-owned and leased office space GSA manages for agencies. Specifically, GAO found that from fiscal years 2015 through 2018 the actual average cost per square foot for this space was, on average, $1.31 per square foot higher than the costs GSA and OMB reported for the 23 civilian agencies subject to the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act. The actual cost per square foot was higher for 18 out of 23 of these agencies (see figure). Because GSA and OMB did not use readily available actual cost data, their method, which is based on 1 month's data, excluded an average of $271 million per year in costs over this period. Consequently, stakeholders and agencies do not have accurate information to assess agencies' performance or help manage their space decisions.", "Note: This information covers the 23 Civilian Chief Financial Officers Act agencies.", "While selected agencies considered costs when making office space decisions, they balanced other factors as well. As the federal government's principal landlord, GSA obtains space for many agencies. In so doing, it emphasizes federal cost savings, which may not lead to agency savings. For example, GSA prioritized filling unoccupied federally-managed space even if it was more costly to an agency than another option. The selected agencies also reported that factors such as mission, workforce needs, and external factors are important to consider and balance as well. For example, a senior official from the Department of Education said that effects on employees' commutes are an important factor in its space decisions, and that it weighs the impact of potential office locations on the Department's workforce against the cost of the space."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that GSA coordinate with OMB to use actual cost information to calculate the average cost per square foot performance measure for GSA-managed space.

According to OMB and the General Services Administration  (GSA), the 24 agencies subject to the Chief Financial Officers Act (CFO  Act agencies) have reduced their domestic office and warehouse space  by more than 16 million total square feet and avoided an estimated $166  million in costs since fiscal year 2015. However, OMB and GSA also  reported that average costs per square foot have increased for some  space, raising questions about the effects agencies\u2019 efforts have had on  their actual real property costs.

We  assessed the reliability of these data by conducting electronic testing and  interviewing GSA officials, among other steps, and determined that both  datasets were reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives. While  GSA measures RTF performance for all 24 CFO Act agencies, we  excluded the Department of Defense (DOD) from our scope because of  GSA concerns about the reliability of their data. We refer to the  remaining 23 civilian CFO Act agencies as \u201cagencies\u201d in this report. We  also reviewed the methodologies GSA developed with OMB for the cost  performance measures, interviewed GSA and OMB officials regarding the  measures, and replicated one of the methods.

To select agencies, we used FRPP and Occupancy  Agreement data on agencies\u2019 costs and square footage, and considered  a range of factors, such as changes in portfolio cost and square footage.  We selected agencies for variety but weighted our selection toward  agencies with larger absolute changes in cost and square footage. We  also selected 13 office space projects these agencies undertook from  fiscal years 2015 through 2018 based on factors such as cost, location,  changes in square footage, and project type to further understand how  agencies considered cost in their decisions. We selected projects with a  range of locations and types, but selected only those with a cost of $1  million or more because these projects have more effect on overall costs.  Our selections are not representative or generalizable to all agencies or  projects. To gain insights into how selected agencies considered costs in  their office space decisions, we reviewed their real property management  policies and project documentation and interviewed agency officials.

Under certain conditions, agencies  may vacate GSA-managed space prior to the end of their occupancy  agreement and report that as a reduction in their space. However, until  this space is reoccupied or GSA disposes of it, the federal government  continues to incur costs to operate and maintain the space. Because of  these continued costs, GSA accounts for vacant space when it estimates  cost avoidance. For example, from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2017 the  amount of vacant GSA-managed office space increased more than the  amount of space agencies reduced. Since this increase meant that the  federal government had not reduced office space overall when the  calculation was made, GSA estimated that rather than avoiding costs,  costs for civilian office space increased by roughly three-quarters of a  million dollars during this period. GSA officials noted that this estimate  represents estimated cost avoidance at a single point in time and does  not capture fluctuations in agencies\u2019 space or vacant federal space  throughout the year.", "Average fiscal year 2015 cost per square foot  for (1) space agencies lease directly,   (2) space agencies acquire and manage  directly, (3) space GSA leases on behalf of  agencies, and (4) federally-owned space  GSA manages.", "In 2018, GAO reported that GSA\u2019s and OMB\u2019s method for estimating the  cost avoidance associated with agencies\u2019 real property changes is a  reasonable approach given current limitations. OMB officials explained  that the estimated cost avoidance is not intended to depict actual cost  savings or the net effect of space changes on costs (i.e., investment cost  minus savings) because the estimate does not include agencies\u2019  investment costs to renovate, relocate, or dispose of space. Rather,  GSA\u2019s and OMB\u2019s method estimates the costs for rent, operations, and  maintenance that the federal government did not incur because it no  longer occupies space. Further, OMB officials pointed out that because  agencies use a variety of methods and systems to track and categorize  their renovation, relocation, and disposal costs, agencies\u2019 data on actual  investment costs are not consistent across agencies and using these data  would limit the accuracy of any estimate purporting to be an actual cost  savings measure.", "Another annual cost measure GSA uses to track agencies\u2019 RTF  performance is the average cost per square foot, which is intended to  reflect actual changes in agencies\u2019 real property costs. GSA calculates  the annual average cost per square foot for different categories based on  how the space is managed\u2014directly-owned, directly-leased, and GSA- managed office space. GSA uses the same approach to calculate the  measure for all agencies, and for each agency to use in their annual  Efficiency Plans. GSA\u2019s performance measure shows an increase in all  types of office space costs since fiscal year 2015, and our analysis of  FRPP and Occupancy Agreement data similarly found that overall office  space costs have increased for the majority of agencies, some by as  much as 10 to 15 percent. We found the approach GSA developed with  OMB to calculate average cost per square foot for directly-owned and  directly-leased office space to be reasonable because GSA used the best  available data.", "However, we found that GSA\u2019s and OMB\u2019s approach for GSA-managed  space understated the average cost per square foot. Specifically, we  found that GSA understated the overall average cost per square foot for  all agencies\u2019 GSA-managed office space by $1.31 (4.7 percent) on  average from fiscal years 2015 through 2018. Furthermore, we found that  GSA\u2019s and OMB\u2019s method understated the average cost per square foot  for 18 of the 23 agencies between 3 percent and 41 percent on average  from fiscal years 2015 through 2018. Figure 2 illustrates the range of  differences we found between GSA\u2019s and OMB\u2019s method and actual  costs.", "GSA understated the average cost per square foot for GSA-managed  space because it did not use readily available data on the actual costs  agencies paid to GSA for office space each year. Instead, GSA used the  \u201crental rate\u201d, which reflects the cost per square foot that agencies paid in  the month GSA accessed the data\u2014usually September. This rate does  not include all agency costs, such as costs for GSA\u2019s fee. Using the  monthly rental rate to calculate average cost per square foot can  significantly affect the resulting measure because the rental rate can differ  from month to month. According to GSA officials, this variation can occur  for many reasons including rental incentives, credits, or one-time costs  that are reflected in that particular month but do not apply in all months.  To identify how GSA\u2019s use of the rental rate affected the cost information  GSA used to calculate the measure, we calculated costs using the rental  rate (GSA\u2019s method) and compared them to the actual annual costs in  GSA\u2019s data. We found that costs calculated using the rental rate were  almost always lower than actual annual costs for agencies, sometimes by  millions of dollars for a single space. This approach led GSA to exclude  an average of $271 million in office space costs per year from its  calculations during this time period. Moreover, by using this approach  GSA did not include the costs for spaces that did not have a rental rate,  even when agencies paid for those spaces during the fiscal year. In  fiscal year 2018, GSA\u2019s and OMB\u2019s method excluded 405 GSA-managed  office spaces that did not have a rental rate but that had a combined  annual rental cost of $24.2 million.", "Example of the Effect of General Services  Administration\u2019s (GSA) and Office of  Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) Method  on Cost per Square Foot: National  Aeronautics and Space Administration  (NASA)", "GSA used the rental rate even though it tracks and can easily access  actual annual costs in its Occupancy Agreement database because, in  GSA\u2019s view, the rental rate better reflects the real average cost of an  office space. Officials said that the actual annual cost can represent  partial year costs and that GSA did not want to skew the averages toward  zero- or low-cost spaces. However, as demonstrated by our analysis,  GSA\u2019s use of the rental rate, rather than preventing GSA from skewing  the average costs toward lower cost office spaces, actually resulted in an  understatement of these costs.", "GSA and OMB\u2019s method excluded about $31  million from the cost per square foot  calculation. This difference was largely  attributable to one office space, which had a  rental rate of $44.67, much lower than the  actual annual cost per square foot for that  space, which was $97.98.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that  agencies should use and externally communicate quality information\u2014 information that is accurate and complete\u2014to achieve their goals.

On the other hand, a senior IRS official told us that  because enforcement needs\u2014a central part of IRS\u2019s mission\u2014are  constantly shifting to different parts of the country, IRS may not  always be able to enter into long-term lease agreements, which are  generally more cost-effective.", "Goals: We found that agencies\u2019 goals could be complementary to or in  conflict with their efforts to reduce cost. A senior NIH official told us  that NIH\u2019s offices are currently widely dispersed and that NIH has a  goal of \u201cmaking the crumbs into a loaf\u201d by co-locating different offices  as leases expire. The NIH official told us that co-locating can facilitate  cost savings because it allows NIH to operate more efficiently by, for  instance, reducing shuttle services and sharing common areas and  services. For example, one NIH project in Bethesda, Maryland will  consolidate 11 expiring leases in five locations into three leases in a  two-building campus that, according to GSA analysis, will reduce rent  by 42.5 percent per year for 15 years. Conversely, some of our  selected agencies noted that agency goals do not always align with  cost savings. For example, both Labor and IRS officials told us that  they may not pursue their space utilization goals if it costs too much to  renovate space to meet their desired space per person. Additionally,  the senior NIH official told us that NIH has previously moved to office  space that did not meet its utilization rate goals because it was able to  achieve larger cost savings by moving to a space in an area with  lower rent than the area it previously considered.", "Workforce Impact: We found that all five of the selected agencies  considered how office space decisions could impact their workforce, and  a couple of agencies told us that they balance this consideration with  costs, along with agency mission and goals.", "Commuting time: Officials from three selected agencies noted that  changes in employees\u2019 commuting time can influence what office  space to select. For example, Education is scheduled to relocate its  Dallas regional office in fiscal year 2020. A senior Education official  told us that Education chose a space that has close proximity to the  current space, in part, because the relocation will have minimal impact  on employees\u2019 commute. The official also said that even if federally- owned office space further away became available, Education may  not move there if it would be difficult for staff to get to. Similarly, IRS\u2019s  business case to consolidate several offices in the Cincinnati, OH,  area into one office starting in fiscal year 2015, analyzed how the  project would affect IRS employees, including the impact on  employees\u2019 commute, ability to park, and the effect on employees\u2019  income taxes.", "Employee Morale and Productivity: Several selected agencies noted  that reducing the amount of space per person can affect employee  morale and productivity. According to GSA\u2019s strategic goals,  improving space utilization by, for example, reducing the amount of  space per person can help the federal government achieve cost  savings. A senior Education official told us that when redesigning  Education\u2019s Washington, D.C., offices, which reduced the amount of  space per person, leadership engaged in a substantial employee  outreach effort to understand how these changes affected employees  and to build employee support for the changes. The official also said  Education took into account upfront costs for tools to improve  employees\u2019 experience. For example, the official said that the  Department invested in noise cancelling headphones to improve the  employee experience, which was a small cost compared to the cost  for office space. To ensure that reductions are not having a negative  impact on its employees, GSA developed a survey that it sometimes  distributes both before and after making space changes.", "External Factors: Officials from four of the five selected agencies said  external factors, such as federal priorities, statutes, regulations, and  policies can influence their office space decisions. In some cases, these  factors did not complement efforts to reduce costs.", "Federal Priorities: Federal goals and priorities can influence agencies\u2019  space decisions, and these requirements may not align with efforts to  reduce costs. For example, in fiscal year 2016, GSA relocated its  regional office in New York City from federally-owned to federally- leased space in the World Trade Center. Though GSA considered  cost, the federal government\u2019s commitment to move into the World  Trade Center after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001,  influenced this decision, which resulted in increased costs for GSA.", "Statutes, Executive Orders, and Regulations: Some agencies told us  that statutory requirements, directives, and regulations can influence  their space decisions, and may or may not align with efforts to reduce  costs. For example, a senior IRS official told us that a 1978 Executive  Order, which requires that agencies with a mission need to locate in  an urban area first consider moving to a central business district,  might result in IRS moving to higher-cost neighborhoods. A senior  official from the Department of Health and Human Services also told  us that locating office space in the central business district of urban  areas can be more expensive, but that the Department often does so  because of the Executive Order.", "GSA policies: GSA policies on space management can also affect  agencies\u2019 office space decisions. A senior Labor official told us that  the Department is currently reducing space in its Chicago, IL, regional  office but the ability to do so is dependent on whether Labor can  return the space to GSA. GSA policy states that agencies occupying  space acquired from PBS can return space within a certain time frame  if, among other requirements, the space is categorized as cancelable  and is in marketable blocks based on the location, usage, and size of  the space. If the space does not meet these criteria, an agency can  return the space to PBS but is still responsible for paying rent and  other costs associated with the space until the occupancy agreement  or lease expires."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Even as agencies have intensified their focus on better space  management in an effort to save taxpayer dollars, overall, the cost for  office space continues to rise. Using the best data available to assess  space options and trade-offs is critical. GSA\u2019s and OMB\u2019s cost per square  foot performance measure could provide agencies a good way to assess  their costs and track cost trends, particularly as agencies\u2019 efforts continue  to evolve beyond reducing their footprints toward optimizing their space.  However, the measure is only as good as the approach and data used in  the calculation. Because GSA\u2019s and OMB\u2019s cost per square foot  performance measure is not using actual cost information for GSA- managed space, GSA and OMB are understating the average cost per  square foot for a significant portion of square footage. This inaccurate  information could adversely affect agencies\u2019 and stakeholders\u2019  understanding of RTF results. As the RTF policy ends in fiscal year 2020  and agencies look toward the next initiative, having the most transparent  and accurate information on the results of agencies\u2019 efforts to date can  inform new strategies and tools to help agencies continue and expand  upon their efforts to manage their property more efficiently and ultimately  save money. Moreover, having accurate information on agencies\u2019 real  property costs will continue to be important in future initiatives to  efficiently manage federal real property."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["The Administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA), in  coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget,  should ensure that the average cost per square foot performance  measure for GSA-managed space is calculated using actual cost  information.

We also examined  information GSA uses to track RTF progress, including public data on  agencies\u2019 square footage changes. We assessed the reliability of these  data by conducting electronic testing, reviewing prior GAO assessments  of reliability, and interviewing agency officials. Based on this assessment,  we determined these data to be reliable for the purposes of describing  changes in agencies\u2019 square footage. Additionally, we reviewed previous  GAO and GSA Inspector General reports describing the federal  government\u2019s efforts to use its property more efficiently and reduce  costs.", "To address our first objective, we analyzed federal data on office space  square footage and costs, and reviewed the two RTF cost measures GSA  developed with OMB to track and report agency performance: (1)  estimated cost avoidance and (2) changes in average cost per square  foot. To identify changes in agencies\u2019 office space costs, we analyzed  square footage, and rent, operations, and maintenance costs from  Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) data submitted by agencies and  GSA\u2019s Occupancy Agreement data. Office space costs in both datasets  may contain costs for additional items beyond rent, operations and  maintenance, such as tenant improvements, but we determined that the  inclusion of these costs did not preclude us from using these data to  describe agencies\u2019 costs as the data reflect the total annual costs to  agencies. Though agencies may report different types of square footage  in FRPP, as specified by GSA\u2019s FRPP reporting guidance, we analyzed  rentable square footage where available because it represents the total  space an agency pays for. We limited our analysis to the CFO Act  agencies because these agencies are subject to RTF requirements, but  we excluded the Department of Defense (DOD) from our analysis  because of GSA concerns about the reliability of DOD\u2019s data. We  analyzed data from fiscal year 2015, the year RTF began, through fiscal  year 2018, the most recent year for which data were available. To assess  the reliability of these data, we conducted electronic testing, reviewed  GSA documentation and prior GAO data reliability assessments, and  interviewed GSA officials. Based on our assessment, we determined that  both the FRPP and Occupancy Agreement data were reliable for the  purposes of describing changes in agencies\u2019 office space costs and  square footage.", "To analyze the extent to which the cost performance measures reflected  agencies\u2019 cost changes, we reviewed the methodologies GSA developed  with OMB for the cost performance measures and GSA\u2019s calculations,  interviewed OMB and GSA officials regarding the measures, and  replicated one of the methods. We also reviewed previous GAO  assessments of the estimated cost avoidance methodology. To determine  how GSA\u2019s and OMB\u2019s approach to calculating the average cost per  square foot affected the results for GSA-managed space, we used GSA  Occupancy Agreement data to compare the average cost per square foot  based on GSA\u2019s and OMB\u2019s method to the average cost per square foot  using actual costs. We compared our analysis of the average cost per  square foot method to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, which state that agencies should use and communicate  quality information\u2014information that is complete and accurate\u2014to inform  decisions.", "To address our second objective, we selected five agencies\u2014the  Department of Education (Education), GSA, the Department of the  Treasury, the Department of Labor (Labor), and the Department of Health  and Human Services\u2014to review in depth. Within the Departments of the  Treasury and Health and Human Services, we further selected the  Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and National Institutes of Health (NIH)  respectively because we determined that real property within these  Departments is managed at the agency level. Using FRPP and  Occupancy Agreement data on agencies\u2019 costs and square footage, we  selected agencies based on factors such as office space portfolio size,  whether the agencies obtain office space themselves or through GSA,  and changes in portfolio cost and square footage. We selected agencies  for variety but weighted our selection toward agencies with larger  absolute changes in cost and square footage. Our selection is not  representative, and these agencies\u2019 experience is not generalizable to all  agencies. To gain insights into how these agencies consider costs when  making office space decisions, we reviewed selected agencies\u2019 real  property management policies, and interviewed agency officials. We then  analyzed this information to identify common themes across selected  agencies.", "To further understand how agencies implemented their policies and the  factors agencies considered when making specific office space decisions,  we also selected 13 office space projects these agencies undertook from  fiscal year 2015 through fiscal year 2018. We identified potential projects  based on selected agencies\u2019 annual Efficiency Plans, agency project  data, and interviews with agency officials. We selected specific projects  based on factors such as cost, location, changes in square footage, and  project type. We chose projects with a range of types and locations to  better understand agencies\u2019 decision-making process for different kinds of  projects. However, we selected only projects with a cost of $1 million or  more and with larger changes in square footage because these projects  have more effect on overall federal and agency costs and portfolios.  Because our intent was to understand the factors selected agencies  considered when deciding on projects, our selection includes both  completed projects and projects that were ongoing as of spring 2019,  when we collected our data. The projects we selected are not  representative of all projects or agencies, and are not generalizable. We  analyzed project documentation and interviewed agency officials about  each project. We also reviewed federal data for some projects to identify  the changes in agencies\u2019 square footage and costs before and after  projects.", "To further address our second objective, we reviewed GSA Public  Buildings Service (PBS) policies and guidance, and interviewed PBS  headquarters officials to understand PBS\u2019s role in agencies\u2019 office space  decisions, including how PBS considers costs when helping agencies  obtain space.
