In that period, DOD averaged $6.1 billion in DTS travel payments and $322 million in improper travel payments annually. Not all improper travel payments\u2014such as legitimate payments that initially lacked supporting documentation\u2015represented a monetary loss to the government. Officials said DOD first estimated a monetary loss from improper travel payments in fiscal year 2017. For fiscal years 2017 and 2018 it estimated a total monetary loss of $205 million out of $549 million in improper DTS payments (see fig.).", "In October 2016, DOD established a Remediation Plan to reduce improper travel payments and a committee to monitor implementation of the plan at 10 DOD components. DOD selected these 10 components because they accounted for a significant percentage of total travel payments. However, DOD did not take into account the components' own estimates of their improper payment rates. As of March 2019, only 4 of the 9 components that responded to GAO's survey had completed all of the plan's requirements, in part because of a lack of milestones in the plan and ineffective monitoring for required actions. As a result, DOD does not have reasonable assurance that its actions have been sufficient.", "DOD has mechanisms to identify errors leading to improper travel payments, and some components have developed specific corrective plans to address the errors. However, GAO found that these efforts did not clearly identify the root causes of the errors, in part because there is no common understanding of what constitutes the root cause of improper travel payments. DOD components also have not incorporated considerations of cost-effectiveness into decisions about whether to take actions that could reduce improper payments.

Both we and the Department of Defense Inspector General  (DODIG) have reported on problems related to improper payments in the  Department of Defense (DOD) travel pay program. DOD travel payments  are made to active and reserve or guard servicemembers and civilian  employees and cover travel for both temporary duty and permanent  change of station. DOD\u2019s Defense Travel System (DTS) is the primary  system used to process travel payments and accounts for most of the  department\u2019s travel payments. For fiscal year 2018, the department  reported $365.32 million in improper payments related to its travel pay  program.", "In March 2019, we reported on our priority open recommendations  directed to DOD, including six open recommendations related to improper  payments. For example, in 2013, we reported that DOD\u2019s process for  estimating and reporting improper travel payments needed to be improved to meet statutory requirements and Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) guidance. The Improper Payments Elimination and  Recovery Act of 2010 (IPERA) requires the DODIG to report annually on  DOD\u2019s compliance with statutory requirements for estimating and  reporting improper payments; since 2012, the DODIG has consistently  reported that the department has not met those requirements. For  example, the DODIG found that DOD had not published statistically valid  estimates of improper payments for DOD travel in fiscal years 2015  through 2018. In addition, the DODIG has reported on the actions that  DOD has taken to identify the underlying reasons for improper travel  payments. In 2016, the DODIG reported that DOD\u2019s actions to reduce  estimated improper travel payments were inadequate, because the  corrective actions that DOD components had developed did not include  identifying the underlying reasons that authorizing officials had approved  deficient vouchers for payment. Due, in part, to the DODIG\u2019s findings, in  October 2016, DOD developed a DOD Travel Pay Improper Payments  Remediation Plan (Remediation Plan) to reinforce internal controls and  accountability in the DOD travel pay program and help to reduce improper  payments.", "We conducted this work under the authority of the Comptroller General to  assist Congress with its oversight responsibilities.

We calculated the total payments for that time period, as well as  the average annual payments and subtotals for various categories, such  as the trip purposes that represented the top three highest percentages of  payments. We also collected data from the Defense Finance and  Accounting Service (DFAS) on travel payments made in DTS that were  identified as improper. The data included the dollar amount of those  improper payments that were estimated to result in a monetary loss to the  government, which represent amounts that should not have been paid by  the government and could be recovered.", "To assess the reliability of the data we obtained, we reviewed  corroborating documentation, analyzed the data for inconsistencies, and  interviewed service officials about the reliability of the data. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our reporting  purposes, which were to determine the amount of DOD\u2019s DTS travel  payments and provide insight into the estimated improper travel payment  amounts the department reported for fiscal years 2016 through 2018.  However, we also determined that, based on persistent problems with  DOD\u2019s improper payment estimates that we and the DODIG have  reported since 2013, these data were not sufficiently reliable for other  purposes, such as determining the specific progress DOD has made in  reducing its improper travel payment rates during this time period.", "To address our second objective, we reviewed documents and met with  officials to discuss DOD\u2019s implementation of its Remediation Plan. We  also conducted a web-based survey in February and March 2019 of travel  administrators in 52 DOD components to obtain information on their  familiarity with and implementation of the plan. These 52 components  represent the universe of DOD components that manage payments  processed in DTS for official travel by DOD personnel, according to DOD  records, our prior work, and reports by the DODIG.

For instance, 1 component (the Defense  Information Systems Agency) had not developed a component-level  remediation plan, and 6 of the 10 components had not developed  corrective action plans to address the improper travel payments they  identified, as required by the Remediation Plan. OUSD (Comptroller)  officials told us that they required only the military services to complete  corrective action plans, because these components accounted for about  92 percent of DTS travel payments.", "We found that, while DOD established specific milestones for certain  actions in the Remediation Plan, it did not establish milestones for  completing most of the actions. Specifically, as shown in table 2 earlier in  this report, only 5 of the 11 requirements in the Remediation Plan had an  associated due date. Further, while DOD established a mechanism to  monitor whether the components had implemented the Remediation Plan  requirements through the SAO committee, this mechanism was not  effective in holding them accountable for doing so.", "For example, at the first SAO committee meeting (January 18, 2017), the  SAOs were told to complete the Remediation Plan requirements by  March 1, 2017, and to be prepared to discuss them at the next SAO  committee meeting.

At the meeting,  the DOD Deputy Chief Financial Officer, serving as the chair of the  committee, emphasized that components needed to document progress  in order to demonstrate that the department was working toward  identifying root causes and implementing corrective action plans to  prevent and reduce improper travel payments. At the May 24, 2018 SAO  committee meeting, 3 additional components\u2014the Air Force, the Defense  Contract Management Agency, and the Missile Defense Agency\u2014 presented their plans to the committee.

In response to a requirement in the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, DTMO developed a  compliance tool that uses a set of digital queries to automatically  review vouchers submitted for payment through DTS to determine  whether they meet criteria that indicate the potential for improper  payment. According to DTMO, as of fiscal year 2018, the tool had  recovered $25 million over 5 years.", "If a voucher is flagged by this tool, an email is automatically generated  to the traveler and approving official associated with that voucher with  instructions for correcting the error. For example, the compliance tool  flags vouchers with duplicate expenses, such as expenses for lodging  or rental cars. However, the tool does not flag all potential improper  payments, because it does not identify all types of voucher errors. For  instance, according to DTMO officials, the tool cannot identify  vouchers that have been submitted without required receipts. For  fiscal year 2018, the average rate for DTS vouchers identified as  erroneous by the DTMO compliance tool was 0.044 percent. In  contrast, DOD reported an improper payment rate of 4.5 percent for  DTS vouchers in fiscal year 2018. In addition, the tool does not  identify the root causes leading to those errors. Rather, the tool simply  notifies the traveler and approving official associated with a specific  voucher with characteristics indicative of a potential improper payment  and requests that they amend the voucher to remove any errors.", "DFAS Sampling. Each month, DFAS selects a sample of vouchers  that have been processed in DTS and assigns staff to review those  vouchers to determine whether any resulted in an improper payment.  According to DFAS officials, DFAS provides the results of these  reviews to the components represented on the SAO committee. DFAS  also prepares quarterly reports that summarize the most frequent  errors that lead to improper travel payments and presents these  reports for discussion at SAO committee meetings. DFAS reports the  frequency of voucher errors for each military service and U.S. Special  Operations Command and an aggregate rate for defense agencies  and joint commands. The DFAS reports also suggest corrective  actions to address the identified errors. For example, in November  2018, DFAS reported that the voucher error leading to the third largest  amount of improper payments was \u201cLodging\u2014Paid Without a  Receipt,\u201d which accounted for a total of $21,810 in improper payments  in that month. The corrective action DFAS suggested was for  reviewers or approving officials to verify that receipts were uploaded  to DTS and that any uploaded receipts met the criteria for valid  receipts. If either of these conditions was not met, the reviewer was to  return the voucher to the traveler to correct and resubmit.", "However, these corrective actions did not address the root causes of  those errors. Specifically, neither DFAS nor the SAO committee  determined why travelers were not uploading receipts for lodging  expenses or why officials were approving vouchers without receipts.  According to DFAS reports, errors related to missing lodging receipts  were among the top 5 errors from October 2016 through June 2017.  By December 2018, these were was the most common errors DFAS  identified\u2014accounting for a total of $53,125 in improper payments in  that month\u2014yet DOD did not develop corrective actions to address  the root cause (i.e., why travelers were continuing to submit vouchers  without lodging receipts).", "SAO Committee Effort. As we discussed earlier in this report,  beginning in January 2017, OUSD (Comptroller) convened five  meetings of the SAOs from 10 components that, according to officials,  accounted for the majority of DOD travel payments in fiscal year 2016.  At these meetings, representatives from the components discussed  approaches they were using to reduce improper travel payments. In  addition, representatives from DTMO and DFAS presented trends  resulting from their efforts to identify improper travel payments using  the DTMO Compliance Tool and DFAS post-pay sampling. These  presentations conveyed information about the types of voucher errors  that were leading to improper travel payments, and SAOs in  attendance discussed how to mitigate those errors.

The military services, in  coordination with OUSD (Comptroller), developed corrective action  plans to address improper travel payments. OUSD (Comptroller)  provided the military services with guidance on developing the  corrective action plans that states that corrective action plans are  required to reduce improper payments, as well as to address specific  audit recommendations and issues of IPERA non-compliance. OUSD  (Comptroller) also provided the military services with a corrective  action plan template that instructs them to describe what the plan is  intended to address, i.e., improper payments, a specific audit  recommendation, or noncompliance issues. The template also defines  root causes as \u201cunderlying issues that are reasonably identifiable, can  be controlled by management, and require implementing corrective  actions to mitigate.\u201d As of May 2019, the military services had  prepared 12 corrective action plans for the travel pay area. However,  we found that only 4 of them included specific corrective actions  addressing the root causes of improper travel payments.", "We also found that the plans varied in terms of their sophistication in  discussing and identifying root causes. For example, none of the  corrective action plans prepared by the Air Force targeted the root  causes of improper travel payments. By contrast, one of the Navy\u2019s  corrective action plans clearly identified the root cause of an error  (vouchers being approved without the required forms) and specified  10 milestones and associated corrective actions to address the root  cause. Of the Army\u2019s two corrective action plans, one addressed  weaknesses in the Army\u2019s sampling plan for determining improper  payments at overseas offices but did not discuss identifying the root  causes of improper travel payments, and the other required Army  travel management officials at overseas offices to improve their  reporting of improper travel payments to more clearly link corrective  actions with root causes.", "While DOD has taken some positive steps to identify the errors that most  frequently lead to improper travel payments, our review found that  component officials do not have a clear understanding of what constitutes  the \u201croot cause\u201d of an improper travel payment. For example, component  officials who responded to our survey consistently mischaracterized root  causes as the specific errors leading to improper payments (e.g., missing  receipts) rather than the underlying reasons for those errors.", "Our survey asked respondents if their component had taken steps to  identify the root causes of voucher errors that led to improper travel  payments in fiscal year 2018 and, if so, to provide examples of root  causes they had identified. While 31 of the 37 (84 percent) components  that responded to the question indicated that they had taken steps to  identify root causes, and 28 (76 percent) indicated that they had taken  steps to address those identified root causes, open-ended survey  responses indicated that the components did not understand the term  \u201croot cause.\u201d Specifically, 24 of the 31 (77 percent) components that  provided open-ended responses with examples of the root causes they  identified cited voucher errors\u2014such as missing receipts\u2014rather than  identifying the root causes for why those errors occurred. This indicates  that the 31 components that responded to this question did not  understand the term \u201croot cause\u201d. It also suggests that the number of  components that actually took actions to address root causes is likely  significantly lower than the numbers reported by the survey respondents.", "OMB guidance specifies that agencies should ensure they have identified  a true root cause of an improper payment, because it is critical to do so in  order to formulate effective corrective actions.

Specifically, of the  31 components that provided examples of what they believed to be the  root causes of voucher errors, only 7 provided examples of actual root  causes.

However, we found that the services had not incorporated a consideration  of cost-effectiveness into their decisions on whether to implement those  actions, at least in part because OUSD (Comptroller) had not provided  guidance on how they should assess the cost-effectiveness of potential  corrective actions. Specifically, the template OUSD (Comptroller)  provided to the military services for preparing corrective action plans  neither asked for information on costs nor specified how to determine the  cost-effectiveness of specific corrective actions.

However, \u201cTrip Workbook\u201d is not  visible to approving officials when they process the voucher for approval  and payment. As a result, vouchers are being approved without the  required receipts, because approving officials cannot determine whether  or not the receipts have been attached. Officials stated that changes to  DTS are often costly and can take a long time, and in some instances  they can be more costly than the improper payment amounts they are  intended to reduce.

Thus, DOD lacks assurance that the components it selected for greater scrutiny  were the ones most at risk for improper travel payments. Further, even  the components that DOD determined were critical to implementing the  Remediation Plan did not fully implement the Plan\u2019s requirements,  because DOD had not established milestones for completing all of the  requirements, monitored whether the components had completed them  on time, or held them accountable for completing the requirements.

DOD added that this  approach achieved maximum coverage of travel payments, given its time  and resource limitations. DOD also stated that improper payment metrics  reported by DFAS supported this approach, as these data show that the  military services accounted for 92 percent of DTS travel payments and a  majority of improper travel payments.", "We acknowledge in our report that DOD identified the 10 components to  include on the SAO committee because these components accounted for  the significant majority of the department\u2019s fiscal year 2016 DTS travel  payments.

We  administered the survey from February 4 through March 29, 2019,  soliciting information on the extent to which components had  implemented the Remediation Plan, steps the components had taken to  address improper travel payments, the types of issues that frequently  lead to improper travel payments, and challenges associated with  reducing improper travel payments. We sent this survey to 52  components, 37 (71 percent) of whom responded. More specifically, 9 of  10 (90 percent) components represented on the Senior Accountable  Official (SAO) committee (SAO components) responded and 28 of 42  (67 percent) components not represented on the SAO committee (non- SAO components) responded. The survey results represent the views of  only those components that responded and may not be generalizable to all components. The results of our survey provide measures of  component officials\u2019 views at the time they completed the survey in  February and March 2019.
