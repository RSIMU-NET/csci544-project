The Whistleblower Protection Program at the Department of Labor's (Labor) Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is responsible for investigating whistleblowers' complaints. OSHA's decisions generally may be appealed to the Office of Administrative Law Judges (OALJ) and, ultimately, the Administrative Review Board (ARB). GAO examined (1) what is known about processing times for complaints and what affects these times, (2) what outcomes resulted, and (3) what challenges OSHA faces in administering the program. To answer these questions, GAO analyzed electronic data files from OSHA, OALJ, and ARB; visited five OSHA regional offices; reviewed case files; conducted a Web-based survey of investigators; and interviewed key officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Labor lacks reliable information on processing times and, as a result, cannot accurately report how long it takes to investigate and close a case or decide on certain appeals. OSHA does not have an effective mechanism to ensure that the data are accurately recorded in its database, and GAO's file reviews revealed that the key dates are often inaccurately recorded in the database or cannot be verified due to a lack of supporting documentation. For example, in one region visited, none of the case closed dates matched the documentation in case files. At the appeals level, the reliability of information on the processing times is mixed. Timeliness data at the OALJ level are reliable, and the OALJ completed appealed cases in an average of about 9 months in fiscal year 2007. In contrast, ARB data are unreliable, and the agency lacks sufficient oversight of data quality. GAO's file review found that ARB processing times ranged from 30 days to over 5 years. At all levels of the whistleblower program, GAO found that increasing caseloads, case complexity, and accommodating requests from the parties' legal counsel affect case processing times. Whistleblowers received a favorable outcome in a minority of cases that were closed in fiscal year 2007, both at initial decision and on appeal, but the actual proportion may be somewhat lower than Labor's data show. OSHA's data show that whistleblowers received a favorable outcome in 21 percent of complaints--nearly all settled through a separate agreement involving the whistleblower and the employer, rather than through a decision rendered by OSHA. However, GAO found several problems in the way settlements were being recorded in OSHA's database, and a review of settlement agreements suggests that the proportion of cases found to have merit may actually be about 19 percent. As with investigations, when whistleblower complaints were appealed, decisions favored the whistleblower in a minority of the cases--one-third or less of outcomes favored the whistleblower. With respect to administering the whistleblower program, OSHA faces two key challenges--it lacks a mechanism to adequately ensure the quality and consistency of investigations, and many investigators said they lack certain resources they need to do their jobs, including equipment, training, and legal assistance. OSHA does not routinely conduct independent audits of the program to ensure consistent application of its policies and procedures. OSHA's new field audit program has begun to address this need but is lacking in several key areas. For example, the current audit processes do not adequately provide for independence, an important aspect of an effective audit program. Moreover, OSHA is challenged to ensure that investigators in all regions have the resources they need to address their large and complex caseloads. OSHA has not established minimum equipment standards for its investigators, and nearly half of the whistleblower investigators reported that the equipment they have does not meet the needs of their jobs. Furthermore, investigators often cite the need for more training and legal assistance on the complex federal statutes that OSHA administers."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Workers who \u201cblow the whistle\u201d on prohibited or unlawful practices they  discover during their employment can play an important role in enforcing  federal laws. However, these whistleblowers also risk reprisals from their  employers, sometimes being demoted, reassigned, or fired. Many federal  laws and regulations establish a whistleblower protection process,  whereby workers who feel they have faced retaliation for blowing the  whistle can report their allegations to the appropriate federal agency,  which then determines the merit of their claims. The Whistleblower  Protection Program at the Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and  Health Administration (OSHA) is responsible for receiving and  investigating most whistleblower complaints. Since the whistleblower  program began in 1970, the number of statutes for which OSHA is  responsible for enforcing whistleblower provisions has increased\u2014recent  additions in 2008 bring the total to 17 such statutes. With the exception of  the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the basic provisions of these  statutes are administered by agencies other than the Department of Labor  (Labor). All of the whistleblower provisions are intended to protect   non-federal workers in a range of industries, including nuclear power,  transportation, pipeline infrastructure, consumer product safety, and  securities industries, as well as in several environmental areas. The  Whistleblower Protection Program does not have its own budget, but  shares resources with OSHA\u2019s other enforcement programs--the exact  distribution of resources for investigations is decided by each of the 10  regional administrators. Since 2003, the number of investigators has  remained relatively steady; currently, OSHA has 69 investigators, 8  supervisory investigators, and 1 program manager assigned to the  whistleblower program. During fiscal year 2007, OSHA investigated and  closed over 1,800 whistleblower complaints covering 13 statutes.", "To receive protection under the program, a whistleblower must file a  complaint with OSHA. Under the whistleblower provisions, OSHA has  between 30 and 90 days, depending on the statute, to complete its  investigation and make its initial findings. After OSHA completes its  investigation and issues its decision, the whistleblower and his or her  employer generally have the right to appeal the decision within Labor\u2014for  many of the statutes, to the Office of Administrative Law Judges (OALJ)  and, ultimately, the Administrative Review Board (ARB). After this  administrative appeals process, either party may, in certain circumstances,  bring a legal action in a U.S. District Court or a U.S. Court of Appeals.", "When we last reviewed the whistleblower program in 1988, we found that  OSHA had not focused sufficient management attention on the program,  and that criteria and standards for handling complaints were not  consistently followed. In addition, we found that many investigations  under the statute we reviewed were not completed within statutory time  frames. In 2001, Labor\u2019s Inspector General similarly found that OSHA was  not completing its whistleblower investigations under two other statutes  within statutory time frames. Moreover, with the addition of new statutes  to the program, caseloads are increasing at all levels. Within this context,  we addressed the following objectives: (1) What is known about the  processing times for claims under the whistleblower statutes that OSHA  administers and what factors affect processing times? (2) What are the  outcomes from complaints filed with the Whistleblower Protection  Program? (3) What are the key challenges OSHA faces in administering the  whistleblower program?", "To answer these questions, we obtained and tested the reliability of databases  on key information about whistleblowers\u2019 cases from OSHA, OALJ, and ARB.  We found that the OSHA and ARB data on processing times were not reliable,  so we conducted case file reviews in 5 of the 10 OSHA regions to provide  examples of processing times for investigating these cases. We selected these  regions to give us a mix of case volumes (high and low) and to provide  geographic dispersion. In addition, we requested case file documents on all  cases the ARB closed in fiscal year 2007 and were able to obtain and analyze  109 of the 120 cases that were closed. With regard to outcomes, we found that  elements in OSHA\u2019s database related to cases dismissed and withdrawn were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes, but the data related to settlements were  not; therefore, we reviewed and analyzed all available settlement documents  completed in fiscal year 2007. The OALJ and the ARB databases did not  contain outcome information. Because we had to rely largely on reviewing  whistleblower case decisions to gather these data, we focused our efforts on  cases closed in fiscal year 2007. We also reviewed pertinent documents and  interviewed agency officials from OSHA, OALJ, and ARB. In addition, we  surveyed all OSHA investigators to gather information about their views of  the whistleblower program, and we received an 86 percent response rate.  During our site visits to the five OSHA regional offices, we interviewed key  officials and, to supplement these site visits, we interviewed officials in the  other five regions by phone to obtain their views of the whistleblower  program. In our work, we did not review the adequacy of Labor\u2019s human  capital strategies for meeting its current and future investigation workload. In  addition, we did not assess the quality of the investigations or the  appropriateness of whistleblower outcomes because these aspects were  beyond the scope of the engagement. Appendix I contains a detailed  discussion of our objectives, scope, and methodology. We conducted this  performance audit from October 2007 to January 2009, in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require  that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence  to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["OSHA was established after the passage of the Occupational Safety and  Health Act in 1970. In the broadest sense, OSHA was mandated to ensure  safe and healthy working conditions for working men and women. Section  11(c) of that act prohibits anyone from discharging or discriminating  against any private sector employee because that employee filed a  complaint related to the act. Section 11(c) also allows these employees to  file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor alleging such discrimination.  OSHA was initially responsible for investigating whistleblower allegations  under only the Occupational Safety and Health Act. In 1983, OSHA began  investigating whistleblower complaints from trucking employees and,  since that time, OSHA has been assigned whistleblower provisions under  15 other statutes related to airline, nuclear power, pipeline, environmental,  rail, consumer product safety, and securities industries. Currently, under  OSHA\u2019s whistleblower program, the agency is responsible for investigating  discrimination complaints under 17 statutes, the basic provisions of which  are administered by a number of different federal agencies (see table 1).  Other Labor agencies, such as the Mine Safety and Health Administration  and the Employment Standards Administration, are responsible for  enforcing anti-retaliation provisions for several other statutes for which  Labor is substantively responsible. (App. II provides details on the  whistleblower provisions OSHA enforces, including statutory and  regulatory time frames. App. III provides information on the anti- retaliation provisions that other Labor agencies administer.)", "As with OSHA\u2019s enforcement programs, the whistleblower program  operates within the decentralized structure of the agency\u2019s regional and  area offices, and the 10 regional administrators are responsible for  administering the program in their regions (see fig. 1). Each region  generally employs a supervisory investigator or program manager and a  number of investigators to review claims filed under the whistleblower  program. The program\u2019s national director, located in Washington, D.C., is  responsible for developing policy and procedures, providing training, and  offering technical assistance and guidance.", "A whistleblower\u2019s claim begins when he or she contacts OSHA with an  allegation of discrimination for engaging in a protected activity, such as  reporting a workplace health violation to OSHA or a Clean Air Act violation to  the Environmental Protection Agency. According to Labor, the  whistleblower\u2014or complainant\u2014should address the prima facie elements of  a violation: the employer knew about the protected activity, that the  employer\u2014or respondent\u2014subjected the whistleblower to an adverse action  (such as being fired), and the protected activity contributed to the adverse  action. Investigators screen complaints for these prima facie elements and, if  warranted, conduct an investigation (see fig. 2).", "If the investigation results in a finding of nonmerit, the case is dismissed. If  the investigation leads to a Secretary\u2019s finding of merit, OSHA generally  issues a preliminary order, which may include reinstatement to the  employee\u2019s previous position and back pay. If neither party files an  objection within the required time frames, the preliminary order becomes  final. (See app. II for information on each statute\u2019s time frames.) If either  party objects to the Secretary\u2019s findings or preliminary order, the objecting  party may generally request a review of the case.", "For complaints under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, Asbestos  Hazard Emergency Response Act, and International Safe Container Act,  the whistleblower may request that the Appeals Committee review OSHA\u2019s  decision. This committee will review the file and any other documentation  supplied by the complainant or the regional administrator, and may   (1) return the case for additional investigation, or (2) deny the appeal.", "Under the other 14 statutes, either party may generally file an objection to  the Secretary\u2019s findings or preliminary order by requesting a hearing with  Labor\u2019s Office of Administrative Law Judges (see fig. 3). This review is   de novo\u2014it does not take into account the Secretary\u2019s findings from the  OSHA investigation.", "Either party may generally appeal the ALJ\u2019s decision to the Administrative  Review Board (ARB). In 1996, the Secretary of Labor delegated authority  to ARB to issue final decisions on whistleblower and other types of cases.  The Secretary\u2019s final decision may, in specific circumstances, be appealed  to the federal courts (see fig. 4).", "A whistleblower may potentially obtain relief in many forms. One possible  remedy is an order for reinstatement of the whistleblower to his or her  former position, or an equivalent position. The whistleblower may also be  awarded back pay to make up for the money he or she would have earned  in the absence of retaliation.

Moreover, case  files we reviewed showed that some cases exceeded their statutory or  regulatory time frames. Only the OALJ data were reliable, enabling us to  report that the average processing time at the OALJ for cases closed in  fiscal year 2007 was about 9 months.

We found a large number of  errors in four of the five regions where we reviewed randomly selected  case files. For example, in at least one-sixth of the cases we reviewed in  three regions, documentation for the dates the cases were opened did not  match information in the database or was missing from files. In one region,  none of the documentation for the dates that the cases were closed  matched the information in the database because this region does not  follow agency policy for determining when the case is closed. In this  region, the case closed date reflects an interim step\u2014the date the  supervisor signed the investigator\u2019s report. However, according to OSHA\u2019s  guidance, the case closed date should match the date OSHA sends a letter  describing the outcome of the investigation to the whistleblower and the  employer.", "Moreover, the processing times that some regions reported were  appreciably different than the actual processing times for several of the  cases we reviewed\u2014in some cases, actual processing times were longer  and in others, shorter than they appeared in the database. Cases that had  actual processing times that were longer than they appeared in the  database had case open dates that were as much as 50 days later than the  actual date they were opened or case closed dates as much as 27 days  earlier than the actual dates the cases were closed. Conversely, cases for  which the actual processing times were shorter than they appeared had  case closed dates in the database that were as much as 121 days later than  the actual dates the cases were closed.", "These unreliable data undermine OSHA\u2019s efforts to manage the  whistleblower program and ensure the completion of cases within  statutory and regulatory time frames. The Office of Management and  Budget requires that federal agencies establish and maintain internal  controls, in part, to ensure the agency\u2019s compliance with laws and  regulations. As part of this process, agencies are required to ensure that  transactions are processed accurately in their information systems and  that the data are valid and complete. Furthermore, according to the  Government Auditing Standards, managers are responsible for providing  reliable, useful, and timely information for accountability of government  programs and their operations. OSHA does not have an effective  mechanism to ensure that the data are accurately recorded in the system.  There is no requirement that data entered in OSHA\u2019s database be  validated\u2014the decision to do so is left to the regions.  And, although  OSHA has an internal audit program that could help focus efforts on the  data quality, some regions have not conducted audits of their  whistleblower program in recent years. Even when they have, we found  their timeliness data to be unreliable.", "Although we cannot report overall processing times for OSHA\u2019s  investigations, in our review of case files we found cases that exceeded  their statutory or regulatory time frames. Furthermore, cases under each  statute revealed a wide range of processing times, regardless of their  statutory or regulatory requirements.

Figure 5  illustrates the range of days each phase took among the randomly selected  cases we reviewed. In general, investigators who responded to our survey  believe that 30 or 60 days are not sufficient to conduct an investigation.  For example, for cases under the environmental protection statutes and  the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, the employer is permitted 20 days  after receiving notice of the complaint to submit a written statement. At  this point, the case has nearly reached the 30-day time frame, but the  information gathering and analysis phase has just begun.", "OSHA officials also commented that the differences in allowable  processing times between the statutes can undermine efficiency because  investigators are often forced to place a higher priority on completing the  30-day cases, instead of treating each case in the order it is received."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Caseload Size, Case Complexity, and Involvement of the Parties\u2019 Legal Counsels Hinder Investigators\u2019 Ability to Complete Cases within Required Time Frames", "paragraphs": ["Overall caseload, the amount and complexity of information to gather and  analyze, and involvement of the parties\u2019 counsel affect investigators\u2019 ability  to complete whistleblower investigations within statutory or regulatory  time frames, according to survey respondents. Four-fifths of investigators  who completed our survey reported that the size of their caseloads at least  moderately hindered their ability to complete investigations within these  time frames (see fig 6). In addition, many regional officials we interviewed  confirmed that the caseload affects the timeliness of investigations, citing  the increased number and complexity of statutes and associated training  needs as contributing factors. In general, they reported that investigators  can reasonably manage between 5 and 12 open investigations  concurrently, depending on the types of cases. However, the national  average was 16 open cases per investigator, as of October 2008, with  individual regions ranging from 6 to 35 cases per investigator.", "About three-fourths or more of investigators also reported that the amount  and complexity of information that must be collected and the involvement  of the employer\u2019s counsel at least moderately hindered their ability to  complete investigations within statutory or regulatory time frames.

In our interviews, officials and investigators cited  Sarbanes-Oxley cases as particularly complex and time-consuming, with  different officials equating the work required for one Sarbanes-Oxley case to  the work required for two to six cases under the Occupational Safety and  Health Act. One official explained that Sarbanes-Oxley cases take the  longest to investigate for several reasons: investigators must learn financial  terminology; the cases tend to require more detailed, often legal, research  with little case precedent; and the employers are often large corporations  that engage a larger contingent of attorneys than do employers in other  types of whistleblower cases. Attorney involvement and settlement  negotiations\u2014which are especially common with Sarbanes-Oxley cases\u2014 involve substantial paperwork and processing at various points, such as for  requests for extensions to allow attorneys to conduct their own  investigations.

Processing times varied  widely across statutes, ranging from as little as 10 days to about 3 years  (see table 3).", "The factors that affect the timeliness of OSHA investigations also affect  the length of the OALJ appeals process: the amount and complexity of  evidence, involvement of the parties\u2019 legal counsel, and the judge\u2019s overall  caseload. According to the judges we interviewed, in complex cases, such  as those under Sarbanes-Oxley, Energy Reorganization, and Aviation  Investment and Reform, the discovery and motions phase can last 6  months or more due to the complexity and volume of documents involved.  During the discovery process, at least one party typically requests  extensions, usually to review and respond to the other party\u2019s submitted  documents and to take depositions of witnesses\u2014requiring more time  when lawyers are involved. This phase also involves disputes over  evidence to be entered, and sometimes the judges will have to write  lengthy discovery orders or motions to require opposing parties or outside  parties to cooperate. According to one judge, such disputes occur more  often in whistleblower cases than other types of cases that they hear.  Usually toward the end of the discovery process, parties sometimes  submit a motion for summary judgment\u2014typically requiring a complex  and lengthy motion decision by the judge. If the case is not resolved  through the motions process, the resulting hearing may last a few days or a  few weeks, depending on the number of witnesses and the complexity of  evidence. For example, Sarbanes-Oxley cases typically require expert  witnesses to explain evidence. Judges report that their overall caseload  may increase processing times, especially during the decision phase of the  process. While writing the decision for a complex case may require 1  month of work, it spans several months because of other, ongoing cases.  The judges we interviewed each had from 61 to 115 open cases at the time  of the interview and, although whistleblower cases represent a minority of  the OALJ\u2019s overall caseload, judges report that they take longer to  adjudicate than cases under other statutes.", "Appeals to the ARB.

When this occurs,  investigators do not record the complaint in OSHA\u2019s central database  because they are not required to and, according to OSHA officials, the  system\u2019s design does not allow them to record complaints that are never  opened or investigated. While the individual regional offices have begun  tracking their own screen-outs, OSHA currently has no central mechanism  to assess the overall investigators\u2019 workload during the year, or the  outcomes of all complaints received. OSHA officials tell us they are in the  process of designing a new Web-based data system\u2014called the OSHA  Information System, or OIS\u2014that would capture information on screened  out complaints, including the reasons for the screen-out. OSHA expects to  implement the new system in late 2010.", "The number of complaints that were screened out in fiscal year 2007  varied widely from region to region, and sometimes exceeded the number  of complaints that the region investigated and closed based on data we  reviewed from the five regions we visited. We found that, for two of the  regions, the number of complaints screened out was higher than the  number investigated and closed during the year and, in two other regions,  the number was much lower (see table 7). In explaining these differences,  officials told us that regions are using different standards to make screen- out decisions--existing criteria on when to screen out cases are not  consistently applied and the current process lacks accountability.", "The vast majority of cases that the five regions screened out, where we  could identify the applicable statute, were received under the  Occupational Safety and Health Act\u2014also the statute with the largest  overall number of complaints. According to the regions\u2019 documentation,  the most frequently cited reason for screening out cases was that the  complainant\u2019s allegation did not meet the elements of a prima facie case.  Also, frequently cited reasons included that the complaint was not within  OSHA\u2019s jurisdiction or was not filed within required time frames. Other  reasons included lack of cooperation from the whistleblower and the  whistleblower declined to pursue the complaint. Overall, the five regions  we visited reported that they screened out about 590 cases during fiscal  year 2007, compared with 861 cases that they investigated and closed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Whistleblowers Received a Favorable Decision in No More than One-Third of Cases Appealed in Fiscal Year 2007", "paragraphs": ["Across all statutes, whistleblowers received a favorable decision in no more  than about one-third of the cases appealed in fiscal year 2007. As we  reported earlier, the appeals process differs depending on statute. In fiscal  year 2007, the Appeals Committee reviewed 69 appeals under the three  statutes for which it hears appeals and eventually denied 68 of those cases.  In 2007, three of those cases were sent back to the appropriate regions for  reinvestigation and, upon further review by the Appeals Committee, two of  those cases were denied. The remaining case was also sent back to the  region for reinvestigation, but the whistleblower withdrew his complaint  while the case was being reinvestigated (see fig. 8).", "For all other statutes, cases may generally be appealed to OALJ and,  ultimately, to ARB. Of the 207 appeals that OALJ reviewed in fiscal year  2007, almost two-thirds were either dismissed by OALJ, or withdrawn by  the whistleblower. About one-third of the cases were settled between the  two parties or found in favor of the whistleblower. In a small portion of  appeals, OALJ did not make a decision within the required time frames,  and the whistleblowers took their case to U.S. District Court. Most of the  cases appealed to the courts were related to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,  which permits an action to be brought in U.S. District Court if the  Secretary has not issued a decision within 180 days of the filing of the  complaint.  If either party disagrees with OALJ\u2019s decision, it can file an  appeal with ARB (see fig. 9).", "When cases were further appealed to the ARB, a small portion was  resolved in favor of the whistleblower, most often through a settlement  agreement. ARB decided 50 appealed cases in fiscal year 2007 and  dismissed or denied about 50 percent of the cases it decided. In four  cases, ARB reversed OALJ\u2019s decision that originally favored the  whistleblower, often citing insufficient evidence showing that the  whistleblower was protected by the act or the employer had taken an  adverse action. ARB decided in favor of the whistleblower in 8 percent of  the complaints, and those resulted in a settlement agreement.

OSHA does not routinely conduct  independent audits of the whistleblower program to ensure consistent  application of policies and procedures. OSHA\u2019s new field audit program  has begun to address this need but is lacking in several key areas; in  particular, it does not adequately provide for audit independence or for  accountability in resolving audit findings. With respect to resources, nearly  half of the investigators overall reported that the equipment they have  does not meet the needs of the job, but these equipment needs vary from  region to region.  OSHA has not established minimum standards for  investigator equipment, and we found that the equipment investigators  lack varies from region to region. Furthermore, the majority of  investigators told us that they need more training to effectively address  cases from some of the complex federal statutes that OSHA administers.

In response, OSHA revised its audit directive,  and an office within OSHA is responsible for overseeing regional audit  activities. The revised audit directive requires regions to perform  comprehensive audits of all programs, including the whistleblower  program, at least once every 4 years, but also requires that they audit some  aspect of their own regional operations each year. Such annual audits may,  for example, focus on a single aspect of a program\u2014possibly the  whistleblower program\u2014or may examine only one of several office  locations in a region. Despite these efforts, we found several areas in  which audit efforts fell short.", "Audits of the whistleblower program have not been routinely conducted.  OSHA has not been systematically conducting audits of the whistleblower  program to ensure all regions consistently apply the same policies and  procedures. Since this new directive became effective in 2005, only 6 out  of the 10 regions have completed a limited-focus audit of their  whistleblower program, and none of OSHA\u2019s regions has conducted a  comprehensive audit of the entire program.

All regions should complete a comprehensive audit by the end of  fiscal year 2009.", "Audit guidance is unclear. The current audit directive is unclear and agency  officials expressed conflicting views about the criteria regions must meet in  order to comply with the audit directive. For example, the directive does not  provide specific guidance about what aspects of the whistleblower program  all regions must examine in a comprehensive audit. The guidance is limited to  a sample list of questions auditors may use\u2014but are not required to use\u2014for  either a limited focus or a comprehensive audit. It does not specify which  questions must be answered and does not always provide clear criteria  against which to evaluate performance. For example, one question asks  whether complaints are forwarded to the investigator in a timely manner,  without defining what is meant by timely. Given this lack of clarity, officials  cannot ensure that every region\u2019s whistleblower program is audited using the  same standards and criteria.", "Audits lack independence. OSHA\u2019s audit processes do not adequately  provide for independence, an important aspect of an effective audit  program and a key aspect of generally accepted government auditing  standards. Government Auditing Standards describes the criteria for  independence. \u201cThe audit organization and the individual auditor, whether government  or public, must be free from personal, external, and organizational  impairments to independence, and must avoid the appearance of such  impairments to independence. Auditors and audit organizations must  maintain independence so that their opinions, findings, conclusions,  judgments, and recommendations will be impartial and viewed as  impartial by objective third parties with knowledge of the relevant  information\u2026. audit organizations must not audit their own work...\u201d", "All phases of the audit process are controlled by the regional administrator  whose programs are being audited. Each OSHA regional administrator  appoints regional staff to plan and conduct audits, receives the audit  findings, and takes corrective action. Audit team leaders and members  usually serve on the audit team in addition to their regular duties within  the region; for the purposes of the audits, they report directly to the  regional administrator. Although an official with the audit program told us  that the audit team leader and members should not audit a program on  which they work, the current audit directive does not specifically discuss  the independence of the audit coordinator or team members. An official  acknowledged that regions sometimes appoint staff from within a program  to participate in audits of that program. Regional administrators are also  responsible for deciding how their region will comply with the annual  audit requirement\u2014regions determine the program(s) and/or office  locations to be audited and the scope of those audits.

The national office  may contact regional audit staff to verbally verify that the information on this  checklist is correct. However, neither OSHA\u2019s national office of the audit  program nor the national office of the whistleblower program has the  opportunity to review or follow up on the full findings of audits, or to  systematically monitor whether the region has addressed the problems  identified.

Forty-five percent of the investigators reported that the  equipment they have does not meet the needs of the job, but these  equipment needs vary from region to region. According to OSHA officials,  regional administrators must make key management decisions for the  whistleblower program in their region, including how to allocate resources  among the whistleblower program and the many other OSHA priorities. This  need to balance competing needs against limited resources has led to a  situation in which investigators in some regions lack essential tools.", "According to headquarters officials, the program has not established  minimum equipment standards, but all of the program\u2019s investigators should  have laptop computers, portable printers, and cell phones. In addition to  these items, investigators and supervisors told us that docking stations and  digital voice recorders are also useful tools. Since much of the work  investigators do takes place in the field, the availability of high-quality  equipment is critical. Many investigators reported in our survey that Labor  has provided some key equipment. For example, about 70 percent of  investigators reported that Labor has provided them with laptop computers,  and about the same percentage say they have been given digital recorders.  However, about 26 percent of investigators reported needing a portable  printer, and about 13 percent reported needing a laptop computer (see fig.  11). Moreover, specific equipment needs vary greatly from region to region.  For example, in two regions one-half or more of investigators reported  needing portable printers, but in three other regions, none of the  investigators reported this need. Additionally, in four regions, one-half or  more of investigators reported needing docking stations, in four other  regions, none reported needing them.", "Lacking essential, up-to-date equipment limits investigators\u2019 ability to  conduct timely investigations. Nearly one-third of all investigators  reported that their equipment or computer software hinders their ability to  complete investigations within statutory or regulatory time frames.  However, this figure varies from region to region\u2014while this was not a  major problem in four regions, for six regions, it ranged from around 30 to  80 percent. Lacking essential equipment can negatively affect  investigators\u2019 work. For example, not having a laptop computer and  portable printer while in the field can cause significant delays in an  investigation. According to investigators, having this equipment is often  key to quickly getting witness statements. It is not uncommon for a  witness to be willing and available to sign a sworn statement directly  following an in-person interview in the field, but to be slow to respond\u2014or  not willing to respond at all\u2014if he or she receives the statement in the  mail. Table 8 provides illustrative examples of how investigators would  use certain essential tools to do their jobs.", "Over one-half of investigators reported spending some out-of-pocket funds  on work-related equipment, supplies, or transportation in calendar year  2007, according to our survey. In some cases, this was as little as $75, but,  in two regions, investigators spent as much as $2,000 of their own money.  Some investigators said they purchased basic equipment, such as a laptop  computer or a printer, with their own money, either because they have not  been supplied such equipment by the agency, or because the equipment  the agency provided is of insufficient quality. In one instance, an  investigator who was preparing to attend the mandatory 2-week  investigator training course learned that the course required participants  to bring laptops with operating systems that were compatible with the  software being used for the course. Lacking this, the investigator used his  or her own money to buy a laptop with a compatible operating system. In  three regions, nearly all investigators reported that they had been issued a  government-funded cell phone but, in four other regions, all of the  investigators reported they have not. Most investigators in these four  regions reported using personal cell phones to conduct official business.  Some investigators report that they are not reimbursed for the cost of  using personal cell phones.", "Training and legal resources for complex cases. Whistleblower  investigators reported that they need more training to address their  complex cases. For example, between one-third and one-half of  investigators responding to our survey reported that they have not  received any specific training on two of the statutes that OSHA considers  most complex\u2014Sarbanes-Oxley and the Aviation Investment and Reform  Act. Overall, 40 percent of investigators reported in our survey that a lack  of training hinders their ability to complete investigations within required  time frames; in five regions, it was one-half or more of investigators.  Furthermore, OSHA officials and several supervisors told us that  budgetary constraints have prevented most investigators from receiving  training. All investigators are required to complete a 2-week basic  whistleblower investigations training course that focuses on complaints  filed under the Occupational Safety and Health Act; but, investigators and  supervisors told us, and OSHA officials have acknowledged, that  investigators need additional training that goes beyond the topics covered  in the 2-week course. For example, nearly three-quarters of investigators  ranked the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as the statute on which they most need  additional training in order to improve their ability to effectively do their  jobs. In particular, supervisors and investigators stressed the need for  training on the scope of protected activities covered by the Act. The  national office, together with a curriculum development team, has recently  redesigned the mandatory basic training course to include, among other  changes, training on all of the federal statutes OSHA administers, but the  national office does not control the training budget for regional  investigators. Twenty-four whistleblower investigators and supervisors  were able to take the course in June 2008; while another session has been  scheduled, it is unclear whether all investigators will be able to receive  this training. OSHA officials recognize the need for more investigators to  receive training, but regional budgetary constraints may limit  participation.", "Additionally, investigators do not consistently receive the legal assistance  they need to conduct high-quality investigations. Investigators in many  OSHA regions are able to draw on the legal expertise of their region\u2019s  Solicitor\u2019s Office. In addition, officials and supervisors report that OSHA\u2019s  national Whistleblower Protection Program office frequently offers  technical assistance on complex cases. However, the specialized  knowledge required for some of the statutes does not readily exist within  Labor, in part, because the agency does not administer the substantive  provisions of most of the statutes. Moreover, some of the newer, more  complex statutes have limited case law to guide decision making. As a  result, investigators sometimes have difficulty getting the legal advice they  need to help them with the complex issues they frequently encounter over  the course of investigating cases. Officials and supervisors told us that the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act is the statute on which specialized legal assistance is  most often needed, although other statutes also involve complex legal  matters, for example, the Aviation Investment and Reform Act. Sarbanes- Oxley cases in particular often require investigators to analyze evidence  that is difficult and highly technical\u2014for example, investigators must  analyze laws and regulations pertaining to securities transactions. Several  supervisors report that the national office and their region\u2019s solicitor\u2019s  office are sometimes good sources of assistance on such matters, but that  neither is consistently able to quickly answer important questions about  specific, complex legal issues.

Since then, little has been done to ensure that OSHA\u2014and  ARB\u2014have the accurate and complete data they need to manage and  oversee the program.  No effort has been made to validate the accuracy or  the timeliness of the data.  Having such data is a necessary first step in  determining whether the program is meeting required statutory and  regulatory time frames for responding to whistleblowers\u2019 complaints, and,  if it is not, in assessing the reasonableness of those time frames.   Furthermore, because many complaints are screened out and never  recorded in OSHA\u2019s database, it has an incomplete picture of how many  complaints it receives and of their ultimate outcomes, and it cannot ensure  that screen-out decisions are made using consistent criteria.", "As in the past, OSHA is focusing too little attention on developing the  accountability framework it needs to ensure that criteria and standards for  investigating complaints are consistently followed.  Audits are central to  any internal control and accountability process and, while some progress  has been made to enhance its audit program, more needs to be done to  bring it in line with government auditing standards.  Current guidance for  conducting audits lacks the detail and clarity needed to ensure that the  audits achieve the intended results on a consistent basis across regions.   Even with clearer guidance, OSHA\u2019s audit program lacks the  independence necessary for an objective review of the regions\u2019 activities  and provides too little opportunity for accountability when follow-up is  needed.  Without sufficient internal controls and an appropriate  accountability mechanism, the whistleblower program lacks key  components of good program management and does not have the  oversight tools it needs to ensure it is meeting its mission. Moreover,  lacking this oversight and accountability, OSHA will be hampered in its  ability to ensure the quality and consistency of investigations, as well as  the validity of the outcomes.", "Whistleblower investigators continue to be challenged in their efforts to meet  statutory and regulatory time frames.  In the years since our last review, they  have been entrusted with the responsibility of protecting from retaliation many  more employees who blow the whistle\u2014employees from industries as diverse  as trucking, energy, aviation, and securities.  With these new responsibilities  have come increased job complexity, but OSHA has struggled to provide  investigators with the skills and resources they need to effectively do their jobs.   Fully implementing the new standardized training on the complex issues that  investigators confront and establishing minimum standards for the equipment  they need are important first steps in helping ensure the program meets its  goals. We recognize that OSHA faces significant resource constraints, and the  decision to provide this additional support will be challenging.

In our report, we have noted that, due to the addition of several new  statutes, investigators are carrying larger, more complex caseloads.  However, given that the program has no budget of its own, decisions on  how to allocate staffing or other resources among the various OSHA  programs are within the agency\u2019s control and discretion. Evaluating these  resource allocation issues was beyond the scope of this engagement.

In addition, officials commented that we failed to take into  account the impact on overall efficiency of having statutory processing  time frames that vary from 30 to 90 days. We have modified our report to  reflect that point. Finally, OSHA disagreed with the need for our draft  recommendation to ensure that audits of the program are completed,  citing its expectation that all 10 regional offices will have completed on- site audits during fiscal year 2009. Because audits of the whistleblower  program have not been routinely conducted, we revised the  recommendation, clarifying that the agency should focus its efforts on  developing interim milestones to ensure that audits of the program are  completed within time frames.

In defending its position, ARB listed additional reports  that it uses in conjunction with the case tracking system to monitor  performance.

In all, we visited 5 of  OSHA\u2019s 10 regions: Region 2 in New York City, Region 3 in Philadelphia,  Region 4 in Atlanta, Region 8 in Denver, and Region 10 in Seattle. We  selected these locations to give us a mix of case volumes (high and low),  regions with and without state-based occupational safety and health  programs, and to provide geographic dispersion.

We then randomized the cases within each  subgroup and reviewed the first case on each list. Because we selected  nonprobability samples of regions to visit and cases to review, the  information we obtained at these locations may not be generalized across  all OSHA regions.

When we adjusted settlement outcomes based on the documentation we  obtained, we confirmed our decision with OSHA officials. Despite the database  errors in recording settlements, we concluded that our testing had accurately  assessed that information on cases dismissed and withdrawn was correct. To  arrive at this conclusion, we took into account (1) the higher likelihood that we  would have detected errors in cases dismissed and withdrawn due to its higher  occurrence in the population and (2) the contents of settlement documents  tended to be more nuanced than the documentation related to cases dismissed or  withdrawn and, therefore, more likely to have errors. For the cases screened out  by OSHA, we obtained documentation for cases screened out in fiscal year 2007  from the five OSHA regional offices we visited. Because this information is not  maintained in a centralized database, we had to manually collect and analyze this  information. For the OALJ and ARB, their databases did not contain information  on outcomes, so we manually reviewed all of the cases decided in fiscal year  2007. Due to the time required to manually review whistleblower case decisions,  we focused our efforts on cases decided during the most recently completed  year, fiscal year 2007."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objective 3: Challenges", "paragraphs": ["To identify the key challenges facing OSHA, we designed and implemented  a Web-based survey to gather information on various aspects of the  investigators\u2019 jobs, and we interviewed key officials. Our survey  population consisted of all OSHA whistleblower investigators across all 10  OSHA regions. The response rate for this survey was 86 percent, with 60  out of a possible 70 respondents completing the survey. The survey asked  a combination of questions that allowed for open-ended and close-ended  responses. Because of potential variation in the investigators\u2019 backgrounds  and years with the program, the instrument was designed so that  investigators were asked to comment only on those questions which were  directly applicable to them. Therefore, the number of survey respondents  for some questions varied, depending on the relevance of the question to  each investigator. We pretested the content and format of the  questionnaire with two investigators. In addition, we asked a program  official to review it for clarity of language and question flow. During the  pretests, we asked questions to determine whether (1) the survey  questions were clear, (2) the terms we used were precise, (3) the  questionnaire did not place an undue burden on the respondents, and (4)  the questions were unbiased. We also assessed the usability of the Web- based format. We received input on the survey and made changes to the  content and format of the final questionnaire based on our pretest results.", "The survey was conducted using self-administered electronic  questionnaires posted on the Web. We sent e-mail notifications to  investigators beginning on February 26, 2008. We then sent each potential  respondent a unique password and user name by e-mail to ensure that only  members of the target population could participate in the appropriate  survey, and we activated the survey on February 27, 2008. To encourage  respondents to complete the questionnaire, we sent e-mail messages to  prompt each nonrespondent approximately 2 weeks and 3 weeks after the  initial e-mail message. We also made follow-up phone calls to potential  respondents from March 20, 2008 to March 26, 2008. We closed the survey  on March 27, 2008, obtaining an 86 percent response rate. Because we  attempted to collect data from every investigator in the population, there  was no sampling error. However, the practical difficulties of conducting  any survey may introduce errors, commonly referred to as nonsampling  errors. For example, differences in how a particular question is  interpreted, the sources of information available to respondents, how the  responses were processed and analyzed, or the types of people who do not  respond can influence the accuracy of the survey results. We took steps in  the development of the survey, the data collection, and the data analysis to  minimize these nonsampling errors and help ensure the accuracy of the  answers that were obtained. For example, a social science survey  specialist designed the questionnaire, in collaboration with GAO staff with  subject matter expertise. Then, as noted earlier, the draft questionnaire  was pretested to ensure that questions were relevant, clearly stated, and  easy to comprehend. The questionnaire was also reviewed by an additional  GAO survey specialist.  Data analysis was conducted by a GAO data  analyst working directly with GAO staff with subject matter expertise. A  second, independent analyst checked all of the computer programs for  accuracy.  Since this was a Web-based survey, respondents entered their  answers directly into electronic questionnaires.  This eliminated the need  to have data keyed into databases, thus removing an additional source of  error. To obtain additional perspectives on the challenges OSHA faces in  administering the whistleblower program, we interviewed key OSHA  officials in headquarters and in all 10 regional offices.", "In our work, we did not assess the adequacy of investigator staffing levels for  meeting current workloads, nor did we assess the quality of the investigations  or the appropriateness of whistleblower outcomes at either the investigation  or the appeals levels because these aspects were beyond the scope of the  current engagement. We conducted this performance audit between  October 2007 and January 2009, in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: OSHA\u2019s 17 Statutes and Their Provisions", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Labor (Labor) is responsible for administering the  whistleblower protection provisions of many different federal statutes.   For 17 of these whistleblower provisions, Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and  Health Administration (OSHA) initially investigates any alleged violations.  The majority of the statutory whistleblower protections are supplemented  by regulations that further clarify and set forth specific requirements for  the whistleblower protection process in the private sector.
