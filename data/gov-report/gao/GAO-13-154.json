Inspections are one means of ensuring safety and compliance with regulations. However, several federal agencies--CDC, APHIS, DOT, DHS, and DOD--conduct such inspections, creating significant potential for overlap and duplication of effort. In this context, GAO was asked to assess (1) the extent of overlap and potential duplication in federal inspections of select agent entities, (2) the costs of such overlap and effects on laboratory operations, and (3) actions to reduce the costs and negative effects of any overlap. To answer these objectives, GAO analyzed agency data, surveyed entities, held focus groups with lab staff, and interviewed agency officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["About 15 percent of entities registered to work with select agents were subject to inspection overlap (multiple federal agencies inspecting within a 2-year period). Entities experiencing overlap tended to be larger ones, with more laboratories, principal investigators, and staff. Although there was overlap between Department of Transportation (DOT) inspections and those of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), they were generally not duplicative because specific inspection activities tended to differ, according to GAO's survey of entities experiencing overlap. For example, DOT inspections tended to focus on transportation issues, such as checking hazardous materials and transportation security plans, rather than general biosafety issues. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Department of Defense (DOD) inspections, however, tended to be more duplicative with those of CDC and APHIS. For example, both review the same documents, require safety and security demonstrations, conduct inventory inspections and personnel interviews, and provide corrective action plans. While inspections are important for safety and compliance, there is no value added when federal agencies are expending resources to conduct the same work and, in some cases, reinspecting before entities have had time to respond to findings from a previous inspection.", "The costs of overlapping federal inspections and effects on lab operations are difficult to quantify because agencies and entities generally do not track them and some costs are not quantifiable. Although GAO could not quantify the portion of federal and entity costs directly attributable to overlap, it could quantify the costs of inspections in general. According to agency data, the approximate overall federal cost for fiscal years 2010 and 2011 inspections was $2.1 million dollars. On average, the entity costs per inspection were nearly $15,000, and staff time per inspection was 380 hours, according to the GAO survey. While surveyed entities reported that inspections can help correct deficiencies and improve accountability, most reported moderate to significant nonquantifiable costs of inspections due to loss of productivity and delays in research. In addition, according to surveyed entities, overlapping inspections negatively affected lab productivity, staff morale, available time to complete research, and the research schedule. Because many of these entities are federal laboratories or are funded through federal grants, these costs are passed on to the federal government.", "Actions to reduce the costs of overlapping and duplicative inspections include better coordination among federal agencies and greater consistency in the application of standards, according to various experts and surveyed entities. CDC has taken actions to better coordinate inspections with other agencies, for example, by increasing the use of joint inspections. But such actions, including joint inspections, do not fully address the negative effects of multiple inspections if agencies apply inconsistent standards and develop separate reports of findings. Well-trained inspectors, who apply consistent standards, are also needed. Collectively, these actions would reduce the negative effects of overlap and duplication and could increase agencies' acceptance of each other's inspection results."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CDC and APHIS work with DHS and DOD to coordinate inspections and ensure consistent application of inspection standards.", "HHS, USDA, DHS, and DOD generally agreed with our recommendations and noted various actions they have already taken, or plan to take, to coordinate inspection efforts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Between fiscal years 2009 and 2011, there were 374 entities registered  with the federal Select Agent Program (SAP) that were home to over  1,900 biosafety laboratories in the federal, academic, and private sectors  across the United States. These laboratories conduct research with  biological agents or toxins, known as \u201cselect agents,\u201d such as anthrax,  which have the potential to severely threaten public health and safety,  animal and plant health, and animal and plant products. Consequently,  these issues are a key concern of entities and federal agencies  conducting, funding, or overseeing select agent work. Inspections are one  mechanism for ensuring that entities registered to work with select agents  comply with Select Agent Regulations (SAR) for biosafety, biosecurity,  and biocontainment. However, there are multiple federal agencies, as  well as state, local, and professional organizations, that currently inspect  these entities, creating the potential for overlap and duplication of effort.", "Various federal agencies have the authority to inspect entities that  possess, use, or transfer select agents. The Department of Agriculture\u2019s  (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the  Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention (CDC) inspect entities under the SAR to ensure  compliance with the SAP.  In addition, the Department of  Transportation\u2019s (DOT) Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety  Administration\u2019s (PHMSA), under DOT\u2019s Hazardous Materials  Regulations, has the authority to regulate the safe and secure  transportation of all hazardous materials. Under the SAR, any entity that  uses, possesses, or transfers select agents must (1) register with CDC or  APHIS and (2) establish and implement plans to ensure the safety and  security of its activities. Prior to issuing a certificate of registration, CDC  and APHIS may inspect and evaluate the premises and records to ensure  compliance with the SAR. In addition, CDC and APHIS may inspect any  site, for compliance and other purposes, where activities regulated by the  SAR are conducted. DOT\u2019s PHMSA also has the authority to perform  inspections pertaining to the transport of biological agents. Other federal  agencies also inspect laboratories that work with select agents, including  the Department of Defense (DOD) and its Army, Navy, and Air Force  Inspector General (IG) offices and the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS). DOD inspects to ensure compliance with federal, DOD, and  military service component requirements as well as contract  requirements. DHS conducts periodic inspections to ensure compliance  with funding requirements of entities for which they have funded research.  These inspections, however, also generally cover compliance with the  SAR. While DOD and DHS inspections assess compliance with the SAR,  these departments do not have authority to regulate all entities  possessing, using, or transferring select agents. Rather, these  departments issue their own agency regulations and directives that allow  them to inspect entities they own or fund (see table 1 for major areas  covered in agencies\u2019 inspections). In addition to these federal agencies,  several others, such as the Occupational Safety and Health  Administration (OSHA), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the  Food and Drug Administration (FDA), may also inspect registered entities  for a variety of reasons, such as ensuring employee safety and health or  compliance with standards for recombinant DNA research. We did not  include them in our review because these inspections generally do not  focus on biosafety and biosecurity issues.", "In March 2011, we issued our first annual report to Congress on federal  programs, agencies, offices, and initiatives, either within departments or  government-wide, that have duplicative goals or activities.

The  number of federal agencies involved in inspections of select agent entities  heightens the potential for overlap and duplication. Moreover, the  increasing number of inspections further increases the potential for  overlap. From fiscal year 2009 through 2011, CDC, APHIS, DOD, DHS,  and DOT collectively conducted over 800 inspections of select agent  entities.", "In this context, you asked us to assess (1) the extent of overlap and  potential duplication in federal agencies\u2019 inspections of entities that work  with select agents, (2) the costs of overlapping federal inspections and  effects on laboratory operations, and (3) actions to reduce the costs and  negative effects of overlapping inspections.", "To answer these objectives, we interviewed agency officials and reviewed  pertinent legislation, regulations, and agency documents. We also  analyzed agency information on inspectors\u2019 total compensation (salary  and benefits), hours spent on inspection activities, the associated travel  costs for inspections for fiscal years 2010 and 2011, and inspection data  to identify entities that had been inspected by more than one agency in a  2-year period (at any point between fiscal years 2009 and 2011). Using  the definition of overlap from our 2011 report, in the context of SAR  inspection requirements, we defined overlap as two or more federal  agencies inspecting the same entity on separate occasions within a 2- year period. Because CDC and APHIS manage the SAP jointly and  conduct joint inspections, where applicable, we collapse these agencies  in reporting on overlap to show where DOT, DHS, or DOD inspections  overlapped with either a CDC or APHIS inspection. We developed a  detailed list of inspection activities and identified duplication where the  two overlapping inspections covered the same activities. From the 374  entities registered to work with select agents between fiscal years 2009  and 2011, we identified entities that had been inspected on separate  occasions by more than one agency in a 2-year period. We then  conducted a web-based survey of all such entities to collect information  on (1) the extent to which there was duplication in specific inspection  activities related to the preparation, execution, and closeout phases of the  two inspections undergone, (2) the costs and operational effects of  inspections, (3) the solutions for mitigating the negative effects of multiple  inspections, and (4) the positive and negative aspects of joint inspections.  Our survey was sent to the responsible official (RO) of each entity that  was subject to overlapping inspections, and we received an 85 percent  response rate. To gather preliminary information and develop our survey,  we conducted focus groups with about 50 laboratory workers from entities  that have experienced federal inspections, including ROs, biosafety  officers, principal investigators, and technical staff from federal,  academic, and private entities that work with select agents. We  interviewed officials with CDC, APHIS, DHS, DOD, and DOT and  examined inspection files to understand general and agency-specific  inspection activities. We also spoke with professional organizations, such  as the American Biological Safety Association (ABSA), the American  Society for Microbiology, and experts in the safety of select agent  laboratories.

While the percentage of entities  affected by inspection overlap was relatively small, the entities affected  tended to be larger ones that work with a greater variety of agents and  with more laboratories, principal investigators, and laboratory staff. For  example, entities with five or more laboratories are more likely to be  subject to overlap than entities with fewer than five laboratories,  controlling for biosafety level (BSL) and the number of agents. Similarly,  entities working with five or more select agents are more likely to be  subject to overlap than entities working with fewer than four select agents,  controlling for the number of laboratories and BSL. As a result, the  overlap affected roughly a third of all laboratories, principal investigators,  and lab staff.

DOT coordinates its inspections with CDC and APHIS under a working  Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), which spells out the framework  and responsibilities for the exchange and protection of information on  transfer of select agents. Under the MOU, CDC and APHIS annually  provide DOT with a list of registered entities that have transferred select  agents during the 12 preceding months. DOT, in turn, notifies CDC and  APHIS of any anticipated inspection of an entity 30 days before the  inspection and also provides them with the inspection results. According  to DOT officials, they try to coordinate joint inspections whenever  possible. After CDC provides a list of scheduled inspections, DOT informs  CDC about which inspections it will join.

Such coordination appears effective,  given survey results of entities that experienced DOT inspections that  overlapped with CDC or APHIS inspections. These entities reported little  duplication in specific activities in the preparation, execution, and closeout  phases of inspections (see table 2). Among the activities that tended to  be duplicative were verifying the medical, security, or other credentials of  inspectors in the preparation phase; participating in interviews with  inspectors in the execution phase; and holding exit conferences with the  inspecting agency in the closeout phase. Among the activities that tended  to be DOT-specific were checking hazardous materials and transportation  security plans and verifying the labeling, testing, and assembly of UN- certified packagings.", "DHS identified 42 government, university, private, and not-for-profit  entities that were receiving DHS funding for work involving select agents.

Of those 19 inspections, 8 were joint inspections, including: 5 joint  inspections with CDC; 1 joint inspection with APHIS; and 2 joint  inspections with both CDC and APHIS. According to DHS officials, there  are numerous reasons for DHS to visit a select agent entity that has also  been inspected by CDC or APHIS. These reasons include, for example,  CDC or APHIS placing the entity on a Performance Improvement Plan or  making substantial recommendations to correct regulatory  noncompliance. If it appears that the compliance issues identified by CDC  or APHIS could affect the DHS program, DHS may also make a site visit  to understand the effect on DHS research and to assist the entity in  mitigating the effect through appropriate corrective action.", "According to DHS officials, their inspections are fundamentally different  from CDC and APHIS inspections. DHS describes its compliance  inspections as broader in some ways than those of CDC or APHIS,  because they are designed to ensure that DHS-sponsored research  activities not only comply with select agent requirements, but with other  relevant regulations and guidelines as well. According to DHS officials,  CDC and APHIS, as regulatory agencies, conduct more comprehensive  inspections at the institutional level. DHS compliance inspections,  however, go beyond compliance with select agent regulations to include  general biosafety, animal care and use, research protocols and  procedures, institutional review and oversight (for example, Institutional  Biosafety Committees), and adherence to best practices. Nevertheless,  survey responses from entities that experienced DHS inspections that  overlapped with CDC or APHIS inspections reported some duplication in  specific activities in the preparation, execution, and closeout phases of  inspections (see table 3). Among the activities that tended to be  duplicative were verifying medical, security, or other credentials of  inspectors and arranging staff availability in the preparation phase;  participating in interviews with inspectors in the execution phase; and  holding exit conferences and developing and implementing corrective  action plans in the closeout phase.", "According to DOD inspection data, the DAIG conducted 16 biosurety  inspections of its Army and contractor-owned entities between fiscal  years 2009 and 2011, 5 of which were conducted jointly with CDC. Of the  16 DAIG inspections, 13 overlapped with an inspection from another  federal agency. The Navy IG conducted one inspection and the Air Force  IG conducted two inspections between 2009 and 2011. These  inspections did not overlap with an inspection from another federal  agency. With respect to specific activities in the preparation, execution,  and closeout phases of inspections, entities that experienced DAIG  inspections that overlapped with CDC or APHIS inspections also reported  substantial duplication in inspection activities (see table 4). Among the  inspection activities that tended to be duplicative were arranging staff  availability in the preparation phase, holding entry meetings and escorting  inspectors in the execution phase, and holding exit conferences in the  closeout phase. However, according to DAIG officials, as required by  Army directives and regulations, its biosurety inspections are more- comprehensive than CDC and APHIS inspections, covering biosafety,  biosecurity, biocontainment, personnel reliability program (PRP),  transportation, occupational medical requirements, and emergency  response exercises. While DAIG officials acknowledge a level of overlap  with CDC and APHIS inspections in terms of verifying compliance with  standards, DOD and the Department of the Army have developed specific  requirements to implement those standards. In addition, until recently,  CDC and APHIS inspections did not look at facility or department-specific  requirements such as PRP.", "DOD-related select agent entities are also subject to inspections and  reviews from internal organizations, which can overlap with inspections  from CDC, APHIS, and the service IGs. For example, in addition to  service IG inspections, DOD entities undergo Biosurety Management  Reviews (SMR) and Biosurety Staff Assistance Visits (SAV). The SMRs  are meant to verify the entity is managing its biosurety program according  to standards. They allow the command to see how the surety program is  being managed and where there may be deficiencies. According to Army  lab officials, however, these inspections tend to be identical to service IG  biological surety inspections. SAVs are an opportunity for the command  to assist in fixing deficiencies or other lacking areas, and usually take  place before another major inspection. SAVs are not biosurety  inspections, nor are they required under DOD regulations. However,  SAVs tend to be treated similarly to service IG inspections, according to  Army lab officials. While SMRs and SAVs may be handled like an  inspection with written reports of perceived deficiencies for which the  entity makes a formal response and corrections for the identified  deficiencies, DOD officials noted that entities may be self-imposing  requirements or practices not required by regulation or the inspecting  agency. As a result, these internal reviews can represent an additional  area of overlap for DOD-owned and DOD-operated entities. For example,  as shown in table 5, an Army entity underwent eight inspections or  reviews, five of which were for compliance with select agent regulations  between fiscal years 2009 and 2011.", "According to an official of this particular Army entity, many of the major  command reviews and visits use up time and resources, fixing issues that  are not value-added, or that are not looked at by other major inspections.  In many cases, inspectors are focusing on minor issues, leaving the  laboratory open for larger deficiencies on the major inspection. According  to the DAIG Chief of Technical Inspections, a major cause of overlapping  internal inspections is that there is no single entity within the DOD  overseeing or coordinating inspections and that each service validates  compliance very differently. The Army requires each major command to  have its own internal biosurety team and, because the entities feel they  should be prepared for higher-level reviews, the teams conduct  inspections in preparation for higher-level inspections. For Army labs, the  DAIG inspects an entity every 2 years, an internal command surety team,  such as ATEC, conducts an SMR every 2 years (alternating with the  DAIG inspection), and SAV reviews may be conducted before any  inspection (DOD or otherwise). In an example of an extreme case, an  Army select agent laboratory that conducts recombinant DNA research  for DHS-funded projects and frequently transfers select agent materials to  collaborators could theoretically be inspected by CDC/APHIS, DAIG, NIH,  DHS, and DOT all within the same year.  This could significantly hinder  critical research productivity at the inspected laboratory because of the  time dedicated to inspections, according to the report of the Working  Group on Strengthening the Biosecurity of the United States. This is  somewhat in contrast with inspections of the two Navy and one Air Force  entities. For example, while the Navy can perform SAVs prior to  inspections, they are not required like Army\u2019s SMRs. In addition, rather  than conducting its own inspection, the Air Force accepts the CDC  inspection results and adds its own PRP review. This limited coordination  among the inspection agencies was noted in the Working Group report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "While Difficult to Quantify, Overlap Adds to the Cost of Inspections and Can Negatively Impact Laboratory Operations", "paragraphs": ["The costs of overlapping federal inspections and effects on lab operations  are difficult to quantify because (1) agencies and entities generally do not  track the costs or effects of inspections and (2) some costs are not  quantifiable. Nevertheless, the costs and effects on lab operations are  significant when considering (1) the cost of inspections to federal  agencies, (2) both the quantifiable and nonquantifiable costs to the entity,  and (3) surveyed entities\u2019 perceptions of the negative effects of  overlapping inspections on lab operations. Although we could not quantify  the portion of federal and entity costs directly attributable to overlap, we  could quantify the costs of inspections in general. For example, we  estimate that for fiscal years 2010 through August 2011, individual  agencies\u2019 total inspection costs ranged from approximately $22,400 to  over $900,000, according to agency data on the hours spent on  inspection activities, inspector compensation (salaries and benefits) per  labor hour, and travel. The approximate overall federal cost for fiscal year  2010 and 2011 inspections was over $2.1 million dollars. On average, the  entity costs per inspection were nearly $15,000 and 380 hours in staff  time, according to our survey. The quantifiable cost of an inspection to a  select agent entity depends on the number of laboratories and select  agents, the complexity of the entity\u2019s mission, its location, and whether it  has a history of problems or violations of select agent regulations. In  inspections of larger entities, there are higher inspection costs and a  greater likelihood for overlap. The costs of overlap are therefore most  likely higher as well. Entities also reported moderate to significant  nonquantifiable costs of inspections when it comes to loss of productivity  and delays in research. While inspections can help entities correct  deficiencies, improve inventory management and accountability, and  justify the need for resources to improve operations, most surveyed  entities reported that overlapping inspections have negative effects on lab  operations. According to surveyed entities, overlapping inspections  negatively affected lab productivity, staff morale, available time to  complete research, and the research schedule. And according to at least  one-fifth of surveyed entities, overlapping inspections negatively affected  the physical viability of inventory, staff retention, and competitiveness for  research funds. Because many of these entities are federal laboratories  or are funded through federal grants, these quantifiable and  nonquantifiable costs are passed on to the federal government."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "While the Cost of Multiple Inspections Is Difficult to Quantify, Data from Inspecting Agencies and Entities Indicate They Are Significant", "paragraphs": ["Obtaining an accurate and complete picture of the costs of multiple  inspections is difficult because entities generally do not track the costs of  inspections and some of those costs are nonquantifiable. Nonetheless,  federal agencies do incur quantifiable costs, including salaries, travel, and  training of inspectors, and must purchase inspection equipment and pay  staff to engage in inspection activities as opposed to research or other  routine activities. Entities may also incur nonquantifiable costs of multiple  inspections, such as loss of productivity, delays, and decreased time  available to complete research. In addition, because many of these  entities are federally owned or funded, some portion of this cost is passed  on to the federal government. These costs are affected by the number of  inspectors, the time spent on an inspection, and the size of the entity  being inspected. The larger the entity\u2014in terms of laboratories, staff,  and select agent research\u2014the greater the cost of inspections. Given that  inspections cost more for larger entities and overlap occurs more often for  larger entities, the cost of overlap is greater than it would be if it were  evenly distributed across entities of various sizes.", "The approximate direct federal cost for fiscal years 2010 and 2011  inspections was over $2.1 million, ranging from approximately $22,400 at  DOT to over $900,000 at CDC, according to agency data on the hours  spent on inspection activities, inspector compensation (salaries and  benefits) per labor hour, and travel. Specifically, APHIS\u2019s total labor,  travel, and other costs for inspections were $265,792; DOD\u2019s costs were  $697,744; DOT\u2019s costs in 2010 were approximately $22, 444; and CDC\u2019s  costs were $903,475 (see table 6 for agency inspection costs). DHS  estimates their inspection costs at about $250,000 for the 2-year period.  Although we did not estimate indirect costs, the federal government also  incurs costs from inspections because many select agent entities are  either federally owned or funded. Consequently, the costs to entities,  described in the sections below, also accrue to the federal government.", "The cost of inspections to entities is also difficult to accurately determine  because entities generally do not track inspection cost. However,  according to focus group participants and entities we surveyed, entities  do incur quantifiable and nonquantifiable costs with each inspection,  some of which can be significant. Focus group participants and surveyed  entities reported quantifiable costs, such as purchasing inspection  equipment and salaries for staff involved in preparing for, carrying out,  and responding to an inspection. Entities also reported less-easily  measured, nonquantifiable costs, such as loss of productivity, delays, and  decreased time to complete research, as well as loss of specimen viability  from repeated thawing and freezing.", "Staff time and lab resources are required for inspections, and that burden  is increased with overlapping inspections. The actual cost of an  inspection to a select agent entity will depend on the number of  laboratories and select agents, the complexity of the entity\u2019s mission, its  location, and whether it has a history of problems or violations of select  agent regulations. However, because overlap in inspections tends to  occur more often for larger entities, the overall costs of overlap for these  laboratories are likely higher as well. Entities that experienced an  overlapping inspection spent, on average, 380 hours and nearly $15,000  in staff time to engage in a federal inspection, according to survey data on  the number of hours spent to prepare for, carry out, and close out  inspections and the hourly salaries of laboratory staff involved (see table  7 for average costs across occupational groups). See app. I for an  explanation of how we calculated these costs.", "Much of the time spent on inspections takes place in the preparation  phase, according to focus groups of lab staff. For example, staff from  Army laboratories noted that there is a period of 3 to 4 months of intense  preparation for DAIG inspections and months of follow-up. During the  preparation phase, lab staff perform numerous activities, including  updating standard operating procedures and other documents and  records; verifying inspectors\u2019 health records and clearances; turning in  unused equipment; holding meetings to prepare for the inspection;  checking chemicals and agents in inventory; checking lab equipment; and  inspecting, cleaning and painting floors, walls, and desk space. According  to some focus group participants, in the weeks preceding an inspection,  research is suspended and all staff time is directed toward inspection  efforts. Scheduling for inspections can also create conflicts because  experiments must be scheduled around the inspection, and key staff must  be available during the inspection, regardless of personal plans or  schedule.", "During the inspection, lab staff are involved in activities that take time and  resources. For example, staff conduct safety training for inspectors (how  to wear safety suits and respirators and blood-borne pathogen and  internal requirement training), issue safety equipment to the inspectors,  clear inspectors through security, and provide escorts for inspectors.  Safety equipment, such as personal protective equipment (PPE), gowns,  and footies are provided to inspectors at the entities\u2019 expense, and these  costs increase with larger inspection parties and when there is overlap  because the equipment can not be shared or reused. Staff time for  escorts can be significant in some cases. For example, Army lab  inspection teams can have as many as 20 personnel and stay as long as  2 weeks. According to one Army laboratory, it spent more than 7,305  labor hours in activities related to preparing for, executing, and  responding to six inspections during 2009 at a cost of $350,640. During  2010, the laboratory estimated it spent 4,082 hours on these activities for  three inspections, at a cost of $195,456. In addition, when joint  inspections take place, the size of the inspection team may be too large  for some entities to manage. For example, according to one survey  respondent, the entity requested DHS and CDC not conduct a joint  inspection because the inspection teams are too large to handle at one  time. According to another survey respondent, the respondent\u2019s  laboratory had to arrange for additional personnel to escort large teams of  inspectors for multiple inspections. Laboratories also spend time and  resources in the closeout phase of the inspection. For example, upper- level staff attend meetings to discuss inspection results, and staff time  and effort are required to respond to oral and written findings that may  change or be added to even after the completion of the inspection. Of  particular concern was that frequent inspections keep lab staff in a  constant mode of preparing for the next inspection while responding to  the last one, inhibiting their ability to respond to inspection findings and  conduct research.", "Laboratories also incur nonquantifiable costs from inspections, which can  be exacerbated by overlapping inspections. While these costs tend to be  small, according to most surveyed entities, for some they can be  moderate to significant when it comes to loss of productivity, decreased  time available to complete research, and delays (see table 8). Other costs  noted by surveyed entities include stress and anxiety for lab staff,  contractor and overtime costs, HVAC and equipment testing costs, and  loss of focus and manufacturing time.", "Focus group participants noted a variety of nonquantifiable costs, such as  the loss of productivity, recertifying equipment or bringing it offline for  inspection, and loss of agent viability from repeated thawing and freezing  of agents. Although only 5 (11 percent) of surveyed entities reported that  reduced viability of inventory was a moderate to significant cost, a  preliminary study at the Dugway Army Proving Ground on the viability of  agent vials that had undergone multiple inspections found reductions in  agent viability, with a 100 percent loss of viability in a few cases. While  the costs of reduced or lost viability are difficult to determine, a strain that  existed in only a single vial would be impossible to replace. Furthermore,  loss of agent viability can damage research opportunities and  experimental findings.", "Focus group participants also noted that multiple inspections reduce an  entity\u2019s competitiveness for grant money, although most surveyed entities  found this a negligible cost. In addition, inspection time must be factored  into grant proposals. And because inspections affect the research cycle,  the time it takes to complete research and the overall costs of the  research increase when entities experience multiple inspections. For  example, some participants noted the costs of their entity\u2019s grant  proposals are higher than others\u2019 because of the \u201coverhead\u201d costs they  must build in for their multiple biosafety and biosecurity inspections. In  addition, the time to conduct research is affected when laboratories have  to suspend research for inspections. Undergoing multiple inspections  exacerbates this problem. Some participants noted that the granting  community knows that if laboratories are frequently inspected, the work  will not get done by the desired deadlines, affecting the communities\u2019  willingness to award grants to these entities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "While Multiple Inspections Can Improve Lab Operations, They Can Also Negatively Impact Lab Operations", "paragraphs": ["Inspections are essential in ensuring biosafety and biosecurity  requirements are met and SAR regulations are followed.

Both the HHS-USDA Trans-Federal Task Force  and the Executive Order Working Group on Strengthening the Biosecurity  of the United States recommended enhancing the coordination of  biosafety oversight activities, including inspections. In addition, our earlier  work on select agent laboratories recommended a single coordinating  agency as a means to improve coordination. Accordingly, CDC and  APHIS have taken steps to better coordinate inspections with other  agencies, for example, by increasing the use of joint inspections, signing  MOUs for sharing inspection information with other agencies, establishing  an inspector training program for federal partners, and developing a  common \u201cplaybook\u201d for inspection of registered entities. Such  coordination efforts are important steps in reducing overlap and  duplication. However, MOUs and joint inspections may not fully address  the negative effects of overlap and duplication if inspectors are still  applying standards inconsistently and preparing separate reports of  findings. Specifically, according to surveyed entities, standards must be  applied more consistently between agencies and from one inspection to  another. It is this inconsistent application of standards that exacerbates  the negative effects, including costs, of overlapping inspections.  According to surveyed entities, the most effective actions for greater  consistency in the application of standards include (1) ensuring inspectors  are well trained and experienced, (2) establishing a single set of  inspection standards that all agencies accept, (3) providing an opportunity  to discuss, clarify, and rebut inspection findings, and (4) training  inspectors to one set of standards with requirements for noncompliance  findings (see table 10). Well-trained inspectors, who are able to apply  consistent standards, would reduce the negative effects of overlapping  inspections. In particular, they might reduce overlap by allowing federal  agencies to accept each other\u2019s inspection results. Such a result is  facilitated by joint training, according to DOD officials. Without a  consistent standard, however, highly trained inspectors would not be  effective, according to some surveyed entities. In addition, according to  most surveyed entities, a 3-year federal inspection cycle for select agent  entities was reasonable. Focus group participants also suggested  options for minimizing the potential for overlapping or duplicative  inspections and the associated burden, such as having a single  inspecting agency whose findings are accepted by all other agencies and  improving the knowledge and skills of inspectors.", "In addition to scaled responses, surveyed entities provided written  suggestions for reducing the negative effects of multiple inspections.  While several entities expressed support for a single inspecting agency or  joint inspections, others felt that addressing overlap alone would be  insufficient when the same agency applies different standards in each  inspection. In support of inspections being conducted by a single agency,  entities noted that at least the inconsistent application of standards across  agencies and frustration over trying to comply with two different agency  regulations would be minimized. Surveyed entities highlighted the  inherent conflict that arises when agencies come to different conclusions  about an entity\u2019s compliance. For example, one noted that because there  is no agency \u201cin complete control,\u201d entities cannot determine which  agency is correct when there is conflict in inspection reports. And a DOD  entity wondered about the implication for CDC\u2014which approved the SAP  registration\u2014if DAIG recommends the shutdown of a lab. While some  thought an independent agency or an inspection czar would be a useful  neutral party, others expressed concern that such an entity would just add  another level of bureaucracy or require unnecessary new legislation.  Because of entities\u2019 familiarity with CDC, one noted that they would not  want to have a single agency unless it was CDC. However, another noted  it was uncertain how useful a single agency with authority to audit would  be because there would be a period of mixed messages while each  agency has its say. And so far, the entity had not seen government  agencies \u201cplay well together as a team.\u201d", "In addition, while some thought joint inspections might address the  negative effects of overlap, others thought they would exacerbate the  problem because agency coordination\u2014in terms of consistent  interpretations and applications of standards\u2014was still a concern. In  support of joint inspections, some felt they facilitated agency coordination  and reduced duplication. Others noted that joint inspections are a better  use of time and resources, reducing disruption and burden. In addition,  joint inspections could help bring more uniformity and clarity for the  inspection agencies and entities. For example, according to DAIG  officials, they have taken steps to address these issues in joint  inspections with CDC and APHIS. During joint inspections, the agencies  discuss and resolve differences of interpretation so there is one  \u201cinspector\u201d face to the inspected facility, and except for major findings,  DAIG does not duplicate the findings of the other agency. However,  noting recent inspections by two different agencies, one entity reported  that having them at the same time would have made the inspection longer  and more grueling. Joint inspections also require the entity to provide  escorts and enough PPE for everyone entering the facility, a large  expense when considering how many PPEs and escorts are needed for  some joint inspections. In addition, (1) combined inspections may still  result in multiple reports the entity must respond to and (2) having two  teams do what a single team can do is still an additional burden on the  taxpayer. Nonetheless, the burden that results from inconsistent  application of standards could be minimized if agencies (1) conducting  joint inspections issued a single report of findings or (2) instead of  conducting a separate or joint inspection, accepted each others\u2019  inspection findings in lieu of conducting their own inspections."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Training to Consistently Apply Standards Is Needed", "paragraphs": ["Regardless of whether a single agency is responsible or joint inspections  are conducted, numerous respondents focused on the need for consistent  application of standards by well-trained inspectors. Respondents\u2019  concerns focused on the inconsistent application of standards that can  occur, not only between agencies, but from one inspection to another.  While the problem may be exacerbated by overlapping inspections, the  burden results from inconsistency, not overlap per se. For example, one  entity noted that the biggest problem with multiple inspections by different  agencies is that each has its own agenda, so establishing inspection  standards that are accepted by all agencies would have the greatest  effect on reducing the negative effects of multiple inspections. Another  noted that a common set of requirements and interpretations would  significantly reduce variation in compliance assessments. Reflecting on  the additional burden to Army laboratories, one entity noted, \u201cIdeally the  set of standards that would be accepted would be the same federal  standard that all organizations, not only DOD organizations, would be  held to. This would not only reduce the burden of multiple inspections but  also level the playing field between DOD and academia which would  increase collaboration between laboratories.\u201d Some noted that this might  facilitate sufficient trust for agencies to accept each other\u2019s inspection  results. If all inspections were based on the same standard, with a  checklist to keep them consistent, and all inspectors were trained  together and required to use the published standard and checklist, the  need for multiple inspections would be decreased or eliminated. Despite  the support for greater consistency, some cautioned against the  application of a \u201cchecklist mentality.\u201d For example, one surveyed entity  noted that too many inspectors for their select agent program had been  rigid and unbending, sticking to a checklist rather than common sense.  Training can support efforts to consistently apply standards, while still  allowing the flexibility for inspectors to have essential discussions with  entities to establish rapport, exchange information, and understand why  certain procedures and policies are in place in any given facility.", "Surveyed entities offered a variety of other suggestions, such as (1)  limiting the number of inspectors and days for inspections; (2)  streamlining inspections, including the number of inspectors on the team,  and coordinating areas of focus within the team to lessen the burden on  the laboratories; (3) having an advisory group of ROs to give feedback to  the inspection agency, regulatory agency, or GAO; (4) dividing inspection  elements among the inspecting agencies, on the basis of their strengths;  (5) staffing inspection teams for consistency and historical knowledge; (6)  training all inspectors together to help ensure consistent inspections; and  (7) giving entities credit for moving in the right direction. While none of the  written comments suggested reducing the inspection cycle, almost half of  surveyed entities noted that a 3-year federal inspection cycle for select  agent laboratories was reasonable. The agencies have taken some steps  to address these concerns. For example, after we had initiated our work,  CDC and APHIS convened an Interagency Working Group that includes  representatives from DHS and DOD, as well as other federal agencies.  So that effective oversight can be achieved with minimal disruption, the  working group is developing procedures and policies to better coordinate  the inspections of entities that are federally owned or funded, improve  information sharing between agencies, and implement other activities. For  example, the working group has initiated a joint inspection program  through which it has, so far, conducted 24 joint inspections. In addition, it  has MOUs with DHS and DOD to share inspection data and an inspector-  training program to provide the knowledge, skills, and experience to  federal agencies to enable them to conduct \u201cinternal\u201d inspections of  registered entities they own or fund or to conduct joint inspections with  CDC or APHIS."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Inspections are important for safety and compliance and can help  improve laboratory procedures, infrastructure, and security.

While one  could argue that more-frequent inspections might be necessary to better  ensure safety\u2014in particular for larger entities\u2014there is no apparent  value-added when specific inspection activities are duplicative and occur,  in some cases, before entities have had time to respond to findings from  a previous inspection. In addition, most surveyed entities reported a  federal inspection schedule of once every 3 years was reasonable; more  frequent\u2014especially duplicative\u2014inspections waste federal dollars and  can negatively affect lab operations. This effect on lab operations also  wastes federal dollars because many of the laboratories are federally  funded through grants or appropriations. To improve interagency  coordination and reduce the potential for overlap and unnecessary  duplication, a single coordinating agency could be helpful. Such a  coordinating agency need not be responsible for conducting all  inspections. Rather, where agencies can demonstrate that they meet  SAR standards for their inspections, their inspections could be used in  lieu of other agency inspections. Currently, the primary agencies with  regulatory authority, CDC and APHIS, have taken steps toward better  coordination through the interagency working group. However, CDC and  APHIS have not been officially charged with overseeing or coordinating  all inspection efforts and the other federal agencies may still inspect an  entity regardless of how recently another agency has conducted an  inspection. Moreover, consistent application of inspection standards\u2014 both across and within the agencies\u2014is needed to reduce the negative  effects of multiple inspections on lab operations.

HHS stated that it  already has a number of activities underway related to reducing overlap  and duplication in inspections. Specifically, through the working group for  Optimizing the Security of Biological Select Agents and Toxins in the  United States, HHS\u2019s Federal Select Agent Program has developed  procedures and policies to better coordinate inspections of federally  owned or funded entities and to improve information sharing between  departments and agencies.

Specifically, DHS signed  an MOU with CDC and APHIS that outlines how the parties will  coordinate joint inspections in order to reduce the burden on entities and  to facilitate coordination of oversight efforts between the agencies. In line  with our recommendations, DHS now accepts the results of inspections  conducted jointly with CDC or APHIS instead of conducting independent  inspections or generating a DHS-specific report of findings. DHS has also  taken advantage of cross-agency training to ensure consistent application  of biosafety, biosecurity, and biocontainment inspection standards.", "In its written comments, reproduced in appendix VI, DOD agreed with our  recommendations. DOD noted that certain DOD regulations require  compliance inspections for areas, such as the personnel reliability  program (PRP), that are in addition to the SAR. We recognize some  requirements are agency-specific and do not suggest that they be  eliminated. We do recommend, however, that the burden on entities be  reduced through coordination with other SAR inspection activities.  In line  with our recommendations, we are encouraged that DOD has several  initiatives to coordinate with CDC and APHIS to reduce overlap and  duplication of inspections.  For example, the Army and Navy have signed  information sharing memorandums of agreement and understanding with  CDC and APHIS to coordinate inspections of select agent agencies,  through which they conducted the first CDC, DOD, and Army joint  inspection in spring 2011. Although the Air Force does not have an MOU  with CDC or APHIS for its one facility, it accepts the CDC inspection  results and performs its own PRP inspection. During joint inspections,  DOD notes that it develops an inspection plan with CDC, APHIS, and the  entity, and coordinates with the agencies to minimize entries into  inspected areas by inspecting an area together. While two separate  reports are written, the DAIG notes that it generally does not replicate  CDC findings of noncompliance with SAR standards.  Findings are  discussed to ensure a common understanding of the standards and what  was observed, and to delineate between what is required by the SAR,  DOD, and DAIG.  While DOD notes that it is unclear whether it would or  could accept a CDC or APHIS inspection report in lieu of its own  inspection, these joint efforts are still new and the issue will evolve with  further collaboration. Additionally, DOD is revising its biological and  chemical agent security policies in order to harmonize them with the  recently revised SAR. DOD also noted other steps it has taken to  coordinate oversight efforts though the Working Group, such as  developing the charter and implementation plan for the current federal  \u201cjoint\u201d inspections process, and developing tools, such as the inspector  training program and playbook, to administer the joint inspection process.

Specifically, we analyzed fiscal year 2009 through July  2011 inspection data from CDC, APHIS, DHS, DOD, and DOT, and  identified any instances where two different agencies had inspected the  same entity on separate occasions within 2 years of each other. We  counted joint inspections as a single inspection in our analysis, regardless  of the agencies involved. For example, joint APHIS/DHS inspections or  CDC/DAIG inspections were counted as one inspection. We chose the 2- year time frame because the Select Agent Regulations (SAR) require  certification renewal every 3 years and it is the policy of CDC and APHIS  to inspect the entity before recertifying, this represents a somewhat  conservative measure of overlap. Because CDC and APHIS manage the  Select Agent Program (SAP) jointly and conduct joint inspections, where  applicable, we collapse these agencies in reporting on overlap to show  where DOT, DHS, or DOD inspections overlapped with either a CDC or  APHIS inspection. We also relied on our 2011 report for our definition of  duplication\u2014when two or more agencies or programs are engaged in the  same activities or provide the same services to the same beneficiaries.  The entities experiencing overlap were identified from the population of  374 entities registered with CDC or APHIS at any point in the 3-year  period. Some entities register and de-register each year, so the number  of entities registered at any point in the 3-year period will differ from a  single point-in-time number of registered entities. Using the number of  entities registered at any point in the 3-year period, the extent of overlap  as we have defined it is 15 percent. To estimate the likelihood that an  entity would experience overlap in federal inspections, we developed a  logistic regression model, using the following entity characteristics: the  number of laboratories, the highest biosafety level (BSL) of laboratories  within an entity, and the number of different select agents the entity works  with. The model did not include the number of staff or the number of  principal investigators, both of which are strongly correlated with the  number of laboratories. We chose to include the number of laboratories in  the model because it was a stronger predictor of the likelihood, on the  basis of the Wald chi-squared test, than these two characteristics.", "To assess the extent of duplication in the overlapping inspections, we  surveyed the 55 entities that had been inspected by more than one  agency in a 2-year period (that is, the population experiencing overlap).  The web-based survey of all such entities gathered information on the (1)  extent to which there was duplication in specific inspection activities  related to the preparation, execution, and close-out phases of the two  inspections the entities had undergone, (2) costs and operational effects  of inspections, (3) solutions for mitigating the negative effects of multiple  inspections, and (4) positive and negative aspects of joint inspections  (see app. II for a copy of the survey).The survey was sent to the RO of  each entity, and we received an 86 percent response rate, with 47 of the  55 entities responding. To gather preliminary information and develop our  survey, we conducted focus groups with about 50 laboratory workers from  entities that have experienced federal inspections, including responsible  officials, biosafety officers, principal investigators, and technical staff from  federal, academic, and private entities that work with select agents. To  understand general and agency specific inspection activities, we  interviewed inspectors with CDC, APHIS, DHS, DOD service IGs, and  DOT and examined inspection files. We also spoke with professional  organizations such as the ABSA and the American Society for  Microbiology and experts in the safety of select agent laboratories.", "We took several steps to ensure the reliability of survey responses and  the analytical process. To ensure the content and wording of the survey  were clear, accurate, unbiased, and nonburdensome, we solicited  subject-matter expert reviews from affected agencies (CDC, APHIS,  DAIG, and PHMSA), an interest group (ABSA), and an internal (GAO)  survey expert. We also pretested the survey with lab staff from a variety  of laboratories, including an Army lab, an academic lab, a private lab, and  a large federal lab. The survey was deployed through the web, and each  respondent had a unique user identification and password. To increase  the response rate, follow-up e-mail and telephone calls were made to  nonrespondents. Once we had reached an 80 percent response rate, we  reviewed responses for (1) item nonresponse, (2) obvious errors or  outliers in responses, and (3) \u201cno\u201d answers to question 1. We then  followed up with respondents, as necessary, to get additional information  and clarification. Changes identified through this process were recorded,  and appropriate response cleaning was conducted in the analysis. To  eliminate data-processing errors, the computer program that generated  the survey results was independently verified by an internal SAS expert  who was not involved in the engagement.", "To assess the costs of overlapping federal inspections and the effects on  laboratory operations, we (1) analyzed agency budget data and (2)  gathered data from focus groups and our survey of entities on the costs  and effects of inspections. Specifically, to assess the costs to the federal  government, we requested information on the government and contracted  staff involved in inspections and their total compensation (salary and  benefits), the number of hours spent on inspection activities, and the  associated travel costs for inspections for fiscal years 2010 and 2011.  DHS was unable to provide detailed cost data as requested because their  inspections of select agent laboratories are provided under a contract that  does not identify labor hours, hourly contract rates, salaries, and benefits.  But DHS did provide an estimate of the cost of inspections for fiscal years  2010 and 2011. This estimate was based on assumptions about typical  staffing levels and costs for the most-common types of inspections,  multiplied by the number of inspections conducted in each fiscal year.  While DHS believes these estimations include travel costs, they do not  include training costs. DOT was not able to provide cost data that include  travel, because their system does not distinguish between inspection  travel and other travel. As a result, DOT inspection amounts reflect only  compensation costs. To assess the reliability of agency data on the costs  of inspections, we provided the agencies with a detailed data-collection  instrument with specific data requests and precalculated formulas. We  reviewed the data for obvious errors, compared these data with cost data  from earlier fiscal years, and followed up with officials to discuss data  reliability, significant changes across fiscal years, obvious errors, or  omissions. We determined these data were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes, which was to provide the approximate aggregate federal costs  of inspections for the four agencies.", "To assess the costs to entities, we asked surveyed entities to provide  labor and cost information about the most recent inspection identified in  our overlap analysis (see app. II, question 6, for specific wording).  Specifically, we requested data for five occupational groups that tend to  be involved in federal inspections, including (1) ROs and Alternate  Responsible Officials, (2) Principal Investigators, (3) owners or  controllers, (4) laboratory staff, and (5) support staff (security,  administrative, maintenance, and information technology). We asked  entities to provide the number of staff involved and the total labor hours  spent by each occupational group, as well as the average salary for each  group. We used these data to develop overall averages of the personnel  and labor costs entities experience as a result of inspections by each one  of the five federal agencies in our review. For data reliability purposes, we  checked for outliers or obvious errors and followed up where such issues  were identified. We calculated the average cost of an inspection by  dividing the average (yearly) salary by 2080 to get an hourly rate, and  then multiplied that by the number of labor hours provided. We also  surveyed entities about nonquanitifable costs and the operational effects  of multiple inspections and analyzed comments related to costs from our  focus groups of lab staff.", "To assess actions to reduce the costs and negative effects of overlapping  inspections, we interviewed agency officials and interest groups, reviewed  key reports addressing the issue, and analyzed comments related to  solutions from our focus groups of lab staff. In addition, in our survey, we  sought entities\u2019 opinions about solutions for overlapping inspections,  including their experiences with joint inspections, which have been  proposed as a solution for minimizing inspection duplication.", "We conducted our work from March 2011 through January 2013 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
