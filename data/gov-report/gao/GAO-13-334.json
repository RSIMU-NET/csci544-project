About 91 percent were subject to an IPPS payment adjustment or were excluded from the IPPS entirely. Most hospitals, over 63 percent, qualified for at least one of four categories of increased payment, with DSH payments being the most common. Under the CAH program, 28 percent of hospitals were exempt from the IPPS. The remaining hospitals, 9 percent, received IPPS payments that were unadjusted for the modifications included in GAO's review.

To help  control the growth of hospital spending, give hospitals an incentive to  provide care efficiently, and ensure beneficiary access to care, Congress  created the inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS) in 1983. Under  this system, Medicare pays hospitals a flat fee per stay, set in advance,  with different amounts for each type of condition. These payment rates  are also influenced by such factors as the relative hourly wage in the area  where the hospital is located and whether the hospital qualifies for  additional payments.

Specifically, Congress may allow hospitals meeting  certain criteria to receive additional Medicare payments, and may revise  some of the qualification criteria to enable more hospitals to benefit. For  example, legislation has extended statutory provisions set to expire, or  allowed certain hospitals to continue receiving additional payments after  qualifying criteria have changed, through grandfathering. Often such  efforts were intended to ensure beneficiary access to care or to help  hospitals recruit and retain physicians and other medical professionals.  However, some Medicare payment experts have expressed concerns  about exceptions to the IPPS, extensions of certain provisions, and other  forms of payment adjustments.

We found that the states with the largest  percentage of hospitals designated as CAHs are North Dakota and  Montana, with about 84 percent and 79 percent, respectively. (See fig. 5.)  Furthermore, according to MedPAC, 17 percent of CAHs are 35 or more  miles from the nearest hospital, 67 percent are between 15 miles and   35 miles from the nearest hospital, and 16 percent of CAHs are fewer  than 15 miles from the nearest hospital. These data indicate that not all  CAHs meet current qualifying criteria.", "Section 1109 of HCERA authorized $400 million in Medicare payments to  qualifying hospitals in low-spending counties over 2 years, fiscal year  2011 and fiscal year 2012. This provision defined qualifying hospitals as  acute care hospitals located in a county that ranked within the lowest  quartile of age, sex, and race adjusted spending per beneficiary enrolled  in fee-for-service Medicare parts A and B. CMS allocated the additional  payments to each qualifying hospital in proportion to its share of Medicare  inpatient payments for all qualifying hospitals, based on fiscal year 2009  IPPS payments for operating expenses. In implementing this provision,", "CMS made payments to about 400 hospitals, which accounted for   11 percent of all IPPS hospitals and approximately 8 percent of IPPS  beds;", "Medicare expenditures increased $150 million in fiscal year 2011 and  $250 million in fiscal year 2012; on average, qualifying hospitals had 135 to 137 beds; half of qualifying hospitals were in urban areas and half were in rural  states with the most hospitals receiving this payment were New York  (50 hospitals), Wisconsin (40 hospitals), Virginia (31 hospitals),  Oregon (21 hospitals), and Iowa (20 hospitals)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "IPPS Payment Adjustments or Exclusions Affected Nearly All Hospitals", "paragraphs": ["We found that, in 2012, payment adjustments to, or exclusions from, the  IPPS affected nearly all of the 4,783 hospitals in our review. Of these  hospitals\u2014IPPS hospitals and CAHs\u201491 percent were subject to a  payment adjustment under the IPPS or were excluded from the IPPS  entirely. Specifically,", "3,039 hospitals, or over 63 percent, qualified for at least one of the  following four types of payment adjustments under the IPPS: a DSH  adjustment, an IME adjustment, a wage index adjustment, or a rural  provider type adjustment for an RRC, SCH, or MDH designation;", "1,328 hospitals, or about 28 percent, qualified as CAHs, excluding  them from the IPPS; and", "416 hospitals, or about 9 percent, received IPPS payments that were  unadjusted for the modifications included in our review.", "Among the 3,455 IPPS hospitals, the vast majority qualified for one of the  four categories of upward payment adjustment in 2012. The DSH  adjustment had the broadest reach, affecting payments to about 4 in 5 of  IPPS hospitals. Nearly 1 in 3 hospitals qualified for an IME adjustment, 1  in 3 qualified for a wage index adjustment, and almost 1 in 5 received a  rural provider type adjustment. Each of these categories of increased  payment benefited hospitals in both urban and rural areas. The DSH and  IME adjustments applied mostly to urban hospitals\u2019 payments, whereas  the wage index adjustment was applied to more rural hospitals\u2019  payments. Although rural provider type adjustments generally supported  payment to rural hospitals, about 20 percent of recipients were urban  hospitals. (See table 1.)", "Among the 3,039 IPPS hospitals receiving additional payment, the  majority qualified for more than one category of payment adjustment. In  2012, roughly half of IPPS hospitals received two forms of adjustments  and 13 percent qualified for three forms of adjustments. Two percent of  IPPS hospitals qualified for four forms of adjustments, but no state had  more than 10 hospitals qualifying for four forms of increased payment.  The remaining IPPS hospitals, almost a third of the total, qualified for a  DSH adjustment alone. By location, we found that most hospitals in urban  areas qualified for one or two forms of increased payment, whereas most  hospitals in rural areas qualified for two or more forms of additional pay.  (See fig. 6.)", "Of the 416 hospitals that did not qualify for IPPS payment adjustments,  nearly all were in urban areas and were distributed across most states.  Generally, they were substantially smaller than the average urban  hospital, typically having 98 beds compared to 224 beds.", "The multiple types of adjustments to Medicare payments vary in their  financial effect, and can substantially affect a hospital\u2019s revenue. Take, for  example, a beneficiary who undergoes coronary bypass surgery with  angioplasty and has a major complication or comorbidity. When this  surgery is performed at a teaching hospital in a large urban area that  treats a high percentage of low-income patients, the total operating  payment from Medicare comes to about $63,600. Specifically, in fiscal  year 2013, the IPPS operating base rate for that case, adjusted for the  local wage index, is approximately $41,500. Added to that amount is  about $14,100 for IME and roughly $8,000 for Medicare DSH. Thus, the  two payment adjustments increase the amount this hospital would receive  for this discharge by more than 50 percent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["The IPPS streamlines how Medicare pays hospitals and gives hospitals  an incentive to economize by paying a fixed amount, set in advance. Over  time, however, numerous statutory provisions have been enacted that  provide, grandfather, or extend additional payments to IPPS hospitals or  exclude a substantial number of hospitals from the IPPS altogether. This  piecemeal approach to modifying the original IPPS\u2014a patchwork of  individual \u201cfixes\u201d\u2014has had the cumulative effect of most hospitals  receiving modifications and add-ons to the basic payment formula that  increase Medicare spending. In fact, over 90 percent of hospitals were  subject to either IPPS payment adjustments or exemptions in 2012.  These changes address characteristics of the hospital market such as  competition for labor, challenges to rural hospitals, and the need to  support Medicare-participating hospitals in certain markets. In addition,  organizations such as IOM and MedPAC have recently made  recommendations to strengthen the data used in geographic adjustments,  and to hone the targeting of rural special payment adjustments. Taken  together, these findings and recommendations suggest that, 30 years  after the IPPS was implemented, the way Medicare currently pays  hospitals may no longer ensure that the goals of the payment system\u2014 cost control, efficiency, and access\u2014are being met."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["HHS reviewed a draft of this report and did not have any general  comments.
