Recent  efforts by the Congress and the executive branch to prohibit the use of  certain telecommunications equipment and services produced or provided  by specific foreign vendors highlight concerns about federal contracting  for telecommunications.

For example,  BLS officials said the move toward newer technologies, such as satellite  transmissions, has had an adverse impact on employment. Additionally,  representatives of a major telecommunications contractor told us that  technological advances either resulted in fewer employees being needed  to perform specific functions or replaced previous manual operations with  automated processes. In addition, the representatives stated that uses of  artificial intelligence, such as smart networks and machine learning,  facilitate tasks that in the past relied extensively on human labor.

Although U.S. employment in  telecommunications has declined, the role of offshoring as a potential  contributor to the decline is unclear, due to a lack of data and because  offshoring is one of many factors that can affect employment levels.  According to BLS officials, no public or private data exist that estimate the  extent of offshoring in this or any industry sector.

Specifically, we selected (1) the Department of Defense  (DOD) because it obligated the highest amount for telecommunications  contracts; (2) the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)  because it obligated the highest amount for call center contracts; and (3)  the General Services Administration (GSA), which is among the top ten  agencies with the highest amounts for telecommunications contracts,  because it provides a government-wide contract available for agencies to  place orders for telecommunications and call centers. We then identified  the component within each agency that obligated the most for these  services or that provides a large government-wide contract vehicle. The  components were DOD\u2019s Defense Information Systems Agency, GSA\u2019s  Federal Acquisition Service, and HHS\u2019s Center for Medicare and  Medicaid Services (CMS). We selected contracts that included a large  call center and a large government-wide telecommunications contract  vehicle. We also selected a variety of telecommunications contracts that  were among the highest obligations during fiscal years 2014 through  2018, and represented different types of telecommunications services  procured during the period, such as wired and wireless services. Table 2  provides a synopsis of the 5 contracts included in our review.", "We reviewed documentation from the five selected contracts, along with  the relevant federal acquisition regulations for worker protections, data  security and privacy protections, subcontracting, and offshoring. We  interviewed cognizant contracting officials to clarify our understanding of  the contract requirements we identified related to worker protection and  data security and privacy protections. We also met with representatives  from three contractors to obtain their insights into contracting with the  government, relevant contract requirements, and industry trends. The  purpose of our contract review was to illustrate the different worker  protections and data security and privacy protections that may be  included in these types of contracts.", "To address the employment trends in telecommunications and call  centers and how they were affected by offshoring, we reviewed  employment data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages  published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) within the Department  of Labor. The Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages program  publishes a quarterly count of employment and wages reported by  employers that covers more than 95 percent of U.S. jobs and is supported  by quarterly reports from all private sector employers. We also reviewed  data from BLS\u2019 employment projections program, which draws from  several BLS data collections as well as interviews with industry specialists  and reviews of relevant articles to develop information about the labor  market for the nation as a whole for 10 years in the future. In addition, we  reviewed BLS\u2019 Business Employment Dynamics data, which consist of a  quarterly series of statistics on gross job gains and gross job losses for  the entire economy. Gross job gains and gross job losses reveal some  aspects of business dynamics, including establishment openings and  expansions, and establishment closings and contractions. The quarterly  data series include the number and percent of gross jobs gained by  opening and expanding establishments, and the number and percent of  gross jobs lost by closing and contracting establishments. Furthermore,  we reviewed DOL data on layoffs collected by the Trade Adjustment  Assistance program that are considered to be caused by trade through  shifts in production or services to a foreign country. While the data include  layoffs in telecommunications, DOL officials did not believe the data  would be useful for this report. Specifically, the data do not necessarily  reflect all layoffs in a given sector, but only those associated with  requests for investigations by DOL as to the role of trade in the layoff, and  initial estimates of affected workers\u2014those facing layoffs and those  threatened by layoffs\u2014are not representative.", "To review the potential effect of offshoring on employment trends, we  performed a literature review of selected economic research and other  relevant articles, and discussed the results with DOL officials.

We excluded references that addressed the effects of offshoring  on non-U.S. economies and labor forces, or were otherwise beyond our  scope, such as working conditions, work flow, collective bargaining,  customer service, service quality, or training in call centers. Based on this  research, we identified reasonable observations about employment  trends and offshoring in telecommunications and call centers. As noted in  this report, research on the questions addressed in this report reaches  different conclusions. The relevant research that we reviewed provided  some insights on how offshoring could potentially affect the  telecommunications and call center industries, but provided no  information regarding the extent of the impact. Because of this and other  data limitations, we were unable to determine the extent to which  offshoring may be occurring and what effect offshoring is having on the  telecommunications and call center industries.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2019 to April 2020 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
