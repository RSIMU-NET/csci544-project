GAO analyzed DOD data; reviewed applicable policies; interviewed DOD, Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Navy officials; visited two Army and one Marine Corps sites selected on factors such as separation rates; and reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of Army and Marine Corps servicemember misconduct separation documents."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO's analysis of Department of Defense (DOD) data show that 62 percent, or 57,141 of the 91,764 servicemembers separated for misconduct from fiscal years 2011 through 2015 had been diagnosed within the 2 years prior to separation with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), or certain other conditions that could be associated with misconduct. Specifically, 16 percent had been diagnosed with PTSD or TBI, while the other conditions, such as adjustment and alcohol-related disorders, were more common. Of the 57,141 servicemembers, 23 percent, or 13,283, received an \u201cother than honorable\u201d characterization of service, making them potentially ineligible for health benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).", "GAO found that the military services' policies to address the impact of PTSD and TBI on separations for misconduct are not always consistent with DOD policy. For example, contrary to DOD policy, Navy policy does not require a medical examination\u2014or screening\u2014for certain servicemembers being separated in lieu of trial by court-martial to assess whether a PTSD or TBI diagnosis is a mitigating factor in the misconduct charged. This type of separation occurs when a servicemember facing a trial by court-martial requests, and is approved, to be discharged administratively. In addition, GAO found that two of the four military services have TBI training polices that are inconsistent with DOD policy.", "GAO also found that the Army and Marine Corps may not have adhered to their own screening, training, and counseling policies related to PTSD and TBI. For example, GAO found that 18 of the 48 nongeneralizable sample separation packets reviewed for Marine Corps servicemembers administratively separated for misconduct lacked documentation showing that the servicemember had been screened for PTSD and TBI. During interviews with Army officers, GAO found that some officers may not have received training to identify mild TBI symptoms, despite Army policy that all servicemembers should be trained. Further, GAO found instances in which both Army and Marine Corps may not have adhered to their counseling policies, which require that servicemembers, specifically prior to requesting separation in lieu of trial by court-martial, be counseled about their potential ineligibility for VA benefits and services. For 11 of the 48 separation packets included in GAO's analysis of Army servicemembers who requested separation in lieu of trial by court-martial, there was no documented evidence\u2014or the evidence was unclear\u2014as to whether the servicemembers received counseling.", "Finally, while Army and Marine Corps have some available data on servicemembers' screenings, training, and counseling, the military services do not use these data to routinely monitor whether they are adhering to relevant policies. Federal internal control standards call for agencies to establish monitoring activities to ensure internal control systems and evaluate results. Without monitoring adherence to these policies, the military services cannot provide assurance that servicemembers with PTSD and TBI are receiving adequate consideration of their conditions as well as the services DOD has established for them."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making five recommendations, including that DOD direct the Air Force and Navy to address inconsistencies in their screening and training policies and ensure that the military services monitor adherence to their screening, training, and counseling policies.

PTSD, TBI,  and other mental and physical conditions can go unrecognized and  unacknowledged by the military, family members, and society in general.  Because these conditions can adversely affect servicemembers\u2019 moods,  thoughts, and behavior, they may lead to disciplinary infractions and  subsequent separations for misconduct from the military. Misconduct  separations can result from actions and behaviors such as drug use,  insubordination, absence from the military without leave, and criminal  behavior. In some cases, servicemembers separated for misconduct are  not eligible for benefits and services from the Department of Veterans  Affairs (VA).", "Congress and others have raised questions about whether  servicemembers with PTSD or TBI resulting from their military service  may be separated for misconduct without appropriate consideration of  these conditions. For example, Congress has passed a law requiring the  military services\u2014Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Navy\u2014to assess  the impact of a PTSD or TBI diagnosis before separating certain  servicemembers for misconduct under regulations prescribed by DOD.  To implement this requirement, DOD has issued policies, and each of the  military services has its own policies to address servicemember  separations for misconduct that involve PTSD or TBI. Nevertheless,  advocacy groups and media reports have described instances of  servicemembers with symptoms of PTSD and TBI being discharged for  misconduct without adequate treatment or consideration of these  symptoms. In May 2016, the Army\u2019s Audit Agency weighed in on this  topic, finding that the Army did not have sufficient documentation to  demonstrate that it had considered whether PTSD or TBI was a mitigating  factor in certain servicemembers\u2019 behavior prior to separating them for  misconduct.", "The Carl Levin and Howard P. \u201cBuck\u201d McKeon National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 contains a provision that we  examine the impact of mental and physical trauma, including PTSD, TBI,  and other combat traumas, on the separation of servicemembers from the  military services for misconduct. In this report, we examine  1.  the number of servicemembers separated for misconduct in fiscal  years 2011 through 2015 who were diagnosed with PTSD, TBI, or  certain other conditions and were potentially ineligible for VA benefits  and services;  2.  the extent to which the military services\u2019 policies to address the impact  of PTSD and TBI on the separation of servicemembers for misconduct  are consistent with DOD\u2019s policies;  3.  the extent to which the Army and Marine Corps have adhered to their  policies to address the impact of PTSD and TBI on the separation of  servicemembers for misconduct; and  4.  the extent to which DOD, the Army, and Marine Corps monitor  adherence to policies to address the impact of PTSD and TBI on the  separation of servicemembers for misconduct.", "To examine the number of servicemembers who were separated for  misconduct in fiscal years 2011 through 2015, diagnosed with PTSD, TBI,  or certain other conditions, and potentially ineligible for VA benefits and  services, we obtained data from three sources. We obtained separation  data from DOD\u2019s Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), medical data  from DOD\u2019s Defense Health Agency (DHA), and data on VA eligibility  determinations from the Veterans Benefits Administration. We limited our  analysis to active duty servicemembers, both officers and enlisted, who  were separated for misconduct from the Army, Marine Corps, Air Force,  or Navy in fiscal years 2011 through 2015. We assessed the reliability of  the DMDC, DHA, and VA data in several ways, including discussing the  reliability of the data with DOD and VA officials, performing electronic  tests of the data to identify any outliers or anomalies, reviewing relevant  documentation, and comparing the data with data from published  sources. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our reporting objectives.

We  compared the extent to which the military services\u2019 policies, as provided  by these military services, are consistent with DOD\u2019s related policies in  the above three areas. In addition, we interviewed DOD and military  service officials regarding the policies. For this and subsequent  objectives, we focused our review on the screening and counseling of  enlisted servicemembers because they represented the vast majority (98  percent) of separations for misconduct identified in our first objective.

We also interviewed Army and Marine Corps headquarter  officials. In addition, we reviewed relevant documents and interviewed  officials regarding screening, training, and counseling during three site  visits. Specifically, we visited two Army installations\u2014Fort Bragg (NC)  and Fort Sill (OK)\u2014and one Marine Corps installation\u2014Camp Pendleton  (CA). We selected the sites based on the number of servicemembers  separated for misconduct and geographic variation. We limited our  review to the Army and the Marine Corps for this and subsequent  objectives because of the resource intensive nature of the site visits. We  selected the Army and Marine Corps because, as of 2014, these two  military services represented over half (almost 60 percent) of all  servicemembers in the United States military forces.", "To examine the extent to which DOD, the Army, and the Marine Corps  monitor adherence to policies to address the impact of PTSD and TBI on  the separation of servicemembers for misconduct, we reviewed relevant  documents and interviewed officials from DOD, the Army, and the Marine  Corps.

In particular, DOD\u2019s policy  permitted physicians to conduct PTSD screenings, whereas the law only  authorizes clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, licensed clinical social  workers, and psychiatric advanced practice registered nurses to do so.

First, the  screening requirement under DOD\u2019s policy extends to  servicemembers who request separation in lieu of trial by court- martial, whereas the Air Force\u2019s policy excludes this group. An Air  Force official told us that PTSD and TBI screenings are, in fact, given  to this group because separating servicemembers are required to be  asked about PTSD and TBI symptoms as part of their physical prior to  separation. However, a separation physical does not meet the  requirements of a PTSD or TBI screening for the purpose of  determining whether the condition is a possible mitigating factor in the  separation characterization of servicemembers who request  separation in lieu of trial by court-martial, as required by DOD policy.  Second, DOD policy requires that any qualifying servicemember who  is diagnosed with PTSD or TBI by one of five specified provider types,  including a licensed clinical social worker or psychiatric advanced  practice registered nurse, must receive a screening to determine  whether the condition is a potentially mitigating factor in the conduct in  question. However, Air Force policy does not require such a screening  unless the diagnosis is made by a doctoral-level provider, thereby not  recognizing diagnoses made by licensed clinical social workers and  psychiatric advanced practice registered nurses. An Air Force official  told us that the intent of the policy is to ensure that diagnoses made  by these providers are reviewed and confirmed by doctoral-level  providers. However, imposing such a condition on the diagnoses  made by these provider types is inconsistent with DOD policy, which  recognizes that their diagnoses are sufficient to trigger the screening  requirement.", "Similar to the Air Force, the Navy\u2019s screening policy excludes  servicemembers who request separation in lieu of trial by court-martial  and is likewise inconsistent with DOD\u2019s screening policy. This is  because the Navy\u2019s separation policy only requires screenings prior to  involuntary separations, whereas the Navy elsewhere defines a  separation in lieu of trial by court-martial as a voluntary separation.  While the Navy, like the Air Force, requires all servicemembers to  undergo a separation physical that includes questions about PTSD  and TBI, such a procedure does not meet the requirement of a  screening for the purpose of assessing whether the condition is a  mitigating factor in the misconduct charged in the separation case.", "Our review did not evaluate whether the inconsistencies we identified had  an impact on any individual servicemember who may have been entitled  to a screening. However, unless the military services rectify these  inconsistences, DOD is at risk that some servicemembers may be  deprived of a required screening for PTSD or TBI or may not have the  results of a screening taken into account as a possible mitigating factor in  their misconduct, as required by DOD policy.", "Some of the inconsistencies in military service screening policies appear  to have existed since DOD updated its screening policy in 2014 in  response to various statutory amendments enacted in 2013. For example,  neither the Navy nor Air Force have updated their policies to expressly  require PTSD or TBI screenings for servicemembers requesting  separation in lieu of trial by court-martial for the purpose of determining  whether the condition is a mitigating factor in the servicemember\u2019s  separation characterization.

As a result, PTSD or TBI may not have  been identified as a possible mitigating factor in the separation.", "In our review of separation packets for Marine Corps servicemembers, we  found the following:", "Of those Marine Corps servicemembers who were administratively  separated for misconduct from fiscal years 2011 to 2015, screening  documentation was missing for 18 of the 48 separation packets we  reviewed and in 2 packets the documentation was unclear. As such,  it is unclear whether these Marine Corps servicemembers were  screened for PTSD and TBI as required under DOD policy.", "In addition, 19 of the 48 separation packets we reviewed did not have  documented evidence that the appropriate official reviewed the  screening prior to separation, and in 1 packet the documentation was  unclear. As such, we cannot be certain that these Marine Corps  servicemembers\u2019 screening results were reviewed by the appropriate  official prior to the servicemembers being separated.", "While the absence of documentation does not prove that screenings and  review by appropriate officials did not occur, it does suggest that Army  and Marine Corps policies may not have been followed.", "In interviews with Army and Marine Corps installation-level defense  counsel who represent servicemembers, some additional concerns  regarding the PTSD and TBI screenings were mentioned. For example,  Marine Corps defense counsel raised concerns that screenings might be  occurring after key separation recommendations are being made and that  the tools used to determine whether servicemembers have either  condition should have a more comprehensive exam for PTSD and TBI.  During our review of separation packets we found one instance in which a  screening did not occur before a board was convened; however, the  board members did discuss PTSD during the proceedings. In addition,  Army and Marine Corps defense counsel raised concerns that providers  might be pressured by commanders to clear servicemembers.", "Training on PTSD and TBI. During our Army and Marine Corps  installation interviews, we found that some Army officers who should have  received training on how to identify symptoms of TBI may not have;  further, installation-level officials for both the Army and the Marine Corps  could not produce documentation for officers who had received the  training. During our site visits to the Army installations, noncommissioned  officers, in particular, told us that they did not receive specific training on  how to identify symptoms for TBI. In contrast, commissioned officers were  more likely to recall that they had received the training, often citing the  officer leadership courses as the way they received the information.  When we asked officials at both Army and Marine Corps installations for  documentation of training, officials said that while they have sign-in  sheets for the servicemembers who participate in the training, they do not  maintain them or other documentation, such as training logs, at the  installations because they are not required to do so.", "Officers at one of the Army and the Marine Corps installations we visited  said that other efforts\u2014beyond training courses\u2014to build awareness of  PTSD and TBI have been helpful. In particular, they said that a DOD- wide initiative to have a mental health provider \u201cembedded\u201d in the units  has been beneficial in helping them to identify these symptoms in the  servicemembers under their command. The officers added that  discussing a servicemember\u2019s behavior with a mental health provider  often resulted in a medical referral instead of initiating the process for  separating a servicemember for misconduct.", "Counseling on potential ineligibility for VA benefits and services. We  found instances in which both the Army and the Marine Corps may not  have adhered to their own counseling policies, specifically prior to  servicemembers\u2019 request for separation in lieu of trial by court-martial. In  11 of the 48 packets included in our analysis of Army servicemembers  who requested separation in lieu of trial by court-martial, we found that  there was no documented evidence or the evidence was unclear as to  whether the servicemembers were counseled on their potential ineligibility  for VA benefits and services. Similarly, with respect to the Marine Corps, 4 of the 15 packets we reviewed for servicemembers who  requested separation in lieu of trial by court-martial were missing  documented evidence that the servicemembers were made aware of their  potential ineligibility for VA benefits and services. As such, we cannot be  certain these servicemembers were counseled on potential ineligibility for  VA benefits and services as required.", "Army and Marine Corps installation-level defense counsel said that if a  servicemember elects to meet with legal counsel prior to requesting  separation in lieu of trial by court-martial, counsel reviews how receiving  an \u201cother than honorable\u201d characterization can affect the  servicemember\u2019s eligibility for VA benefits and services as part of the  counseling. Officials from both military services also stated that  servicemembers are counseled on how their characterization of service  could affect their eligibility for VA benefits and services as part of their  initial training. Moreover, installation-level officials said that commanders  at multiple levels discuss the impact of certain characterizations on  eligibility for VA benefits and services as part of their misconduct  counseling with servicemembers. Marine Corps officials said that early  counseling is done through one-on-one conversations, and in many cases  only once the formal separation is about to begin do the counseling  sessions become documented. However, as previously reported, we  cannot be certain that counseling policies for separations in lieu of trial by  court-martial were always implemented as required based on the results  of our packet review."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD, Army, and Marine Corps Do Not Routinely Monitor Adherence to Policies to Address the Impact of PTSD and TBI on Servicemembers", "paragraphs": ["DOD does not routinely monitor the military services\u2019 adherence to  policies for screening servicemembers for PTSD and TBI prior to  separating them for misconduct, training officers on how to identify  symptoms of TBI in the deployed setting, and counseling servicemembers  on eligibility for VA benefits and services. According to DOD officials, the  expectation is that the military services are responsible for monitoring  adherence to these polices. While both Army and Marine Corps have  some data available that could make it possible for them to monitor  whether their screening, training, and counseling policies are being  adhered to as required, the two military services are not routinely using  these data to do so because of limited resources in some instances,  according to an official. Federal internal control standards call for  agencies to establish activities to monitor internal control systems and  evaluate results. Without monitoring adherence to these policies, the  military services cannot provide assurance that certain servicemembers  are screened for PTSD and TBI prior to separation; all servicemembers,  including officers at all levels, are trained on how to identify symptoms of  mild TBI in the deployed setting; and servicemembers are counseled  about VA benefits and services during the separation process.", "Screening servicemembers prior to separation. Neither the Army nor  the Marine Corps routinely monitors whether its screening policies related  to PTSD and TBI are adhered to.

Such documents can indicate  whether or not servicemembers have been screened for PTSD or TBI.  However, the official added that the Army does not have a systematic  method for monitoring whether certain servicemembers are being  screened. As previously discussed, we found that screening documents  were not always included in the Army separation packets that we  reviewed.", "Recent Army audits have found that the Army did not have sufficient  documentation to demonstrate that it was always considering whether  PTSD or TBI was a mitigating factor in servicemembers\u2019 behavior prior to  separating them for misconduct. Specifically, the Army Audit Agency  conducted two audits that reviewed separation and medical records of  servicemembers who had been separated with a characterization of  service of \u201cother than honorable\u201d and had been deployed and diagnosed  with PTSD or TBI within 24 months of their separation for the period of  November 1, 2009 through July 31, 2015. The Army Audit Agency found  that not all of the separation packets it reviewed had documentation  showing that screening for PTSD and TBI had occurred prior to the  servicemember\u2019s separation for misconduct.", "While the Army does not have a systematic method for monitoring, it does  have data available that could be used to routinely monitor whether  screening is occurring. Specifically, the Army has access to  servicemembers\u2019 medical records and could review the medical records  of certain servicemembers being separated for misconduct to determine if  they had been previously diagnosed with PTSD or TBI and therefore  should be screened. According to Army officials, Army Behavioral Health  System of Care personnel are building an electronic program that will  create an automated record of all screenings. Officials added that this  electronic program is expected to be completed in fiscal year 2017.", "In the case of the Marine Corps, officials recognize that monitoring is  necessary; however, an official told us that the Marine Corps does not  have sufficient data to routinely monitor whether screenings are  occurring. The officials told us the Marine Corps was exploring options for  analyzing separation and medical data to see whether separating  servicemembers had been screened for PTSD and TBI. The officials  explained that the Marine Corps has a new electronic system that allows  commanders at the installation level to input real time information about  an administrative separation, which can be viewed by officials at Marine  Corps headquarters. The officials stated that this system could be used to  help identify separation issues, such as unaccounted for screenings prior  to a servicemember being separated. However, one of the officials told us  that the Marine Corps installations are only using the electronic system in  forty percent of separation cases. Furthermore, the official stated that  medical personnel would be required to review medical records of certain  servicemembers to determine if they had been diagnosed with PTSD or  TBI, but the Marine Corps does not have the resources to hire this  personnel.", "Training on PTSD and TBI. Although Army and Marine Corps officials  told us they collect data about the training provided as part of the TBI  programs, they do not use these data to routinely monitor adherence with  their training policies. As previously discussed, Army and Marine Corps  officials told us they collect attendance for the servicemembers, including  officers, who participate in the trainings. However, according to officials,  these data are not used to identify officers who may not have received  training or to routinely monitor whether the Army and Marine Corps are  adhering to DOD\u2019s policy that all servicemembers receive training on how  to identify mild TBI symptoms in the deployed setting. Because DOD  does not have a policy requiring PTSD training, and the military services  have not developed such policies on their own, there is no policy for the  DOD and the military services to monitor adherence against.", "Counseling servicemembers about VA benefits and services. While  Army and Marine Corps collect some data about the counseling provided  to servicemembers, the two military services do not routinely use these  data to ensure adherence with their counseling policies. For example,  Marine Corps headquarters officials told us that they collect attendance  records for the Marine Corps\u2019 90-day personnel readiness training, which  includes counseling on VA benefits and services, but the data collected  are not reviewed to ensure that servicemembers have received the  required counseling. For the counseling that is provided to  servicemembers being separated in lieu of trial by court-martial, Army and  Marine Corps officials told us that documentation of this counseling  should be included in each servicemember\u2019s separation packet. However,  officials from both military services told us that servicemembers\u2019  separation packets are not reviewed by officials at the military services\u2019  headquarters to ensure that counseling is occurring. Similar to how the  PTSD and TBI screening documents are reviewed, officials explained that  military staff at the installations should review the separation material to  make sure that the counseling documents are included. For example, an  Army headquarters official told us that the Army relies on staff judge  advocates at the installations to review servicemembers\u2019 separation  material and make sure that the required counseling documents are  included prior to a final separation decision.

However, we found that Air Force and Navy\u2019s  pre-separation screening and training policies are inconsistent with DOD  policy. Furthermore, we found that the Army and Marine Corps may not  always be adhering to their own policies and that monitoring of the  policies\u2014which could include a review of documentation, data analyses,  or other oversight mechanisms\u2014by DOD, Army, and Marine Corps is  limited. While we did not review whether the Air Force or Navy adhered to  or monitored their policies, we identified inconsistencies between their  policies and DOD\u2019s policies. As a result of policy inconsistencies and  limited monitoring, DOD has little assurance that certain servicemembers  diagnosed with PTSD or TBI receive the required screening and  counseling prior to being separated for misconduct and that all  servicemembers, including officers, have been trained on how to identify  symptoms of mild TBI in the deployed setting. Unless the policy  inconsistencies are resolved and routine monitoring is undertaken to  ensure adherence, the risk increases that servicemembers may be  inappropriately separated for misconduct without adequate consideration  of these conditions\u2019 effects on behavior, separation characterization, or  eligibility for VA benefits and services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To increase its assurance that PTSD and TBI are appropriately  considered prior to separating certain servicemembers from the military  for misconduct, the Secretary of Defense should take the following five  actions:  Direct the Air Force and Navy to address inconsistencies with DOD policy  in their policies related to  screening certain servicemembers, including servicemembers  separating in lieu of trial by court-martial, for PTSD and TBI and  reviewing the results prior to separation for misconduct; and  training servicemembers, including officers, on how to identify mild  TBI symptoms in the deployed setting.", "Ensure that the military services routinely monitor adherence to policies  related to  screening certain servicemembers for PTSD and TBI prior to  separation for misconduct;  training servicemembers, including officers, on how to identify mild  TBI symptoms in the deployed setting; and  counseling about VA benefits and services during the process of  separating certain servicemembers for misconduct."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD and VA reviewed a draft of this report. DOD provided general  comments, which are reprinted in appendix VI, and technical comments,  which we incorporated as appropriate. VA did not provide written  comments on this report, but the department indicated that it will continue  to raise awareness of PTSD and TBI programs available to veterans,  including veterans with a less than honorable discharge.", "In its comments, DOD concurred with four of our five recommendations.  Specifically, DOD agreed with our recommendation to direct the Air Force  and the Navy to address inconsistencies in their policies related to  screening certain servicemembers for PTSD and TBI and reviewing the  results prior to separation for misconduct. DOD also agreed with our  recommendations to ensure that the military services routinely monitor  adherence to policies related to screening certain servicemembers for  PTSD and TBI prior to separation for misconduct; counseling  servicemembers about VA benefits and services during the separation  process; and training servicemembers, including officers, on how to  identify mild TBI symptoms. On this last monitoring recommendation  related to training, based on additional information from DOD we revised  the language of the original recommendation to clarify that the military  services should monitor the training provided to servicemembers on how  to identify mild TBI symptoms in the deployed setting.", "DOD did not concur with our recommendation that it direct the Air Force  and the Navy to address inconsistencies between their policies and  DOD\u2019s policy related to training servicemembers on how to identify mild  TBI symptoms. In its comments, DOD said that because our  recommendation did not specify that training to identify mild TBI  symptoms was in the deployed setting, we were in effect creating new  policy. We have revised the language in our recommendation to clarify  this point. However, this clarification does not obviate the need for our  recommendation because the inconsistencies we identified in the Air  Force and Navy policies were material to their mild TBI training  requirements in deployed settings. In particular, the Air Force provided no  documentation of the training plans it was responsible for developing,  while the Navy\u2019s mild TBI training requirement only applied to certain  health providers.", "DOD also raised four concerns about our data analysis. First, DOD raised  concern that data from DOD\u2019s Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC)  on the total number of separations were lower than Army and Marine  Corps data. We obtained our data from DMDC, and over the course of  our audit assessed the reliability of the data provided in several ways,  including comparing it with published sources and discussing the data  with officials from the military services and DMDC. Differences between  DMDC\u2019s and the military services\u2019 data were reviewed and, where  necessary, explanations were identified and noted. The discrepancy in  total number of separations noted in DOD\u2019s comments stems largely from  differences in which servicemembers were included. In their analyses of  total separations, the Army and the Marine Corps included  servicemembers who separated from active duty and transferred directly  to National Guard or Reserve duty, whereas the data provided by DMDC  that we used for our analysis excluded these servicemembers. We  excluded these servicemembers because our review focuses on  servicemembers separating to civilian life. In response to DOD\u2019s concern,  we clarified this exclusion in the report. Further, these military services  confirmed that DMDC\u2019s misconduct separations data\u2014the data on which  our findings are based\u2014are consistent with their data.", "Second, DOD raised concern that the number of servicemembers we  report as having been diagnosed with PTSD or TBI\u201414,816\u2014is  inaccurate because of double counting. We disagree. As stated in the  report, collectively, about 16 percent, or 14,816, of the 91,764  servicemembers who were separated for misconduct had been  diagnosed with PTSD or TBI. As we explain in footnote 28, this proportion  is lower than the sum of the proportion diagnosed with PTSD (8 percent)  and the proportion diagnosed with TBI (11 percent) because some  servicemembers had been diagnosed with both conditions. However, in  response to DOD\u2019s concern, we made additional clarifications in the  report.", "Third, DOD expressed concern about some of the conditions included in  our group of conditions other than PTSD and TBI that could be  associated with misconduct. As described in our methodology, we  developed our list of conditions through conversations with DOD and  mental health professionals and reviews of relevant publications. We  ultimately selected conditions that could potentially be caused or  exacerbated by military service, or that could be misdiagnosed as PTSD  or TBI. For example, one of the reasons we included depressive  disorders was the discussion of major depressive disorder and  depressive symptoms in a 2008 RAND study. This study noted that  depression could be linked to specific war experiences such as loss, and  affects mood, thoughts, and behavior, but often goes unrecognized and  unacknowledged. Furthermore, because we understand that there can be  conflicting evidence on these issues, in key parts of the report we  separate discussions of PTSD and TBI data from the data on other health  conditions. In response to DOD\u2019s concern, we also included additional  data on PTSD and TBI separately from the data related to other health  conditions.", "Finally, DOD expressed concern that our use of the word \u201cofficials\u201d to  describe servicemembers\u2019 defense counsel implied that they represented  the interests of the military services rather than the servicemembers.
