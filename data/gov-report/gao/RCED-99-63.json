These plants generate electricity from the flow of water that is also used for other purposes, including fish and wildlife enhancement, flood control, irrigation, navigation, recreation, and water supply. Since about the 1930s, electricity that is generated by these hydropower plants has played an important role in electricity markets. These plants were a key element in electrifying rural and sparsely populated areas of the nation. These plants account for over 35,000 megawatts (MW) of generating capacity (or about 5 percent of the nation\u2019s total electric supply) in 1998. The Department of Energy\u2019s power marketing administrations (PMA) generally market the electricity generated at these plants to wholesale customers (the \u201cpower customers\u201d), such as rural electric cooperatives and municipal utilities, that in turn sell the electricity to retail customers. (Fig. 1.1 shows the service areas of the PMAs.) Revenues earned from the sale of this electricity totaled over $3 billion in fiscal year 1997. These revenues pay for the operation and maintenance of the government\u2019s electricity-related assets and repay a portion of the outstanding federal appropriated and other debt of about $22 billion for the Bureau\u2019s and the Corps\u2019 power plants, related PMA transmission lines, and well as certain related federal investments for irrigation, water supply, and other facilities that are to be repaid over time from electricity revenues. The revenues also pay interest on the outstanding appropriated debt, where applicable."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Changes in Electricity Markets", "paragraphs": ["In traditional markets, electric utilities enjoyed relative certainty about the amount of demand they would have to satisfy in the future. A compact existed between utilities and state public utility commissions. Utilities were obligated to serve all existing and future customers in their pre-established service areas. In return, utilities were granted monopolies within their service areas and approved rate schedules that guaranteed stated earnings on their operating costs and investments. They forecasted the load they would serve by using econometric and end-use analyses models over future periods of time that were as long as 20 years. They collected sufficient funds in their electric rates to pay for needed generating capacity and to operate, maintain, and repair existing power plants and other electricity assets. The funds collected through rates also include profits.", "However, the nation\u2019s electricity markets are undergoing significant changes. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 significantly increased competition in wholesale electricity markets. In addition, competition at the retail level is now arriving. According to the Department of Energy\u2019s Energy Information Administration, as of March 1999, 18 states had acted\u2014by legislation that had been enacted (14 states) or by regulatory order (4 states) \u2014to restructure electricity markets. Regulators in these states expected that industrial, commercial, and, ultimately, residential consumers would be able to choose their electricity supplier from among several competitors, rather than being tied to one utility.", "As competition increases, the rates paid by consumers for electricity have dropped and should continue to do so. For example, according to the Energy Information Administration, as a result of such factors as emerging competition and new, more efficient generating technologies, retail electricity rates decreased by about 25 percent from 1982 through 1996, after factoring in the impact of inflation. The administration expects electricity rates to continue to decrease in real terms by 6 percent to 19 percent by 2015."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Utilities Respond to More Competitive Markets", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, uncertainty about the pace and extent of competitiveness in electric markets has caused utilities to be more flexible. Utilities have relied more on purchasing electricity from other sources or acquiring new power plants, such as smaller natural-gas-fired plants, that are less expensive and more flexible for meeting shifting demand. They have also cut costs by reorganizing and reducing staff, and they have consolidated or merged with other utilities where they believed it was appropriate. For example, after years of virtually no mergers, from October 1992 to January 1998, investor-owned utilities had proposed over 40 mergers and completed 17 of them, according to the Edison Electric Institute. In addition, according to utility officials, some utilities are retiring or divesting some high-cost power plants, while others are buying those same plants to serve a niche in their resource portfolios.", "According to utility officials, in more stable electricity markets, utilities and federal agencies maintained and repaired their hydroelectric and other power plants according to a schedule that was predetermined by the manufacturer\u2019s specifications and the operating history of the plant. Maintenance and repairs were frequently made at this predetermined time whether or not they were needed. Because maintenance or repairs could have been performed later or less frequently, perhaps with lower costs, some Bureau and utility officials that we contacted characterized these practices as over-maintenance of the hydropower plants. These practices, according to an industry consultant, were seldom questioned partly because of the low costs and resiliency of hydropower plants\u2014especially of those placed into service during the 1950s.", "However, as markets become more competitive, federal agency, utility, and electric industry officials have increasingly viewed hydropower plants as particularly useful to utilities\u2019 overall operations. One of hydropower\u2019s important traits is its flexibility in meeting different levels of demand. This characteristic, according to utility officials, means that hydropower plants will likely continue to play a significant role in meeting demand during peak periods and providing ancillary services, without which electricity systems cannot operate. Currently, utilities provide these services routinely. However, according to Bureau, PMA, and utility officials, depending upon actions taken by federal and state regulators in the near future, a separate market may develop for ancillary services. These services may be priced separately and may allow utilities with hydropower to capture a market niche and earn additional revenues.", "In response to new markets and perceptions about the role of hydropower in those markets, federal agencies and some utilities have reconsidered how they operate, maintain, and repair their hydropower plants. For example, some utilities have implemented less-expensive, more-flexible maintenance practices, which consider such factors as the generating size of a utility\u2019s hydropower plants, those plants\u2019 roles in the utility\u2019s generation portfolio, and marketing and economic considerations. One such approach, called \u201cReliability Centered Maintenance,\u201d is defined as a maintenance philosophy that attempts to make use of the most logical, cost-effective mix of breakdown maintenance, preventive maintenance, and predictive testing and proactive maintenance to attain the full life of the equipment, reduce maintenance costs, and encourage reliable operations. For example, according to some utilities we contacted, in determining when to maintain or repair equipment, they are relying increasingly on the use of monitoring equipment to detect changes in the operating conditions of the equipment, instead of performing those actions in a prescheduled manner, as in the past. On the basis of these examinations, the utility may decide to repair or replace the component. Alternatively, the utility may decide to stretch out the operation of the component to the point of near-failure. Some components may actually be run until they fail. However, according to Corps and utility officials, in the cases of some smaller hydropower units, installing monitoring equipment at a cost of $200 to $500 per unit may not make economic sense. Other measures may also be used to monitor the operating condition of equipment. For example, the Corps tests the lubricating oil to indicate the condition of its generating equipment.", "Also, in some cases, when deciding how and when to maintain and repair generating units, management now considers the plant or the unit as an individual cost center that must make a positive contribution to the utility\u2019s bottom line. In such an environment, plant managers will become more aware of the production costs and will exert increased pressures to cut costs at the plant and at the corporate levels. Plant managers may become aware that a utility may actually shut down and sell a generating unit if operating or repairing it does not return a required, positive financial return."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Measuring the Reliability of Power Plants", "paragraphs": ["As market competition intensifies, utilities will face increasing pressures to operate as efficiently and cost-effectively as possible. Utilities\u2019 management will need to know how well their plants are producing electricity in order to make informed decisions about how to allocate scarce dollars for maintaining and repairing power plants, where to cut costs, or, in more extreme cases, which generating units to sell or shut down. An important concept for defining power plants\u2019 performance is the \u201creliability\u201d with which plants generate electricity. Within the electric utility industry, power plants are viewed as \u201creliable\u201d if they are capable of functioning without failure over a specific period of time or amount of usage. The availability factor and the related outages factors are widely accepted measures of the reliability of power plants. The time a generating unit is \u201cavailable\u201d to generate electricity is the time it is mechanically able to generate electricity because it is not malfunctioning unexpectedly or because it is not being maintained or repaired. For instance, if a unit were available to generate electricity 8,000 hours out of the 8,760 hours in a year, then its availability factor would be 8,000 hours divided by 8,760 hours, or about 91.3 percent.", "When a unit is unable to generate electricity because it is broken, being repaired, or being maintained, it is in outage status. Outages are further classified as \u201cscheduled\u201d outages if the unit is unable to generate electricity because it is undergoing previously scheduled repairs or maintenance. If a unit is unable to generate electricity because of an unexpected breakdown and/or if unanticipated repairs need to be performed, then it is in \u201cforced outage\u201d status. If a plant were in scheduled outage status for 100 hours over the course of one year, then its scheduled outage factor would be 100 hours divided by the 8,760 hours in a year, or 1.1 percent. If a plant were in a forced outage status for 600 hours, then its forced outage factor would be 600 hours divided by the 8,760 hours in the year, or 6.8 percent of the time. For any generating unit, the availability factor, the scheduled outage factor, and the forced outage factor, added together, should equal 100 percent because, taken together, they account for a plant\u2019s entire operating status over a period of time.", "Assessing the performance of a hydropower plant or unit by examining its availability factor calls for understanding additional variables that would affect its performance. Many officials we contacted said that the availability factor needs to be understood in terms of such factors as the role played by the plant in terms of the kind of demand that it meets (for instance, whether it meets peak demand), the availability of water throughout the year, and the purposes satisfied by the dam and reservoir. For example, according to a utility consultant, because water is abundant at the New York Power Authority\u2019s Niagara Power Project, the generating units are used primarily to satisfy nonpeak loads. Therefore, the utility attempts to operate and maintain those units to be on line as much as possible. To do otherwise entails a loss of generating revenues that could be earned almost 24 hours per day. Nevertheless, officials at every utility we contacted said that they achieved an availability of at least 90 percent, and the Bureau and the Corps have formal goals of attaining that availability level."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["As requested by the Chairman, Subcommittee on Water and Power, House Committee on Resources, we examined the (1) reliability of the Bureau\u2019s and Corps\u2019 hydropower plants in generating electricity compared with the reliability of nonfederal hydropower plants; (2) reasons why the Bureau\u2019s and the Corps\u2019 plants may be less reliable than nonfederal plants and the potential implications of reduced reliability; and (3) actions taken to obtain funding to better maintain and repair the Bureau\u2019s and the Corps\u2019 plants.", "To compare the generating reliability of the Bureau\u2019s and the Corps\u2019 hydropower plants with nonfederal ones, we obtained, analyzed, and contrasted power plants\u2019 performance data, including availability and outages factors, from the Bureau, the Corps, and the North American Electric Reliability Council.

In addition, the Anti-Deficiency Act and other statutes require that federal agencies not enter into any contracts before appropriations become available, unless authorized by law. Such delays can lead to maintenance backlogs and to inconsistent, unreliable performance. The PMAs\u2019 electricity generally is priced less than other electricity.

To fund the repairs, the Bureau requested funds in its fiscal year 1993 budget request; however, according to the Bureau\u2019s records, OMB eliminated the request. The Bureau\u2019s Budget Review Committee recommended that the project not be included in the agency\u2019s fiscal year 1994 budget request and that the Bureau\u2019s regional office \u201cmake a concerted effort to find non-federal financing.\u201d", "The Corps\u2019 Northwestern Division in Portland, Oregon, has also experienced difficulties in funding needed repairs.

In addition, issuing bonds but allowing work to begin prior to the bond\u2019s issuance is another tool that utilities use to pay for and make repairs very quickly. For example, according to officials of the Douglas County Public Utility District, the utility district can respond quickly to an unexpected breakdown because (1) it has access to some reserve funds, (2) its commissioners can approve funding via the issuance of bonds up to 18 months after work was begun on a repair, and (3) its budgeting process is fast and accurate. For example, the utility district in January 1999 was completing work on the budget for the next fiscal year that would begin in only 8 months\u2014namely, August 1999. The budget for the utility district\u2019s hydropower project reflects funding requirements for operations, maintenance, anticipated repairs, and debt service, on the basis of the long-term operational and financial history for the project.

We collected 1998 availability and outage data for the Bureau and the Corps, but we did not present it in our graphs because comparative data for the nonfederal units were not available from NERC at the time we completed our study. We also did not evaluate the specific input data used by the Corps and the Bureau to develop their databases on the performance of federal generating units. Table I.1 depicts some of the characteristics of the hydropower generating units included in our analysis of the performance of the Bureau\u2019s, the Corps, and industry\u2019s generating units. Data for nonfederal units is from 32 nonfederal utilities.", "Average age of generating units (years)", "Nameplate capacity of generating units (MW)", "Average nameplate capacity of generating units (MW)", "We discussed the limitations of these performance indicators with officials from the Bureau, the Corps, the Tennessee Valley Authority, investor-owned utilities, publicly owned utilities, and other experts in the electric utility industry.", "To explore why federal hydropower plants sometimes performed at lower levels, we obtained and analyzed various reports on the subject, and discussed the topic with representatives of Bonneville, the Bureau, the Corps, various pwer maketing administration (PMA) power customers or their associations, investor-owned utilities, and nonfederal, publicly owned utilities. In our analysis, we included information obtained from the Tennessee Valley Authority, a federally owned utility with high performance indicators and significant hydropower resources.", "In addressing the implications of any reduced performance by federal plants, we interviewed industry experts, representatives of investor-owned and publicly owned utilities, and officials of PMA power customers. We also examined studies about the changes in electricity markets and contacted national and regional trade associations. Moreover, we addressed alternative ways of ensuring the enhanced funding of maintenance and repairs of the federal hydropower plants and related facilities. In this regard, to the extent possible, we relied upon previous work that we had performed on federal power, especially work performed during two prior reviews: Federal Power: Options for Selected Power Marketing Administrations: Role in a Changing Electricity Industry (GAO/RCED-98-43, Mar. 6, 1998) and Federal Power: Outages Reduce the Reliability of Hydroelectric Power Plants in the Southeast (GAO/T-RCED-96-180, July 25, 1996). Moreover, we examined the Corps\u2019, the Bureau\u2019s, and the PMAs\u2019 efforts to make power revenues directly finance the maintenance and repair of federal hydropower assets. In this regard, we contacted the Bureau, the Corps, Bonneville, Western, and the PMAs\u2019 power customers and examined various agreements of arrangements to pay for the maintenance and repair of the federal hydropower plants and related facilities.", "Our work was performed at various locations, including the offices of federal and nonfederal parties. Regarding the Corps, these locations include the agency\u2019s headquarters, Washington, D.C.; the Northwestern Division, Portland, Oregon; the Portland, Oregon, District; and the Nashville, Tennessee, District. Because the Corps\u2019 power operations have been affected by the need to accommodate the migrations of salmon, we also contacted the Walla Walla and Seattle, Washington, Districts, and the Corps\u2019 Bonneville (Oregon) power plant. We visited the Bureau\u2019s offices at the Department of the Interior in Washington, D.C.; Denver, Colorado; the Central Valley Operations Office, Sacramento, California; the Pacific Northwest Region, Boise, Idaho; and the Grand Coulee, Washington, power plant. To gain a perspective on how another federal electricity-generating entity operated its hydropower program, we interviewed TVA officials in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Moreover, we contacted the PMAs at locations including their Power Marketing Liaison Office, U.S. Department of Energy, Washington, D.C.; Bonneville in Portland, Oregon; Southeastern in Elberton, Georgia; Southwestern in Tulsa, Oklahoma; and Western in Golden and Loveland, Colorado, and Folsom, California.", "Our scope included contacting several PMA customers or associations that represent PMA customers, including the City of Roseville, California; Colorado River Energy Distributors Association, Tuscon, Arizona; the Midwest Electric Consumers Association, Denver, Colorado; the Northern California Power Agency, Roseville, California; and the Sacramento (California) Municipal Utility District. In addition, we contacted several investor-owned utilities, utility holding companies, and nonfederal publicly owned utilities (other than those previously listed) that operate significant amounts (collectively, over 17,000 MW) of hydropower -generating capacity; they included the Chelan County (Washington) Public Utility District; Idaho Power Company; Grant County (Washington) Public Utility District; Douglas County (Washington) Public Utility District; New York Power Authority in Niagara, New York; Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Sacramento, California; South Carolina Electric and Gas; and the Southern Company in Atlanta, Georgia.", "Our work was performed from July 1998 through February 1999 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Department of Energy", "paragraphs": ["On March 6, 1999, the Department of Energy provided technical suggestions for the draft report but deferred to the comments of the Bureau and the Corps on more substantive matters.

In its cover letter and general comments, Interior stated that the report does a good job in recognizing the funding needs for operating and maintaining electrical-generating facilities. However, Interior stated the report does not articulate in the executive summary, as it does in the body, the initiatives undertaken by the Bureau and the Corps to identify alternative funding sources. We believe that the executive summary adequately addresses the issue of the initiatives undertaken by the Bureau, the Corps, and the PMAs, particularly as they relate to efforts in the Pacific Northwest. Therefore, we did not revise our report. 2. In its cover letter and in general comments, Interior stated that the report does not articulate the fact that the Bureau\u2019s facilities are operated to fulfill multiple purposes, such as providing water for irrigation, municipal and industrial uses, fish and wildlife enhancement, and electricity generation. According to the Bureau, if water is frequently not available for generating electricity, the availability factor is not a good indicator for comparing the reliability of the Bureau\u2019s hydropower-generating units with other units that are not operated under multipurpose requirements. Interior also suggested that the nonfederal projects are freer to maximize power and revenues because they are less affected by multiple purposes.", "We disagree with the Bureau\u2019s position that the report does not recognize that water is used for multiple purposes and affects how electricity is generated. For example, the executive summary recognizes that the Bureau and the Corps generate electricity subject to the use of water for flood control, navigation, irrigation, and other purposes. In addition, the report recognizes, in chapter 2, that the Bureau and other utilities utilize periods of low water and low demand to perform scheduled maintenance and repairs. This would tend to decrease the availability factors of these entities. The report also states that this practice may be regarded as good business practices. We further disagree that the availability factor is not a good basis for comparing the reliability of different projects. The availability factor is a widely accepted measure of reliability that has validity, as long as it is understood in terms of other factors that affect how plants are operated. Moreover, we disagree that other utilities necessarily operate hydropower plants that are affected less by multiple purposes. In fact, as we have noted previously, for other utilities, the multiple uses of the water are regulated through conditions in the utilities\u2019 hydropower-plant-operating licenses, which are issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.", "The Bureau contends that the availability of its plants is affected by the fact that more of the Bureau\u2019s plants are located on pipelines, canals, and water diversion facilities than most nonfederal plants. We recognized this point in chapter 2. 3. In the cover letter and in its general comments, Interior stated that the forced outages factor is a better indicator of reliability than the availability factor for multiple purpose facilities. In addition, in its cover letter, Interior indicated that the Bureau\u2019s benchmarking studies indicate that its plants compare favorably with other plants in the area of reliability. Regarding forced outages factors, our report recognizes that there are several indicators of reliability and the forced outages factor is one of most meaningful. More generally, we disagree with Interior\u2019s conclusion that the Bureau\u2019s plants are as reliable as those of other power providers. As shown in chapter 2 of this report, although the Bureau\u2019s forced outages factors are on par with those of nonfederal utilities, the Bureau\u2019s availability factor is lower, and it has been improving. Moreover, the Bureau\u2019s scheduled outages factors are higher than nonfederal utilities.", "In its general comments, Interior adds that reliability is a measure of whether a plant can operate when it is needed, while availability is a measure of a unit\u2019s ability to operate within a given time period. These factors, stated the Bureau, can be equated only when a plant is required to operate for the full time of the period. The Bureau added that optimum availability is unique to each plant, depending on such factors as design, time, water supply, location, and cost. As stated in our report, reliability is a measure of a plant\u2019s ability to operate over a specific period or amount of usage. We further agree that the significance of an availability factor should be understood within the context of various factors, some of which are mentioned by the Bureau. We revised chapter 1 to recognize that assessing the performance of a hydropower plant or unit by examining its availability factor calls for understanding additional variables. We added language to reflect that the availability factor needs to be understood in terms of such factors as the kind of demand the plant meets (e.g., whether it meets peak demand), the availability of water throughout the year, and the purposes satisfied by the dam and reservoir. 4. According to Interior, the report implies that the Bureau delays repairs and maintenance, pending the availability of funds. The Bureau stated that it performs repairs and maintenance when needed by reprioritizing funds. We revised the report in chapter 3 to recognize the Bureau\u2019s statement that it reprioritizes funding. However, the example of the delayed repairs because of delayed funding at the Bureau\u2019s Shasta, California, project, illustrates our point that repairs and maintenance are delayed when funds are not forthcoming. 5. Interior stated that the Bureau has undertaken a program to improve its performance by benchmarking its electricity operations against the rest of the industry and is continually striving to improve, given the legal and financial constraints encountered. Our report does not imply that these agencies are operating in an unbusinesslike manner but shows that the Bureau\u2019s availability has improved in the face of financial and budgeting constraints. We revised chapter 1 to recognize the Bureau\u2019s benchmarking effort."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Specific Comments", "paragraphs": ["1. Interior commented that the title of the report implies that the Bureau has reduced its operation and maintenance program. Interior stated the Bureau has always implemented preventive and reliability-centered maintenance and that adequate funding for these activities has been available. Chapter 4 of the report recognizes that the Bureau, in particular in the Pacific Northwest, will increasingly practice reliability-centered maintenance and practiced preventive maintenance in the past. However, the efforts of the Bureau\u2019s field locations to engage in direct or advance funding arrangements serves as evidence that faster and more predictable funding is needed. 2. We added \u201ctransmission system\u201d to the report, as requested by Interior. 3. We revised the report to indicate that the Bureau\u2019s forced outages rate from 1993 through 1997 was the same as the nonfederal sector\u2019s. 4. According to Interior, our comparing plants of different size and type may distort our conclusions about the performance of the federal and nonfederal plants. We disagree. As shown in appendix I, the federal and nonfederal electrical-generating units in our analysis were about same size because our analysis of nonfederal units excluded about 2,400 smaller ones that averaged about 9 MW of generating capacity. In addition, our decision to include both conventional generators and pump generators in our analysis was based on the fact that the Corps\u2019 performance data did not separate its conventional and pump units. The Bureau itself, in its 1996 benchmarking study, included seven pump units (about 323 MW) at its Grand Coulee and Flatiron plants as conventional generating units. Moreover, although the Bureau has generating units from 1 MW to 700 MW, it used only two MW-size categories (1 to 29 MW, and 30 MW and larger) in comparing the availability and outages factors of its plants to the industry in its 1996 benchmarking study. In addition, our analysis of the availability factors of the Bureau\u2019s hydropower-generating units from 1993 through 1997 showed that among pump generators as well as the size categories zero to 10 MW, 11 to 50 MW, 51 to 100 MW, and 101 to 200 MW, the Bureau\u2019s hydropower units had lower availability factors than the industry as a whole. 5. According to Interior, although the customers funded up to $22 million in repairs for Shasta, the rewind contract was awarded for $8.8 million, including total costs to replace the turbines estimated at $12.2 million. This point is expanded upon under comment 12. 6. Interior disagrees with the statement in the draft report that advance or direct funding arrangements decrease opportunities for congressional oversight. We revised the report to state that, although these arrangements could diminish opportunities for oversight, the Bureau, the Corps, and the PMAs provide such information as the history and background of their power plants; the plants\u2019 generating capacity and electricity produced; annual electricity revenues and costs; and related environmental and water availability issues to the Congress, other decisionmakers, and to the public. The means of communicating this information include the PMAs\u2019 annual reports; the PMAs\u2019, the Bureau\u2019s, and the Corps\u2019 Internet Websites; and letters to the Congress. 7. According to Interior, our statement that \u201cthe longer the scheduled outage, the less efficient the maintenance program,\u201d is out of place as it pertains to federal plants. The statement would apply primarily to run-of-the-river plants, according to Interior. The Department noted that federal plants are not allowed to earn more revenues and outages do not have an impact on revenues if water is not available for generating electricity.", "We believe our report sufficiently addresses these points. We have already noted that performing scheduled outages during times of low water or low demand may constitute good business practice. In addition, we have noted the need to understand such factors as the kind of demand a plant meets (for instance, whether it meets peak demand) and the availability of water for generating power. Our report also states that, as markets evolve to become more competitive, operating plants at higher availability factors may allow the PMAs and utilities to take advantage of new opportunities to earn revenue by selling ancillary services. In addition, we continue to believe that, all things being equal, having plants on-line for longer periods of time is also good business practice, as stated in the Bureau\u2019s 1996 benchmarking report.8. As suggested by Interior, we revised the report to read \u201cWestern Systems Coordinating Council.\u201d 9. As suggested by Interior, we revised the report to reflect that three of five units at Shasta were repaired. The other two were not. 10. In response to Interior\u2019s comment, we revised the report to reflect that while the Bureau defers noncritical items, it does not defer items it deems to be critical. Interior also notes that unfunded maintenance requirements do not necessarily indicate a deferred maintenance situation. In our view, any maintenance requirements that are put off until the future are deferred. However, we revised the report to state that deferred maintenance is not problematic as long as it can be managed. 11. As requested by Interior, we added \u201cdue to limited and declining federal budgetary sources.\u201d 12. Interior clarified that the costs of rewinding the Shasta units decreased from $10.5 million (low bid) in 1994 to $8.8 million in 1996. The rewind contract was executed in 1996 to increase the rating to 142 MW per unit versus the higher-priced rewind in 1994 to 125 MW per unit. Most importantly, the $21.5 million commitment includes the replacement of turbines in three units that were not included in earlier cost estimates. Because of the new information provided regarding the nature of the additional work at Shasta, we revised our report in chapter 3 to state that the Bureau expanded the scope of work to be performed at the plant. 13. As suggested by Interior, we revised the text to state that the funding arrangements in the Pacific Northwest were necessitated by budget cuts during the 1980s. Also, the need to fund about $200 million in maintenance in the near term would limit the Bureau\u2019s ability to pay for maintenance and repairs in a steady, predictable fashion. 14. As suggested by Interior, we deleted the word \u201celectricity\u201d from the reference to the Bureau\u2019s operation and maintenance budget. 15. As suggested by Interior, we revised the text to eliminate references to \u201cseparate\u201d Joint Operating Committees. 16. As suggested by Interior, we changed \u201cdefer spending\u201d to \u201creschedule.\u201d"], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": ["On March 16, 1999, the Department of Defense (including the Army Corps of Engineers) provided us with a letter acknowledging that the Corps\u2019 verbal comments, discussed with us at a March 10, 1999, meeting, had been resolved.

The Corps suggested that we include these data in various graphs in our report. As discussed with Corps officials, we addressed the changes in the Corps\u2019 performance in the text of our report, primarily in chapter 2.

Bonneville noted that in its view, we \u201csought to conduct a fair assessment of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) and the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) facilities during the time of the study.\u201d 1. Bonneville understood that we were not requested to evaluate the direct-funding agreements in the Pacific Northwest. However, Bonneville suggested that we add language to the report to reflect that the funding agreements between itself, the Bureau, and the Corps contain a systematic approach to maintenance planning and investment that creates opportunities for increased hydropower availability, financial savings, and increased revenues. We believe that our report addresses these points. However, we added language that Bonneville believes these enhancements will be attained as a result of the funding agreements. 2. As noted by Bonneville, our report stated that the availability factors of the Bureau\u2019s and the Corps\u2019 hydropower plants in the Pacific Northwest are lower than in the rest of the nation. Bonneville suggested that we clarify the report, in the executive summary, by stating that Bonneville, the Bureau, and the Corps recognized the lower reliability of the plants in the Pacific Northwest and took action through a series of direct-funding agreements to address the problem. Bonneville further suggested a clarification that during the period 1993 through 1997, the federal agencies undertook extensive upgrades and rehabilitations of the Bureau\u2019s plants partly as a result of the increased funding flexibility provided by the direct-funding agreements. We agreed that these statements would clarify the report and incorporated them. 3. Bonneville noted that the draft report stated that funding maintenance and repair actions through direct customer contributions or through direct payments from the PMAs\u2019 revenues reduced opportunities for congressional oversight. According to Bonneville, the funding arrangement in the Pacific Northwest was specifically supported by the Senate Appropriations Committee in 1997. Bonneville also stated that its annual congressional budget submission includes programmatic information on the operations and maintenance funding that Bonneville plans to provide for the Bureau and the Corps. In response to this and other comments, we revised the executive summary and chapter 4 to show that information is now being made available to the Congress and others about the operation of the federal power program. For instance, the Bureau, the Corps, and the PMAs provide such information as the history and background of their power plants; the plants\u2019 generating capacity and electricity produced; annual electricity revenues and costs; and related environmental and water quality issues to the Congress, other decisionmakers, and to the public. The means of communicating this information include the PMAs\u2019 annual reports; the PMAs\u2019, the Bureau\u2019s, and the Corps\u2019 Internet Websites; and letters to the appropriate congressional committtees. 4. We revised the executive summary as recommended by Bonneville by adding \u201cunder the traditional appropriations process.\u201d 5. Bonneville believed that the location of figure 1 in the executive summary was confusing, since it discussed national availability factors but was positioned over the discussion of availability in the Pacific Northwest. We agree and have relocated the figure. 6. The draft\u2019s executive summary stated that some of Bonneville\u2019s power customers are leaving the agency for less-expensive sources. Bonneville stated that some customers left the power administration in an earlier period but the situation today is significantly different, with demand for electricity and other products exceeding the supply. Bonneville stated that increasing demand for its electricity as well as the increased financial resources provided by its funding agreements with the Bureau and the Corps will improve its competitive viability and ability to recover the full cost of the Federal Columbia River Power System. We agreed and revised the report in the executive summary and chapter 4. 7. Bonneville suggested that the final report recognize that, for large hydropower systems, the ability to earn electricity revenues depends on the availability of water and of operable hydropower-generating units. These conditions and other factors must be considered to optimize the maintenance program for the plants from which Bonneville markets electricity. We agreed and revised chapter 3 accordingly. 8. As suggested by Bonneville, we added language to chapter 3 to the effect that like the Douglas County Public Utility District, Bonneville will be able to quickly provide access to funds and establish reserved funds through agreements whereby its funds directly pay for the operation, maintenance, and repair of the Bureau\u2019s and the Corps\u2019 hydropower plants."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": ["Peg Reese Philip Amon Ernie Hazera Martha Vawter The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.
