GAO identified key characteristics of effective transparency tools through a literature review and interviews with experts. The information that is most relevant to consumers relates directly to their personal circumstances, such as information on specific procedures they are considering, and allows them to make meaningful distinctions among providers based on their performance. Characteristics of such relevant information include describing key differences in quality of care and costs, particularly for what consumers are likely to pay out of pocket based on their specific circumstances. In addition, effective transparency tools must take specific steps to make the information they present understandable by consumers. For example, tools must enable consumers to discern patterns by summarizing related information and allowing consumers to customize information to focus on what is most relevant to them.", "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) operates five transparency tools\u2014Nursing Home Compare, Dialysis Facility Compare, Home Health Compare, Hospital Compare and Physician Compare\u2014that are limited in their provision of relevant and understandable cost and quality information for consumers. In particular, GAO found that the tools lack relevant information on cost and provide limited information on key differences in quality of care, which hinders consumers' ability to make meaningful distinctions among providers based on their performance. Because none of the tools contain information on patients' out-of-pocket costs, they do not allow consumers to combine cost and quality information to assess the value of health care services or anticipate the cost of such services in advance.

Both HHS and CMS have set goals to report on measures that meet consumer needs. However, CMS's process for developing and selecting cost and quality measures for its tools has been heavily influenced by the concerns of providers rather than consumers.

Providers, such as hospitals or physicians,  may be paid two or three times more than similar providers for the same  health care services, without delivering higher quality of care. At the  same time, a growing proportion of health care costs are being paid by  consumers. Consumers without health insurance are generally  responsible for paying what the provider charges, rather than discounted  rates negotiated by insurance companies, while those with insurance also  face increased costs, as use of high-deductible health plans and other  forms of cost sharing have increased. In particular, consumers whose  out-of-pocket costs are based on a percentage of the total cost of care  can be especially affected by cost variations. Consumers may also face  fees associated with care received from physicians, laboratories, or  hospitals that are outside of an insurance network and bill for their  services separately.", "As consumers are asked to pay more for their care, they run the risk of  obtaining care from high-cost providers without receiving the highest  quality care. Therefore, consumers have an increased need for  transparent information on cost and quality before they receive care, so  they can make informed decisions when choosing treatments and  providers. Even when not faced with these decisions, consumers can use  such information to better anticipate and plan for expenses. Together,  information on both cost and quality enables consumers to assess the  value of health care services, for example by comparing costs within a  group of providers determined to be of high quality. Research suggests  that this transparent information is most relevant for services that can be  planned in advance, so consumers have time to consider it.

Specifically, we found this variation in cost to be present  across multiple services, settings, and geographic areas in the  information provided by the transparency tools of two different entities (a  health insurer and Castlight) that we reviewed. For example, the health  insurer reported that in the Denver area, the estimated total cost of a  laparoscopic gallbladder surgery in selected ASCs ranged between  $3,281 and $18,770 (consumers would pay between $3,281 and $6,954  in estimated out-of-pocket costs) in July 2014.

For example, research shows that most consumers do not find the  information derived from many specific process-of-care measures that  clinicians have developed and used to guide quality improvement efforts  useful. Rather, consumers are most likely to respond to information that  applies to their personal circumstances, including, for example,  information on the specific procedures consumers are considering, on  providers who would be available to perform those procedures, and on  cost estimates that take account of their particular insurance coverage.  Consumers also seek information that helps them to make meaningful  distinctions among providers in terms of cost and quality. The research  we reviewed has found that consumers value quality measures that show  differences in clinical outcomes and patient experiences, and cost  measures that show differences in out-of-pocket expenses. In addition,  consumers want to know the source of cost and quality information  because this source information helps them determine their level of  confidence in that information.", "Eight of the 15 characteristics of effective transparency tools we identified  address the extent to which a tool provides substantive quality and cost  information of relevance to consumers. Specifically, the research we  reviewed shows that more effective transparency tools:  1.  Review a broad range of services so that more consumers\u2019  particular needs are included. The more services that are covered  by a transparency tool (or set of tools), the more likely it is that the tool  will have information relevant to the particular services of interest to  any given consumer. It is especially important to include services that  are predictable and non-urgent in a transparency tool, because these  services are most likely to afford consumers the opportunity to  evaluate cost and quality information before receiving the service.  2.  Cover a broad range of providers. Transparency tools that provide  information for all or most of the available providers in a given  geographic area, regardless of network status or practice setting, give  consumers more information about their full range of options. For  example, for procedures that can be conducted in either a hospital  outpatient department or ASC, it helps consumers to provide  comparable information for both settings, so that consumers can  choose from a larger number of providers that offer those procedures.  3.  Describe key differences in clinical quality of care, particularly  patient-reported outcomes. Assessments of the clinical quality of  care that have been shown to have particular relevance to consumers  are those that relate to long-term outcomes of the care experienced  by other patients. Often this is best addressed by patient-reported  outcomes, which tell consumers the eventual outcome of treatments,  as reported by previous patients of a particular provider. For example,  patients receiving hip replacements can be asked, through such  patient-reported outcomes, to rate their ability to climb stairs both  before and after their procedures, which enables assessments of the  procedures\u2019 effects on patients\u2019 mobility.  4.  Describe key differences in patient experiences with providers.", "Another outcome that matters is patients\u2019 assessment of their  interactions with providers. Effective transparency tools include  information on how past patients evaluated providers in terms of  dimensions such as how well nurses communicate with patients, or  the responsiveness of clinicians to patients\u2019 needs.  5.  Describe key differences in costs, particularly patient out-of- pocket costs. The cost information of greatest relevance to  consumers is finding out what they will have to pay for a given service  before it occurs. For example, a tool that provides information on the  average cost of a selected procedure in a given geographic location  may be less relevant to consumers than one that takes into account  the specific costs for that procedure and location given that  consumer\u2019s specific health insurance coverage.  6.  Describe other information related to quality, where appropriate.", "There may be other quality indicators that could have major  significance to consumers for certain types of services. For example,  facility inspection results and staffing levels are of particular relevance  to nursing home care.  7.  Provide timely Information. More recent data are intrinsically more  relevant than data that are several years old. Because consumer  transparency tools necessarily rely on past data to assess likely cost  and quality performance in the future, some lag in collecting,  analyzing, and providing data is inevitable. Data that are no more than  two years old are generally considered timely.  8.  Describe key strengths and limitations of the data. Although the  research we reviewed shows that few consumers are inclined to delve  into the many methodological issues that concern appropriate  techniques for collecting, checking, and analyzing cost and quality  data, transparency tools can provide both summary assessments of  strengths and limitations for most consumers, and links to more  complete explanations for those wanting to pursue these issues in  greater detail. Such information, along with identification of the  organization responsible for the tool, provides consumers a basis to  judge the credibility of the cost and quality information provided."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effective Transparency Tools Take Steps to Make Cost and Quality Information Understandable to Consumers", "paragraphs": ["Regardless of its potential relevance to them, consumers only can  respond to information about cost and quality if they understand it.  Although cost and quality information can be inherently difficult to  understand, research suggests ways that transparency tools can make it  easier for consumers to do so. One factor that increases the difficulty of  understanding such information is the prevalence of misleading  preconceptions about the cost and quality of care. For example,  researchers find that many consumers incorrectly assume that all  hospitals and physicians provide good quality care, while others assume  that higher-cost providers will provide higher quality of care than lower- cost providers. As a result, transparency tools that address these  misleading preconceptions can better help consumers to understand the  information they present.", "Other challenges identified by researchers that consumers face include  absorbing and evaluating large amounts of information about multiple  providers across different measures of cost and quality, assessing a  provider who does relatively well on some measures of quality and less  well on others, and interpreting complex numerical information.  Therefore, it is important that transparency tools limit the amount of  information that consumers need to pay attention to and make it easy for  them to discern overall patterns. One experiment demonstrated that  improving the organization and presentation of quality information in  transparency tools led to an increased proportion of consumers who  could identify the best-performing providers for a given dimension   of quality. Specifically, with the improvements, the proportion of  consumers who could identify the best-performing providers increased  from 18 percent to 76 percent.", "Seven of the 15 characteristics of effective consumer transparency tools  we identified focus on the extent to which a tool presents its information in  a way that enables the consumer to grasp and interpret it. Specifically,  the research we reviewed shows that more effective transparency tools:  1.  Use plain language with clear graphics. Effective consumer  transparency tools use labels and descriptions that make sense to  consumers who typically are unfamiliar with clinical terminology and  who often have difficulty interpreting numerical information. Graphics,  including symbols, can help to readily convey information on relative  provider performance, especially when they are designed to display a  summary assessment of that performance as part of the symbol itself,  for example one that incorporates the words \u201csuperior\u201d or \u201cpoor\u201d.  2.  Explain purpose and value of quality performance ratings to  consumers. Effective consumer transparency tools address prevalent  misleading preconceptions by providing consumers coherent  explanations of how different quality measures relate to the aspects of  quality that consumers find relevant. These explanations work best  when they link individual measures to overarching categories  indicating what is being achieved, such as effectiveness of care,  safety, or patient-focused care.  3.  Summarize related information and organize data to highlight  patterns and facilitate consumer interpretation. Two techniques  that consumer tools can use to help consumers make sense of large  amounts of information are (a) combining information from multiple  related measures into summary or composite scores, and   (b) structuring presentation of the data in ways that make patterns  evident. For example, listing providers in rank order on selected cost  and quality dimensions greatly simplifies identification of high and low  performers.  4.  Enable consumers to customize information selected for  presentation to focus on what is most relevant to them.  Consumers differ in the priority they assign to different aspects of  quality. Tools that enable consumers to customize which quality  information is presented help consumers filter out information of  lesser consequence to them, and hone in on the information that they  find most compelling. For example, one consumer may choose to  focus on providers\u2019 capacity to communicate well with patients, while  another may focus on providers\u2019 rates of complications and infections.  5.  Enable consumers to compare quality performance of multiple  providers in one view. Transparency tools are most effective when  they present side-by-side assessments of providers\u2019 performance on  a given aspect of cost or quality, so consumers can most easily  compare providers.  6.  Enable consumers to assess cost and quality information  together. Consumers cannot make judgments about the value of the  care offered by providers unless they can consider both cost and  quality in relation to each other. For example, transparency tools can  enable consumers to rank order available providers first on selected  measures of quality, and then, within the high-quality group, show  those with lower costs.  7.  Enable easy use and navigation of the tool. Unless consumers can  quickly find information of interest to them, they are likely to quickly  dismiss the potential utility of a consumer transparency tool and move  on. Extensive testing with consumers can help public and private  entities providing transparency tools to develop intuitive, user-friendly  approaches to website navigation and for manipulating how the data  are presented."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CMS Transparency Tools Are Limited in Their Provision of Relevant and Understandable Cost and Quality Information for Consumers", "paragraphs": ["The CMS transparency tools we evaluated are limited in the relevance  and understandability of cost and quality information they provide to  consumers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "CMS Transparency Tools Lack Certain Relevant Information Needed to Make Meaningful Distinctions about the Cost and Quality of Providers", "paragraphs": ["Based on the characteristics we identified concerning information  provided to consumers by effective transparency tools, we found that  CMS\u2019s tools demonstrate a number of the characteristics of effective  transparency tools, such as timeliness of data; however, the tools lack  relevant information on cost and key differences in quality of care.

Although the CMS tools demonstrate other characteristics of  effective transparency tools, such as explaining the purpose and value of  the performance information reported in the tools, and providing the  capacity to compare up to three providers side by side, the limitations we  identified may hinder consumers\u2019 ability to understand and use the  information provided. (See Appendix 2 for our assessment of how CMS  tools compared to the 15 characteristics of effective tools identified  through our literature review and interviews with experts.)", "The tools generally do not use clear language and symbols. Although  consumers can follow links to a separate page to obtain plain-language  explanations of quality measures, the labels for the actual results of the  tools often use fairly technical terms. For example, one quality measure  for heart attack patients is labeled \u201cheart attack patients given fibrinolytic  medication within 30 minutes of arrival.\u201d In addition, many of the quality  measures are reported in numerical form, most often as percentages.  With the exception of the \u201cfive-star\u201d ratings currently limited to Nursing  Home Compare, none of the other CMS tools use symbols to help  consumers interpret the meaning of the information provided.", "Additionally, the CMS tools also generally do not summarize results for  consumers\u2014with the exception of Nursing Home Compare\u2014or organize  data to highlight patterns. The Nursing Home Compare tool\u2019s five-star  rating system provides overall assessments of performance in three  major categories\u2014health inspections, quality measures, and staffing\u2014 each of which summarizes a set of individual measures in those  categories that the tool also reports. CMS officials told us that the agency   In  plans to expand this five-star rating system to its other tools by 2015.addition, CMS generally has not structured the presentation of the  information in its tools in a way that helps consumers detect patterns in  provider performance. For example, consumers may choose up to three  providers to compare, but must do so from lists in which the providers are  sequenced in alphabetical order or by distance from a geographic  location, not in rank order according to provider performance.consumers have to sort through the information themselves if they want  to identify the top performing providers.", "In addition, the CMS tools provide consumers very limited ability to  customize what information is presented, which may not be sufficient to  allow consumers to focus on information most relevant to them. the CMS tools typically allow consumers to filter providers for  consideration based on their geographic location and whether the  provider offers one or more of a particular set of services. Expanding the  options available to consumers to customize the information presented on  cost and quality according to their individual situations and priorities  would allow them to reduce the amount of information that they must  review to identify providers that meet their needs.", "For the purposes of our review, customizing information refers to the ability of  consumers to select from the quality measures offered in the tool those that are relevant  to their personal situation. organizing the tools\u2019 information in rank order according to provider  performance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CMS Has Taken Limited Steps to Expand Access to Cost and Quality Information, but Has Not Established Procedures to Ensure This Information Meets Consumer Needs", "paragraphs": ["CMS has taken limited steps in three key areas to expand information on  cost and quality and increase transparency to consumers and others.

According  to research conducted to support CMS public reporting efforts, CMS uses  the tools to create an incentive for providers to improve the quality of care  they deliver. By publically reporting how providers compare to their peers,  CMS intends providers to be able to identify shortcomings in their  performance that can be improved. However, research we reviewed  demonstrates that information used to motivate providers can be different  from information needed by consumers. Consequently, researchers who  have assessed CMS\u2019s tools have raised the question of whether CMS  can ensure that tools intended to influence provider quality can also  provide consumers with the cost and quality information they need.", "According to consumer transparency experts we interviewed and  research we reviewed, CMS\u2019s processes for measure development and  selection do not adequately address consumer needs.

For example:  In 2013, CMS updated its requirements for measure development  contracts to address the needs of consumers. Specifically, contractors  are required to include patient or caregiver participation on technical  expert panels, which are a part of the measure development  process. According to one CMS official, the requirements do not  specifically dictate how contractors must involve these consumers, but  rather asks contractors to consider meaningful ways to include them.  They also do not specify how contractors will be evaluated on their  ability to meet consumer needs or specifically define expected results.  According to the CMS official, only two measure contracts have taken  effect since the requirements were updated, so it will take time to  determine the extent to which they may improve the development of  cost and quality measures of particular relevance to consumers.", "CMS also has begun to solicit consumer input in the selection of  measures included in its transparency tools. In 2011, HHS convened  the Measure Applications Partnership (MAP), a consensus-based  group that includes representatives of consumer as well as provider  and other stakeholder organizations, to furnish CMS with input on the  selection of measures to include in its transparency tools and  payment programs. Although the inclusion of consumer organizations  in the MAP gives consumers an opportunity to influence measure  selection, both a CMS official and a MAP member said that the  concerns of provider organizations, which command greater technical  expertise on measurement methodology and therefore are better  prepared to advocate for their own selection preferences, tend to take  priority.", "Aligning cost and quality measurement. CMS, along with several other  HHS agencies, collaborates with multiple consumer organizations, state  and private sector entities that also collect and report cost and quality  data, to work toward agreement on an aligned core set of cost and quality  measures. According to HHS\u2019s National Quality Strategy, providers are  often asked to submit quality and other information to multiple payers,  including Medicare, and having a consistent, or aligned, set of measures  can help facilitate the collection of this information. Transparency experts  have indicated that such alignment could not only reduce the providers\u2019  reporting burden, but it could also lead to more consistent information on  provider performance. However, according to a CMS official and an  expert involved in the alignment efforts, the extent to which this promise is  fulfilled remains to be seen, both in terms of the number and breadth of  the measures for which an agreed alignment is reached, as well as how  effectively the agreement ensures uniform application of the aligned  measures. In addition, according to experts we interviewed, the extent to  which this movement toward measure alignment benefits consumers will  depend on the extent to which the agreed-upon set of measures are  relevant to consumer concerns.", "Releases of claims data. In addition to the quality data published  through the Compare sites, CMS has begun to publicly report information  on provider costs based on Medicare fee-for-service claims data.  Specifically, beginning in 2013, CMS began releasing large data sets  containing partially aggregated payment data on individual physicians and  hospitals. According to experts we interviewed, the release of these data  help to promote the concept of transparency. However, these experts  noted that the lack of patient-level information in the files prevents even  rudimentary risk adjustment\u2014adjustments based on differences in  patients\u2014which precludes using these data to supply cost and claims- data-based quality information for state and private sector transparency  tools.", "CMS has released more detailed patient-level claims data to CMS- approved qualified entities (QE).

CMS\u2019s transparency tools\u2014five Compare websites\u2014are one way  the agency has provided cost and quality information to consumers.  However, CMS addresses multiple strategic aims with these tools,  including both informing consumers and incentivizing providers to  improve the quality of their care. Partly as a result, the tools exhibit critical  weaknesses when assessed in terms of the characteristics that would  make them most effective for consumers. For example, the tools lack  information on topics of considerable relevance to consumers, such as  patient-reported outcome measures and patient out-of-pocket costs.  Additionally, the tools do not organize cost and quality information in a  way that may enable consumers to readily understand and compare  provider performance, or customize how the information is presented to  enable consumers to identify the best providers for aspects of care that  they may find most relevant. While providing relevant and understandable  information on cost and the ability to compare it with provider quality is  inherently complex, consumers need this information to determine if  different providers or settings provide a greater overall value for care they  expect to receive and to determine what their health care expenses will  be in advance.", "Although HHS has set goals to promote transparency for consumers,  and, largely through CMS, has taken steps to expand available cost and  quality information, CMS has not established procedures or performance  metrics to ensure that this information is relevant and understandable to  consumers.

In  particular, CMS\u2019s process for developing and selecting cost and quality  measures for its tools has been heavily influenced by the concerns of  providers rather than consumers, which helps to account for the relative  lack of cost and quality information in CMS\u2019s tools that consumers would  find relevant. Especially in such situations where agencies are responding  to multiple priorities, leading practices for strategic planning call for  establishing specific procedures and performance metrics to ensure that  each of those priorities receives due attention.
