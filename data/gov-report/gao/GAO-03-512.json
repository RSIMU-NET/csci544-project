The Section 202 program, which offers about 260,000 rental units nationwide and ensures that residents receive rental assistance and access to services that promote independent living, is the only federal program devoted exclusively to providing this type of housing. However, even with the program's exclusive focus, Section 202 has reached only about an estimated 8 percent of very low income elderly households. About three-quarters of Section 202 projects in GAO's analysis did not meet HUD's time guideline for gaining approval to start construction. These delays held up the delivery of housing assistance to needy elderly households by nearly a year compared with projects that met HUD's guideline. Several factors contributed to these delays, in particular capital advances that were not sufficient to cover development costs. Project sponsors reported that insufficient capital advances often forced them to spend time seeking additional funds from HUD and other sources. Although HUD's policy is to provide sufficient funding to cover the cost of constructing a modestly designed project, HUD has acknowledged that its capital advances for the Section 202 program sometimes fall short. Other factors affecting the timeliness of the approval process include inadequate training and guidance for field staff responsible for the approval process, inexperienced project sponsors, and local zoning and permit requirements."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD),  the most widespread and urgent housing problem facing elderly  households is affordability\u2014that is, finding housing that is not too  expensive relative to household income. In 2001, there were about 26  million households nationwide in which the householder or householder\u2019s  spouse was 62 years or older. Of these elderly households, about 3.3  million were renters with very low incomes, which HUD defines as 50  percent or less of area median income. The Section 202 Supportive Housing  for the Elderly Program (the Section 202 program) provides funds to  nonprofit organizations to develop affordable rental housing exclusively  for very low income elderly households that are not receiving other forms  of housing assistance. In fiscal year 2002, the Section 202 program received  about $783 million in appropriations to fund, among other things, the  construction of over 6,000 rental units.", "The Section 202 program provides two types of financial support to  nonprofit sponsors that develop and operate projects. First, project  sponsors receive a capital advance, or a grant, to cover land and  construction costs for projects of modest design that comply with HUD\u2019s  minimum property standards. HUD determines the amounts of capital  advances using its published development cost limits, adjusted for areas  with high construction costs. HUD\u2019s policy is to have the capital advance  cover total development costs without the need for sponsors to obtain  additional funding from other sources. Second, after the project is  completed and elderly tenants move in, the sponsor receives monthly  rental assistance payments to defray some of the operating expenses. The  combination of a debt-free project and rental assistance payments enables  project sponsors to offer units at rents that are generally equal to 30  percent of the renter\u2019s income. Section 202 also has requirements to ensure  that sponsors make the appropriate supportive services, such as  housekeeping and transportation, available to elderly tenants.", "Each year HUD announces the availability of Section 202 funds. Potential  project sponsors submit their applications for these funds to HUD\u2019s field  offices. An application includes the description of the sponsor\u2019s nonprofit  status, past experiences in providing housing and supportive services, and  the housing needs of the elderly in the market area to be served. Once the  applications are ranked according to criteria published in the Federal  Register, field offices make their selection recommendations to HUD  headquarters. If HUD headquarters approves these recommendations, HUD  reserves funds for these proposed projects and sends notification letters to  project sponsors. Between the time HUD sends notification letters and  approves the start of construction, the sponsors\u2019 must complete, and HUD  must approve, design plans and other documentation. These actions are  referred to as project processing. Generally, 45 of HUD\u2019s 81 field offices are  responsible for processing Section 202 projects.", "HUD\u2019s guidelines stipulate that HUD field offices and project sponsors  should complete project processing within 18 months of the date the  funding is awarded.   However, the field offices may grant extensions of up  to 6 months. Delays in processing hold up the distribution of funds and  contribute to the program\u2019s annual unexpended balances. Between fiscal  years 1998 and 2002, for example, the program\u2019s unexpended balances  increased from about $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion. Delays in processing also  hinder efforts to provide much-needed housing to very low income elderly  renter households.", "This report addresses the role of the Section 202 program in responding to  the housing affordability needs of elderly renter households with very low  incomes and the program\u2019s timeliness in processing projects for  construction and expending appropriated funds. As agreed with your  offices, our report discusses: (1) the role of the Section 202 program in  meeting the housing needs of elderly renter households with very low  incomes, (2) the extent to which Section 202 projects meet HUD\u2019s time  guideline for project processing, and (3) the factors that keep Section 202  projects from meeting HUD\u2019s time guideline for project processing.", "To address these objectives, we analyzed data from the American Housing  Survey and other sources on the affordability of rental housing for very low  income elderly households and the levels of assistance the Section 202  program provides. In addition, we reviewed HUD program and budget  data, surveyed all HUD field offices that process Section 202 projects,  conducted site visits at selected offices, surveyed and interviewed project  sponsors and consultants experienced in working with the Section 202  program, and observed a HUD training program on processing Section 202  projects. Unless stated otherwise, our analysis focused on Section 202  projects funded between fiscal years 1998 and 2000. Lack of reliable  program data prevented us from reviewing all Section 202 projects funded  before fiscal year 1998.

A large majority of these elderly households were  homeowners. The homeownership rate was considerably higher for elderly  households than for nonelderly households (fig.1). A smaller share of  elderly households (19 percent) rented their homes. These elderly renter  households comprised about 15 percent of all renter households  nationwide.", "The Housing Act of 1959 (P.L. 86-372) established the Section 202 program,  which began as a direct loan program that provided below-market interest  rate loans to private nonprofit developers, among others, to build rental  housing for the elderly and people with disabilities. In 1990, the Cranston- Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (P.L. 101-625) modified Section  202 by converting it from a direct loan program into a capital advance  program. In addition, the 1990 act created Section 811, another capital  advance program, to produce housing specifically for people with  disabilities and limited Section 202 to housing for the elderly.", "In its current form, Section 202 provides capital advances\u2014effectively  grants\u2014to private nonprofit organizations (usually referred to as sponsors  or owners) to pay for the costs of developing elderly rental housing. As  long as rents on the units remain within the program\u2019s guidelines for at  least 40 years, the sponsor does not have to pay back the capital advance.  HUD calculates capital advances in accordance with development cost  limits that it determines annually. These limits must account for several  factors, including the costs of construction, reconstruction, or  rehabilitation of supportive housing for the elderly that meets applicable  state and local housing and building codes. HUD must, by statute, use  current data that reflect these costs for each market area. HUD\u2019s policy is  that these limits should cover the reasonable and necessary costs of  developing a project of modest design that complies with HUD\u2019s minimum  property standards, accessibility requirements, and project design and cost  standards. Once HUD calculates a capital advance, the amount is placed on  reserve, and the funds are made available to the sponsor.", "To be eligible to receive Section 202 housing assistance, tenants must have  (1) one household member who is at least 62 years old and (2) household  income that does not exceed the program\u2019s income limits. HUD has  established general income categories that it and other federal agencies use  to determine eligibility for many federal rental housing assistance  programs (table 1). These amounts are subject to adjustments in areas  with unusually high or low incomes or housing costs and are published.  Only very low income households\u2014those with incomes below 50 percent  of the area\u2019s median income\u2014are eligible for the Section 202 program.", "Very low income households in Section 202 projects generally pay 30  percent of their income for rent. Because tenants\u2019 rent payments are not  sufficient to cover the property\u2019s operating costs, the project sponsor  receives an operating subsidy from HUD, called a project rental assistance  contract. Under the project rental assistance contract, HUD pays the  difference between the property\u2019s operating expenses (as approved by  HUD) and total tenant rental receipts. Section 202 rental assistance is a  project-based subsidy and, as such, is tied to rental units. The households  receiving assistance can benefit from a project-based subsidy only while  living in Section 202 units.", "For fiscal year 2002, Congress appropriated about $783 million for the  Section 202 program to fund the construction of over 6,000 new units as  well as new multiyear rental assistance contracts, service coordinators,  renewals of expiring rental assistance contracts, and other activities as  authorized by Section 202. From year to year, the Section 202 program has  carried balances of unexpended appropriated dollars. According to HUD,  in fiscal year 2002, the unexpended balance for Section 202 was  approximately $5.2 billion. About 41 percent of this balance was for capital  advance funds and 59 percent for rental assistance funds. Generally, some  of the program\u2019s unexpended funds have not yet been awarded to projects,  and others are attributable to projects that have not begun construction.  Once construction begins, funds are expended over several years during  the construction phase and during the term of the project rental assistance  contract.

Nationwide,  about 1.7 of the 3.3 million elderly renter households with very low  incomes have a housing affordability problem.   Section 202 insulates  tenants in housing units subsidized by the program from increases in  housing costs by limiting rents to 30 percent of household income. The  program is a significant source of new and affordable housing for very low  income elderly households: in 2001, 1.3 million such households received  government housing assistance (about 40 percent of the total), and Section  202 provided housing for roughly one-fifth of them.

According to the American Housing Survey,  in 2001 about 1.7 million households paid over 30 percent of their income  for rent.

As figure 2  illustrates, about 35 percent (over 1 million) of all elderly renter  households with very low incomes had severe rent burdens, and about 15  percent (about 500,000) had moderate rent burdens. For detailed data on  housing needs of these households, including data for metropolitan and  nonmetropolitan areas, see appendix III.", "Since Section 202 provides projects with rental assistance payments that  cover a portion of the rent for each unit, the tenants themselves pay rents  that equal a percentage of their household incomes\u2014generally 30 percent.  This percentage remains constant, so the amount of rent tenants pay  increases only when household income rises, protecting them from rent  increases that might be imposed in the private housing market when, for  example, market conditions change. In contrast, low income elderly renter  households that do not receive this type of assistance\u2014especially those  with very low incomes\u2014are vulnerable to high rent burdens and increases  in housing costs. Most of these households have few or no financial  resources, such as cash savings and other investments, and rely primarily  on fixed incomes that may not increase at the same rate as housing costs.", "Section 202 serves another important function, potentially allowing  households to live independently longer by offering tenants a range of  services that support independent living\u2014for example, meal services,  housekeeping, personal assistance, and transportation. HUD ensures that  sponsors have the managerial capacity to assess residents\u2019 needs,  coordinate the provision of supportive services, and seek new sources of  assistance to ensure long-term support.

Considering the urgent housing needs of the  Section 202 program\u2019s target population, ensuring that its projects are  completed as soon as possible is critical. Delays in timely Section 202  processing can prolong project completion, on average, by nearly a year  and result in higher balances of unexpended funds. Awarding capital  advances that are sufficient to cover project development costs can  alleviate delays by averting the need for sponsors to seek secondary  financing or request approval from HUD headquarters for additional  funding. While sufficient capital advance funding for projects, absent  additional appropriations, can result in fewer units funded annually, it can  also result in the prompt delivery of housing assistance to needy  households and in the reduction of unexpended balances attributable to  delayed projects. In addition, issuing an updated program handbook and  providing adequate formal training can help in timely project processing by  ensuring that staff are accountable for applying and interpreting HUD  policies and procedures in a consistent manner. Finally, HUD\u2019s project  monitoring system, in its current form, is not as effective as it can be and  may hinder HUD\u2019s oversight.

Also relevant to this  report, AHS is known to underreport income when compared to the  Current Population Survey and other independent sources. However, our  analysis concentrates on elderly renters with very low income, for which  this should be less of an issue. According to a Census study based on  relatively older data (from the early 1980s), much of the underreporting of  income in the survey seems to derive from interest and dividend income as  well as wages and salary. Consequently, the underreporting of income may  be less of a problem among very low income elderly households who do  not tend to rely on these sources of income. Generally, HUD\u2019s own internal  analysis suggests that very low income renters in AHS tend to report their  income more accurately than other groups. For example, in an unpublished  analysis, HUD found that the income reported by very low income renters  in the 1989 AHS was about 2 percent greater than the income reported in  the 1990 Decennial Census.
