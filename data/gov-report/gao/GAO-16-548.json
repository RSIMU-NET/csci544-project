Over a 10-year period (2005 to 2014), GAO found that agencies used an annual average of approximately 2,000 SGEs, with a peak of about 3,100 in 2009 and a low of about 500 in 2013.", "Agencies are responsible for reporting on SGEs not serving on federal boards to OGE. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) requires agencies to identify SGEs on an individual's personnel action. OGE's data reflected what agencies reported on SGEs not serving on federal boards. Three of the five agencies GAO reviewed had challenges reporting reliable data on SGEs not serving on federal boards. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) had difficulty distinguishing between SGEs not serving on federal boards and those who were, and HHS did not explain data discrepancies. GAO found instances of misidentified SGEs not serving on federal boards at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the Department of State (State), but the agencies provided corrected data. Weak internal coordination and misunderstanding about the SGE designation contributed to the identification challenges. Stronger data would better position agencies to report on SGEs and provide the required ethics training. Moreover, accurate and complete data are important to allow OGE and Congress to provide informed oversight of agencies.", "Three of the five selected agencies primarily used expert and consultant hiring authorities to appoint SGEs not serving on federal boards. The other two agencies generally used their agency-specific authorities. The agencies used these employees in specialized areas (see figure). Four of five agencies said supervisors are generally responsible for tracking SGEs' days of service. One agency permits SGEs to track their own days.", "OGE has not found any issues specific to SGEs not serving on federal boards. GAO's analysis of 23 OGE reviews at Chief Financial Officers Act agencies and the Consumer Financial Protection Board for fiscal years 1998 to 2014 showed no issues specific to SGEs not serving on federal boards.

To help address our second and third objectives, we  selected five case study agencies: Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS), Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of State  (State), National Science Foundation (NSF), and Nuclear Regulatory  Commission (NRC). We based our selection on criteria such as the  number of SGEs, the size of the agency, OGE ethics program review  results, and the ratio of SGEs not serving on federal boards compared to  the agency\u2019s 2-year on-board average of all employees, among other  criteria. We analyzed OGE\u2019s, OPM\u2019s, and selected agencies\u2019 data on the  number of SGEs at CFO Act agencies and CFPB between fiscal and  calendar years 2005 and 2014.

For two agencies, we  found several instances of misidentified SGEs and, after discussion with  the agencies, they provided corrected data. We found that one of the  selected agencies, HHS, provided unreliable effective dates for SGEs not  serving on federal boards. We found that the OPM data did not have  complete information that would allow us to report on annual totals of  SGEs not serving on federal boards in the executive branch agencies.", "To assess how selected agencies appoint, utilize, and oversee SGEs, we  examined agency documentation and interviewed agency officials on the  (1) process for designating and hiring SGEs not serving on federal  boards; (2) hiring authorities used; (3) internal coordination among hiring,  ethics, and general counsel offices; (4) types of roles and responsibilities  SGEs performed; and (5) agency tracking of whether SGEs\u2019 stay within  the 130-day service estimate. To examine how, if at all, OGE oversees  and ensures compliance with ethics requirements for SGEs, we examined  selected agency documentation and interviewed officials on OGE ethics  program reviews and open recommendations.

An individual hired under a  temporary appointment can be designated a SGE where the employing  agency makes a good-faith estimate that the individual is not expected to  serve more than 130 days in the succeeding 1-year period. Under the  executive branch\u2019s longstanding interpretation, while SGEs are expected  to serve no more than 130 days in a 1-year period, if an individual was  designated a SGE but unexpectedly exceeds the 130 days of service,  that person is still considered a SGE for the current year. However, OGE  advises that if the SGE is to serve beyond the 1-year period, the agency  will need to make a new estimate for the following year, and the prior  year\u2019s experience will have a bearing on whether the agency reasonably  can conclude that the employee is likely to serve no more than 130 days  in the next year (see appendix II for a legislative history of the  establishment of the SGE status).", "SGEs are covered by most ethics rules, but the application of some of  those rules to SGEs is less restrictive than for other employees and  permits them to engage in more outside activities (see appendix III for a  comparative overview of select ethics rules for SGEs and other  employees). Employees of the executive branch are covered under  numerous prohibitions and requirements set forth under statute (criminal  and noncriminal), executive order, and regulation. The criminal statutes  establishing the foundation for acceptable conduct while serving the  public include the bribery and illegal gratuities prohibitions (18 U.S.C. \u00a7  201) and the criminal conflict of interest prohibitions (principally 18 U.S.C.  \u00a7\u00a7 203, 205, 207, 208, and 209).", "SGEs are covered by most, but not all, of these criminal statutes and in  some instances are afforded distinct treatment from other employees.  Like other employees, SGEs are subject to prohibitions on bribery and  illegal gratuities, and prohibited from participating in matters that directly  affect their own financial interests (or the financial interests of individuals  or entities attributed to the employee). SGEs are generally not afforded  special treatment under the various post-employment bans on the  activities of former employees. However, SGEs are subject to  substantially narrower restrictions than other employees on their outside  representational activities (including the receipt of compensation related  to such activities).", "As illustrated in figure 1 below, SGEs are not covered under the ban on  outside supplementation of government salaries. More specifically, a  regular employee cannot receive compensation from anyone (other than  the government) for performing government service. SGEs are subject to  the standards of conduct regulations, which implement the principles of  ethical conduct established under Executive Order No. 12674, and  prohibits SGEs from, among other things, receiving compensation for  teaching, speaking, and writing that is undertaken as part of the  employee\u2019s official duties. While the treatment of SGEs is generally the  same as for other employees under these standards of conduct, there are  exceptions.", "Apart from the government-wide ethics requirements, some agencies  have developed supplemental agency-specific ethics requirements  covering their employees, including SGEs.

However, OGE stated that pursuant to the  executive branch\u2019s longstanding interpretation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 202, a  proper designation requires a prospective good faith determination at the  time of an appointment that the individual is not expected to perform  services for more than 130 days of the succeeding 1-year period. OGE  believes that a prospective determination is important so that employees  are on notice with respect to the ethics laws and rules that will apply to  them.", "To help carry out its oversight role, OGE collects data on agency ethics  programs. Executive branch agencies are required to submit an annual  report to OGE concerning certain aspects of their ethics programs. OGE  provides an annual questionnaire to each executive branch agency to  assist agencies in fulfilling this requirement. The annual questionnaire  covers a range of issues, including the agency\u2019s ethics program structure  and staffing, as well as ethics education and training policies. According  to agency officials, OGE also uses the annual questionnaire to gain  knowledge about individual programs as well the overall program and to  make informed decisions about agency resource allocations and  priorities.", "OPM provides guidance to agencies on government-wide hiring  authorities to ensure that agencies properly utilize these authorities, such  as the expert and consultant appointment authority, which may be used to  on-board employees ultimately categorized as SGEs (see appendix IV for  examples of government-wide hiring authorities used by selected  agencies to hire SGEs). OPM requires all federal agencies to identify that  an employee is a SGE on the government records documenting an  individual\u2019s personnel action\u2014Standard Form 50. Agencies also can  identify an employee as a SGE by using a specific remark code\u2014E21 on  the personnel action form.

The use of the specific remarks code for SGE is  not mandatory for agencies.", "At individual agencies, multiple offices may play a role in on-boarding and  designating SGEs. Those offices may include the hiring or appointing  office, the human capital office, the ethics office, and the office of general  counsel. Generally, the hiring office takes the lead role in identifying the  skill set and length of service needs. The agency\u2019s human capital office  advises on the appropriate use of hiring authorities, processes the  personnel action to on-board the SGE, and enters the personnel action  information into the personnel database. Agencies are required to identify  the SGE designation on the personnel action Standard Form 50. The  agency\u2019s ethics office is responsible for training employees, including  SGEs, on their ethics requirements so that they are able to identify  potential problems and seek the advice and counsel of ethics officials,  when appropriate. Ethics offices may also provide technical assistance to  the hiring office by advising on how to make a good faith service days  estimate for the purposes of making a SGE designation, and evaluating  whether the individual has potential conflicts of interest. At agencies  where the ethics functions are not within the general counsel\u2019s office, then  the agency\u2019s general counsel\u2019s office may also have a role in helping to  ensure that ethics statutes and regulations are applied appropriately to a  SGE."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agencies\u2019 Use of SGEs Not Serving on Federal Boards Is Limited", "paragraphs": ["OGE data show SGEs not serving on federal boards make up a small  portion of total SGEs in the executive branch.

OGE officials  believe publicizing agency responses will increase reporting  accountability. Also, in 2014, OGE officials convened focus groups with  executive branch ethics officials to identify any challenges with  understanding ethics reporting requirements, including for SGEs, in the  annual questionnaire. In 2015, OGE officials added a skip-ahead feature  to its annual questionnaire to help streamline agencies\u2019 responses. This  feature helps to prevent agencies from responding to questions that are  not germane to their agency. OGE also directed executive branch  agencies to centralize their annual reporting strategy by requiring that all  submissions be sent to OGE directly from the CFO Act department, rather  than from component agencies. Through these and other efforts, OGE  officials said their goals are to expand the reach of ethics guidance for  federal employees, and to increase both the consistency and the  accuracy of ethics training across the executive branch.

HHS experienced  difficulty identifying employees categorized as SGEs not serving on  federal boards, in part, because the departmental human capital office is  not consistently coordinating with human capital offices in its components  or with the Office of the General Counsel, Ethics Division to ensure that  SGEs not serving on federal boards are appropriately identified. In  addition, HHS\u2019s human capital officials misunderstood the SGE  designation and, at times during our audit, could not distinguish between  SGEs not serving on federal boards and SGEs who serve on federal  advisory boards, committees, or commissions.

Selected agencies said such conversions are infrequent. Generally, a  conversion is a change of appointment (under either the same or a  different appointment authority) in the same agency without a break in  service.

For example, a conversion action into an expert position  under section 3109 would have to comply with the requirements under  that authority, including that the expert position requires the services of a  specialist with skills superior to those of others in the same activity, and  that the individual to be appointed is regarded as an authority or  practitioner of unusual competence and skill in a professional, scientific,  technical, or other activity. These conversions included:", "DOJ officials reported that a senior noncareer employee, who wished to return to academia, resigned and the following day was appointed to an intermittent consultant position. The consultant appointment was not to exceed 5 months and therefore since the employee would be in a temporary appointment that would not exceed 130 days, the employee was a SGE. Agency officials explained that the conversion was justified because there were a number of pending matters for which the office had a continuing need for the employee\u2019s expertise, which they viewed as essential for program stability.", "NRC officials reported two instances when regular employees became SGEs through conversion actions. In both instances, retired NRC employees had been reemployed as regular (non-SGE) employees. Subsequently, both employees\u2019 appointments were converted to consultant appointments (in conformance with NRC\u2019s guidance on consultants), resulting in the employees becoming SGEs. NRC said the conversions resulted from changes to the work assignments and responsibilities of both individuals.", "State officials reported that a senior presidential appointee, who  intended to retire, was appointed to an expert/consultant position,  resulting in the employee becoming a SGE.

HHS also used SGEs not  serving on a federal board to 1) advise and consult on acquiring  materials for its medical library to administer health coaching  programs, 2) develop and implement a health coaching program, and  3) advise on a strategy to achieve accreditation for one of its  operating divisions.", "At NRC, SGEs often served in areas such as engineering, scientific,  and other technical (professional) occupational series. NRC SGEs  roles and responsibilities included providing services related to  security administration, human factors, budget analysis, technical  writing and editing, and visual information.", "At State, SGEs most often served as Foreign Affairs officers, senior  advisors, management analysts, and physical scientists.

Our analysis of 23 OGE reviews conducted at the CFO Act and  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for fiscal years 2005 to 2014  showed no issues specific to SGEs not serving on federal boards.  According to OGE and officials at our selected agencies, at the time of  our review, there were no outstanding OGE recommendations at the five  agencies.", "OGE primarily conducts two types of ethics program reviews: plenary  reviews and inspections. During a plenary review, OGE generally  examines all elements of an agency\u2019s ethics program, including its  structure and general administration; public and confidential financial disclosure process; ethics training, advice, and counseling program; enforcement of ethics-related statutes and regulations, including  supplemental standards of conduct regulations; and administration of its ethics program as it applies specifically to  advisory committees and SGEs.", "As part of the plenary reviews, OGE evaluates whether an agency made  an affirmative determination as to whether or not a member of an  advisory committee is a SGE rather than a representative. OGE officials  said this helps ensure that those advisory committee members who will  be expected to provide advice to the government (rather than on behalf of  a group or industry the member represents) are designated as SGEs and  therefore appropriately covered by ethics and conflicts of interest  provisions. In 2015, OGE\u2019s Program Review Branch examined all ethics  program review reports issued from January 1, 2009, through September  30, 2015, to determine how they addressed issues involving SGEs. The  examination covered 238 review reports and identified model practices  related to SGEs and recommendations, and suggestions regarding  management of SGEs during the specified period.", "According to OGE officials, the majority of the recommendations OGE  makes about SGEs following plenary reviews are focused on the  determinations agencies made between designating an advisory  committee member as a representative or as a SGE. According to OGE  officials, an agency that fails to properly designate a member of an  advisory committee as a SGE, but rather designates the member as a  representative, poses a risk to the government because that member is  not subject to ethics and conflicts of interest provisions (including agency  reviews for conflicts of interest). Based on its reviews and the results from  its annual questionnaire, OGE officials said they believe agencies are  more routinely properly designating advisory committee members as  SGEs in recent years.", "According to OGE, its inspections are a streamlined version of the  plenary review process. Inspections focus on the core elements of an  agency\u2019s ethics program, which include overall program administration,  public and confidential financial disclosure systems, ethics training, and  ethics advice and counseling. Inspections do not focus specifically on  advisory committees or SGEs. However, if a concern specific to SGEs  was to be identified during the inspection, the issue would be addressed  and noted in the inspection report.

However, agencies may have reporting  challenges as a result of weak internal coordination among offices with a  role in designating and identifying SGEs not serving on boards and  misunderstandings about which individuals are in this category. Although  OGE has taken recent steps to improve agencies\u2019 reporting, the reliability  of agencies\u2019 data is dependent on how well they coordinate internally and  how well agencies understand the SGE designation. Given the  misunderstanding about SGEs that we found at selected agencies,  additional research may be needed to determine whether other agencies  are experiencing challenges similar to those we identified at selected  agencies. Stronger internal coordination among offices that maintain SGE  data would strengthen the SGE data that agencies report to OGE and  OPM. In particular, unless HHS takes steps to reconcile differences  between data held by components and its headquarters, and reconcile  differences in data held by its ethics office with data held by its human  capital office, the agency cannot be assured of the reliability of its data on  SGEs not serving on federal boards.

During congressional testimony, examples were provided  concerning the impact the existing conflict of interest laws had on agency  recruitment. For example, an attorney declined a position on an advisory  committee concerning the civil service system because he was  concerned that to serve he would have to resign from his firm, which  represented individuals in their dealings with federal agencies (such as  the Internal Revenue Service). In another example, an individual who had  served full time in the Department of State but left was asked to return as  a part-time consultant to leverage the considerable knowledge he had  acquired while employed with the department overseas. He declined  because the application of the law would have exposed him to criminal  liability.", "Prior to the act, most of the existing laws originated in the 19th Century,  at a time when persons outside the government rarely served as  consultants or advisers. Therefore, the laws were aimed at the activities  of regular full-time employees, rather than at a consultant or other  temporary employee whose main work was performed outside the  government. While Congress had recognized the adverse impact these  laws had on temporary employees and granted specific statutory  exemptions from time to time, this approach created an inconsistent  range of exemptions. To address this issue, Congress created a uniform  means of imposing special rules on all temporary employees expected to  serve within specified time limits.
