NAICS codes are the basis for SBA's size standards; therefore, the code that the contracting officer assigns determines whether a firm is eligible for federal contracting preferences, such as small business set-asides. The contracting officers GAO interviewed cited several factors that affect their assignment of NAICS codes, including information on the work to be performed and input from agency small business specialists. However, they stated that assigning a NAICS code can be challenging when one or more codes could apply to a contract. In the 2013 rule, SBA clarified that under certain circumstances, contracting officers may assign more than one code to multiple-award contracts. Such contracts are awarded to two or more contractors under a single solicitation and include indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contracts used when quantities and timing are not known at the time of the award. However, updates to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)\u2014the rules governing the federal government's purchasing process\u2014are required to fully implement SBA's final rule. The agencies GAO interviewed plan to implement this rule after it is adopted into the FAR and they can make necessary updates to their information technology for contracting. This FAR rule-making process is ongoing.", "Some industry groups and firms GAO interviewed expressed concerns about how contracting officers assign NAICS codes, but SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) dismissed most appeals and denied more than half of the remaining appeals. Some industry groups and firms GAO interviewed expressed concerns that contracting officers may assign NAICS codes based on the size standard (thereby affecting the number of firms that can compete as a small business) and not the work to be performed. However, some also stated it was difficult to determine how often this practice occurs, and OHA officials noted it is the office's role to review the appropriateness of appealed NAICS codes, not the contracting officer's intention when assigning the code. Of the 62 NAICS code appeals that were filed in calendar years 2014\u20132016, OHA dismissed 35, denied 15, and granted 12 (see fig.).

To understand how  these selected agencies assign NAICS codes to contracts, we reviewed  contract documentation, such as acquisition plans and market research  documents, for one ID/IQ contract from each of the agencies and  interviewed the relevant contracting officers, small business specialists,  and SBA procurement center representatives (PCR). We also selected  and reviewed 10 orders from each contract and compared the order  purposes to the base award purposes. To determine the status of  ongoing efforts to clarify code assignment, we reviewed proposed and  final regulatory changes and interviewed officials at SBA and the General  Services Administration (GSA) (the agency responsible for managing the  operation, maintenance, and updating of FPDS-NG). To assess the  reliability of the FPDS-NG data we used, we conducted electronic testing  for missing data, outliers, and inconsistent coding, and compared the data  on selected contracts to contract documentation we obtained. We  determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  determining ID/IQ obligations and identifying trends in NAICS codes  assigned (as discussed below).", "For our second objective, we interviewed officials from three industry  groups and five firms that filed NAICS code appeals during calendar  years 2014\u20132016 (the 3 most recent years of data available). To identify  commonly used NAICS codes and commonly used size standards, we analyzed data from FPDS-NG to identify the top NAICS codes by  obligations and by number of contracts awarded in fiscal year 2016. To  assess whether contracting officers were more likely to use a NAICS  code after the corresponding size standard increased, we analyzed  FPDS-NG data on fiscal year 2009\u20132016 obligations and number of  contracts awarded for NAICS codes with size standards that SBA  increased in 2012. To understand SBA OHA\u2019s process for reviewing  NAICS code appeals, we reviewed federal regulations and interviewed  OHA officials. For context, we compared OHA\u2019s process for NAICS codes  appeals to its processes for other types of appeals. To identify the  number and outcomes of NAICS code appeals, we analyzed SBA\u2019s OHA  decisions on NAICS code appeals filed during calendar years 2014\u20132016.

Two  of the four contracting officers also consider the codes assigned to  other contracts within their agencies that consisted of similar work.", "The purpose of the order. To issue an order under a contract, the  purpose of the order must be within the scope of the underlying base  contract. The four contracts we reviewed all had one NAICS code.  The contracting officers we interviewed at all four agencies stated that  if an order did not relate to the base award\u2019s statement of work or  NAICS code, they would award the order through another existing  contract or award a new contract. We reviewed 10 orders from each  of the four selected contracts and found that all 40 of the orders  appeared to reflect the purpose of the base award and appeared to  relate to the assigned NAICS code.", "However, the contracting officers we interviewed at two of the four  agencies noted some challenges in assigning NAICS codes. They stated  that because NAICS code definitions are broad, sometimes more than  one code could be assigned to a solicitation. In reviewing the 40 orders  associated with the four contracts we selected, we noted that in some  instances more than one code could appear to apply to a contract. For  example, the purpose of one order was to provide recommendations on  design, testing, and evaluation in support of engineering activities. We  found that this order could relate to the Research and Development in the  Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (Except Biotechnology) code  that was assigned as well as to the Engineering Services code because  both include studies and development using engineering sciences. One  contracting officer also noted that assigning the NAICS code is subjective  and two different contracting officers could review the same contract and  find different codes to be appropriate. We also noted this in reviewing our  sample of orders. We found that some orders had similar purposes but  were assigned different NAICS codes with different corresponding size  standards. For example, as shown in table 1, we found two orders related  to the installation of closed-circuit TV systems that had different NAICS  codes.", "Three of the four contracting officers we interviewed stated that there are  no unique challenges associated with assigning NAICS codes to ID/IQ  contracts compared to other contracts. However, one small business  specialist noted that assigning NAICS codes to ID/IQ contracts may be  challenging for contracting officers because the statements of work may  cover more than one code.

The final rule clarifies that if a multiple- award contract consists of discrete categories, contracting officers may  assign a different NAICS code and corresponding size standard to each  category. Additionally, under the final rule, contracting officers may issue  orders under each category as long as the category\u2019s NAICS code  matches the order\u2019s NAICS code.

Specifically, the three industry groups and four of  the five appellants we interviewed contended that contracting officers in  some instances assign NAICS codes that allow them to make an award  to a firm that would not be considered a small business under the  \u201cappropriate\u201d code. Conversely, an official of one firm we interviewed told  us that contracting officers in some instances assign NAICS codes with  smaller size standards to limit competition for a contract. Because  agencies have a federal mandate to meet small business contracting  goals, contracting officers are required to provide maximum practicable  opportunity to award contracts to small businesses in support of those  goals.", "The following are specific concerns that industry groups and firms  expressed:", "Ambiguous and overlapping language. An official from one firm  told us that the language in the NAICS Manual can be ambiguous and  noted overlap in the descriptions of certain codes with different size  standards. For example, NAICS codes 541330 (Engineering Services)  and 541712 (Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering  and Life Sciences except Biotechnology) both include engineering,  but have different size standards ($15 million and 1,000 employees,  respectively). An official from another firm stated that the broad  NAICS code descriptions result in solicitations that describe identical  work having different NAICS codes and size standards. One industry  group official stated that the practice of assigning a code based on the  size standard and not the principal purpose is particularly a concern  for research and development, professional services, and construction  contracts. The definitions of the NAICS codes for these industries are  broad and there is some overlap. For example, the Professional,  Scientific, and Technical Services sector (Sector 54) includes  research and development, engineering, legal and accounting, and  computer systems design services, among other services. The  Construction sector (Sector 23) also includes engineering services in  addition to housing construction, water and sewer line construction,  and plumbing and heating contractors.", "Preference for incumbent. Officials from two firms we interviewed  told us that when recompeting an existing contract, the contracting  officer may choose the NAICS code that best positions the incumbent  company to compete rather than the code that best represents the  work. Officials of one of these firms also stated that they are  concerned when the NAICS code assigned to an existing contract that  is being recompeted has changed and, in their opinion, the body of  work to be performed under the new contract remains the same as  the existing contract.", "Need to select multiple NAICS codes. In addition, one firm we  interviewed stated that it is difficult to predict the code that a  contracting officer will use for a procurement. Therefore, the firm  selects multiple NAICS codes in its SAM entity registration so  contracting officers will consider it for a variety of contracts. The other  four firms we interviewed also told us that they selected multiple  NAICS codes in SAM. As shown in table 2, a hypothetical firm that  has 450 employees and revenue of $200 million would be a small  business under some NAICS codes and large under other codes.  Certain NAICS codes such as 541330 (Engineering Services) have  exceptions to accommodate military procurement needs.", "However, one industry group and some firms stated that it is difficult to  determine how often the practice of assigning a code based on the size  standard and not the principal purpose occurs. Industry groups and firms  also acknowledged that other factors could lead to the assignment of  inappropriate NAICS codes. For example, one industry group official  stated that human error, not ill intentions, may lead to the assignment of  inappropriate codes. In addition, two firms we interviewed cited the  inexperience of some contracting officers as a cause. One of these firms  also noted that there could be legitimate disagreements about the  appropriate NAICS code because individuals can perceive the nature of  the work differently, including what is the preponderance of work to be  performed. Another industry group official noted that the intended use of  NAICS codes is for statistical purposes, not procurement, and as a result,  the codes do not always align with procurement needs and the  contracting marketplace. OHA officials acknowledged that assigning  codes based on size standards may occur, but noted that it is OHA\u2019s role  to review the appropriateness of appealed NAICS code assignments, not the contracting officer\u2019s intention behind assigning the code. As discussed  in more detail later in this report, the standard for OHA\u2019s review is  whether the NAICS code designation was based on clear error of fact or  law.", "When we shared stakeholders\u2019 concerns about the assignment of NAICS  codes with officials at the four agencies we reviewed and SBA, officials at  three of the five agencies told us that they did not agree with some of the  concerns. For example, DHS officials said that some of the  observations\u2014particularly the statement that contracting officers may  assign the NAICS code that best positions the incumbent company to  compete for the contract\u2014were unfair and could be taken out of context.  HHS officials told us they did not believe that contracting officers at HHS  assign NAICS codes because they want specific size standards. SBA  officials also questioned the stakeholders\u2019 statements and pointed to the  results of NAICS code appeals as an indication that the practice of  assigning NAICS codes based on the size standard was not widespread.", "In addition, we analyzed the use of NAICS codes from fiscal years 2009\u2013 2016 to determine whether contracting officers used NAICS codes whose  size standard increased in 2012 more often than codes whose size  standard did not increase. We selected three sectors with size standard  increases in 2012 (Sectors 48\u201349 and 54) for this analysis because these  sectors were among the first that SBA reviewed and adjusted.  We  found that the proportion of obligations and new contracts, respectively,  related to NAICS codes with size standards that increased in 2012  remained relatively consistent for Sector 54 and increased for Sectors  48\u201349 after the size increase.

SBA\u2019s process for NAICS code appeals includes (1) determining if appeals are timely and within OHA\u2019s jurisdiction, (2) determining if the  appellant is adversely affected by the assignment, and (3) expediting  NAICS code appeals that are accepted. Interested parties filing a NAICS  code appeal do not have to follow a particular format, but the appeal must  include the following information: the solicitation or contract number; the  name, address, and telephone number of the contracting officer; a full  and specific statement as to why the NAICS code designation is alleged  to be in error, and argument in support of such allegations; and the name,  address, and telephone number of the appellant or its attorney.", "Once an appeal is filed, an administrative judge is assigned to adjudicate  it.

Upon receiving notice of the appeal, the contracting officer must  place a hold on the solicitation; inform the public about the appeal and the  procedures and deadline for interested parties to submit arguments  concerning the appeal; and send OHA copies of the solicitation and  inform them of any amendments, actions, and developments concerning  the procurement in question. When reviewing NAICS code appeals, the  judge first considers whether the appeal is timely and within OHA\u2019s  jurisdiction. SBA regulations define timely appeals as those that are filed  within 10 calendar days after issuance of the solicitation or amendment to  the solicitation affecting the NAICS code. According to OHA officials,  because the office has jurisdiction over small businesses only, large  businesses cannot file appeals. If the appeal is untimely or outside OHA\u2019s  jurisdiction, the appeal is dismissed.", "If the appeal is not dismissed, OHA officials told us the judge then  reviews the NAICS Manual, SBA regulations on size standards, OHA  precedent, and the written records to make a final and independent  decision. The standard of review is whether the NAICS code designation  was based on clear error of fact or law. If there was no clear error of fact  or law, OHA will deny the appeal. If it finds a clear error of fact or law,  OHA will grant the appeal (see fig. 2).", "We found that OHA\u2019s process for reviewing NAICS code appeals is  generally similar to other types of OHA appeals (see table 3). For  example, NAICS code appeals and other SBA appeals generally must be  filed by an interested party that has been adversely affected. In addition,  NAICS code appeals and some other SBA appeals must be filed within  10 calendar or business days. NAICS code appeals are different from  other SBA appeals in that OHA is adjudicating an action taken by a  contracting agency as opposed to a determination made by an SBA  official.", "Four of the five firms (appellants) that we interviewed to discuss their  experience with NAICS code appeals were generally satisfied with the  appeals process. Of the five appellants, four used a legal counsel and  expressed general satisfaction with the time frames for filing a NAICS  code appeal. Four of the five appellants noted that filing within the 10  calendar days was not a challenge, two of them indicating that they had  known about the code for some time because it was included in the  agency\u2019s request for information or proposals. Three of the four firms that  used a legal counsel also told us the NAICS code filing process was  straightforward. However, the remaining appellant said that 10 calendar  days was not enough time.

These agencies accounted for approximately $347  billion in obligations and 47 percent of all ID/IQ obligations in fiscal years  2011\u20132015. To understand how these selected agencies assign NAICS  codes to contracts, we reviewed contract documentation, such as  acquisition plans and market research documents, for one ID/IQ contract  from each of the agencies (see table 4).", "We selected the four contracts we reviewed based on (1) whether they  had small business set-asides, (2) the NAICS code, and (3) the number  of orders. We selected contracts to obtain a mix of assigned NAICS  codes and corresponding size standards. We selected contracts awarded  in fiscal years 2014 and 2015 with codes from NAICS industry Sector 54  (Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services) because this sector  accounted for half of the 10 NAICS codes with the highest ID/IQ  obligations from fiscal years 2011\u20132015 (see table 5). We focused on  ID/IQ contracts for our contract review because orders for these contracts  are ordered after the base contract is awarded, potentially leading to  challenges when assigning the NAICS code.", "We interviewed contracting officers, small business specialists, and SBA  procurement center representatives (PCR) associated with each  contract. Of the contracting officers who assigned the NAICS codes to  the selected contracts, three no longer worked at the agencies. As such,  we interviewed the contracting officer currently assigned to the contract.  We also interviewed either the small business specialist who reviewed the  NAICS code assignment or the specialist currently responsible for the  contract or program office.", "To understand how orders relate to the base awards and their NAICS  codes, we reviewed 10 orders from each contract and compared each  order\u2019s purposes to the base award purposes and to the NAICS code  definition. We selected a mix of (1) orders that had product and service  codes different from the codes assigned to the majority of the contract\u2019s  orders or did not contain key words contained in the contract\u2019s statement  of work and (2) orders that were the top orders in terms of obligations.  To determine the status of ongoing efforts to clarify code assignment, we  reviewed proposed and final regulatory changes to NAICS code  assignment and interviewed officials at SBA and the General Services  Administration (the agency responsible for managing the operation,  maintenance, and updating of FPDS-NG).", "For our second objective, to understand stakeholders\u2019 views on NAICS  code assignment, we interviewed officials from three industry groups and  five firms that filed NAICS code appeals during calendar years 2014\u2013 2016 (the 3 most recent years of data available). We selected three  industry groups to interview that were small business trade associations  or contracting interest groups with information on their websites about  NAICS codes. We interviewed 5 of the 14 firms that filed appeals in  calendar years 2014\u20132016 of NAICS codes in Sector 54 (the sector with  the most appeal decisions). We selected these firms to get a variety of  results (granted, denied, or dismissed) and focused on firms that had filed  multiple appeals or recent appeals.", "To identify commonly used NAICS codes and commonly used size  standards, we analyzed data from FPDS-NG to identify the top NAICS  codes by obligations and by number of contracts awarded in fiscal year  2016. To assess whether contracting officers were more likely to use a  NAICS code when the corresponding size standard increased, we  analyzed fiscal year 2009\u20132016 obligations and number of contracts  awarded for NAICS codes in three sectors with size standards that SBA  increased in 2012. We assessed the reliability of the FPDS-NG data we  used by electronically testing for missing data, outliers, and inconsistent  coding, and by comparing the data on selected contracts to contract  documentation we obtained, including the NAICS code and whether or  not the contract was an ID/IQ contract. We determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of identifying trends in NAICS codes  assigned.", "To understand SBA OHA\u2019s process for reviewing NAICS code appeals,  we reviewed federal regulations and interviewed OHA officials. For  context, we compared OHA\u2019s process for NAICS code appeals to its  processes for other types of appeals. To identify the number and  outcomes of NAICS code appeals, we obtained and analyzed SBA\u2019s OHA  decisions on NAICS code appeals filed during calendar years 2014\u20132016.  We summarized the year, agency, outcome, and challenged code for  each of the decisions in this time period.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2016 to December  2017 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
