The Project BioShield Act of 2004 authorized the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to procure countermeasures for a Strategic National Stockpile. However, in December 2006, HHS terminated the contract for a recombinant protective antigen (rPA) anthrax vaccine because VaxGen failed to meet a critical contractual milestone. Also, supplies of the licensed BioThrax anthrax vaccine already in the stockpile will start expiring in 2008. GAO was asked to testify on its report on Project BioShield, which is being released today. This testimony summarizes (1) factors contributing to the failure of the rPA vaccine contract and (2) issues associated with using the BioThrax in the stockpile. GAO interviewed agency and industry officials, reviewed documents, and consulted with biodefense experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Three major factors contributed to the failure of the first Project BioShield procurement effort for an rPA anthrax vaccine. First, HHS's Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) awarded the procurement contract to VaxGen, a small biotechnology firm, while VaxGen was still in the early stages of developing a vaccine and had not addressed many critical manufacturing issues. This award preempted critical development work on the vaccine. Also, the contract required VaxGen to deliver 25 million doses of the vaccine in 2 years, which would have been unrealistic even for a larger manufacturer. Second, VaxGen took unrealistic risks in accepting the contract terms. VaxGen officials told GAO that they accepted the contract despite significant risks due to (1) the aggressive delivery time line for the vaccine, (2) VaxGen's lack of in-house technical expertise--a condition exacerbated by the attrition of key company staff as the contract progressed--and (3) VaxGen's limited options for securing any additional funding needed. Third, important Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements regarding the type of data and testing required for the rPA anthrax vaccine to be eligible for use in an emergency were not known at the outset of the procurement contract. In addition, ASPR's anticipated use of the rPA anthrax vaccine was not articulated to all parties clearly enough and evolved over time. Finally, according to VaxGen, the purchase of BioThrax for the stockpile as a stopgap measure raised the bar for the VaxGen vaccine. All these factors created confusion over the acceptance criteria for VaxGen's product and significantly diminished VaxGen's ability to meet contract time lines. ASPR has announced its intention to issue another request for proposal for an rPA anthrax vaccine procurement but, along with other HHS components, has not analyzed lessons learned from the first contract's failure and may repeat earlier mistakes. According to industry experts, the lack of specific requirements is a cause of concern to the biotechnology companies that have invested significant resources in trying to meet government needs and now question whether the government can clearly define future procurement contract requirements. GAO identified two issues related with the use of the BioThrax in the Strategic National Stockpile. First, ASPR lacks an effective strategy to minimize the waste of BioThrax. Starting in 2008, several lots of BioThrax in the Strategic National Stockpile will begin to expire. As a result, over $100 million per year could be lost for the life of the vaccine currently in the stockpile. ASPR could minimize such potential waste by developing a single inventory system with DOD--a high-volume user of BioThrax--with rotation based on a first-in, first-out principle. DOD and ASPR officials identified a number of obstacles to this type of rotation that may require legislative action. Second, ASPR planned to use three lots of expired BioThrax vaccine in the stockpile in the event of an emergency. This would violate FDA rules, which prohibit using an expired vaccine, and could also undermine public confidence because the vaccine's potency could not be guaranteed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We are pleased to be here to discuss our findings on Project BioShield\u2019s  first major procurement contract and the potential for waste in the  Strategic National Stockpile.

The Secretary, in turn, entrusted this responsibility to  the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response  (ASPR). Among other medical countermeasures, this stockpile contained,  as of June 2007, about 10 million doses of BioThrax, the licensed anthrax  vaccine. Since doses of BioThrax, like other vaccines, have an expiration  date, these doses will be disposed of if they are not used before that date.

Citing the urgency involved, ASPR awarded the procurement  contract to VaxGen several years before the planned completion of earlier  and uncompleted NIAID development contracts with VaxGen and thus  preempted critical development work.", "NIAID awarded VaxGen two development contracts, neither of which was  near completion when ASPR awarded the procurement contract.  However, on November 4, 2004, a little more than a year after NIAID  awarded VaxGen its second development contract, ASPR awarded the  procurement contract to VaxGen for 75 million doses of its rPA anthrax  vaccine. At that time, VaxGen was still at least a year away from  completing the Phase 2 clinical trials under the second NIAID  development contract. Moreover, VaxGen was still finishing up work on  the original stability testing required under the first development contract.", "At the time of the award, ASPR officials had no objective criteria, such as  Technology Readiness Levels (TRL), to assess product maturity. They  were, however, optimistic that the procurement contract would be  successful. One official described its chances of success at 80 percent to  90 percent. However, a key official at VaxGen told us at the same time that  VaxGen estimated the chances of success at 10 percent to 15 percent.  When we asked ASPR officials why they awarded the procurement  contract when they did, they pointed to a sense of urgency at that time and  the difficulties in deciding when to launch procurement contracts.", "According to industry experts, preempting the development contract 2  years before completing work\u2014almost half its scheduled milestones\u2014was  questionable, especially for vaccine development work, which is known to  be susceptible to technical issues even in late stages of development.  NIAID officials also told us it was too early for a BioShield purchase. At a  minimum, the time extensions for NIAID\u2019s first development contract with  VaxGen to accommodate stability testing should have indicated to ASPR  that development on its candidate vaccine was far from complete.", "After ASPR awarded VaxGen the procurement contract, NIAID canceled  several milestones under its development contracts undermining VaxGen\u2019s  ability to deliver the required number of doses within the 2-year time  frame."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VaxGen Took Unrealistic Risks in Accepting the Procurement Contract", "paragraphs": ["VaxGen officials told us that they understood their chances for success  were limited and that the contract terms posed significant risks.

VaxGen officials told us  that at the time of the procurement award they knew the probability of  success was very low, but they were counting on ASPR\u2019s willingness to be  flexible with the contract time line and work with them to achieve  success. In fact, in May 2006, ASPR did extend the contract deadlines to  initiate delivery to the stockpile an additional 2 years. However, on  November 3, 2006, FDA imposed a clinical hold on VaxGen\u2019s forthcoming  phase 2 trial after determining that data submitted by VaxGen were  insufficient to ensure that the product would be stable enough to resume  clinical testing. By that time, ASPR had lost faith in VaxGen\u2019s technical  ability to solve its stability problems in any reasonable time frame. When  VaxGen failed to meet a critical performance milestone to initiate the next  clinical trial, ASPR terminated the contract.", "According to VaxGen\u2019s officials, throughout the two development  contracts and the Project BioShield procurement contract, VaxGen\u2019s staff  peaked at only 120, and the company was consistently unable to marshal  sufficient technical expertise. External expertise that might have helped  VaxGen better understand its stability issue was never applied. At one  point during the development contracts, NIAID\u2014realizing VaxGen had a  stability problem with its product\u2014convened a panel of technical experts  in Washington, D.C. NIAID officials told us that at the time of the panel  meeting, they offered to fund technical experts to work with the company,  but VaxGen opted not to accept the offer. Conversely, VaxGen officials  reported to us that at the time NIAID convened the panel of experts,  NIAID declined to fund the work recommended by the expert panel.", "Finally, VaxGen accepted the procurement contract terms even though the  financial constraints imposed by the BioShield Act limited its options for  securing any additional funding needed. In accordance with this act,  payment was conditional on delivery of a product to the stockpile, and  little provision could be made, contractually, to support any unanticipated  or additional development needed\u2014for example, to work through issues  of stability or reformulation. Both problems are frequently encountered  throughout the developmental life of a vaccine. This meant that the  contractor would pay for any development work needed on the vaccine.  VaxGen, as a small biotechnology company, had limited internal financial  resources and was dependent on being able to attract investor capital for  any major influx of funds. However VaxGen was willing to accept the firm,  fixed-price contract and assume the risks involved.

ASPR officials told us that FDA would define \u201csufficient  data\u201d and the testing hurdles a product needed to overcome to be  considered a \u201cusable product.\u201d", "According to FDA, while VaxGen and FDA had monthly communication,  data requirements for emergency use were not discussed until December  2005, when VaxGen asked FDA what data would be needed for emergency  use. In January 2006, FDA informed VaxGen, under its recently issued  draft EUA guidance, of the data FDA would require from VaxGen for its  product to be eligible for consideration for use in an emergency. The draft  guidance described in general FDA\u2019s current thinking concerning what  FDA considered sufficient data and the testing needed for a product to be  considered for authorization in certain emergencies.", "Because the EUA guidance is intended to create a more feasible protocol  for using an unapproved product in a mass emergency than the term  \u201ccontingency use\u201d under an IND protocol that ASPR used in the  procurement contract, it may require more stringent data for safety and  efficacy. Under an IND protocol, written, informed consent must be  received before administering the vaccine to any person, and reporting  requirements identical to those in a human clinical trial are required. The  EUA guidance\u2014as directed by the BioShield law\u2014eased both informed  consent and reporting requirements. This makes sense in view of the  logistics of administering vaccine to millions of people in the large-scale,  postexposure scenarios envisioned. Because EUA guidance defines a less  stringent requirement for the government to use the product, it  correspondingly may require more testing and clinical trial work than was  anticipated under contingency use.", "Several of the agencies and companies involved in BioShield-related work  have told us the EUA guidance appears to require a product to be further  along the development path to licensure than the previous contingency  use protocols would indicate. VaxGen officials told us that if the draft EUA  guidance was the measure of success, then VaxGen estimated significant  additional resources would be needed to complete testing to  accommodate the expectations under this new guidance.

According to FDA, data and testing requirements to support a product\u2019s  use in an emergency context may vary depending on many factors,  including the number of people to whom the product is expected to be  administered. The current use of an unlicensed product involves assessing  potential risks and benefits from using an unapproved drug in a very small  number of people who are in a potentially life-threatening situation. In  such situations, because of the very significant potential for benefit, safety  and efficacy data needed to make the risk benefit assessment might be  lower than in an emergency situation where an unlicensed vaccine might  be offered to millions of healthy people.

From FDA\u2019s perspective, the  purpose of phase 2 trials was to place the product and sponsor (VaxGen)  in the best position possible to design and conduct a pivotal phase 3 trial  in support of licensure and not to produce meaningful safety and efficacy  data to support use of the vaccine in a contingency protocol under IND as  expected by VaxGen, ASPR, and CDC. This lack of a clear understanding  of the concept of use for VaxGen\u2019s product caused FDA to delay replying  to VaxGen until it could confer with ASPR and CDC to clarify this issue.
