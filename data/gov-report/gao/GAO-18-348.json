Federal law requires DOD's Office of Special Needs (OSN) to develop a uniform policy that includes requirements for (1) developing and updating a services plan for each family with special needs and (2) resources, such as staffing, to ensure an appropriate number of family support providers. OSN has developed such a policy, but DOD relies on each Service to determine its compliance with the policy. However, Army and Navy officials said they have not received feedback from OSN about the extent to which their Service-specific guidance complies. Federal internal control standards call for developing clear policies to achieve agency goals. In addition, DOD's most recent annual reports to Congress do not indicate the extent to which each Service provides services plans or allocates sufficient resources for family support providers. According to GAO's analysis, the Military Services have developed relatively few services plans, and there is wide variation in the number of family support providers employed, which raises questions about potential gaps in services for families with special needs (see table).", "Each Service uses various mechanisms to monitor how servicemembers are assigned to installations (assignment coordination) and obtain family support, but DOD has not established common performance measures to assess these activities. DOD has taken steps to better support families with special needs, according to the DOD officials GAO interviewed. For example, DOD established a working group to identify gaps in services. However, OSN officials said that DOD lacks common performance measures for assignment coordination and family support because the Services have not reached consensus on what those measures should be. In addition, OSN does not have a process to systematically evaluate the results of the Services' monitoring activities. Federal internal control standards call for assessing performance over time and evaluating the results of monitoring activities.

In  addition, we visited seven installations in five states to learn more about  how service-specific guidance for the EFMP is implemented. We  selected these installations because they serve a large segment of the  total population of families with special needs enrolled in the Services\u2019  EFMPs, including high concentrations of military-connected children  attending local schools and children attending U.S. DOD schools. At each  installation we visited, we conducted group interviews with a self-selected  group of military family members and caregivers enrolled in the EFMP  that have used family support services (see app. III for more information  about these interviews, which provide illustrative examples of issues  raised by families with special needs regarding the EFMP). We also  obtained program data from the Air Force, Army, Marine Corps, and Navy  and interviewed representatives from each Service about the data to  determine that the selected data variables from each service are  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of providing summary results about  family support for fiscal year 2016.

Specifically, we reviewed policies and procedures included in Service- specific guidance related to monitoring, including DOD-required  certifications for family support services and related quality assurance  activities for assignment coordination, such as site-visits from each  Service\u2019s headquarters. In addition, we discussed required monitoring  activities with personnel from each Service\u2019s headquarters and EFMP  managers at each installation we visited.

OSN is  also responsible for collaborating with the Services to standardize EFMP  components as appropriate and for monitoring the Services\u2019 EFMPs.  OSN has been delegated the responsibility of implementing DOD\u2019s policy  for families with special needs by the Undersecretary of Defense for  Personnel and Readiness through the Assistant Secretary for Manpower  and Reserve Affairs according to DOD officials. Currently, OSN is  administered under the direction of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Military Community and Family Policy through the Office of  Military Family Readiness Policy.

In addition, DOD states that each Service must  balance the need for overarching consistency across EFMPs with the  need for each Service to provide family support that is consistent with  their specific mission. To accomplish this, each Service is required to  jointly work with DOD to develop a performance strategy, which is a plan  that assesses the elements of cost, quality, effectiveness, utilization,  accessibility, and customer satisfaction for family readiness services. In  addition, each Military Service is required to evaluate their family  readiness services using performance goals that are linked to valid and  reliable measures such as customer satisfaction and cost.

In addition, the DOD reference guide for family support providers  emphasizes that timely, up-to-date documentation is especially important  each time a family relocates, as military families regularly do. Therefore,  SPs are an important part of providing family support during the relocation  process, and provide a record for the gaining installation. Requiring timely  and up-to-date documentation is consistent with federal internal control  standards, which state that agencies should periodically review policies,  procedures, and related control activities for continued relevance and  effectiveness in achieving their objectives.

This report focuses on the assignment coordination and family  support components of the EFMP for dependents with special needs and  examines: (1) the extent to which each Service has provided family  support as required by DOD, and (2) the extent to which the Services  monitor and DOD evaluates assignment coordination and family support.  To address these objectives, we used a variety of data collection  methods. Key methods are described in greater detail below.", "For both objectives, we reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and  DOD guidance and documentation that pertain to the EFMP, including the  following:", "The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2010, which established the Office of  Special Needs and defined program requirements for assisting  families with special needs, including assignment coordination and  family support.", "DOD\u2019s guidance for administering the EFMP. We assessed how DOD  implements the requirements in the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2010; how  each Service implements assignment coordination and family support;  and how the Services and DOD monitor assignment coordination and  family support using performance measures. Specially, we reviewed  DOD Instruction 1315.19 - Exceptional Family Member Program;  Service-specific guidance and related documents from the Air Force,  Army, Marine Corps, and Navy; and DOD Instruction 1342.22 -  Military Family Readiness.", "Standards for internal control in the federal government related to the  documentation of responsibilities through policies, performance  measures, and evaluating the results of monitoring activities. We  compared each Service\u2019s procedures for monitoring assignment  coordination and family support to these standards.", "To determine the extent of the Services\u2019 EFMP family support, we  obtained and analyzed fiscal year 2016 EFMP data (the most recent  available) for each Service. We reviewed DOD policy to identify data  variables that each Service maintains related to its EFMP. We used  these data to summarize key characteristics of each Service\u2019s EFMP.  The selected variables provided Service-wide and installation-specific  EFMP information on,  the number of continental United States (CONUS) and outside the  continental United States (OCONUS) installations;  the number of servicemembers (sponsors) enrolled in the EFMP;  the number of family members with special needs enrolled in the  EFMP;  the number of EFMP family support personnel; and  the number of services plans created for families with special needs  enrolled in the EFMP.", "We determined that the selected data variables from each Service are  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of providing summary results about  family support for fiscal year 2016.", "To learn more about how the Services implement their EFMPs, we visited  seven installations in five states. We selected the seven installations  based on their location in states with the largest number of military- connected students in school year 2012-2013 (the most recent available  and reliable data) or in states with the largest percentage of students  enrolled in U.S. DOD schools as of May 2017, as well as their status as a  joint base. At each installation, we interviewed installation officials,  EFMP managers, selected family support personnel, and family members  and caregivers enrolled in the program. In states we visited that had the  largest number of military-connected students, the EFMP personnel we  interviewed collectively served 66 percent of students who attend local  public schools and 42 percent of the students attending U.S. DOD  schools.", "To obtain illustrative examples about how the EFMP serves families with  special needs, we conducted seven group interviews with EFMP-enrolled  family members and caregivers (one at each of the seven installations we  visited). Using a prepared script, we asked participants to describe how  they were identified and enrolled in the EFMP, how they were assigned to  new installations, and the types of family support services they received.  We also asked about how these services aligned with their family  member\u2019s EFMP-eligible condition, the benefits and challenges they  experienced, as well as their overall satisfaction. A total of 38 self- selected volunteers participated in the seven group discussions. While  the participants in these groups included a variety of family members and  caregivers, the number of participants and groups were very small  relative to the total number of family members enrolled in the EFMP.  Their comments are not intended to represent all EFMP-enrolled family  members or caregivers. Other EFMP-enrolled family members and  caregivers may have had other experiences with the program during the  same period.", "Finally, for both objectives, we conducted interviews with a variety of  DOD, Service-level, and nonfederal officials. We spoke with DOD officials  from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense\u2013Offices of  Manpower and Reserve Affairs, Military Community and Family Policy,  Military Family Readiness Policy, and Special Needs. We also spoke with  EFMP Managers from Air Force, Army, Marine Corps, and Navy  headquarters. We also met with officials from selected national military  family advocacy organizations including the National Military Family  Association; the Military Family Advisory Network; and the Military  Officers Association of America to discuss the EFMP.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2017 to May 2018 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Services\u2019 Fiscal Year 2016 Exceptional Family Member Program Data", "paragraphs": ["Each Service has an Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) that  provides support to military families with special needs.
