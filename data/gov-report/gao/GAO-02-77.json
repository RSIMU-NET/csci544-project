This includes the exchange of information on how FAA and the military services have addressed particular aviation safety concerns. Existing gaps in the formal processes used by FAA and the military services to exchange information could allow for communication lapses and delays in getting critical safety information to the right parties in a timely manner, potentially resulting in the loss of lives and aircraft."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Safety of aircraft is a paramount concern in both civilian and military  aviation because safety deficiencies can cost lives and equipment and  affect mission accomplishment. The Federal Aviation Administration  (FAA) and the military services often face common safety issues as they  oversee the operation of similar aircraft or even dissimilar aircraft that use  common parts and materials. Our preliminary work, however, showed that  in some cases FAA and the military services have taken different actions  to address similar aviation safety concerns. We recognize that there could  be reasonable explanations for FAA and the military services taking  different approaches in addressing such concerns.", "To shed more light in this area, we used a case study approach  supplemented by a review of FAA\u2019s and Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD)  aviation safety oversight processes and related interdepartmental  communication efforts to (1) examine different responses by FAA and  DOD/military services to similar aviation safety concerns and (2) assess  the processes used by FAA and DOD to communicate information about  similar aviation safety concerns. To select case studies for this review, we  identified aviation safety problems shared by FAA and the military  services, selected examples in which FAA and DOD/military services had  taken a different approach to solving a similar aviation safety problem or  had a need to be informed about such a problem, and discussed potential  case studies with FAA and the military services.", "To examine different responses by FAA and the military services, we used  two cases in which FAA and the military services took different actions or  similar actions at a different pace when faced with common aviation  safety problems. These cases pertain to aircraft wiring insulation and  cockpit equipment designed to improve safety and support quality  assurance programs for flight operations. In addition, we selected two  case studies to assess the exchange of aviation safety information between  FAA and the military services. These include a specific brand of wire rope  used in the construction of aircraft control cables and problems of fuel  pump performance and overheating in fuel tanks in the E-4B, a military  variant of the Boeing 747.", "We interviewed and obtained relevant documentation from federal  officials and others familiar with FAA\u2019s and the military services\u2019 aviation  safety oversight systems. We asked these officials about the extent to  which these entities share information on aviation safety issues of  common interest. This review focuses primarily on issues involving similar  civilian and military aircraft equipment, parts, and material issues related  to aviation safety, rather than issues concerning the operation of aircraft.  It does not address aviation security issues, such as hijacking, sabotage, or  terrorist activities. See appendix I for additional details on our scope and  methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["FAA, an agency located within DOT is responsible for regulating and  promoting the safety of civil aviation. The Coast Guard is part of DOT,  except when operating as a service in the Navy during time of declared  war or when the president otherwise directs; however, the Coast Guard  follows its own rules for aviation safety oversight, which parallel the  structure and operations followed by the military services rather than  those of FAA.", "In contrast to FAA, DOD is both an operator and a regulator of aviation for  the military services. Its primary mission is national defense, one  component of which is aviation safety. OSD maintains oversight of the  military services\u2019 aircraft aviation safety processes but has delegated to  the heads of the military departments the responsibility for aviation safety  programs. For example, the secretary\u2019s office is responsible for issuing  policies and directives pertaining to aviation safety that the military  services must implement as they address their respective missions. Within  OSD, aviation safety is the responsibility of the Office of Safety and  Occupational Health, under the Office of the Deputy Undersecretary for  Installations and Environment, which, among other responsibilities,  includes traffic safety, OSHA compliance, and toxic hazards.", "There are three key similarities and three differences between the aviation  safety oversight systems used by FAA and the military services. They share  common internal processes for disseminating safety information;  managing aviation safety risks (e.g., they each use variations of a five-step  process); and certifying that aircraft meet civil aviation standards (FAA  provides the certification services to the military at no cost). They differ,  however, in their processes to certify that aircraft meet their unique safety  standards and to investigate aircraft accidents, as well as in the timetables  and thresholds for acting on potential and identified aviation safety  problems. For example, the command and control structure of the military  services allows immediate action to be ordered, such as the grounding of a  fleet of aircraft, after weighing the impact on their respective missions. In  contrast, although FAA can and has taken similar immediate action when  necessary, the agency often has more to consider before taking equivalent  action, such as consulting with airlines and other stakeholders, given the  potential ramifications for the nation\u2019s economy and the public interest.  See appendix III for additional information on key similarities and  differences between FAA\u2019s and the military services\u2019 aviation safety  oversight systems.", "Flight operations for military aircraft can differ from those of civil aircraft  in their nature and severity (e.g., turns may be made at steeper angles and  aircraft may ascend and descend at higher speeds). Although standard  parts may be common, the stress on the parts and materials in the  environment in which they are used may be quite different. As such, the  Coast Guard and the Navy frequently fly aircraft in close proximity to  water,a condition that poses special maintenance concerns, while most  commercial civil aircraft are not typically exposed to similar conditions. In  addition, according to some military officials, military aircraft can be  operated closer to the \u201cedge of the envelope\u201d\u2014maximum recommended  speeds, weight, and other parameters\u2014than commercial civil aircraft.  Such conditions can also accelerate wear of aircraft.", "FAA and the military services oversee the safety of some similar aircraft  types, such as the Boeing 737 and executive jet aircraft.  See appendix II  for a more detailed listing. Even dissimilar civil and military aircraft often  have common parts and materials such as bolts, fasteners, and wiring.  Civil and military aircraft are manufactured, modified, and repaired using  standard type parts, although their application may differ.  Interdepartmental communication about aviation safety issues of mutual  interest is important to (1) ensure timely correction of structural,  mechanical, or material weaknesses on aircraft that could lead to safety  problems (e.g., loss of lives and aircraft) and (2) make effective use of  federal dollars by sharing lessons learned about specific problems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Actions of FAA and the Military Services to Address Similar Aviation Safety Concerns Vary", "paragraphs": ["Similar aviation safety concerns do not necessarily lead FAA and the  military services to take the same actions to mitigate or eliminate them or  to act at the same pace. Different actions taken by these entities based on  assessments of safety risk can in some cases be appropriate and reflect  mission differences or, in other cases, may not seem warranted. The  examples below, describing the potential safety concerns associated with  the choice of electrical wire insulation and the pace of equipping aircraft  with warning devices to alert pilots to impending collisions, illustrates this  point."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Assessments of Similar Aviation Safety Risks by FAA and the Military Services Can Vary", "paragraphs": ["Given different operating environments, the same safety risk can vary in  probability and/or severity. For example, one of the military services could  determine that, based on its mission requirements and a unique and harsh  operating environment, an aviation safety hazard poses an extremely high  risk because it is likely to occur frequently and have a critical or  catastrophic impact. Conversely, FAA might determine that, based on the  standard operating environment for civil aviation, the hazard poses a low  safety risk because it is unlikely to occur, even if its severity is deemed  critical. Given the prohibitively high cost of eliminating all potential  aviation safety hazards, officials responsible for aviation safety must often  accept some level of residual risk. FAA and military service officials  acknowledged that some of the components used in preparing such safety  risk estimates are subjective, but said they rely to the extent practical on  technical experts to inform the decision-making process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA and the Military Services Took Different Actions to Address Potential Safety Concerns Posed by a Type of Wire Insulation", "paragraphs": ["When faced with a similar potential safety concern posed by the use of a  specific type of wire insulation known as aromatic polyimide, FAA and  each of the military services used common research findings, evidence  collected from flight operations, and mission priorities to independently  assess the safety risk of continued use of this wire insulation. Each arrived  at different decisions about the level of hazard it posed and the actions  warranted based largely upon mission differences and specific design  requirements. Aviation safety officials involved in these risk assessments  provided some explanations for the differing results.", "Environment: One of the main considerations used to assess its safety risk  was the operating environment of the aircraft. For example, FAA also  considered that naval aircraft routinely operate in more harsh  environments than commercial aircraft\u2013on aircraft carriers where they are  constantly exposed to moisture.", "Ballistic Testing: To explain differences between FAA\u2019s decision and the  Navy\u2019s decision, some officials pointed out that the genesis of the Navy\u2019s  concerns grew out of ballistic testing\u2013 a survivability issue that was not a  concern for FAA and commercial operators. For example, in 1986, Navy  tests found that bullets fired into an aircraft could sever wires, cause arc  tracking events, and trip circuit breakers.", "Aircraft Design Dictates Wire Installation Practices: According to FAA and  military safety officials, another consideration that guided FAA to a  different result from the Navy is that transport passenger aircraft have  much more room to run wires than fighter aircraft. As a result, wires  require much less bending that can potentially cause their insulation to  degrade.", "The Navy took the lead in identifying and examining potential problems  associated with the use of this wire insulation type and in mitigating  hazards. In the mid-1980s, when the Navy began experiencing problems  with this wire insulation, it enlisted the support of experts from other  military services and FAA to further characterize the problems and  identify possible solutions. Researchers determined that prolonged  exposure of this type of wire insulation to moisture could cause it to  deteriorate and that it was susceptible to arc tracking. Arc tracking can  occur when two cracks in the insulation are close enough together to  allow the current to form a conductive path between them at temperatures  that can cause the insulation to char and carbonize. This carbonization can  turn the insulation into an electrical conductor, and, eventually, can trip a  circuit breaker. When a pilot presses the switch to reset a tripped circuit  breaker, an entire wire bundle can be disabled and potentially compromise  the safety of an aircraft\u2019s entire electrical system.", "Ultimately, the Navy and the Coast Guard took the most active measures  to address potential problems with aromatic polyimide, which some  experts attribute to these entities\u2019 unique aircraft operations near water. In  December 1985, the Navy decided that aromatic polyimide would no  longer be its wiring insulator of choice and subsequently removed it  selectively from parts of aircraft where it was most problematic (e.g., fore  and aft flaps, wheel wells, and around unsecured seals that could leak).  The Coast Guard lagged behind the Navy in taking action to address  problems with this wire insulation; however, it took the most extensive  action by stripping it from its largest fleet of helicopters as a precautionary  measure after occurrences of in-flight fires and cockpit smoke and fumes  between 1993 and 1996. While no aircraft were destroyed, these incidents  led to poor visibility in the cockpit and, in some cases, the loss of all  electrically powered flight instruments. A senior Coast Guard safety  official said that the Coast Guard completed  removal of this wire  insulation from its entire fleet of H-65 helicopters  in September  2001. In  contrast, the Army did not experience similar safety problems. While it  independently confirmed the Navy\u2019s findings in 1986, the Army concluded  that it did not have the same problems with aromatic polyimide. The Army  did have durability concerns, however; it found the degree to which  aromatic polyimide chafes in Apache and Blackhawk helicopters is  unacceptable over time and decided to remove it gradually as it  refurbished older aircraft.", "In response to the Navy\u2019s finding of potential hazards with the use of  aromatic polyimide, FAA conducted independent research, tracked related  research and operational data from industry and the military services, and  decided that mandating the removal of this wire insulation from  commercial aircraft was not warranted. However, FAA did issue three  Advisory Circulars related to the use of this wire insulation type, in 1987,  1991, and 1998, to provide policy guidance to help prevent electrical  problems and potential fires and to describe acceptable practices for  aircraft inspection and repair, including wire installation.", "Recognizing the need for sustained attention to aircraft wiring issues, FAA  has ongoing efforts to assess the health of wire in aging aircraft through its  Aging Transport Systems Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ATSRAC). To  date, working groups under ATSRAC have conducted visual (nonintrusive)  and extensive physical (intrusive) inspections of wiring on aging aircraft.  However, according to National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)  officials, it is too soon to determine how well the agency is doing in its  assessment. These officials pointed out that ATSRAC has a seven-step  objective of reviewing wiring in aging aircraft, and its recent intrusive  inspection is only one step in the process.", "In August 2001, FAA announced a new initiative, the Enhanced  Airworthiness Program for Airplane Systems (EAPAS), a cooperative  effort with industry that is intended to (1) enhance the safety of aircraft  wiring from design and installation through retirement, (2) increase  awareness of wiring degradation, (3) implement better procedures for  wiring maintenance and design, and (4) ensure that the aviation  community is informed. In the same month, the Transportation Safety  Board of Canada announced that, as a result of its investigation of the  crash of Swissair Flight 111, it (1) concluded wire failure can play an  active role in fire initiation and (2) recommended a more stringent  certification test regime. FAA officials told us that the agency has not yet  responded to the conclusions and recommendations of the Transportation  Safety Board of Canada. See appendix IV for a more detailed summary of  actions taken by FAA and the military services to address concerns about  aromatic polyimide."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Military Services Acted More Slowly Than FAA to Require Installation of Cockpit Safety Equipment to Reduce Crashes Into Terrain, and Midair Collisions, and to Monitor Other Potential Safety Problems", "paragraphs": ["The military services have lagged as much as two decades behind FAA in  requiring the installation of cockpit technology in passenger-carrying  aircraft to alert pilots to impending collisions. In 1974, FAA responded to  NTSB recommendations by requiring operators of large commercial  aircraft to equip the cockpits of these aircraft with Ground Proximity  Warning Systems (GPWS) to provide pilots with warnings of potential  collisions with terrain (land or water). FAA extended this GPWS  requirement to operators of smaller airplanes and turbojet-powered  airplanes with 10 or more passenger seats in 1978. However, the military  services did not plan to systematically install GPWS in passenger- and  troop-carrying aircraft until after the 1996 crash of a military aircraft  carrying then-Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown and 34 others.  Subsequently, a senior military safety official reported that the crash  would almost certainly have been prevented had the aircraft been  equipped with enhanced GPWS. The enhanced version of GPWS provides  flight crews with earlier auditory and visual warnings of terrain, forward- looking capability, and more time to make smoother and more gradual  corrective actions.", "FAA also took action in 1989\u2014based on a 1987 congressional mandate\u2014to  reduce the number of midair collisions by requiring certain civil aircraft to  be equipped with Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS).  These systems help pilots to avoid midair collisions by providing them  with messages of an impending collision with another aircraft. According  to FAA, since the advanced version of TCAS (TCAS II) was introduced in  1993, civil midair collisions in the United States have declined by 80  percent. While acknowledging the benefits of TCAS, the military services  have equipped their passenger-carrying aircraft with TCAS at a slower  pace. For example, in August 1996, the Air Force published its Navigation  and Safety Equipment Master Plan for DOD Passenger-Carrying Aircraft,  which established guidance for equipping passenger- and troop-carrying  aircraft, including GPWS and TCAS in two implementation phases. Phase 1  requires installation by 2001 of all equipment used to transport senior  military leaders, and Phase 2 requires installation of this equipment on  remaining passenger- and troop-carrying aircraft by 2005. As of January  2001, the Air Force had equipped 49 percent of its passenger- and troop- carrying fleet with these technologies, but in some cases the timelines for  equipping these aircraft with GPWS and TCAS extend out as far as 2009.  As of July 2001, the Navy had equipped less than 20 percent of its  passenger-carrying fleet with GPWS and TCAS. According to an official  from the Department of the Army, as of August 2001, units had equipped  38 of the Army\u2019s 294 fixed wing aircraft with enhanced GPWS and 90 of  these same aircraft with TCAS. The remaining fixed wing aircraft must be  equipped with these technologies by fiscal year 2006. The Army has not  equipped any of its rotary wing aircraft (i.e., helicopters) with GPWS or  TCAS and currently has no plans to do so. In contrast, by 1998, the Coast  Guard had installed TCAS in all of its fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft.  In addition, according to a senior Coast Guard safety official, it has  equipped its C-130 fleet with GPWS, and the majority of the remainder of  its fleet is helicopters; however, due to the erratic nature of rotorcraft  flight as compared to fixed wing aircraft flight, making use of GPWS on  helicopters is much more difficult and the technology development lags  behind that for fixed wing aircraft.  This official stressed that as such there  is no FAA mandate that civil helicopters be equipped with GPWS or its  enhanced version.  See appendix V for more details on GPWS and TCAS.", "In addition, some major U.S. air carriers, in coordination with FAA, have  generally acted sooner than the military services to install passenger- carrying aircraft with flight data recorders and to establish programs that  collect and analyze aircraft data from routine passenger flights to detect  potential safety, training, and maintenance problems. These programs are  commonly referred to as Flight Operational Quality Assurance (FOQA)  programs. In July 1995, as part of FAA\u2019s strategy to achieve significant  reductions in aviation accident rates, the agency initiated a 3-year, $5.5  million FOQA Demonstration Project to promote the voluntary  implementation of FOQA programs by U.S. airlines. In response, several  major carriers have initiated FOQA programs.", "In October 1999, the safety chiefs for each of the military services agreed  that FOQA had value and endorsed projects and research by all services. A  Memorandum of Agreement signed by the services\u2019 safety chiefs in August  2000 followed this. Efforts by the military services to initiate FOQA  programs are in the very early stages, with the Air Force taking the lead  through a demonstration project using the C-17 aircraft. The Air Force  selected a software contractor for its FOQA program in June 2001 and has  since begun analyzing data it has collected since 1994 from nearly 11,000  flights. See appendix VI for additional information.", "Some officials with OSD told us that because of the relatively low  organizational position of aviation safety within DOD this issue does not  receive the visibility that is warranted. Aviation safety is located within the  office of the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Installations and  Environment within the Office of Safety and Occupational Health and is  one of 26 competing oversight responsibilities of this office, which  includes OSHA compliance, traffic safety, and toxic hazards. Currently  there is no aviation safety manager/officer for OSD. Several years ago, five  safety positions were abolished as part of an OSD downsizing effort and a  single staff member was hired to cover aviation safety and a multitude of  other responsibilities including OSHA compliance, fire and emergency  services, and range, weapons, traffic, and transportation safety."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Shortcomings in Existing Processes Used for Sharing Aviation Safety Information", "paragraphs": ["While FAA and the military services have numerous mechanisms in place  to exchange aviation safety information, we found (1) a lack of a common  definition of what constitutes aviation safety information of mutual  concern and (2) gaps in the formal processes currently used to exchange  aviation safety information. These gaps are illustrated by two cases where  existing formal networks of communication were not sufficient to ensure  prompt and comprehensive exchanges of aviation safety information and  follow-up actions responding to identified problems. The heavy reliance by  FAA and the military services on informal communication networks to  exchange aviation safety information is vulnerable to an expected wave of  retirements."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Numerous Mechanisms Are Used to Exchange Aviation Safety Information", "paragraphs": ["FAA and the military services have established numerous mechanisms for  exchanging aviation safety information, including informal networks  among aviation safety personnel, use of Web sites, meetings among senior  leaders and attending each others\u2019 meetings and conferences.", "Informal Networks: Technical staff at FAA and the military services (e.g.,  aerospace engineers) have developed an informal network that has  facilitated the exchange of information about similar aviation safety  issues. These officials reported that they have set some joint research  priorities, routinely share research findings and information gleaned from  accident investigations, and conduct joint aircraft testing. According to  FAA and DOD officials in the research and development arena, the  exchange of information on aviation safety is excellent, routine, and  reliable. This communication has provided them with a means of alerting  colleagues in other agencies and services about key issues or problems.  These officials cautioned that the effectiveness of this type of  communication is attributable to its informal nature and that formalizing  these processes would hinder rather than help their work.", "For example, officials from the FAA Technical Center, military services,  and National Aeronautics and Space Administration meet at least  semiannually to set common research priorities, share the research  workload, and, in some cases, this has led to formal cost-sharing for  research and development on aging aircraft systems. This allows each of  these entities to leverage the federal dollars spent on common aviation  safety problems. While formal initiatives are in place regarding shared  federal agency research on aviation safety and aging aircraft systems,  these meetings and research sharing activities evolved from informal  communication. One outgrowth of this informal communication has been  the sharing of costs by the Navy and FAA to develop a new \u201csmart\u201d circuit  breaker that can detect and interrupt electrical surges associated with arc  tracking and minimize the damage to wires. This technology should help  to prevent much of the damage that currently occurs and goes undetected.  In addition, miniaturizing this new circuit breaker is a priority for both the  military services and FAA, for example, for use on military aircraft that  have limited space and aboard civil aircraft to increase the number of  functions for which the circuit breaker can be used. Such sharing of  aviation safety research priorities helps to ensure the timely exchange of  lessons learned among FAA and the military services (e.g., about how a  specific aviation safety hazard was addressed) and the effective use of  federal funds dedicated to aviation safety oversight.", "Use of Web Sites: Exchanges of information between FAA and the military  services also take place when information of mutual interest is posted to  their respective Web sites. For example, the Air Force currently maintains  the most exhaustive database on the hazards of aircraft striking birds. It is  used extensively by the other military services and FAA to identify, among  other things, altitudes and migratory flight paths commonly used by bird  species. It also serves as a mechanism to alert pilots and aviation safety  officials to avoid certain flight levels and airspace, when practical. In  addition, the Army\u2019s Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM) makes use  of its Web site to post critical aviation safety messages (stripped of  privileged and classified information) pertaining to its helicopter fleet,  thus allowing the other military services and FAA to monitor potential  safety hazards. Similarly, FAA\u2019s Web site provides access to many of the  agency\u2019s safety databases as well as airworthiness directives, which are  generally posted on a real-time basis.", "Communication Among FAA and DOD Senior Leaders: Senior leaders at  FAA and DOD reported that they generally keep informed about aviation  safety issues common to both organizations through networking, such as  telephone and working lunches. According to a senior DOD official, this  networking has been a very effective way to exchange information with  FAA, as senior leaders from both entities have become well acquainted  and use these personal relationships to keep lines of communication open  and active. A senior FAA safety official also characterized informal  working relations between FAA and DOD as effective.", "Other Mechanisms for Information Exchange: FAA and the military  services use a range of other mechanisms for exchanging information  about aviation safety. These include attending each other\u2019s meetings and  professional conferences, exchanging practices for assessing safety risks,  and developing technical standards. Table 1 provides further examples of  ways that FAA and the military services communicate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA and the Military Services Have Not Developed a Common Definition of Aviation Safety Information of Mutual Concern", "paragraphs": ["FAA and the military services have not developed a common definition of  aviation safety information of mutual interest, and, in particular, what  information should be considered critical. As a result, the information  exchanged is based on individual judgment rather than on the systematic  identification and exchange of information. Various definitions of critical  aviation safety information have been established, such as that used by  DOD for procuring aircraft materials and parts. Policies have also been  established to facilitate the exchange of aviation safety information of  common interest between FAA and the military services; however, the  basis for such communication is unclear and left up to individuals\u2019  interpretation. A fundamental step in developing this definition is  establishing the universe of civil aircraft and their military aircraft  derivatives, something senior FAA officials told us the agency has not been  able to do.

These military addressees represent only a small subset  of the military entities that could be affected. FAA officials told us that it  has added specific military users to its list of addressees, but has had  limited success maintaining accurate and current contact information.", "Despite FAA\u2019s general practice of posting emergency ADs to its Web site in  real time, the site contains a disclaimer that the agency cannot guarantee  the accuracy of the information it posts\u2014for instance, the information  posted could be vulnerable to tampering from computer viruses or  computer hackers. As a result, FAA requires that all emergency ADs be  sent immediately via telegram or fax to owners and operators of civil  aircraft and that their receipt be documented. While FAA is not required to  send these directives to the military services, it appears prudent to do so  when it involves information of mutual interest, given their common  responsibilities for aviation safety oversight.", "Similarly, the military services provide FAA with some of their aviation  safety information, but generally not with the same level of urgency with  which they distribute it to the other services. For example, the Army\u2019s  Aviation and Missile Command strips privileged and classified information  from its critical safety messages pertaining to its helicopter fleet, sends  them all to the other military services and FAA, and posts them to its Web  site. In contrast, the Navy uses its judgment to send some of its aviation  safety messages to FAA, while the Air Force\u2019s, Coast Guard\u2019s, and Army\u2019s  Safety Centers generally provide aviation safety information to FAA only  upon request.", "The formal processes used by FAA and the military services to exchange  aviation safety information of mutual concern, including information  critical to flight safety, have not always been sufficient to ensure the  comprehensive exchange of such information. While informal  communication networks have helped to facilitate the exchange of  aviation safety information, these exchanges are not required and  systematic, and do not provide assurances that such information is  exchanged in a timely manner. The automatic exchange of critical safety  information is important to the safe operation of both civil and military  aviation to help ensure that entities that could be affected receive  notification promptly to provide them with as much time as possible to  mitigate or eliminate a given hazard and avoid potential loss of lives and  aircraft."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Two Cases Illustrate How FAA and the Military Services Do Not Always Exchange Critical Aviation Safety Information on a Systematic and Timely Basis", "paragraphs": ["The importance of effective and timely information sharing between civil  and military aviation entities on aviation safety issues was highlighted  during the investigation of the 1996 crash of TWA Flight 800. It was not  discovered until 1999 that the Air Force had contracted with Boeing in the  late 1970s to study problems it experienced with fuel pumps and  overheating in the center fuel tanks in the E-4B aircraft\u2014the military  variant of the Boeing 747. The Air Force was concerned about the E-4B  engines continuing to run satisfactorily if a main (wing) fuel tank pump  malfunctioned. There was also a concern over running of the air  conditioning packs under the center wing fuel tank for extended periods  of time (e.g., for 48 hours when operated in an alert mode). In this mode,  the center wing tank was full of fuel, and heated up slowly to a high  temperature. Boeing found that, under certain circumstances, air  conditioning wires running through the fuel tank could create a potential  safety problem, but determined that the engine would continue to operate  successfully provided certain operating restrictions were implemented.  While the central focus of the Air Force\u2019s concerns and Boeing\u2019s analysis  was fuel pump performance, not fuel vapor flammability, NTSB officials  said that the information contained in this report would have assisted  them with their investigations of fuel tank overheating.", "A senior NTSB official told us that it is not likely that earlier sharing of the  report\u2019s findings would have prevented the crash of TWA Flight 800.  However, had NTSB received the study in 1996 following the crash,  valuable time and resources in conducting its investigation could have  been saved. In August 2000, NTSB released its report on the TWA Flight  800 accident, which included the following statement regarding the report  Boeing prepared for the Air Force on fuel tank overheating in the E4-B:  The Safety Board recognizes that the military variant of the 747 is not  directly comparable to the civilian 747 and that the focus of that study  was fuel pump functionality, not flammability. Nonetheless, it is  unfortunate that potentially relevant information about 747 center wing   tank overheating and corrective measures were not provided to the  FAA or to 747 operators earlier.", "In addition, according to the NTSB chairman and director of aviation  safety, the report might have been helpful to NTSB in its investigation of a  Boeing 737 aircraft explosion in 1990 at Manila Airport in the Philippines.  The explosion occurred in the aircraft\u2019s center fuel tank. Both the  chairman and the director said that it is possible that if they had received  this study in 1990, safety recommendations made as a result of the TWA  Flight 800 investigation concerning fuel tanks might have been issued  sooner. See appendix VII for more information about this case.", "According to DOD, the wire rope produced by Strandflex and used to  construct aircraft control cables is critical to the safe operation of flight  control systems, such as aircraft rudders, steering, and brakes, on affected  aircraft, while FAA officials contend that it is not always critical to flight  safety. According to these officials, this is because civil federal aviation  regulations require that aircraft control systems incorporate redundancies,  meaning that failure of control cables would not cause loss of the  airplane.", "The wire rope produced by Strandflex became the subject of a Defense  Criminal Investigative Service investigation when the military discovered  that it was not being tested to ensure that it met military specifications and  an independent DOD test demonstrated that it did not meet strength  requirements. The DOD Office of Inspector General (DODIG) notified the  military services and FAA\u2019s Office of Civil Aviation Security at the same  time of potential problems with Strandflex. The military services quickly  addressed this situation by alerting responsible officials of the need to  assess and address safety concerns associated with the use of this  product. In contrast, as confirmed by a DOT Office of Inspector General\u2019s  (DOTIG) investigation, FAA did not issue an Unapproved Parts  Notification (UPN) to notify civil aviation community officials of potential  problems with the Strandflex product for a year\u2014a problem the inspector  general attributed to weaknesses in the agency\u2019s overall processing of  UPNs. FAA officials acknowledged that there was a delay in issuing the  UPN, but said that they had assessed the situation and concluded that it  did not require urgent action.", "Among other things, FAA did not inform the DOD Office of Inspector  General (DODIG) that the appropriate recipient of its messages pertaining  to suspect unapproved parts is its Suspect Unapproved Parts Program  Office until the DOTIG initiated its investigation. While the DOTIG did not  identify this as a key contributor to the year-long delay by FAA, even  simple communication breakdowns such as not informing DOD of the  appropriate addressee could lead to potential safety hazards being  overlooked or going unreported to responsible officials.", "Recognizing the fundamental nature of this shortcoming, the manager of  FAA\u2019s Suspect Unapproved Parts Program Office cited a change in the  FAA addressee as the first among numerous corrective actions that had  been taken to address weaknesses identified by the DOTIG in the agency\u2019s  processing of UPNs. Specifically, this manager advised the DOTIG general  that the FAA copy of DOD alert messages would be sent directly to the  Suspect Unapproved Parts Program Office rather than going through the  Office of Civil Aviation Security.  FAA and DOD officials told us that, while  the Office of Civil Aviation Security remains the addressee on the official  DOD notification letter to FAA, a facsimile copy is now sent directly to the  Suspect Unapproved Parts Program Office.

Retirements have  already affected some senior aviation safety positions during the past year.  For example, the key civilian at the Navy Safety Center retired in April  2001 and according to Naval safety officials a replacement was difficult to  find due to the high demands of the job and lack of commensurate pay.Similarly, one of the Army\u2019s key civilians in charge of aviation safety\u2014  responsible for the Safety of Flight Messages and routing FAA  Airworthiness Directives to the appropriate aircraft program managers\u2014  has also retired.

Among these  competencies, DOT has identified the Aviation Safety Series job  classification as a mission critical occupation important to succession  planning. We estimate that 47 percent of the employees in this  classification will be eligible to retire within the next 5 years. In April  2001, we reported that almost 37 percent of DOT\u2019s workforce who are  eligible to retire by the end of fiscal year 2006 would actually retire.  Applying this percent of staff at DOT in the Aviation Safety Series who will  be eligible to retire by the end of fiscal year 2006, we estimate that about  17 percent will actually retire.

However, succession planning can be difficult.

For example, FAA issues  Airworthiness Directives (ADs) to provide primarily owners and operators  of civil aircraft with formal notice of an unsafe condition. For large civil  commercial aircraft, ADs are written by the agency\u2019s Transport Airplane  Directorate Aircraft Certification Service in Renton, Washington, and sent  to FAA\u2019s Oklahoma City office, which has responsibility for formal  distribution to owners and operators of registered civil aircraft and the  posting of this information to the FAA Web site. Similarly, the military  services issue near-equivalents of ADs to distribute aviation safety  messages to affected units and sister services\u2019 aviation safety centers. In  addition, the chiefs of the military services\u2019 safety centers hold a Joint  Services Safety Conference every six months.", "According to both FAA and military officials, formal communication  mechanisms also include internal meetings among engineering and  program staff as well as FAA senior managers or internal meetings of  senior military officers responsible for aviation safety. Both use training as  another means of formally sharing aviation safety information internally  among agency/service staff.", "Both FAA and the military services also have internal informal networks in  place among aviation safety personnel that are used to share information.  These exchanges are typically self-initiated, occur on an ad hoc basis, and  are based largely on personal relationships. It is a primary means used  among the military services\u2019 safety centers to keep apprised of current  aviation safety issues. According to FAA and military aviation safety  officials, personal relationships are a cornerstone of informal  communication within both FAA and the military services and have  resulted in extensive networking that allows for an active exchange of  aviation safety information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA and the Military Services Use a Similar Process for Managing Aviation Safety Risks", "paragraphs": ["FAA and the military services all use variations of a five-step process for  managing aviation safety risks.(1) Identifying potential aviation safety risks. FAA and the military  services employ similar proactive and reactive methods for identifying  potential aviation safety risks. For example, they monitor pilots\u2019 reports of  aircraft performance problems, manufacturers\u2019 recommendations, foreign  civil and military aviation authorities\u2019 reports, mechanics\u2019 reports of  aircraft structural, part, or material weaknesses, inspectors\u2019 reports of  aircraft conditions and maintenance records, and information exchanges  between stakeholders (e.g., airlines, pilots, and engineers) in the aviation  community. Reactive methods include actions taken as the result of  findings and recommendations from aircraft mishaps and accident  investigations.  (2) Assessing safety risks to determine if corrective action is  warranted. Both FAA and the military services assess the safety risks of  a potential aviation safety problem to determine if action is warranted.  This includes weighing the costs and benefits that taking action might  have in mitigating or eliminating a safety risk and fulfilling their  responsibilities. For example, this process assists military decision-makers  in choosing if and how much to fund a project and in comparing its  urgency to other projects competing for resources.", "DOD requires the military services to use risk management and accident  investigations as decision-making tools for identifying potential safety  problems, assessing safety risks, and implementing and monitoring  corrective actions. FAA requires the use of safety risk management by all  offices, consistent with their role within the agency.", "FAA and the military services commonly use a risk assessment matrix to  estimate the level of risk associated with a potential or identified aviation  safety risk. The safety risk is estimated in terms of its probability and  severity. For example, FAA and the Air Force use a risk matrix to classify  identified or potential safety problems into one of four categories of risk\u2014  extremely high, high, medium, and low. FAA and military service officials  acknowledge that some of the components used to prepare this type of  safety risk estimate are subjective but, to the extent practical, they rely on  technical experts to inform the decision-making process.", "An assessment of safety risk may lead decision-makers to conclude that no  action is warranted or that the implementation of measures to mitigate a  problem will achieve an acceptable level of safety risk. For example,  according to Air Force safety officials, if a major command concludes that  a risk to life, health, property or environment posed by the operation of an  aircraft system or subsystem falls within acceptable limits\u2014without  mitigation or upon completion of mitigation efforts\u2014a formal decision will  likely be made to accept the residual risk.", "Assessments of risks associated with aircraft safety can vary among FAA  and the military services, even when they share a similar safety hazard.  According to FAA and military officials, this variability can be attributed,  in part, to differences in missions, operating environments, and aircraft  operational practices.  (3) Determining a corrective course of action to be taken. According  to FAA and military officials, when determining the appropriate course of  action to address a potential or identified aviation safety hazard, their  organizations consult with technical experts, including engineers,  manufacturers\u2019 representatives, pilots, and maintenance personnel. These  experts identify a range of potential remedies, weigh the costs and benefits  of each remedy, and select the most appropriate course of action to  minimize danger to air crews and damage to aircraft by eliminating a  safety risk or achieving an acceptable level of residual risk. For example,  following the crash of Alaska Air Flight 261 on January 31, 2000, FAA  determined that an emergency AD was warranted to inspect several  McDonnell Douglas aircraft for excessive wear of their jackscrew  assemblies on the horizontal stabilizer. Such wear could severely limit the  ability of aircrews to control an airplane and posed an unacceptable level  of risk to flight safety.", "The military services follow a similar process. For example, according to a  senior Army safety official, once Army engineers from the Aviation and  Missile Command (AMCOM) have determined an appropriate course of  action for a given aviation safety hazard, they prepare a narrative  describing to field personnel the precise remedy that they are ordered to  implement. This narrative also indicates whether the action is an interim  or final approach for reducing the hazard. AMCOM engineers may require  the replacement of a defective part immediately; the operation of aircraft  at or below a prescribed speed; more frequent inspections of aircraft; or  that the aircraft be grounded immediately. The Army took the last action  in June 2001, when investigators in Israel discovered damage to an Apache  helicopter\u2019s tail rotor after a low number of flight hours. In response,  AMCOM engineers decided that the potential risk to flight safety  warranted grounding the majority of the Army\u2019s fleet of Apache  helicopters to allow tail rotors that had been in service for greater than  1000 hours to be x-rayed immediately.  (4) Implementing corrective actions. According to FAA and military  officials, their organizations also have similar methods to implement  corrective actions to address a potential or identified aviation safety  problem. Corrective actions can be taken to restore the safety of approved  products to the level of safety required by airworthiness standards (e.g.,  through the issuance of an AD by FAA) or to upgrade airworthiness  standards through the issuance of new rules that will apply to aircraft at  some future date. For example, FAA issues an AD to notify primarily civil  aircraft owners and operators of an unsafe condition and to mandate a  specific corrective action. The military services issue their respective  equivalents. Both identify required actions and time frames for  implementing those actions.", "Depending on the perceived level of safety risk to flight operations, a  directive may require corrective action once a certain number of flight  hours has been reached. Physical inspections might determine if a  problem exists on a given aircraft, if a certain part must be repaired or  replaced, or if the installation of equipment is required. Alternatively, a  directive may place restrictions on certain flight maneuvers, while  continuing to permit an unlimited number of flight operations. Finally, a  directive may not be deemed necessary and an advisory message issued  instead. Such advisories are designed to alert flight crews and  maintenance personnel to potential equipment defects or limitations.", "When FAA determines that action is warranted, it may develop a  regulation through the federal rulemaking process. As we recently  reported, in doing so, it must balance the potential consequences for the  aviation community and the nation with the consequences of inaction on  public safety. On the one hand, the process of developing regulations, or  rulemaking, is complex and time-consuming. Because rules can have a  significant impact on individuals, industries, the economy, and the  environment, proposed rules must be carefully considered before being  finalized. On the other hand, threats to public safety and the rapid pace of  technological development in the aviation industry demand timely action.  A need for rulemaking can be identified internally, by one of FAA\u2019s offices,  or externally, by an outside source such as Congress through a statutory  mandate or the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) through a  recommended rulemaking. When the Congress mandates a rulemaking,  FAA is required to initiate the process. When NTSB issues a  recommendation, FAA studies the situation and decides whether to  initiate the rulemaking process.", "Both FAA and the military services maintain emergency procedures to  compel immediate action. If FAA determines, for example, that a serious  threat of an unsafe condition exists, the agency may decide to issue an  emergency AD. This process allows FAA to issue an emergency directive  first and submit it for stakeholders\u2019 comments and potential revision at a  later date. Issuance of an emergency AD can require that aircraft operators  comply before making their next flight.", "Each branch of the military maintains a similar emergency process. For  example, the Army may issue an Emergency Safety of Flight Message that  immediately grounds all affected aircraft. The Air Force and Coast Guard,  likewise, signal an emergency situation by publishing a Time Compliance  Technical Order. The Navy issues a message called a Bulletin Technical  Directive (Immediate Compliance).  (5) Monitoring to ensure that corrective actions have been taken.  Both FAA and the military services monitor compliance with required  corrective actions largely through inspections and audits. For example,  federal law establishes that the airlines are responsible for providing  service with the highest possible degree of safety in the public interest and  FAA is responsible for, among other things, overseeing airlines\u2019  compliance with the statute and regulations. This includes, for example,  examining airlines\u2019 operations when they seek a certificate to operate and  for conducting periodic inspections to oversee airlines\u2019 continued  compliance with safety regulations. FAA also tracks various reports from  flight crews to monitor airline compliance with FAA requirements.", "Similarly, the military services also rely upon inspections and audits to  ensure that corrective actions have been implemented. Compliance  measures include recording in aircraft logbooks or other official  documents that corrective actions have been taken and, in some cases,  reporting compliance directly to the responsible oversight organization by  unique aircraft identification numbers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Military Services Adhere to FAA\u2019s Regulations to Establish and Maintain the Airworthiness of Some Military Aircraft That Are Civil Variants", "paragraphs": ["The military services use FAA\u2019s civil aircraft certification services to  establish the airworthiness of some similar aircraft types (e.g., the civil  variant of the Air Force\u2019s T-43 is the Boeing 737 commercial aircraft) and  can retain this certification by maintaining the aircraft in accordance with  the civil federal aviation regulations. FAA has responsibility for certifying  that civil aircraft meet federal airworthiness requirements. To document  that aircraft comply with these requirements, the agency issues type  (aircraft design), production, and airworthiness certificates for aircraft  produced by civil aircraft manufacturers in the United States. In some  cases, FAA may issue aircraft type, production, and airworthiness  certificates for a military variant of a civil aircraft as well as supplemental  type certificates when modifications to an aircraft are made, but still meet  civil airworthiness standards. See figure 1. Discussions among senior  FAA and DOD officials are under way to determine FAA\u2019s future role in  certifying that military aircraft that are variants of civil aircraft comply  with FAA\u2019s minimum safety requirements. Some consideration is being  given to the military reimbursing FAA for its certification services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Different Methods Are Used to Certify the Airworthiness of Military Aircraft That Do Not Meet Civil Standards", "paragraphs": ["Different certification methods are used when military aircraft derived  from civil variants are modified for mission-readiness purposes to the  extent that they no longer meet civil standards for airworthiness and when  an aircraft is operated exclusively by the military (e.g., fighter aircraft). In  such cases, DOD engineers must use their own standards to certify that an  aircraft meets requirements for the minimum level of safety. For example,  if the military modifies a C-130 (a variant of the civil L-100) to convert it  from a passenger-carrying aircraft to one used for air-to-air aircraft  refueling, the modifications would not meet civil airworthiness standards.  Consequently, DOD engineers would assume responsibility for certifying  the airworthiness of this aircraft and it would no longer maintain its safety  certification for civil use. In contrast to FAA\u2019s aircraft certification  procedures, the military services serve as both the approving officials and  the ultimate users of military aircraft. In addition, the approval process  must consider not only the safety and airworthiness of an aircraft, but also  its suitability and effectiveness to meet mission readiness requirements.  Furthermore, the military services do not issue certificates documenting  that military aircraft meet military standards for aircraft type (design),  aircraft production, and airworthiness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Civil and Military Accident Investigation Processes Differ", "paragraphs": ["A second key difference is the accident investigation process: the military  services conduct their own accident investigations while civil aviation  accident investigations are conducted primarily by an independent agency,  NTSB.

In contrast, the  NTSB, which has the authority to conduct all civil accident investigations,  performs a single investigation following an aircraft accident. FAA  conducts the on-site investigations in most (80 percent) of general aviation  accidents and submits a factual report to NTSB. During accident  investigations, FAA looks into the potential roles of the air traffic control  system, navigational aids, pilots\u2019 flight and medical qualifications, as well  as the adequacy of the agency\u2019s rules and whether or not those rules were  followed.", "The reports of military \u201csafety investigations\u201d contain two types of  information\u2014nonprivileged and privileged. Nonprivileged data, such as  engineering analyses, may be released to the public. Privileged data, such  as confidential witness statements made by flight crew members,  reluctant witnesses, and some contractors, are not made accessible to the  public or used in litigation, claims, disciplinary actions or other adverse  administrative actions. The intent of this discretion is to quickly identify  root causes by encouraging candor among flight crews and witnesses to  prevent similar accidents in the future and to help ensure military  readiness. In contrast, during the civil version of the \u201csafety investigation\u201d  by the NTSB, the only protection against potential criminal action  available to civil commercial pilots is refusing to be interviewed or testify."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Pace of Decisionmaking and Thresholds for Safety Actions Differ for Military and Civil Aviation", "paragraphs": ["The pace with which FAA and the military services make decisions about  potential and identified aviation safety concerns differs, as do the  thresholds used to determine that action is warranted. For example, the  command and control structure of the military services allows immediate  action, such as the grounding of a fleet of aircraft, after considering the  impact on their respective missions, but without consulting outside  entities or considering economic impact. In contrast, while FAA can and  has taken similar immediate action, the agency must also weigh the  potential ramifications for the nation\u2019s economy. Arriving at such a  decision may involve consultation with manufacturers, operators, and  other aviation stakeholders. Such consultation and coordination can take  place at a very rapid pace when dictated by an unsafe condition.", "FAA and DOD operate under different formal requirements for issuing  aviation safety regulations. For example, when DOD issues an order to  address an aviation safety hazard, the military services are required to  issue instructions implementing the order, which are effective upon  signature by the approving official. In contrast, FAA, as a regulator of civil  aircraft, must often follow a complex rulemaking process (except in  emergency situations).

In  response, the Air Force contracted with Boeing\u2019s Military Group to study  the problem between 1979 and 1980; the group issued a report to the Air  Force in 1980. However, the report was not shared with the civil aviation  officials until 1999. This case study illustrates the importance of effective  and timely communication between the military and civilian aviation  communities on similar aviation safety problems.", "The Air Force was concerned about the E-4B engines continuing to run  satisfactorily if a main (wing) tank fuel pump malfunctioned. In addition,  there was concern over the running of the air conditioning packs under  the center wing tank for extended periods of time when the airplane was  on alert, idling on the ground with engines running for 48 hours. In this  mode, the center wing tank was full of fuel, and heated up slowly to a high  temperature. The 1980 Air Force report prepared by Boeing\u2019s Military  Group found that, under certain circumstances, air conditioning wires  running through the fuel tank could create a potential safety problem, but  determined that the engine would continue to operate successfully  provided certain operating restrictions were implemented.", "The central focus of the Air Force\u2019s concerns and Boeing\u2019s analysis was  fuel pump performance, not fuel tank flammability. Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA) officials said that this test was not envisioned as one  of flammability of the vapor in the fuel tank, but merely to assess the  effectiveness of fuel being fed to the engine. They added that it was always  assumed that fuel vapor might be flammable under certain conditions.However, NTSB officials maintain that the information contained in this  report would have assisted them with their accident investigations related  to fuel tank flammability. While the report\u2019s authors did not recommend  structural changes to the E-4B aircraft, they did recommended taking  mitigating actions, such as flying the aircraft with the center fuel tank  empty.", "In July 1996, NTSB began its investigation into the crash of TWA Flight  800. As part of the investigation, Boeing was requested to search its  database for any information concerning heating problems with the 747\u2019s  center (wing) fuel tanks. According to both NTSB and Boeing officials, the  Boeing Commercial Airplane Group told NTSB that it had no such data.  However, in December 1997, the Air Force report came to the attention of  the Boeing Military Group when it was found during a \u201chousecleaning  effort.\u201d It was determined that the report was the property of the Air Force  and subsequently sent to the Air Force Oklahoma City Air Logistics  Command (OC-ALC).", "Boeing officials told us that the report should have been located and  turned over to NTSB in 1996, even though the Boeing Military Group  prepared it for the Air Force. They stated that human error had caused an  incomplete search to be made of the Boeing records system for  information on heat studies involving center (wing) fuel tanks. A senior  Boeing safety official told us that the company has modified its electronic  library to allow key word searches across all of the company\u2019s reports. Its  accident investigation processes have also been revised to include  electronic searches for technical documents.", "In 1998, the Air Force OC-ALC initiated an Independent Review Team  (IRT) to discuss center (wing) fuel tank issues connected with the E-4B  aircraft in light of recommendations issued by the NTSB following its  investigation of the TWA Flight 800 accident. The Air Force OC-ALC held  an IRT meeting in March 1999 to continue to review safety issues  concerning the center (wing) fuel tank of the E-4B aircraft. As part of that  meeting, the Air Force included the report on the meeting agenda. Air  Force officials told us that the report was put on the agenda to show that  the E-4B aircraft was equipped somewhat differently and was capable of  operating under more difficult conditions than the commercial 747, not for  safety reasons. Participants in this meeting included officials from  Boeing\u2019s Commercial Airplane Group and Military Group and NTSB.  Officials of both Boeing\u2019s Commercial Airplane Group and NTSB told us  that this was the first time they had heard about the report.", "Air Force OC-ALC officials told us that when Boeing brought the report to  their attention, it was placed on the IRT agenda for discussion. These  officials said that they did not intentionally withhold the report from the  NTSB because both military and civilian personnel in their organization  considered it to be an operational or readiness study, not a safety study.  The NTSB director told us that, after the March 1999 IRT meeting, NTSB  requested a copy of the entire study from the Air Force, but instead  received a summary. In June, after intervention by a U.S. Senate  committee, the Air Force provided the entire study to NTSB.", "A senior NTSB official told us that it is not likely that earlier sharing of the  report\u2019s findings would have prevented the crash of TWA Flight 800.  However, had NTSB received the study in 1996 following the crash of TWA  Flight 800, it would have saved valuable time and resources in conducting  its investigation. Both the NTSB\u2019s chairman and director of aviation noted  that the study might have been very helpful to the NTSB in its 1990  investigation of a Boeing 737 aircraft explosion at Manila Airport in the  Philippines\u2014the explosion occurred in the aircraft\u2019s center fuel tank.  According to both officials, it is possible that, if they had received the  Boeing study by 1990, safety recommendations made as a result of the  TWA Flight 800 crash could have been issued sooner.", "In August 2000, NTSB released its report on the TWA Flight 800 accident,  which included the following statement regarding the report Boeing  prepared for the Air Force on fuel tank overheating in the E4-B:  The Safety Board recognizes that the military variant of the 747 is not  directly comparable to the civilian 747 and that the focus of that study  was fuel pump functionality, not flammability. Nonetheless, it is  unfortunate that potentially relevant information about 747 center wing   tank overheating and corrective measures were not provided to the  FAA or to 747 operators earlier."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: Case Study on Strandflex Control Cable", "paragraphs": ["In January 1999, a former employee of the Strandflex Company alleged in  federal court that the corporation was not conducting quality assurance  tests to ensure that its wire rope used in the assembly of aircraft control  cables met military specifications. According to the Department of  Defense (DOD), this wire rope is critical to the safe operation of flight  control systems (e.g., aircraft rudders, wing flaps, brakes, and steering) on  affected aircraft. However, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)  officials contend that this wire rope is not always critical to flight safety  because civil federal aviation regulations require that aircraft control  systems incorporate redundancies, meaning that failure of control cables  would not cause loss of the airplane.", "In response to the allegation against the Strandflex Company, the Defense  Criminal Investigative Service initiated an investigation and an  independent test by DOD demonstrated the wire rope did not consistently  meet strength requirements. The Department of Defense Office of  Inspector General (DODIG) alerted the military services and FAA  concurrently in May 1999. The military services took prompt action to  notify responsible officials to assess the extent of safety hazards and  correct them. FAA took just over a year to notify the civil aviation  community. FAA officials acknowledged that there was a delay, but said  that they had assessed the situation and concluded that it did not require  urgent action.  However, the agency\u2019s inaction resulted in a Department of  Transportation Office of Inspector General (DOTIG) investigation into the  delay and FAA\u2019s overall process for issuing notifications of unapproved  parts.  On May 30, 2001, the Strandflex Company admitted to making false  claims to the United States and falsely certifying that its aircraft control  cable wire rope met U.S. military specifications and was ordered by a U.S.  District Court judge to pay a criminal fine and restitution."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOTIG Has Reported That FAA Delayed Action on Strandflex Concerns", "paragraphs": ["Concerned about FAA\u2019s delay in notifying air carriers of possible problems  with Strandflex cables, a June 2000 Congressional request called for the  DOTIG to investigate, among other things, the timeliness and effectiveness  of FAA\u2019s response to information about possible flaws in the Strandflex  control cable.", "In March 2001, the DOTIG reported that FAA did not act in a timely  manner in response to the information it received about Strandflex,  confirming that just over a year had passed between the time that the  DODIG notified FAA about possible problems with Strandflex and the date  that FAA published an Unapproved Parts Notification (UPN) on  Strandflex. A UPN disseminates information about unapproved parts to  the civil aviation community.", "Furthermore, the DOTIG identified three primary factors that accounted  for FAA\u2019s untimely response: FAA (1) misfiled the initial notification,  resulting in an initial delay of approximately 3 months; (2) spent an  additional month forwarding a Suspect Unapproved Parts investigative  request to the New England Regional office for further investigation; (3)  delayed an additional 4 months because a legal challenge made it reluctant  to issue advisory field notifications about suspect unapproved parts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA Has Taken Action to Improve Communication with DOD in Response to the DOTIG Investigation of Strandflex", "paragraphs": ["FAA notified the DODIG in August 2000 of the need for DOD to send alert  messages pertaining to suspect unapproved parts directly to FAA\u2019s  Suspect Unapproved Parts Program Office. This action was taken in  response to the DOTIG\u2019s investigation of FAA\u2019s delay in alerting the civil  aviation community about potential quality assurance problems with  Strandflex wire rope. Specifically, DOD alerts about suspect unapproved  parts were being sent to FAA\u2019s Civil Aviation Security Office rather than  FAA\u2019s Suspect Unapproved Parts Program Office. While the DOTIG did  not identify this as a key contributor to the year-long delay by FAA, such  simple communication breakdowns as not sending safety notifications to  all responsible officials could lead to delays in addressing potential  hazards. In its response to the DOTIG finding of weaknesses in FAA\u2019s  overall processing of UPNs, the FAA manager for the Suspect Unapproved  Parts Program Office advised the DOTIG that corrective action had been  taken to ensure that all DOD alert messages were now sent directly to  FAA\u2019s Suspect Unapproved Part Program Office. According to FAA and  DOD officials, while FAA\u2019s Office of Civil Aviation Security remains the  addressee in the official letter from DOD alerting FAA to potential  problems with suspect unapproved parts, the FAA Unapproved Parts  Program Office is included on DOD\u2019s list of facsimile recipients and  receives notifications immediately after signature."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix X: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Aaron Casey, Beverly Dulaney,  Colin Fallon, David Hooper, Maren McAvoy, Sara-Ann Moessbauer, Robert  White, and Mario Zavala made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
