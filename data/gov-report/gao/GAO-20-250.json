Those with such \u201cfear claims\u201d are referred to USCIS for a credible fear screening. Individuals who have certain criminal convictions or who have a reinstated order of removal and claim fear are referred for a reasonable fear screening. Those with negative outcomes can request a review by EOIR's immigration judges. GAO was asked to review USCIS's and EOIR's processes for fear screenings.", "This report examines (1) USCIS and EOIR data on fear screenings, (2) USCIS policies and procedures for overseeing fear screenings, and (3) USCIS and EOIR processes for workload management. GAO analyzed USCIS and EOIR data from fiscal years 2014 through mid-2019; interviewed relevant headquarters and field officials; and observed fear screenings in California, Texas, and Virginia, where most screenings occur."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Data from the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and Department of Justice's Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) indicate that their credible and reasonable fear caseloads generally increased from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2018.", "USCIS's caseloads nearly doubled during this timeframe\u2014from about 56,000 to almost 109,000 referrals for credible and reasonable fear screenings. Further, the credible fear caseload was larger in the first two quarters of fiscal year 2019 alone than in each of fiscal years 2014 and 2015. Referrals to USCIS for reasonable fear screenings also increased from fiscal years 2014 through 2018. USCIS asylum officers made positive determinations in 71 percent of all credible and reasonable fear screenings between fiscal years 2014 and the first two quarters of fiscal year 2019. The outcomes of the remaining screenings were generally split evenly (14 percent each) between negative determinations or administrative closures (such as if the applicant was unable to communicate).", "EOIR's caseload for immigration judge reviews of USCIS's negative credible and reasonable fear determinations also increased between fiscal year 2014 and fiscal year 2018. EOIR's immigration judges reviewed about 55,000 cases from fiscal year 2014 through the third quarter of 2019 (the most recent data available), and judges upheld USCIS's negative determinations in about three-quarters of all reviews.", "USCIS has developed various policies and procedures for overseeing credible and reasonable fear screenings in accordance with the regulations governing those screenings, such as interview requirements and mandatory supervisory review. USCIS provides basic training for new asylum officers and other training at individual asylum offices that includes credible and reasonable fear. The training at asylum offices includes on-the-job training for officers newly-assigned to credible and reasonable fear cases and ongoing weekly training for incumbent officers\u2014some of which includes credible and reasonable fear. However, USCIS asylum offices do not all provide additional pre-departure training before officers begin screening families in person at DHS's family residential centers. Asylum Division officials told GAO that additional training for asylum officers before they begin screening such cases is important\u2014in particular, credible fear screenings at these facilities represent about one-third of USCIS's caseload. Almost all USCIS asylum offices send officers to the family residential centers, including those offices with small fear caseloads at the local level. Some asylum offices provide pre-departure training to officers being sent to screen families, but such training is inconsistent across offices. By comparison, officials from the Chicago and New York offices stated they do not provide formal pre-departure training, but rather direct or recommend that officers review Asylum Division guidance and procedures on family processing independently before they travel. Officials from two other offices stated they rely on the training asylum officers may receive throughout the year related to credible and reasonable fear, which can vary. Providing pre-departure training, in addition to USCIS's basic training for new asylum officers, would help USCIS ensure that officers from all asylum offices are conducting efficient and effective fear screenings of families.", "Further, consistent with regulation, USCIS policy is to include any dependents on a principal applicant's credible fear determination if the principal applicant receives a positive determination, resulting in the principal and any dependents being placed into full removal proceedings with an opportunity to apply for various forms of relief or protection, including asylum. For example, a parent as a principal applicant may receive a negative determination, but his or her child may receive a separate positive determination. In the interest of family unity, USCIS may use discretion to place both the parent and child into full removal proceedings rather than the parent being expeditiously ordered removed in accordance with the expedited removal process. However, USCIS's case management system does not allow officers to record whether an individual receives a determination on his or her case as a principal applicant, dependent, or in the interest of family unity. Without complete data on all such outcomes, USCIS is not well-positioned to report on the scope of either the agency's policy for family members who are treated as dependents, pursuant to regulation, or USCIS's use of discretion in the interest of family unity.", "USCIS and EOIR have processes for managing their respective credible and reasonable fear workloads. For example, USCIS uses national- and local-level staffing models to inform staffing allocation decisions. USCIS also sets and monitors timeliness goals for completing credible and reasonable fear cases. Although USCIS monitors overall processing times, it does not collect comprehensive data on some types of case delays, which officers told us can occur on a regular basis. Asylum officers whom GAO interviewed stated that certain delays could affect the number of credible or reasonable fear cases they can complete each day. Collecting and analyzing additional information on case delays would better position USCIS to mitigate the reasons for the delays and improve efficiency. EOIR has developed processes for immigration courts and judges to help manage its workload that include performance measures with timeliness goals for credible and reasonable fear reviews. EOIR data indicate that about 30 percent of credible and reasonable fear reviews are not completed within the required timeframes. EOIR officials said they plan to implement an automated tool in early 2020 to monitor court performance, including the credible and reasonable fear performance goals. Because implementation of the automated tool is planned for early 2020, it is too soon to know if EOIR will use the tool to monitor adherence to the required credible and reasonable fear review time frames or if it will help EOIR understand reasons for case delays."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making four recommendations, including that USCIS provide additional pre-departure training to USCIS asylum officers before they begin screening families, systematically record case outcomes of family members, and collect and analyze information on case delays.

CBP may place apprehended adults and family  units into full or expedited removal proceedings before an immigration  court, consistent with the Immigration and Nationality Act. In full removal  proceedings, they may apply for various forms of relief or protection,  including asylum. U.S. immigration law provides that noncitizens  physically present within the United States, whether or not at a  designated port of entry, may be granted asylum if they are found to be  unable or unwilling to return to their home country because of past  persecution, or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of  their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or  political opinion (referred to as \u201cprotected grounds\u201d). If they are  precluded from obtaining asylum based on, for example, past convictions  of certain crimes, but their life or freedom would be threatened based on  the protected grounds or they would potentially be tortured if removed,  they may also seek withholding of removal.", "If noncitizens are placed into expedited removal proceedings instead of  full removal proceedings, they are to be ordered removed from the United  States without further hearing before an immigration judge unless they  indicate either (1) an intention to apply for asylum or (2) a fear of  persecution or torture, or a fear of return to their country (referred to  throughout this report as making a \u201cfear claim\u201d). In such cases, they are  referred to DHS\u2019s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for  a credible fear screening by an asylum officer. If they have been issued a  final administrative removal order after conviction for an aggravated  felony or have a prior order of removal that is reinstated, and express a  fear of return, they are referred to an asylum officer for a reasonable fear  screening. USCIS data indicate that its credible fear caseload nearly  doubled from fiscal years 2015 to 2016 (approximately 48,000 to 91,000  cases) and generally remained at that level through fiscal year 2018.  Further, USCIS reported that it received more than 105,000 credible fear  cases in fiscal year 2019.", "Through these screenings, USCIS makes a determination about whether  these individuals have a credible or reasonable fear of persecution or  torture if returned to their country and the likelihood they can establish in  a hearing before an immigration judge that these threats exist. If USCIS  determines that the individual has a credible fear of persecution or torture,  he or she will be placed into full immigration proceedings. If the individual  receives a negative determination, he or she can request a review of that  determination by an immigration judge within the Department of Justice\u2019s  (DOJ) Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR).", "We were asked to review DHS\u2019s and DOJ\u2019s processes for screening  noncitizens who arrive at the southwest border expressing an intention to  apply for asylum, a fear of persecution or torture, or a fear of return to  their country, and the resources needed to carry out these screenings  within applicable time frames. This report discusses (1) what USCIS and  EOIR data show about the credible fear and reasonable fear processes,  (2) the extent to which USCIS has policies and procedures for overseeing  credible fear and reasonable fear screenings, and (3) the extent to which  USCIS and EOIR have processes for managing their respective credible  fear and reasonable fear-related workloads.", "For these objectives, we interviewed DHS and DOJ officials. Specifically,  we interviewed officials from CBP\u2019s Border Patrol and Office of Field  Operations (OFO); ICE\u2019s Enforcement and Removal Operations; USCIS\u2019s  Asylum Division; and EOIR. We conducted site visits at Border Patrol  stations and OFO ports of entry in Arizona, California, and Texas; ICE  single adult and family residential centers in California and Texas; and  USCIS asylum offices in Texas and Virginia, from September 2018 to  April 2019. During these site visits, we interviewed Border Patrol, OFO,  ICE, USCIS, and EOIR officials and observed credible and reasonable  fear interviews, among other activities. To select these locations, we  reviewed USCIS data on credible and reasonable fear cases in fiscal year  2018, and identified specific locations that received the vast majority of  cases during that year. We also considered the geographical proximity of  multiple CBP and ICE facilities to maximize observations. Our  observations during site visits are not generalizable to all Border Patrol,  OFO, ICE, USCIS, or EOIR operations, but provided us the opportunity to  learn more about policies and procedures for credible and reasonable  fear.", "To address the first objective, we reviewed record-level data from USCIS  and EOIR. For USCIS, we reviewed record-level data from USCIS\u2019s  automated case management system to identify the number,  characteristics, and outcomes of credible and reasonable fear cases  between fiscal year 2014 through the second quarter of fiscal year 2019  (the most current data available from USCIS at the time of our review).  For EOIR, we reviewed data on immigration judge reviews of credible and  reasonable fear cases posted on its public website. We also requested  data from EOIR on credible and reasonable fear reviews for those  individuals detained in ICE\u2019s family residential centers. Further, we  reviewed EOIR data on credible and reasonable fear reviews from fiscal  year 2014 through the third quarter of 2019 (the most current data  available from EOIR at the time of our review). To assess the reliability of  USCIS and EOIR data, we completed a number of data reliability steps,  including (1) performing electronic testing for obvious errors in accuracy  and completeness, such as running logic tests; (2) reviewing information  about the data and systems that produced them, such as relevant training  materials for USCIS officers who use agency data systems; and (3)  discussing data entry issues and data limitations with USCIS and EOIR  officials. We determined the data were sufficiently reliable to describe the  number, outcomes, and characteristics of credible and reasonable fear  cases.", "To address the second objective, we reviewed USCIS policy documents,  training materials, and other guidance documents, such as procedures  manuals for credible and reasonable fear. In particular, we reviewed  USCIS Asylum Division quarterly training reports for fiscal year 2018 to  analyze the weekly training activities in each asylum office for each week  of the reporting quarter. We also reviewed asylum officer training  materials, reports from the Asylum Division\u2019s periodic quality assurance  reviews of credible and reasonable fear cases at individual asylum offices  conducted between November 2017 and May 2018, and USCIS guidance  on processing families in credible and reasonable fear cases. In addition,  we conducted interviews with USCIS headquarters and asylum office  officials, and we observed asylum officers screening credible and  reasonable fear cases. We compared USCIS policies and procedures to  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government related to  developing competent individuals qualified to carry out assigned  responsibilities, ongoing monitoring activities and evaluation of results,  and obtaining high quality data.", "To address the third objective, we reviewed USCIS and EOIR documents  and data and conducted interviews with USCIS and EOIR officials, to  evaluate the extent to which USCIS and EOIR have processes for  managing their respective credible and reasonable fear-related  workloads. For USCIS, we reviewed policy documents, training materials,  and other guidance documents related to USCIS\u2019s staffing allocation  model for the credible and reasonable fear workload. In addition, we  analyzed record-level USCIS data to calculate processing times and case  delays for credible and reasonable fear cases from fiscal year 2014  through the second quarter of fiscal year 2019. We also reviewed  USCIS\u2019s publicly-reported data on credible fear processing times during  this time period. We compared USCIS policies and procedures to  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government related to  obtaining data on a timely basis for management to use for effective  monitoring and processing data into high quality information. For EOIR,  we reviewed required time frames for EOIR\u2019s review of USCIS\u2019s credible  and reasonable fear determinations; data that EOIR has publicly reported  about its workload and case adjudications; and policy documents, such  as EOIR\u2019s 2018 memorandum on case priorities. In addition, we analyzed  summary data on EOIR\u2019s credible and reasonable fear review processing  times for fiscal year 2014 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 (the  most current data available at the time of our review) and compared  EOIR\u2019s processing times with required time frames. To assess the  reliability of the data, we reviewed documentation on USCIS\u2019s and EOIR\u2019s  data systems, interviewed knowledgeable officials, and conducted  electronic testing of USCIS\u2019s record-level data for obvious errors.

As of July 2019, an asylum office is to wait a  minimum of one full calendar day from the applicant\u2019s arrival at an ICE  detention facility before conducting a credible fear interview; an asylum  office is to wait 48 hours after an initial orientation on the reasonable fear  process before a reasonable fear interview, according to USCIS policy.  However, both credible and reasonable fear interviews generally occur at  least 48 hours after the applicant\u2019s arrival at a detention facility, according  to USCIS officials. Asylum officers may conduct credible and  reasonable fear interviews either in-person or on the phone. Asylum  officers are to arrange the assistance of an interpreter, generally  connected over the phone, if the applicant is unable to proceed effectively  in English pursuant to regulation. Asylum officers are to verify and  document that applicants have received and understood information  regarding the credible or reasonable fear process before they begin  asking substantive questions during the interview about the applicant\u2019s  claim.", "According to USCIS documents and officials, during the interview, asylum  officers are to elicit all information relevant to a credible or reasonable  fear claim, and regulation requires they conduct interviews in a non- adversarial manner. For example, asylum officers are to ask applicants  questions to determine whether they can establish a credible or  reasonable fear of persecution based on their race, religion, nationality,  membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. In addition,  asylum officers are to ask applicants questions to determine whether they  can establish a credible or reasonable fear of torture if returned to their  home country. During our observations of in-person and telephone  interviews, we observed asylum officers asking questions to ensure they  fully explored any aspect of the claim related to a protected ground that  could result in a positive determination. For example, we observed  asylum officers asking applicants separate questions about each  protected ground, even if the applicant had not previously expressed they  were harmed because of their political beliefs or race.", "USCIS policy notes the applicant\u2019s credibility is dependent on various  factors such as comparing information provided during the interview with  that previously provided in the applicant\u2019s sworn statement to Border  Patrol or OFO when initially apprehended. If asylum officers identify an  issue with the applicant\u2019s credibility, they are to inform the applicant of the  concerns and ask the applicant for his or her perspectives. During our site  visits, we observed asylum officers questioning applicants on  inconsistencies, in a non-adversarial manner, between information  provided during the interview as compared to the applicant\u2019s sworn  statements to Border Patrol agents upon apprehension. At the end of the  interview, asylum officers are to provide a verbal summary of the material  facts of the applicant\u2019s claim, and provide an opportunity for the applicant  to make any corrections or additions. We observed asylum officers  providing such summaries in all but one of the interviews that we  observed in full.", "According to USCIS policy, asylum officers are to record key information  about the applicant\u2019s claim, as well as specific details of the  determination, on required forms that serve as the official record of the  credible or reasonable fear screening. In addition, asylum officers use a  \u201cchecklist\u201d to record more detailed legal analysis related to the applicant\u2019s  claim. Asylum officers also generally type notes during interviews in a  question and answer format, capturing each question and follow-up  question they ask, and each response the applicant provides. We  observed asylum officers documenting interviews in this way during all of  the interviews where we observed the asylum officer in person.", "Background and security checks. USCIS policy requires asylum  officers to ensure certain background and security checks are conducted.  If security checks or information discovered during the interview raises  concerns related to fraud, public safety, or national security, asylum  officers are to refer the case to USCIS\u2019s Fraud Detection and National  Security Directorate (FDNS) for assistance. FDNS officials told us the  short time frames in the credible and reasonable fear process, among  other factors, make direct involvement in individual cases less likely than  in other caseloads at USCIS, such as affirmative asylum cases. As  such, the scope and extent of FDNS investigations into credible and  reasonable fear cases is limited relative to other USCIS caseloads. FDNS  data indicate that asylum officers referred approximately 1,400 total  credible and reasonable fear cases to FDNS between fiscal years 2017  and 2018. Of those, 13 cases resulted in a formal finding, called a  Statement of Finding. FDNS officials told us referrals from asylum  officers on credible and reasonable fear cases typically result in FDNS  conducting research related to an applicant\u2019s criminal history or travel  patterns. FDNS may refer this information, in turn, to ICE to reference in  the applicant\u2019s removal proceedings, as appropriate.

According to officials, supervisors are  to communicate the results of their review to the asylum officer informally  (e.g., via email or in-person discussion) for small issues, such as an  administrative error, or through a formal write-up for larger issues, such  as if the asylum officer\u2019s legal analysis was insufficient and requires a  second interview with the applicant."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USCIS Provides Initial Training on Credible and Reasonable Fear to New Asylum Officers and Asylum Offices Are Required to Provide Ongoing On-the-Job Training", "paragraphs": ["USCIS oversight of credible and reasonable fear cases includes basic  training for new asylum officers and ongoing training for incumbent  officers at asylum offices; these trainings include information specific to  credible fear and reasonable fear screenings.

New asylum officers participate in 3 weeks of self- paced RAIO Directorate and Asylum Division distance training in their  respective asylum offices. During distance training, asylum officers  are expected to participate in webinars, read the training materials  and complete exercises and quizzes in preparation for residential  training. The Asylum Division distance training includes course  readings on credible and reasonable fear, and observations of  credible and reasonable fear interviews.", "Residential Basic Training. Asylum officers participate in a 6-week  residential basic training program, which includes 3 weeks of training  in issue areas common across USCIS\u2019s Refugees, Asylum, and  International Operations Directorate, as well as three weeks of  Asylum Division-specific training. In the first 3-week session, courses  include classroom instruction, practical exercises, and interviewing  exercises on a variety of topics and skills relevant to multiple areas of  USCIS\u2019s work, such as on affirmative asylum and refugee  adjudications. The legal topics and skills covered in this initial training  include eligibility for asylum, an applicant\u2019s nexus to protected  grounds, and eliciting testimony, among others. The second 3-week  session focuses on division-specific policy, procedure, and law related  to asylum adjudications and screenings. For example, the 3-week  session includes training on the affirmative asylum process, and  multiple mock affirmative asylum interviews, among others, as well as  2 days of training specific to credible and reasonable fear cases.  These 2 days include practical exercises; one mock credible fear  interview exercise; and formal presentations on interviewing skills and  security checks in a credible fear context, forms required for credible  and reasonable fear, and on the Convention against Torture. At the  end of the 6-week residential training course, new asylum officers  must pass final exams with a score of at least 70 percent. We  reviewed a version of the exam and found that it included questions  specific to credible and reasonable fear screenings.", "Asylum Division officials said the 9 combined weeks of distance and  residential basic training constitute the minimum amount of formal training  required for asylum officers to effectively screen credible and reasonable  fear cases. However, Asylum Division officials said it is important for  individual asylum offices to provide additional, on-the-job training to new  officers assigned to screen credible and reasonable fear cases,  specifically. Asylum officers screen credible and reasonable fear cases  under shorter time frames and with less corroborating documentation  compared to affirmative asylum cases. As such, Asylum Division officials  told us that officers accustomed to adjudicating affirmative asylum cases  may need to adjust to the shorter time frames required in credible and  reasonable fear cases. For example, some asylum offices have  developed formal presentations on local policies and procedures, or  provide officers with an opportunity to observe other officers conducting  credible or reasonable fear interviews and gradually increase the number  of cases they screen per day. Given their caseloads, the Houston and  Arlington asylum offices provide 3 and 4 weeks of additional credible and  reasonable fear training for new asylum officers, respectively. By  comparison, the San Francisco and Newark asylum offices provide 1  week of training on credible and reasonable fear procedures for new  asylum officers and Los Angeles provides 2 days of such training,  according to officials.", "For incumbent asylum officers, USCIS policy requires asylum offices to  allocate four hours per week for formal or informal training. The training  can range from classroom instruction by a training officer, to individual  study time that asylum officers can use to review case law, research  country conditions affecting asylum applicants, or read new USCIS  procedures and guidance. Individual asylum offices design their weekly  training programs based on the types of cases their office generally  receives, according to Asylum Division officials. The Asylum Division  requires training officers to track the date and topic of each weekly training session and report that information to Asylum Division  headquarters on a quarterly basis. Our analysis of fiscal year 2018  quarterly training reports for all asylum offices and sub-offices indicates  that offices with larger credible and reasonable fear caseloads generally  provided more weekly trainings on these topics. For example, Houston  and Arlington conducted seven or more weekly training sessions on  credible and reasonable fear screenings in fiscal year 2018. By  comparison, two offices with smaller credible and reasonable fear  caseloads\u2014Newark and New York\u2014conducted one or fewer weekly  sessions on credible and reasonable fear (see app. III for credible and  reasonable fear workload data by asylum office).", "In addition to this training program for asylum officers, USCIS trains  officers from outside the Asylum Division to screen credible and  reasonable fear cases, including refugee officers and others. Refugee  officers receive some of the same basic training as asylum officers, as  they participate in the same RAIO distance training and RAIO Directorate  residential training. Refugee officers do not participate in Asylum Division  distance training or residential training. As a result, USCIS provides  refugee officers with 3 days of training on screening credible fear cases  before they can begin screening cases. We reviewed training materials  for the refugee officer training, and found the sessions are similar to  Asylum Division residential training sessions on credible fear screening.", "In addition, some materials provide information and guidance on the  differences between adjudicating refugee cases and screening credible  fear cases. Officials said refugee officers generally screen credible fear  cases, including at the family residential centers, only if they are detailed  to the Houston and Arlington asylum offices. Both Houston and Arlington  provide refugee officers detailed to their offices with 1-2 weeks of  additional training on credible fear screening, similar to the procedural  training they provide to new asylum officers.

As discussed previously, asylum offices with relatively small  credible and reasonable fear local caseloads generally provide less on- the-job training throughout the year on credible and reasonable fear.  However, almost all asylum offices send officers to the family residential  centers in Texas for in-person interviews, including those offices with  small credible and reasonable fear caseloads at the local level. Asylum  Division officials said they require asylum offices to send a specific  number of asylum officers\u2014a number in proportion to the size of the  office\u2014with the largest offices sending the most officers to the family  residential centers each year.

To support officers  who are more accustomed to adjudicating affirmative asylum cases, the  Los Angeles asylum office provides pre-departure training for officers  before they travel to the family residential centers. In Los Angeles,  officers observe credible and reasonable fear interviews and gradually  increase to a full caseload of credible or reasonable fear cases at their  home office, according to officials. In San Francisco, officers receive pre- departure training highlighting procedures unique to the family residential  centers or to processing family units in credible and reasonable fear.  Specifically, San Francisco pre-departure training includes a formal  presentation on family residential center procedures, including discussion  of challenges officers may experience, according to officials. By  comparison, officials from the Chicago and New York offices told us they  do not provide formal pre-departure training but rather direct or  recommend that officers review Asylum Division guidance and  procedures on family processing independently before they travel.  Officials from two other offices told us they rely on the training asylum  officers may receive throughout the year related to credible and  reasonable fear, which can vary, as previously discussed.", "Asylum officers also noted inconsistent pre-departure training prior to  their temporary duty during our February 2019 visits to two Texas family  residential centers in Dilley and Karnes. For example, some asylum  officers we interviewed said they screened credible and reasonable fear  cases at their home office in preparation for their assignment. Others said  they reviewed procedures independently on family processing in credible  and reasonable fear cases. Officers from one asylum office said they  relied primarily on an email from USCIS support staff located at the family  residential centers to learn about screening family cases.", "Asylum officers are to review the procedures on family processing in  credible and reasonable fear before they arrive at the family residential  centers, according to officials. However, there is no minimum amount of  pre-departure training, or required content for such training, that all  asylum offices are to provide before officers begin screening family units.  Asylum Division officials acknowledged that training on screening of  family units for credible and reasonable fear varies by asylum office and  noted that offices have been given discretion to determine what, if any,  pre-departure training to provide on screening family units. Arlington and  Houston asylum office officials stated that inconsistent asylum officer  training on credible and reasonable fear cases negatively impacts  efficiency at the family residential centers. Specifically, these officials  noted that asylum officers who typically adjudicate affirmative asylum  applications benefit from training on key differences between credible  fear, reasonable fear, and affirmative asylum. For example, officials said  more training could reduce administrative errors in applicants\u2019 paperwork,  and changes needed during supervisory review, both of which occur more  often for officers with less experience and training, according to officials.  Further, officials said asylum officers less experienced in credible and  reasonable fear may not be able to handle a full caseload at the family  residential centers when they first arrive. As a result, Houston officials  said they may spend the first week of a 2-week assignment providing  additional support to inexperienced officers as they gradually increase to  a full caseload.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states  management should demonstrate a commitment to recruit, develop, and  retain competent individuals.

As previously noted,  Asylum Division officials told us additional training for asylum officers  before they begin screening cases at the family residential centers is  important. Officials also said their intention is to balance such training  against the need for rapid deployment, in some cases. Although  additional training may not be feasible before every deployment, providing  asylum officers additional pre-departure training before they begin  screening credible and reasonable fear cases for family units would better  prepare officers and help ensure efficient and effective case processing at  ICE\u2019s family residential centers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USCIS Conducts Various Quality Assurance Reviews of Credible and Reasonable Fear Cases, but Does Not Document Results in a Consistent Manner", "paragraphs": ["USCIS relies primarily on two quality assurance reviews for assessing  quality of credible and reasonable fear cases, but does not document the  results of one of these reviews in a consistent manner.", "Annual, Asylum Division-wide reviews.

To do so, the Asylum Division works in  collaboration with the RAIO Directorate. The reviews occur each year,  and rotate between a sampling of credible fear cases, reasonable fear  cases, and affirmative asylum cases.", "For credible and reasonable fear reviews, USCIS randomly selects a  specified number of cases after supervisory review, but before officers  serve determinations to the applicant. Reviewers use a checklist to  identify and track quality issues arising in each reviewed case, such as  accurate data entry, appropriate legal analysis, asylum officer notes that  reflect a skilled interview, and others. The review process for each case  includes two lines of review. If the two reviewers come to different  conclusions, they discuss any differences in their reviews and reach  consensus about how to score the case. USCIS records the results of  these reviews in a document that lays out the numbers and percentages  of errors in areas covered in the review checklist. For example, for the  2018 review of credible fear cases, the document states asylum officer  notes did not reflect a skilled interview in an estimated 58 percent of  cases. For most of these cases, the reason for the error that reviewers  noted was insufficient follow-up questions. USCIS officials said while the  sample across asylum offices is generalizable with respect to the credible  or reasonable fear caseloads nationwide, the samples taken from each  asylum office are not large enough to draw conclusions about trends at  individual asylum offices. Officials said they rely on periodic reviews to  identify trends by asylum office.", "Periodic, asylum office reviews. In addition to the Asylum Division-wide  quality assurance reviews, the Asylum Division began conducting periodic  reviews at asylum offices in November 2017. As of November 2019, the  Asylum Division had conducted periodic reviews of credible and  reasonable fear cases or affirmative asylum adjudications at some  asylum offices, as well as a review of credible and reasonable fear cases  at the family residential centers. For periodic reviews, the Asylum Division  selects cases over a period of several weeks. For example, based on the  Asylum Division\u2019s draft standard operating procedures for the periodic  reviews, an asylum office may send two to four credible and reasonable  fear cases every day for several weeks to reach the required total number  of cases.

For example, some reports had analysis on details related to  procedures, eliciting testimony, and issues related to fraud detection and  national security. Other reports included analysis of specific trends in  persecution cases and in Convention against Torture cases. Some  reports also included analysis on legal sufficiency, applicant country of  origin, determination outcomes, and others. According to the draft  standard operating procedure, reviewers are to note trends, common  errors, and collect samples to create a deliverable, such as a short report  or other deliverables, for the asylum office at the end of the review.

Asylum Division officials told us the primary purpose of the  periodic reviews is to collect information about current, office-specific  trends, and provide timely support in the form of training sessions and  other guidance. Further, the Asylum Division historically has not used the  periodic reviews to compare one office to another, though they have  sometimes noted issues from these reviews requiring similar guidance  across multiple offices.

Issuing the parent and  child a Notice to Appear places them into full removal proceedings where  they can apply for multiple forms of relief or protection before an  immigration judge, including asylum, rather than being expeditiously  ordered removed in accordance with the expedited removal process. The  exercise of this discretion to issue a Notice to Appear to both the child  receiving a positive determination and the parent he or she arrived with in  the interest of family unity is limited to cases in which the children are  under the age of 18 because, according to the policy, family unity  interests are more compelling when the child is a minor.", "USCIS data indicate that asylum officers screened more than 141,000  credible fear cases at ICE\u2019s four family residential centers between fiscal  years 2014 and the first two quarters of 2019 (see table 3).

They stated surges in credible and reasonable fear case receipts may  require immediate staff redeployment from the affirmative asylum  workload. As a result, asylum offices have sometimes canceled planned  affirmative asylum interviews and have prioritized credible and  reasonable fear screenings over affirmative asylum cases, which have  significantly contributed to the current backlog in pending affirmative  asylum cases, according to headquarters officials.

For reasonable fear cases  subject to this settlement agreement that take longer than 20 court days  to complete, asylum offices are to notify the Chief of the Asylum Division  in writing and provide an explanation for the delay. Further, USCIS must  provide class counsel in the Alfaro-Garcia case a notice and remedial  plan of action for cases that exceed 20 days that are subject to that  settlement agreement.", "Consistent with USCIS policy and the Alfaro-Garcia settlement  agreement, officers may pause the clock for reasonable fear cases\u2014 and thus case processing times\u2014in the following limited circumstances:  the applicant or the applicant\u2019s representative requests to defer the  reasonable fear interview;  the applicant refuses to participate in the reasonable fear interview or  accept service of a reasonable fear determination; or exceptional circumstances.", "USCIS pauses processing times for detained reasonable fear cases by  recording the dates when the case was paused and when processing  resumed, once the basis for pausing the clock no longer exists.

In our case processing time  analysis of USCIS data, we excluded approximately 13 percent of  reasonable fear cases that had at least one pause in case processing  time from our analysis because, in conducting our analysis, we could not  systematically confirm the appropriate order of dates for those cases. As  shown in table 6, our review of USCIS data for cases that did not include  pauses found that USCIS completed at least 91 percent of reasonable  fear cases within 10 or fewer court days from fiscal year 2016 to the  second quarter of fiscal year 2019."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USCIS Does Not Have Complete Data on Reasons for Case Delays", "paragraphs": ["Although the Asylum Division monitors overall processing times for  credible and reasonable fear cases, it does not collect comprehensive  data in its case management system on some types of case delays. For  example, USCIS tracks whether cases are delayed for certain reasons  related to the individual\u2014such as if he or she has a medical condition that  prevents the asylum officer from conducting the interview, if the individual  requests that the interview be rescheduled, or if the individual is detained  in a remote location. In addition, USCIS\u2019s system can track if cases are  delayed for logistical or resource constraints. Specifically, asylum officers  may select \u201clack of resources\u201d as one case delay reason in the system.  However, this field in the system does not allow officers to distinguish  more specific types of delays\u2014such as a lack of space in detention  facilities for officers to screen fear cases, telephones not working  properly, and other types of delays\u2014which officers told us occur on a  regular basis.", "Asylum officers we interviewed in the Arlington and Houston offices  stated that logistical delays could affect the number of credible or  reasonable fear cases they can complete each day. Specifically, some  asylum officers said they have experienced delays up to 30 minutes  waiting for phone lines to work properly at detention facilities. Moreover,  supervisors we interviewed in the Arlington office stated telephone and  interpreter delays could add 20 or 30 minutes per case, resulting in a  cumulative delay that could affect an officer\u2019s productivity for any given  day. Moreover, supervisors in the Arlington office said it is challenging to  identify the appropriate number of cases to assign to officers because the  number depends on whether or not disruptions occur. Asylum officers in  Arlington said they are expected to conduct a certain number of credible  or reasonable fear screenings per day, but expectations for completing  their assigned cases may be tempered by circumstances such as  interpreter availability or if there are issues at the detention facility,  including physical space shortfalls or difficulty in locating the individual at  the facility. Similarly, asylum officers in Houston said they are expected  to complete a certain number of credible or reasonable fear cases per  day, but supervisors understand that they may face logistical challenges  such as interpreter or telephone issues.", "In addition to system limitations in tracking case delay reasons, Asylum  Division headquarters officials said their case management system does  not have the capability to track how long case delays may last. Our  analysis of USCIS data from fiscal year 2014 through the second quarter  of fiscal year 2019 indicates that 21,528 credible fear cases and 6,724  reasonable fear cases had delays. USCIS\u2019s system can calculate the  number of days for each credible and reasonable fear case\u2014in other  words, the total processing time for each case\u2014and the system can  produce daily reports noting these overall processing times. However,  officials in the Houston office told us they must investigate individual  cases on an ad hoc basis to understand how long cases have been  delayed during processing. Specifically, officials in the Houston office said  they maintain weekly \u201clate reports\u201d using information from USCIS\u2019s case  management system that show pending credible and reasonable fear  cases with the longest processing times and that they must spend time  researching cases on the report to determine the length of the delays.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that  management should obtain data on a timely basis so that they can be  used for effective monitoring. These standards also state that  management should process the obtained data into quality information  that supports the internal control system. As previously discussed,  USCIS\u2019s case management system does not track specific logistical  reasons for any delays in credible and reasonable fear cases, which  affect the number of cases an officer can complete in a day. Furthermore,  USCIS\u2019s system can calculate the number of processing days for each  credible and reasonable fear case. However, the system cannot track  how long a case delay lasts. Headquarters officials said they evaluate the  usefulness of their system, and consider options for improvements or  changes, on an ongoing basis. However, as of October 2019, they stated  they did not have plans for significant changes to the system to track  more specific case delay reasons. Collecting additional information in its  automated case management system on case delays would provide  USCIS with more readily available information and analyzing such data  could help USCIS identify case delay reasons relevant in the current  environment for officers conducting fear screenings and better position  USCIS to mitigate the reasons for the delays and improve efficiency in  case processing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EOIR Has Processes to Manage the Credible and Reasonable Fear Review Workload and Is Developing a Tool to Monitor Adherence to Required Review Processing Times", "paragraphs": ["EOIR has developed processes for immigration courts and judges to help  manage its workload related to credible and reasonable fear reviews. As  previously discussed, in the event of a negative outcome of their credible  or reasonable fear screening, noncitizens can request a review of  USCIS\u2019s negative determination by an immigration judge. The  Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, and regulation require that  such reviews occur within certain time frames. Specifically,  immigration judge reviews of negative credible fear determinations are  to be conducted no later than 7 days after referral from USCIS, to the  maximum extent practicable, and  immigration judge reviews of negative reasonable fear determinations  are to be conducted within 10 days of referral, in the absence of  exceptional circumstances.", "EOIR officials told us that increased resources, beginning in fiscal year  2015, and a faster process for hiring immigration judges have allowed  EOIR to increase the number of immigration judges. As of September 30,  2019, EOIR reported that it had 442 immigration judges on board,  including 173 judges hired in fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019. EOIR  reports that the number of immigration judges has increased each year  from fiscal year 2015 through fiscal year 2019. EOIR officials told us that  they plan to hire an additional 100 judges in fiscal year 2020.  Additionally, EOIR officials told us that they prioritize credible and  reasonable fear reviews and that these reviews can generally be  accommodated within EOIR\u2019s existing resources\u2014specifically, by finding  efficiencies within judges\u2019 existing schedules to add credible or  reasonable fear review hearings or by conducting hearings via video  teleconferencing (VTC). EOIR officials also said that credible and  reasonable fear reviews for individuals in ICE\u2019s family residential centers  comprise a small portion of EOIR\u2019s overall workload.", "According to EOIR officials, each ICE detention facility is assigned to the  jurisdiction of an immigration court, and the workload for credible and  reasonable fear reviews is managed locally by the court to which each  detention facility is assigned. ICE officers are to initiate the immigration  judge\u2019s review by filing a request with the appropriate immigration court.  Some courts are co-located with ICE detention facilities in which the  detainee requesting the credible or reasonable fear review is housed.  EOIR officials said that reviews in those locations are typically heard in  person by immigration judges assigned to that facility, and that the court  finds room in the judge\u2019s regular calendar to hear credible and reasonable  fear reviews. For individuals in detention facilities without a co-located  immigration court, including ICE family residential centers, immigration  judges typically conduct credible and reasonable fear reviews via VTC.  Judges conducting credible or reasonable fear reviews via VTC may be  located in any immigration court in the United States. According to EOIR  officials, the Assistant Chief Immigration Judge for each court is  responsible for managing the court\u2019s workload, including seeking support  from judges outside the court in circumstances where there are too many  cases for the court\u2019s assigned judges. EOIR officials told us that the use  of VTC technology\u2014which is available in all courtrooms\u2014provides  flexibility to the courts in balancing workloads related to credible and  reasonable fear reviews, among other workloads.", "In addition, EOIR officials stated that judges\u2019 credible and reasonable fear  workload is impacted, in particular, by immigration enforcement priorities  and USCIS credible or reasonable fear determinations. For example, if  DHS places more noncitizens into expedited removal proceedings who  subsequently express fear or intent to apply for asylum, EOIR\u2019s related  workload might increase. In addition, because immigration judges do not  review USCIS\u2019s positive credible fear determinations, if USCIS\u2019s  screenings result in more negative determinations, EOIR\u2019s caseload  related to credible or reasonable fear reviews might increase.", "As of January 2018, EOIR has performance measures that include  timeliness goals for credible and reasonable fear reviews, and these  timeliness goals align with the required credible and reasonable fear  review time frames. However, EOIR data we reviewed indicate that about  30 percent of credible and reasonable fear reviews are not completed  within the required time frames. Specifically, EOIR\u2019s memorandum on  Case Priorities and Immigration Court Performance Measures states that  100 percent of credible fear reviews should be completed within seven  days of an asylum officer\u2019s negative determination and that 100 percent  of reasonable fear reviews should be completed within 10 days of the  filing of a negative reasonable fear determination. Further, according to  EOIR officials, courts are to assign credible and reasonable fear reviews  to a judge within 48 hours of receipt of the request from ICE, and  immigration judges are to complete such reviews within 24 hours after  they are assigned.", "EOIR officials said their automated case management system maintains  data on the date when courts receive a request from ICE for an  immigration judge review, the date the review is assigned to a judge, and  the date the review takes place. EOIR headquarters officials told us that  they monitor the extent to which judges are completing reviews within 24  hours after they are assigned using an automated immigration judge  performance dashboard, which allows officials to review this performance  measure for all judges combined, for individual courts, or for individual  judges. Further, EOIR officials told us that if courts are scheduling  credible and reasonable fear reviews within 48 hours after receipt and  judges are completing reviews within 24 hours after they are assigned,  they expect that EOIR should be meeting the required time frames (7  days after ICE\u2019s referral for credible fear reviews and 10 days after ICE\u2019s  referral for reasonable fear review) for conducting credible and  reasonable fear reviews.", "EOIR data we reviewed indicate that, from fiscal year 2014 through June  2019, approximately 28 percent of credible fear and 36 percent of  reasonable fear reviews exceeded the required time frames, as shown in  table 7 below.", "As previously discussed, the Immigration and Nationality Act and  regulation allow for some flexibility with regard to the required credible  and reasonable fear review time frames. Specifically, credible fear  reviews are to be completed within 7 days, to the maximum extent  practicable, and reasonable fear reviews are to be completed within 10  days, absent exceptional circumstances. EOIR officials we spoke with  said there are a variety of court, judge, or applicant-related reasons that  reviews could exceed the required time frames. For example, case file  documentation sent from USCIS to the court may be incomplete. Further,  a detention facility may have a medical quarantine that restricts court  proceedings for a certain period of time.", "EOIR headquarters officials told us that, as of October 2019, they review  weekly reports that include the median processing times for completed  credible and reasonable fear reviews. For example, according to one  weekly report from October 2019, the median completion time for credible  fear reviews was 7 days. These reports also include information about  the average and median number of days pending per case, for those  credible and reasonable fear reviews that are not complete. For example,  the weekly report we reviewed from October 2019 showed that EOIR had  553 pending credible fear reviews that week, with a median of 7 days  pending and an average of 18 days pending. While these weekly reports  allow EOIR headquarters officials to monitor some information about their  credible and reasonable fear workload, they do not provide information to  EOIR officials about the proportion of EOIR\u2019s credible and reasonable  fear reviews that are completed within the required time frames, or  whether any reviews are delayed for reasons within the limits set out in  the law or regulation.", "EOIR officials said they plan to implement an automated court operations  dashboard in early 2020 which is to, among other things, monitor court  performance against the performance goals EOIR established in January  2018, including the credible and reasonable fear performance goals. This  automated dashboard is to be similar to the immigration judge  performance dashboard, which EOIR implemented in early 2019.  According to EOIR, the court operations dashboard is intended to  operationalize EOIR\u2019s performance measures\u2014including completion of  100 percent of credible fear reviews with 7 days and 100 percent of  reasonable fear reviews within 10 days\u2014by providing court staff with daily  alerts and warning notices to help court administrators prioritize the  scheduling of cases based on the performance measures. This  prioritization, combined with EOIR\u2019s monitoring of judge performance to  ensure that credible and reasonable fear reviews are completed within 24  hours after they are scheduled, should provide EOIR officials with  sufficient information to monitor EOIR\u2019s adherence to the required  credible and reasonable fear review time frames. Because  implementation of the court operations dashboard is planned for early  2020, it is too soon to know if EOIR will use the dashboard to monitor  adherence to the required credible and reasonable fear review time  frames or if it will help EOIR understand reasons for delays in those  cases that take longer than 7 or 10 days."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The number of credible and reasonable fear cases has increased since  fiscal year 2014, and USCIS policies and procedures require completion  of those cases within short time frames. The Asylum Division provides  training for credible and reasonable fear cases to new asylum officers in  basic training, given the differences between these screenings and  affirmative asylum adjudications. However, not all offices provide  additional training on screening such cases at the family residential  centers. Ensuring that all asylum offices provide such training, in addition  to basic training for new officers, would better prepare them to screen  those cases efficiently and effectively. In addition, USCIS relies on its  periodic quality assurance reviews to assess the quality of credible and  reasonable fear cases across asylum offices. Developing and  implementing more specific guidance on requirements for documenting  the results of its periodic quality assurance reviews would better position  the agency to track trends for credible and reasonable fear reviews  across asylum offices. USCIS data show that positive credible fear  determination rates are higher at the family residential centers than they  are nationwide, in part because USCIS\u2019s automated case management  system does not track whether an individual receives a credible fear  determination as a principal applicant, dependent, or in the interest of  family unity. Without systematically recording credible fear determinations  involving family members, USCIS may not have complete data on  credible fear determination rates, and the agency may not be in a position  to report on the scope of its policy for family members in the credible fear  process.", "Asylum officers have experienced logistical delays that can affect the  number of credible and reasonable fear cases they complete each day.  Although USCIS tracks some of these delays in its case management  system, the system does not distinguish between specific reasons for  logistical case delays, such as telephones nor working properly or lack of  space at detention facilities for officers to screen cases. Furthermore,  USCIS\u2019s system can calculate the number of processing days for each  credible and reasonable fear case. However, the system cannot track  how long case delays last. By collecting and analyzing additional  information on case delays, including specific reasons for delays and how  long they last, USCIS can identify relevant case delays for officers  conducting fear screenings.

We also interviewed officials from USCIS\u2019s Fraud Detection and National  Security Directorate (FDNS), which is responsible for leading USCIS\u2019s  efforts to detect and deter immigration benefit fraud and help detect  national security and public safety threats. We conducted site visits at two  of USCIS\u2019s eight asylum offices\u2014Houston, Texas and Arlington,  Virginia\u2014in April 2019. We selected these asylum offices based on the  relatively large size of their credible and reasonable fear caseloads in  fiscal year 2018\u2014the most recent, complete data available at the time of  our review. During these visits, we conducted in-person, semi-structured  interviews with asylum officers, supervisory asylum officers, training  officers, FDNS immigration officers, and asylum office management.  During these interviews, we discussed topics related to data quality,  supervisory review, training, quality assurance, family processing, and  resource allocation. While the views expressed in these interviews do not  represent those of all Houston and Arlington asylum office officials, they  provide valuable insights from stakeholders who have experience with  credible and reasonable fear policies and procedures. In addition, we  collected written responses from the remaining six asylum offices on the  same topics.", "Further, we conducted site visits to U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement (ICE) adult detention centers and family residential centers.  Specifically, we visited single adult detention facilities in San Diego,  California (September 2018), and Port Isabel and Pearsall, Texas  (October 2018 and February 2019, respectively). We selected these ICE  single adult facilities based on their geographic proximity to various CBP  field locations we visited (discussed below). In addition, in February 2019,  we visited ICE\u2019s Enforcement and Removal Operations field office in San  Antonio, Texas, as well as ICE\u2019s South Texas Family Residential Center  in Dilley, Texas, and Karnes County Residential Center in Karnes, Texas.  We selected these two ICE family residential centers for field visits  because they accounted for more credible and reasonable fear referrals  to USCIS than any other single adult detention facility or family residential  center. We also selected them to examine unique aspects of ICE and  USCIS processing of credible and reasonable fear claims made by  members of family units.", "During these visits to USCIS asylum offices and ICE detention facilities,  we observed USCIS asylum officers conducting credible or reasonable  fear screenings of single adults and family unit members either in person  or via telephone. In total, we observed more than 20 credible and  reasonable fear interviews across our site visits. Our observations are not  generalizable to all USCIS asylum offices conducting credible and  reasonable fear screenings, but provided us the opportunity to learn more  about how USCIS personnel conduct interviews, make fear  determinations, process these cases, and coordinate with ICE officials.", "For additional context about how noncitizens are apprehended at the  border, processed into expedited or full immigration removal proceedings,  transferred to ICE, and ultimately referred to USCIS for credible and  reasonable fear screenings, as appropriate, we interviewed headquarters  personnel from DHS\u2019s U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u2019s (CBP)  Office of Field Operations (OFO) and U.S. Border Patrol (Border Patrol)  who are responsible for apprehending noncitizens at or between U.S.  ports of entry. In addition, we conducted site visits at CBP facilities in  California and Texas from September 2018 to October 2018. In  California, we visited Border Patrol\u2019s San Diego sector headquarters and  Imperial Beach station, and OFO\u2019s San Ysidro port of entry.

During these visits, we interviewed Border Patrol and OFO officials and  observed how CBP personnel processed apprehended individuals and,  as appropriate, documented whether those individuals expressed an  intention to apply for asylum, a fear of persecution or torture, or a fear of  return to their country. To select these locations, we assessed CBP data  on Border Patrol and OFO apprehensions along the southwest border  and targeted specific locations that saw the greatest increase in the  number of apprehensions of individuals from fiscal year 2016 to 2017. As  noted previously, we also considered the geographical proximity of  multiple CBP and ICE facilities to maximize observations. Our  observations during site visits are not generalizable to all Border Patrol  and OFO operations along the southwest border, but provided us the  opportunity to learn more about policies and procedures for processing  noncitizens into removal proceedings and documenting any fear claims.", "To address the first objective, we obtained and analyzed data and  documentation from USCIS and EOIR. Regarding USCIS, we analyzed  record-level data from USCIS\u2019s automated case management system  from fiscal year 2014 through the second quarter of fiscal year 2019  (March 2019)\u2014the most recent time period for which complete data were  available at the time of our review. We analyzed these data to identify  the number, characteristics, and outcomes of credible and reasonable  fear cases. According to USCIS officials, USCIS\u2019s system creates a  unique number, or \u201ccase ID\u201d for each case. USCIS officials told us that a  previous system used a different identifier for each case\u2014the individual\u2019s  Alien number (or \u201cA-number\u201d)\u2014and did not use a \u201ccase ID\u201d field. USCIS  transitioned from its previous system to its current system in February  2018 and, according to USCIS officials, cases originally opened prior to  the transition to the new system may have been re-opened under the  same \u201ccase ID\u201d number in the new system. As part of our data reliability  testing, we checked for unique \u201ccase ID\u201d numbers by searching for  duplicate values and determined the data did not have duplicate values  for \u201ccase ID\u201d numbers. For our analysis of USCIS data specifically for ICE  detention facilities and family residential centers, we only included  credible and reasonable fear cases for detained individuals. To assess  the reliability of USCIS data, we completed a number of steps, including  (1) performing electronic testing for obvious errors in accuracy and  completeness, such as running logic tests; (2) reviewing existing  information about the data and the systems that produced them, such as  relevant training materials for USCIS officers who use the system; and (3)  discussing data entry issues and data limitations with USCIS officials.

Specifically, we reviewed EOIR data on credible and reasonable fear  reviews from fiscal year 2014 through June 2019\u2014the most recent,  complete data available at the time of our review. We also obtained and  analyzed summary data from EOIR on credible and reasonable fear  reviews for those individuals detained in ICE\u2019s family residential centers.  We analyzed the data to determine the outcomes of all credible and  reasonable fear reviews and compared the outcomes of all reviews with  the outcomes of reviews at ICE\u2019s family residential centers.

For our analysis of Border Patrol data, we used  \u201capprehensions\u201d as our unit of analysis, instead of the number of  individuals apprehended, because an individual may have been  apprehended multiple times in the same year.

It is possible that these  apprehension records represented one apprehended individual that  Border Patrol agents processed as two apprehensions. These records  comprised less than one percent of the more than 2.3 million  apprehension records we analyzed. We included these apprehension  records in our analysis because Border Patrol considers them unique  apprehensions and because their small number did not materially affect  our analysis.", "In addition, Border Patrol did not systematically track family relationships  in its data systems until fiscal year 2016, as we have previously reported.  Therefore, our analysis of Border Patrol apprehensions of family unit  members processed under expedited removal proceedings is for fiscal  years 2016 through the first two quarters of 2019.", "Further, according to Border Patrol officials, Border Patrol did not record  reasonable fear cases in its automated data system before April 2016.  Therefore, we are reporting the number of reasonable fear cases  recorded by the Border Patrol in its automated system from fiscal year  2017 (the first full year for which Border Patrol recorded this information in  its system) through the second quarter of fiscal year 2019. We did not  include the 860 reasonable fear cases that Border Patrol recorded in its  automated system for fiscal year 2016, since this number represents only  partial-year data. According to Border Patrol officials, prior to April 2016,  these reasonable fear cases would likely have been recorded under other  case dispositions in their automated system, such as one indicating the  reinstatement of a prior removal order.", "We determined that Border Patrol data are sufficiently reliable to describe  the numbers and demographic characteristics of individuals and family  unit members apprehended from fiscal year 2014 through the second  quarter of fiscal year 2019.", "OFO data. For our analysis of OFO data, we used \u201capprehensions\u201d as  our unit of analysis, instead of the number of individuals apprehended.", "We excluded approximately 13 percent of all apprehension records  (including single adults, unaccompanied alien children, and parents and  children that arrived as part of a family unit) from our analyses because  we could not confirm an A-number for those apprehensions. Among the  apprehension records missing an A-number, 44 percent were cases in  which OFO officers paroled the individuals and, according to OFO  officials, officers are not required to assign an A-number to these  individuals. In addition, 47 percent of the records with a missing A- number were cases that involved the individual withdrawing their  application for admission into the United States, in which OFO officers  have discretion whether to assign an A-number. According to OFO  officials, additional records with missing A-numbers may be due to data  entry errors or problems with the data system saving this information in  the database that OFO used to pull the data. Finally, we collapsed  182,266 apprehension records into 86,597 apprehension records  because we determined that they were duplicate records for the same  individual and the same apprehension, based on factors such as alien  number, birth date, and date and time of apprehension.", "As a result, we determined that we could not present precise figures for  analyses that include OFO data and instead provided approximations  throughout the report. We rounded all data and figures on OFO  apprehensions down to the hundreds place and described relevant data  using modifiers such as \u201cat least\u201d because of possible missing  information.", "In addition, according to OFO officials, OFO does not capture information  in its automated data system on individuals who were processed under  expedited removal with a reasonable fear claim. OFO officials stated that,  since OFO has historically processed a relatively small number of such  apprehensions, it does not collect automated data on reasonable fear  claims.", "With the previously-described modifications, we determined that OFO  data are sufficiently reliable to generally describe the numbers and  demographic characteristics of individuals and family unit members  apprehended from fiscal year 2014 through the second quarter of fiscal  year 2019.", "ICE data. To report on ICE detentions of adults and family unit members,  we obtained and analyzed ICE detention data from fiscal years 2014 to  2018, the most current data available at the time of our review. The ICE  data we obtained contained information on whether adults and family  members booked-in to an ICE detention facility had a fear claim recorded  in ICE\u2019s data system as of the date our data were pulled. Specifically,  we divided our analysis of ICE detention data into two parts. First, we  obtained data on all individuals (all adults and children without  consideration of any family relationships) detained from fiscal year 2014  through fiscal year 2018. Second, we obtained data specifically on family  unit members apprehended by CBP and housed at the four ICE family  residential centers from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2018.", "Regarding our analysis of family unit members who made a fear claim in  one of ICE\u2019s family residential centers, we excluded less than one percent  of all detention records from our analyses because we could not confirm a  unique identifier for the individual. In addition, for individual family unit  members who were detained more than once in a fiscal year, we included  the most recent record for the individuals in our analyses to report on the  most recent information available about each individual. This accounted  for less than one percent of all detention records in our time period of  analysis.", "We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable to describe the  numbers of individuals (adults and family unit members) who were  apprehended by CBP and recorded by ICE as having made a credible  fear claim.", "To address our second objective, in addition to our aforementioned  interviews and site visits, we reviewed relevant laws and regulations  governing the credible and reasonable fear screening process. We  collected and analyzed documentation on key USCIS oversight  mechanisms related to credible and reasonable fear screenings\u2014 supervisory review, asylum officer training, and quality assurance  reviews. In particular, we reviewed the Credible Fear Procedures Manual,  and the Reasonable Fear Procedures Manual, standard operating  procedures, training and quality assurance records and materials, and  guidance on conducting credible and reasonable fear screenings for  families in ICE detention.", "Specifically, we reviewed USCIS asylum officer basic training materials  from RAIO and the Asylum Division, and training materials for officers  from outside the Asylum Division who screen credible and reasonable  fear cases. In particular, we reviewed USCIS Asylum Division quarterly  training reports for fiscal year 2018 and used them to analyze the weekly  training activities in each asylum office for each week of the reporting  quarter. We compared RAIO and Asylum Division training materials with  federal internal control standards related to developing competent  individuals qualified to carry out assigned responsibilities. We also  reviewed documents associated with the quality assurance reviews that  the Asylum Division conducted, including those reviews conducted in  collaboration with RAIO. Specifically, we reviewed standard operating  procedures, reviewer checklists, and resulting reports and analysis for  three RAIO nationwide reviews of credible and reasonable fear cases and  for the six periodic reviews of credible and reasonable fear cases the  Asylum Division conducted at asylum offices and at the family residential  centers between November 2017 and May 2018. We compared these  policy documents and their role in providing oversight of the credible and  reasonable fear process against federal internal control standards related  to ongoing monitoring activities and evaluation of results. We also  reviewed USCIS standard operating procedures, requirements, and  training materials for processing family members, and corresponding data  on applicant family relationships. We then compared the procedures,  requirements and data against federal internal control standards related  to obtaining high quality data.", "To address our third objective, we reviewed USCIS and EOIR documents  and data, and interviewed relevant officials to evaluate the extent to which  USCIS and EOIR have process for managing their respective credible  and reasonable fear-related workloads.", "USCIS. In particular, we reviewed USCIS documentation and spoke with  officials from Asylum Division headquarters and local asylum offices  regarding the Asylum Division\u2019s staffing allocation model for the credible  and reasonable fear workload. In addition, we obtained and analyzed  record-level data from USCIS\u2019s automated case management system to  identify processing times and case delays for credible and reasonable  fear cases between fiscal year 2014 through the second quarter of fiscal  year 2019 (March 2019). We included cases that had a fear determination  that was served or an administrative closure for both detained and  nondetained individuals.", "In this report, we present information on both credible and reasonable  fear case receipts and analysis of processing times for the cases using  the \u201cclock-in\u201d date recorded in USCIS\u2019s automated case management  system. However, while USCIS relies on the \u201cclock-in\u201d date to track case  processing times, according to an Asylum Division official USCIS tracks  and reports the number of credible and reasonable fear case receipts  based on the date cases are input into, or \u201ccreated\u201d in, its automated  system. According to the official, these \u201ccreated\u201d and \u201cclock-in\u201d dates are  often the same, but can differ slightly. Therefore, the number of case  receipts tracked and reported by USCIS may differ slightly from those  presented in this report.", "Regarding credible fear cases, we determined case processing times by  calculating the difference between the beginning and end dates for  credible fear cases. We considered credible fear case processing times  for detained individuals to begin on the day when USCIS receives referral  documents and records a \u201cclock-in\u201d date in the automated case  management system, as noted previously. For nondetained individuals,  the clock starts for credible fear cases when a USCIS asylum office  conducts the interview for a credible fear screening. We used the  starting clock date for detained and nondetained individuals provided by  USCIS for our analysis. We considered credible fear case processing  times to end on the day when cases either had a fear determination that  was served or an administrative closure. We included credible fear  cases that had a fear determination that was served or an administrative  closure for detained and nondetained individuals. We also reviewed  USCIS\u2019s publicly-reported data on credible fear processing times during  this time period.", "Regarding reasonable fear cases, we used USCIS data to count the  number of processing days and percent of cases completed in certain  time intervals. We determined reasonable fear processing times by  calculating the difference between the beginning and end dates for  reasonable fear cases. We considered reasonable fear case processing  times for detained individuals to begin on the day when USCIS receives  referral documents and records a \u201cclock-in\u201d date in the automated case  management system, as noted previously. For nondetained individuals,  the clock starts for reasonable fear cases when a USCIS asylum office  conducts the interview for a reasonable fear screening. We used the  starting clock date for detained and nondetained individuals provided by  USCIS for our analysis. We calculated reasonable fear processing times  in court days by excluding weekends and federal holidays. USCIS may  also pause the clock when processing reasonable fear cases in certain  circumstances. We excluded approximately 13 percent of reasonable  fear cases that had at least one pause in case processing time from our  analysis because in conducting our analysis we could not systematically  confirm the appropriate order of dates for those cases. We considered  reasonable fear case processing times to end on the day when cases  either had a fear determination that was served or administrative  closure. We also included reasonable fear cases that were served a  fear determination or received an administrative closure for detained and  nondetained individuals.", "To identify the reasons for delays in credible and reasonable fear cases  during the time period of our analysis, we identified the fields that  USCIS\u2019s case management system tracks for case delays related to the  credible and reasonable fear workload. In addition, we reviewed USCIS\u2019s  manuals and documentation on its case management system. We  compared USCIS\u2019s recording and tracking of data on case delays to  federal internal control standards related to obtaining data on a timely  basis for management to use for effective monitoring and that data should  be processed into high quality information. We determined that the  USCIS data we reviewed on credible and reasonable fear processing  times and case delays were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "EOIR. To evaluate EOIR\u2019s process for managing its credible and  reasonable fear-related workload, we interviewed EOIR officials about  their practices to manage the credible and reasonable fear workload,  including immigration judge hiring, oversight of credible and reasonable  fear review processing times, infrastructure requirements for credible and  reasonable fear reviews, and the use of video teleconferencing by judges  to conduct credible and reasonable fear reviews. We reviewed publicly  available data about EOIR\u2019s workload and case adjudications, including  data about the number of credible and reasonable fear reviews EOIR  judges completed and data about judges hired from fiscal year 2014  through fiscal year 2019. We also reviewed guidance documents, such as  EOIR\u2019s 2018 Case Priorities and Performance Measures memorandum,  which established performance measures for credible and reasonable  fear reviews. In addition, we used EOIR data to analyze the timeliness of  EOIR\u2019s completion of credible and reasonable fear reviews and compared  EOIR\u2019s processing times for fiscal year 2014 through the third quarter of  fiscal year 2019 with required time frames. By reviewing documentation  on EOIR\u2019s case management system and interviewing officials with  knowledge about EOIR\u2019s case management system and the methodology  used to calculate the publicly-reported data, we determined that the EOIR  data we reviewed on credible and reasonable fear review processing  times and outcomes was sufficiently reliable for analyzing the number of  credible and reasonable fear reviews completed and pending, and the  duration of the reviews.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2018 to February  2020 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
