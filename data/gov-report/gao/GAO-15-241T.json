DOD has financial management improvement efforts under way and is monitoring  progress against milestones; however, we have found that DOD and its  components have emphasized the assertion of audit readiness by  milestone dates over the implementation of effective underlying  processes, systems, and controls. While establishing milestones is  important for measuring progress, DOD should not lose sight of the  ultimate goal\u2014implementing lasting financial management reform to help  ensure that it has the systems, processes, and personnel to routinely  generate reliable financial management and other information critical to  decision-making and effective operations for achieving its missions.  Continued congressional oversight of DOD\u2019s financial management  improvement efforts will be critical to helping ensure DOD achieves its  financial management improvement and audit readiness goals.

While such  progress was made, we continued to note that amounts reported by  federal entity trading partners were not in agreement by significant  amounts. Reasons for the differences cited by several CFOs included  differing accounting methodologies, accounting errors, and timing  differences. In addition, the auditor for DOD reported that DOD, which  contributes significantly to the unreconciled amounts, could not accurately  identify most of its intragovernmental transactions by customer, and was  unable to reconcile most intragovernmental transactions with trading  partners, which resulted in adjustments that cannot be fully supported.", "Additionally, for fiscal year 2013, there continued to be unreconciled  transactions between the General Fund of the U.S. Government (General  Fund) and federal entity trading partners related to appropriations and  other intragovernmental transactions, which amounted to hundreds of  billions of dollars. because only some of the General Fund is reported in Treasury\u2019s  department-level financial statements. For example, these financial  statements include various General Fund-related assets and liabilities  that Treasury manages on behalf of the federal government (e.g., federal  debt and cash held by Treasury), but do not include certain other  activities such as receipts and disbursements related to other federal  agencies. As a result of these circumstances, the federal government\u2019s  ability to determine the impact of these differences on the amounts  reported in the accrual-based consolidated financial statements is  significantly impaired.

Further, even with  BCA and other actions taken, the U.S. government continues to face a  significant long term structural imbalance between revenues and  spending. This imbalance, which is driven on the spending side largely by  the aging of the population and rising health care costs, will cause debt  held by the public to rise continuously in coming decades.
