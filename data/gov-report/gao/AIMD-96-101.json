Progress was made, but many of IRS\u2019 efforts were not yet completed at the conclusion of the audit. IRS has continued its efforts to correct these problems with a goal of having these matters resolved in time for the fiscal year 1996 financial statement audit. Some of the corrective actions, particularly where they involve reprogramming software for IRS\u2019 antiquated systems and developing new systems, will require longer term solutions. Therefore, the focus of key IRS efforts are on interim solutions to facilitate reliable reporting while IRS works to put longer term corrective actions in place.", "IRS advised us that, as of the end of May 1996, its status in correcting the problems our audit identified was as follows: IRS stated that it had developed software programs to capture, from its revenue financial management system, the detailed revenue and refund transactions that, in the short term, would support reported amounts in its future financial statements until longer term system fixes could be made to achieve more reliable reporting of these amounts. In addition, IRS is attempting to complete documentation of its revenue financial management system to (1) aid in identifying better interim reporting solutions for reporting revenues and refunds, (2) provide better insights on the longer term systems fixes needed to enable IRS to readily and reliably provide the underlying support for its reported revenue and refund amounts, and (3) demonstrate that the level of misstatement related to its inability to reconcile the detailed transactions it identifies in its interim reporting efforts to its summary account records would not be material. IRS asserted that it would continue its efforts to determine a means of using its current revenue financial management system\u2019s coding to identify its accounts receivable. IRS\u2019 efforts are focused on correcting known current coding errors through reviewing 100 percent of all receivables over a certain dollar threshold. In addition, through intensified training efforts and better internal control policies and procedures, it said it would seek to ensure more accurate input and processing of transactions that underpin accounts receivable. IRS stated that it had completed the reconciliation of its Fund Balance with Treasury accounts except for IRS\u2019 suspense accounts that contained reconciling items that were more than 6 months old. However, IRS said it was still in the process of making the necessary adjustments required to its general ledger and the related Department of the Treasury records to complete this effort.", "IRS stated that it believed the core issue for correcting its receipt and acceptance problems related to properly accounting for transactions with other federal agencies. IRS stated that it was performing a study of transactions with other federal agencies to determine and correct the problems in this process that are due to IRS policies and procedures and to identify those that need to be corrected governmentwide.", "We could not verify the results of IRS\u2019 efforts as of the close of our fiscal year 1995 audit since they were not yet complete. However, we will continue to monitor IRS\u2019 progress and advise IRS as it attempts to identify and implement solutions for correcting its underlying financial management problems.", "These financial management problems and certain other related matters are discussed further in the Significant Matters section of this report.

The principal purpose of our financial audits is to attest to the reliability of information presented in the financial statements and to independently verify management\u2019s assertions about the effectiveness of internal controls and whether the agency complied with laws and regulations. When information that underpins the reported financial statements is not available for audit, it sometimes results in the auditor being unable to render an opinion on the financial statements as a whole. This is because the auditor cannot evaluate sufficient evidence as a basis for forming an opinion on whether the information presented in the financial statements is correct, determining whether all significant internal controls through which the information was managed and processed were effective, and testing whether or not the agency, in this case IRS, complied with laws and regulations. This situation was the case for IRS for fiscal year 1995.", "The following discusses the five material weaknesses we found.

IRS collects tax receipts, receives tax returns, makes tax refunds to, and corresponds with hundreds of millions of taxpayers each year. IRS also tries to obtain compliance by enforcing the tax laws through its monitoring of accounts receivable. These activities involve processing and tracking billions of paper documents and, in fiscal year 1995, handling a reported $1.4 trillion in tax receipts and a reported $122 billion in tax refunds. Processing this volume of money and paperwork requires substantive coordination among IRS\u2019 more than 600 offices worldwide, approximately 12,000 financial institutions, and 12 Federal Reserve Banks throughout the country."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Revenue", "paragraphs": ["For fiscal year 1995, IRS made several attempts at extracting taxpayer information from its masterfiles\u2014the only detailed record of taxpayer information IRS maintains\u2014to support the amounts it reported for revenues in its financial statements. However, IRS has not been able to make these amounts agree to the amounts included in its financial management systems and Treasury records. Further, IRS is unable to determine that the correct amounts are transferred to the ultimate recipient of the collected taxes. For fiscal year 1995, the detailed transactions from its masterfile accounts were not provided to us in a timely manner to substantiate the reported amounts and thus we could not determine the amount of the differences.", "The core financial management control weaknesses that contribute greatly to these problems are that IRS does not have comprehensive documentation on how its financial management system works. It has not yet put into place the necessary procedures to routinely reconcile activity in its summary account records with that maintained in its detailed masterfile records of taxpayer accounts. This problem is further exacerbated by IRS\u2019 financial management system, which was not designed to support financial statement presentation, and thus significantly hinders IRS\u2019 ability to identify the ultimate recipient of collected taxes.", "This occurs because the system requires that corporate and individual taxpayers pay multiple taxes at the same time without readily identifying the application of the payments to the various taxes paid. As a result, IRS is forced to make the allocation of collections to the recipient based on the total tax owed as identified on the related tax return. The tax return is filed at a later date and may not contain sufficient information if the amount of taxes owed on the return does not agree with the amount paid, as is sometimes the case.", "IRS has developed computer programs to extract the detailed masterfile data from its records but continues to be unable to reconcile the detailed extracted data to the summary accounts. In an interim effort to prepare reliable financial statement information, IRS is attempting to demonstrate the maximum exposure likely attributable to the unexplained differences and provide the necessary information to fix the identified system flaws. This interim plan involves IRS continuing its efforts to develop detailed comprehensive documentation of its current financial management system. We are monitoring IRS\u2019 efforts closely, providing guidance and recommendations, and reporting at regular intervals to IRS\u2019 senior management on the agency\u2019s progress and actions needed to correct these problems in the short and long term.", "As reported since our audit of IRS\u2019 fiscal year 1992 financial statements, IRS cannot ensure that it distributes excise taxes based on collections, as required by law, because it bases these distributions on the amount reported on the tax return, that is, the assessed amount. However, during fiscal year 1995, IRS analyzed excise taxes by specific trust funds to determine if there were significant differences between taxes paid and amounts reported as owed on the return and found that these differences were insignificant. Because IRS completed this analysis after our audit was completed, we were unable to examine and determine the reliability of this information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Accounts Receivable", "paragraphs": ["For fiscal year 1995, IRS attempted to test a statistical sample of its inventory of open assessments to categorize them between financial accounts receivable and compliance assessments. For all the 4 fiscal years we have audited IRS\u2019 financial statements, IRS has had difficulty separating, in its masterfile records of taxpayer accounts, its financial accounts receivable, from the amounts it has assessed only for compliance purposes because the design of IRS\u2019 masterfiles commingles these amounts.", "In fiscal year 1995, IRS expanded its previous years\u2019 efforts by trying to first separate the inventory of assessments into accounts receivable and compliance assessments based on its coding of these assessments in its financial management system and then testing the accuracy of this coding to separate accounts receivable from compliance assessments on a taxpayer account basis. However, these efforts were unsuccessful because of mistakes made in performing the statistical tests and errors found in the coding of the assessments in IRS\u2019 financial management systems which made the sample results unreliable for projecting to the total inventory of outstanding assessments. Our tests of the fiscal year 1995 data found significant errors at levels that made the result of any projections from the samples taken unreliable.", "The actions needed to resolve the key financial management control weaknesses in accounts receivable are consistent with recommendations from our prior reports and are as follows: (1) better review and approval procedures are needed before assessment information is entered into IRS\u2019 masterfile system, (2) clearer lines of authority and responsibility are needed between IRS\u2019 taxpayer service and the Chief Financial Officer\u2019s operations to ensure that internal control procedures are properly identified and strictly adhered to, (3) procedures need to be developed for processing in-process accounts and properly applying them to the respective taxpayer accounts, and (4) periodic detailed taxpayer account reviews should be performed as a quality review measure to ensure that the proper coding is taking place for taxpayer accounts. In addition, IRS needs to (1) continue its efforts to review taxpayer accounts with amounts owed to ensure that they are properly coded and accounted for and (2) perform more macro analysis of its inventory of assessments to identify aberrations and other systemic problems that will need to be corrected to accurately report on accounts receivable. We will continue to monitor IRS\u2019 progress in this area and provide guidance and recommendations as it proceeds."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Administrative Operations Have Improved but More Improvement Is Needed", "paragraphs": ["For fiscal year 1995, IRS had a reported $8.1 billion in operating expenses and related assets and liabilities used and incurred in its administrative operations.

In fiscal year 1992, for the most part, we were unsuccessful in our attempts to audit IRS\u2019 records for its administrative operations. IRS\u2019 accounting records were in total disarray, and it could not substantiate large portions of the reported amounts. In addition, internal control policies and procedures were either nonexistent, inappropriately focused, or not followed. For fiscal year 1995, IRS had a core accounting system in place that tracked its financial management activity. Two critical problems, however, have continued to persist that were identified in our fiscal year 1992 audit: (1) IRS\u2019 Fund Balance with Treasury accounts remain unreconciled, though some progress has been made toward that end and (2) IRS has not been able to provide support as to whether and when certain nonpayroll goods and services paid for were received and, in instances where support existed, we found that the cost associated with the purchase was often recorded and reported in the wrong fiscal year."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Fund Balance With Treasury", "paragraphs": ["IRS\u2019 Fund Balance with Treasury accounts historically were not being reconciled. For the most part, IRS\u2019 personnel were only tracking the gross differences between their accounting records and what Treasury (the equivalent of their bank) reported to them for their administrative receipts and disbursements. This resulted in years of unreconciled amounts accumulating that were never researched and resolved and that were made difficult to research and resolve when the amounts were required to be audited.", "These accounts have been unreconciled in each of the years of our prior audits\u20141992 through 1994\u2014with net reconciling differences in the millions of dollars that were made up of gross reconciling differences in the hundreds of millions of dollars. We were not provided the information to fully determine the gross amount of the differences for fiscal year 1995 and, thus, while we do know the accounts remain unreconciled, we do not know by how much.", "Over the last 2 fiscal years, IRS has made adjustments to its accounting records to write off large portions of the gross unreconciled amounts where it could not determine what the correct disposition of the difference should be after several efforts at researching the items. In addition, it hired a contractor to identify the differences between its accounting records and what it had reported to Treasury as its activity in its Fund Balance with Treasury accounts. IRS, though, has still not fully reconciled its differences between its records and Treasury\u2019s records that are reported to IRS through its budget clearing accounts\u2014for items that are more than 6 months old that remain unreconciled\u2014and that are identified on its statement of differences\u2014for similar items that are less than 6 months old.", "Similarly, IRS still needs to investigate and resolve amounts in its suspense accounts, many of which have been in suspense for 1 year or more. In addition, IRS has not disposed of some of the reconciling items between its accounting records and what it reported to Treasury that were identified by the contractor. Through further contractor assistance or more intensified internal efforts, IRS must get these accounts fully reconciled. In addition, IRS needs to look more closely at the skill mix of its staff assigned with the responsibility of completing this reconciliation process.", "If these accounts remain unreconciled, it will continue to be difficult to provide an opinion on either IRS\u2019 administrative financial statements or management\u2019s assertion about the effectiveness of internal controls. It will also continue to be impossible to determine whether IRS has complied with all of the appropriate laws and regulations to which it is subject. Notwithstanding the problems these unreconciled accounts present for rendering an opinion, these accounts make it impossible, or at best difficult, for IRS or anyone else to know whether its operating funds have been improperly spent and calls into question the accuracy of its reported operating expenses, assets, and liabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Receipt and Acceptance", "paragraphs": ["IRS did not provide support as to whether and when it received goods and services for significant portions of its nonpayroll operating expenses and, in several instances where the support was provided, we found that the cost should have been included in another period. Simply stated, this situation is much like when IRS audits a taxpayer. If the taxpayer cannot show independent evidence that an expense that was deducted on the tax return was incurred in the year under audit, the expense would be disallowed and the taxpayer\u2019s tax liability increased. Likewise, when IRS cannot provide support for its reported expenses or the support shows that the expenses should be properly included in a different fiscal year, the auditor cannot provide an opinion on the amounts. Simply put, we cannot determine whether this expense was an expense of the current period\u2014when no support exists\u2014or whether it must be adjusted from the current year\u2019s expenses\u2014when the support shows it is in the wrong period.

IRS\u2019 lack of control over receipt and acceptance of goods and services, combined with its problems in linking the controls over goods and services purchased to the payment for these goods and services, makes it especially vulnerable to vendors, both federal and commercial, billing IRS for goods and services not provided or for amounts in excess of what was provided. This would be comparable to an individual or business receiving an invoice and paying it without verifying that the purchased item had been received and accepted, based on an assumption that someone else in the household or business received it. For example, IRS has an inventory management system that tracks when printed tax forms are received and used. However, the information tracked in this system is not used or integrated with the payment system for making vendor payments nor with any other system used to account for and report IRS\u2019 operating expense for printing these forms."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Computer Security", "paragraphs": ["In our prior year reports, we stated that IRS\u2019 computer security environment was inadequate.
