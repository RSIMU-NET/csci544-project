The administration's budget request of $1.40 billion is primarily allocated to New Starts projects with existing and pending full funding grant agreements. SAFETEA-LU made several changes to the New Starts evaluation and rating process, which FTA is implementing. Since the fiscal year 2001 evaluation and rating cycle, the New Starts pipeline--that is, projects in the preliminary engineering and final design phases--has changed in size and composition, responding to a variety of factors. The number of projects in the New Starts pipeline has decreased by more than one-half, and the types of projects in the pipeline have changed, with bus rapid transit replacing commuter or light rail as the most common type of project. FTA officials attributed the decrease in the number of projects to FTA's increased scrutiny of applications to help ensure that only the strongest projects enter the pipeline, and to FTA's efforts to remove projects from the pipeline that were not advancing or did not adequately address identified problems. Project sponsors that GAO interviewed cited other reasons for the pipeline's decrease, including the complexity, lengthiness, and cost of the New Starts process. The lengthy nature of the New Starts process is due, in part, to the rigorous and systematic evaluation and rating process established by law--which GAO has previously noted could serve as a model for other programs. Other reasons cited by project sponsors for the decrease in the pipeline include finding alternative sources of funding or opting not to apply because they realize their projects are unlikely to receive funding. FTA is considering different ideas on how to improve the New Starts process, some of which may address the concerns identified by project sponsors. Despite these concerns, GAO's survey of project sponsors indicated future demand for New Starts funding. Project sponsors reported having 141 planned New Starts, Small Starts, and Very Small Starts projects and will likely seek New Starts funding for almost three-fourths of these projects. Of these planned projects, project sponsors indicated that they intend to seek New Starts funding for 57 New Starts projects, 30 Small Starts projects, and 14 Very Small Starts projects. Project sponsors GAO surveyed also reported considering a range of alternative project types in their planning. Although project sponsors expressed appreciation for the creation of the Small Starts program, noting it filled a funding gap, they said the Small Starts application process is not tailored to the Small Starts program and is time-consuming, costly, and duplicative. GAO also found that the application is not always tailored for Small Starts applicants and, in several instances, requests duplicative information. FTA officials acknowledged that the Small Starts application process could be further streamlined, and they are working to decrease the burden."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the early 1970s, a significant portion of the federal government\u2019s  share of new capital investment in mass transportation has come through  the Federal Transit Administration\u2019s (FTA) New Starts program.

Small Starts  projects are defined as those with a need for less than $75 million in  funding from this program and a total capital cost of less than $250  million. FTA subsequently introduced a new eligibility category within the  Small Starts program called Very Small Starts, which is for projects with a  total capital cost of less than $50 million. Very Small Starts projects will  qualify for an even simpler and more expedited evaluation and rating  process than other Small Starts projects.

SAFETEA-LU also made changes to the New Starts program,  including changes to its evaluation and rating process. FTA already has  implemented some of these changes and has undertaken efforts to address  the remaining changes.", "FTA generally funds New Starts projects through FFGAs, which establish  the terms and conditions for federal participation in a New Starts project.  FFGAs also define a project\u2019s scope, including the length of the system  and the number of stations; its schedule, including the date when the  system is expected to open for service; and its cost. For a project to obtain  an FFGA, it must progress through a local or regional review of  alternatives and meet a number of federal requirements, including  requirements for information used in the New Starts evaluation and rating  process (see fig. 1). As required by federal statute, New Starts projects  must emerge from a regional, multimodal transportation planning process.  The first two phases of the New Starts process\u2014systems planning and  alternatives analysis\u2014address this requirement. The systems planning  phase identifies the transportation needs of a region, while the alternatives  analysis phase provides information on the benefits, costs, and impacts of  different options, such as rail lines or bus routes, in a specific corridor  versus in a region. The alternatives analysis phase results in the selection  of a locally preferred alternative, which is intended to be the New Starts  project that FTA evaluates for funding, as required by statute. After a  locally preferred alternative is selected, the project sponsor submits an  application to FTA for the project to enter the preliminary engineering  phase. When this phase is completed and federal environmental  requirements are satisfied, FTA may approve the project\u2019s advancement  into final design, after which FTA may approve the project for an FFGA  and proceed to construction, as provided for in statute. FTA oversees  grantees\u2019 management of projects from the preliminary engineering phase  through the construction phase and evaluates the projects for  advancement into each phase of the process. FTA also evaluates the  projects annually for the New Starts report to Congress.", "To help inform administration and congressional decisions about which  projects should receive federal funds, FTA assigns ratings on the basis of  various statutorily defined evaluation criteria\u2014including both local  financial commitment and project justification criteria\u2014and then assigns  an overall rating (see fig. 2). These evaluation criteria reflect a broad  range of benefits and effects of the proposed project, such as cost- effectiveness, as well as the ability of the project sponsor to fund the  project and finance the continued operation of its transit system. FTA  assigns the proposed project a rating for each criterion and then assigns a  summary rating for local financial commitment and project justification.  Lastly, FTA develops an overall project rating. Projects are rated at several  points during the New Starts process\u2014as part of the evaluation for entry  into the preliminary engineering and the final design phases, and yearly for  inclusion in the New Starts annual report to Congress.", "As required by statute, the administration uses the FTA evaluation and  rating process, along with the phase of development of New Starts  projects, to decide which projects to recommend to Congress for  funding. Although many projects receive a summary rating that would  make them eligible for an FFGA, only a few are proposed for an FFGA in a  given fiscal year. FTA proposes a project for an FFGA when it believes  that the project will be able to meet the following conditions during the  fiscal year for which funding is proposed:    All nonfederal project funding must be committed and available for the  project.", "The project must be in the final design phase and have progressed far  enough for uncertainties about costs, benefits, and impacts (i.e.,  environmental or financial) to be minimized.", "The project must meet FTA\u2019s tests for readiness and technical capacity,  which confirm that there are no remaining cost, project scope, or local  financial commitment issues.", "SAFETEA-LU introduced a number of changes to the New Starts program,  including some that affect the evaluation and rating process that we have  previously described in figure 1. For example, SAFETEA-LU added  economic development to the list of evaluation criteria that FTA must use  in evaluating and rating New Starts projects and required FTA to issue  notice and guidance each time significant changes are made to the  program. SAFETEA-LU also established the Small Starts program, a new  capital investment grant program, simplifying the requirements imposed  for those seeking funding for lower-cost projects, such as bus rapid transit,  streetcar, and commuter rail projects. This program is intended to advance  smaller-scale projects through an expedited and streamlined evaluation  and rating process. Small Starts projects require less than $75 million in  federal funding and have a total cost of less than $250 million. According  to FTA\u2019s guidance, Small Starts projects must also (1) meet the definition  of a fixed guideway for at least 50 percent of the project length in the peak  period or (2) be a corridor-based bus project with the following minimum  elements:  traffic signal priority/preemption, to the extent, if any, that there are traffic  signals on the corridor; low-floor vehicles or level boarding;   branding of the proposed service; and    10-minute peak/15-minute off-peak running times (i.e., headways) or better  while operating at least 14 hours per weekday.", "FTA has also subsequently introduced a separate eligibility category  within the Small Starts program for \u201cVery Small Starts\u201d projects. Small  Starts projects that qualify as Very Small Starts are simple, low-cost  projects that FTA has determined qualify for a simplified evaluation and  rating process. These projects must meet the same eligibility requirements  as Small Starts projects and be located in corridors with more than 3,000  existing riders per average weekday who will benefit from the proposed  project.

Specifically, FTA currently assigns a weight of 50  percent each to cost-effectiveness and land use to calculate a project\u2019s  overall rating. The other four statutorily defined criteria, including  economic development, mobility improvements, operating efficiencies,  and environmental benefits, are not weighted. As described in table 3, to  reflect SAFETEA-LU\u2019s increased emphasis on economic development,  FTA has encouraged project sponsors to submit information that they  believe demonstrates the impact of their proposed transit investments on  economic development. According to FTA, this information is considered  as an \u201cother factor\u201d in the evaluation process, but is not weighted.  However, FTA officials told us that few project sponsors submit  information on their projects\u2019 economic development benefits for  consideration as an \u201cother factor.\u201d We previously reported that FTA\u2019s  reliance on two evaluation criteria to calculate a project\u2019s overall rating is  drifting away from the multiple-measure evaluation and rating process  outlined in statute and current New Starts regulations. Thus, we  recommended that FTA (1) improve the measures used to evaluate New  Starts projects so that all of the statutorily defined criteria can be used in  determining a project\u2019s overall rating or (2) provide a crosswalk in the  regulations showing clear linkages between the criteria outlined in the  statute and the criteria and measures used in the evaluation and rating  process in the upcoming rulemaking process.", "Many of the project sponsors and all of the industry groups we  interviewed also stated that they believe certain types of projects are  penalized in the evaluation and rating process because of the weights  assigned to the different evaluation criteria. Specifically, the project  sponsors and industry groups said that by not weighting economic  development, the evaluation and rating process does not consider an  important benefit of some transit projects. They also expressed concern  that the measure FTA uses to determine cost-effectiveness does not  adequately capture the benefits of certain types of fixed-guideway  projects\u2014such as streetcars\u2014that have shorter systems and provide  enhanced access to a dense urban core, rather than transport commuters  from longer distances (e.g., light or heavy rail). Project sponsors and an  industry group we interviewed further noted that FTA\u2019s cost-effectiveness  measure has influenced some project sponsors to change their project  designs from more traditional fixed-guideway systems (e.g., light rail or  streetcars) to bus rapid transit, expressly to receive a more favorable cost- effectiveness rating from FTA.", "According to FTA officials, they understand the importance of economic  development to the transit community and the concerns raised by project  sponsors, and said they are currently working to develop an appropriate  economic development measure. FTA is currently soliciting input from  industry groups on how to measure economic development, studying  possible options, and planning to describe how it will incorporate  economic development into the project justification criteria in its  upcoming rulemaking. FTA officials also stated that incorporating  economic development into the evaluation process before issuing a  regulation could potentially create significant uncertainty about the  evaluation and rating process for project sponsors. Furthermore, they  agreed with our previous recommendation that this issue should be  addressed as part of their upcoming rulemaking, which they expect to be  completed in April 2008. As part of its upcoming rulemaking, FTA will also  conduct several outreach efforts with project sponsors and industry  groups.", "FTA officials noted that they have had difficulty developing an economic  development measure that both accurately measures benefits and  distinguishes competing projects. For example, FTA officials said that  separating economic development benefits from land-use benefits\u2014 another New Starts evaluation criterion\u2014is difficult. In addition, these  officials noted that many economic development benefits result from  direct benefits (e.g., travel time savings). Therefore, including economic  development benefits in the evaluation could lead to double-counting the  benefits FTA already measures and uses to evaluate projects.  Furthermore, FTA officials noted that some economic development  impacts may represent transfers between regions, rather than a net benefit  for the nation, thereby raising questions about the usefulness of these  benefits for a national comparison of projects. We have also reported on  many of the same challenges of measuring and forecasting indirect  benefits, such as economic development and land-use impacts. For  example, we noted that certain benefits are often double-counted when  transportation projects are evaluated. We also noted that indirect benefits,  such as economic development, may be more correctly considered  transfers of direct user benefits or of economic activity from one area to  another. Therefore, estimating and adding such indirect benefits to direct  benefits could constitute double-counting and lead to overestimating a  project\u2019s benefits.

During fiscal years 2001 through 2007, light rail and commuter rail were  the more prevalent modes for projects in the pipeline. In fiscal year 2008,  bus rapid transit became the most common transit mode for projects in  the New Starts pipeline (see fig. 5). The increase in bus rapid transit  projects is likely due to a number of factors, including foreign countries\u2019  positive experiences with this type of transit system. To be eligible, a  corridor-based bus project must (1) operate in a separate right-of-way  dedicated for public transit use for a substantial portion of the project or  (2) represent a substantial investment in a defined corridor. Furthermore,  medium and smaller project sponsors may be expressing more interest in  the New Starts program, including Small Starts, because bus rapid transit  may serve as a more affordable and cost-effective alternative to other  fixed-guideway options.", "Although bus rapid transit projects are now more common than commuter  or light rail projects, they represent a small amount of the total cost for all  projects in the pipeline. We found that bus rapid transit accounts for about  12 percent of the total cost of all projects in the New Starts pipeline, while  commuter rail (36 percent), heavy rail (30 percent), and light rail (22  percent) account for greater shares\u2014which is not surprising, given that  bus rapid transit projects are often less expensive than rail projects.  However, although bus rapid transit projects account for a smaller share  of the total costs, we found that project sponsors seek higher funding  shares for these projects. In fiscal year 2008, project sponsors sought, on  average, New Starts funding to cover about 58 percent of the total cost of  bus rapid transit projects, whereas they sought about 49 percent for  commuter rail projects, about 50 percent for light rail projects, and about  38 percent for heavy rail projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FTA and Project Sponsors Attributed the Decrease in the New Starts Pipeline to Different Factors", "paragraphs": ["FTA and project sponsors identified different factors for the decrease in  the New Starts pipeline. FTA officials cited their increased scrutiny of  applications to help ensure that only the strongest projects enter the  pipeline, and said they had taken steps to remove projects from the  pipeline that were inactive, not advancing, or did not adequately address  identified problems. According to FTA officials, these projects consume  FTA oversight resources and congressional funding without demonstrating  evidence of progress. FTA officials said they believed projects had been  progressing slowly through the pipeline in recent years and, therefore,  needed encouragement to move forward or be removed from the pipeline.  Along these lines, since fiscal year 2004, FTA has issued warnings to  project sponsors that alert them to specific project deficiencies that must  be corrected by a specified date for the project to advance through the  pipeline. If the deficiency is not corrected, FTA removes the project from  the pipeline. To date, FTA has issued warnings for 13 projects. Three  projects have only recently received a warning and their status is to be  determined; 3 projects have adequately addressed the deficiency identified  by FTA; 1 project was removed by FTA for failing to address the identified  deficiency; and 6 projects were withdrawn from the pipeline by the project  sponsors. FTA officials told us that project sponsors are generally aware  of FTA\u2019s efforts to better manage projects in the pipeline.", "Although FTA has taken steps to remove inactive or stalled projects from  the pipeline, FTA officials noted that most projects have been withdrawn  by their project sponsors, not FTA. According to FTA data, 23 projects  were withdrawn from the New Starts pipeline between calendar years  2001 and 2007. Of these, 16 projects were withdrawn from the pipeline at  the request of project sponsors; 6 were removed from the pipeline in  response to efforts initiated by FTA; and 1 was removed from the pipeline  at congressional direction. Of the 16 projects that were withdrawn by  project sponsors, the most common reasons were that the project was  either reconfigured (the project scope or design was significantly  changed) or reconsidered, or that the local financial commitment was not  demonstrated. Similarly, FTA initiated the removal of 4 of 6 projects for  lack of local financial commitments, often demonstrated by a failed  referendum at the local level. Of the 23 projects withdrawn from the New  Starts pipeline, 3 were expected to reenter the pipeline at a later date.", "The project sponsors we interviewed provided other reasons for the  decrease in the number of projects in the New Starts pipeline. The most  common reasons cited by project sponsors were that the New Starts  process is too complex, costly, and time-consuming:    Complexity and cost of the New Starts process: The majority of project  sponsors we interviewed told us that the complexity of the requirements\u2014 including those for financial commitment projections and travel forecasts,  which require extensive analysis and economic modeling\u2014creates  disincentives to entering the New Starts pipeline. Sponsors also told us  that the expense involved in fulfilling the application requirements,  including the costs of hiring additional staff and private grant consultants,  discourages some project sponsors with fewer resources from applying for  New Starts funding. Furthermore, concerns about the cost of applying to  the New Starts program come at a time when project sponsors expect to  receive less funding for their projects from the program. Specifically, for  recently completed transit projects that received an FFGA, the project  sponsors we surveyed reported that, on average, the federal government  funded approximately 60 percent of the total project costs via the New  Starts program. For ongoing projects, sponsors reported that they expect  to receive an average of about 50 percent of the total project costs from  the New Starts program.", "Time required to complete the New Starts process: More than one-half of  the project sponsors we interviewed said that the application process is  time-consuming or leads to project delays, although sponsors could not  provide specifics on how long various components of the process  contributed to a specific delay. One project sponsor told us that  constructing a project with New Starts funding (as opposed to without  such funding) delays the timeline for the project by as much as several  years, which in turn leads to increased project costs since inflation and  expenses from labor and materials increase with the delay. The lengthy  nature of the New Starts process is due, at least in part, to the rigorous and  systematic evaluation and rating process established by law\u2014which, as we  have previously noted, could serve as a model for other transportation  programs. In addition, FTA officials noted that most project delays are  caused by the project sponsor, not FTA. These delays are attributable to  the sponsor\u2019s inability to obtain local funding commitments, local  decisions to significantly modify the project\u2019s scope or alignment, or  unanticipated environmental impacts.", "Other reasons for the decrease in the pipeline that were cited by the  project sponsors we interviewed include that the project sponsors are  finding alternative sources of funding, such as other federal funds or state,  local, or private funding. One project sponsor remarked that sponsors try  to avoid the New Starts process by obtaining a congressional designation,  so that they can skip the New Starts application process and construct  their project more quickly. In addition, three other project sponsors said  that since the New Starts process is well-established and outcomes are  predictable, potential project sponsors do not even apply to enter the  pipeline because they realize their projects will not fare well against the  New Starts criteria and, thus, are unlikely to receive New Starts funding.", "Our survey found similar reasons that project sponsors provided for the  decline in the New Starts pipeline. Among the project sponsors we  surveyed with completed transit projects, the most common reasons given  for not applying to the New Starts program were that the process is  lengthy or that the sponsor wanted to move the project along faster than  could be done in the New Starts process. About two-thirds of these project  sponsors reported that their most recent project was eligible for New  Starts funding, yet more than one-fourth of them did not apply to the  program. Instead, these project sponsors reported using other federal  funding and state, local, and private funding\u2014with other federal and local  funding the most commonly used and private funding the least commonly  used\u2014to fund their most recently completed project. In addition, we  found that almost two-thirds of the large project sponsors we surveyed  applied to the New Starts program for their most recently completed  project, while only about one-third of medium and smaller project  sponsors applied. Other reasons these project sponsors cited for not  applying to the program include sufficient funding from other sources to  complete the project, concern about jeopardizing other projects in the  pipeline, time and resources needed to complete application each year are  too great, and difficulty in understanding and completing the process and  in understanding the program\u2019s eligibility requirements.", "FTA is considering and implementing different means of improving the  New Starts process\u2014many of which would address the concerns  identified by project sponsors. For example, FTA has recognized that the  process can be lengthy, and in 2006 FTA commissioned a study to  examine, among other issues, opportunities for accelerating and  simplifying its implementation of the New Starts program. According to  FTA officials, one of the study\u2019s recommendations was to use project  development agreements to solidify New Starts project schedules and  improve FTA\u2019s timeline for reviews. FTA officials told us that they are  pursuing this recommendation, and have already implemented project  schedules for three New Starts projects in the pipeline. Other key  recommendations for FTA contained in the study include developing a  simple \u201croad map\u201d that concisely identifies requirements for navigating  through preliminary engineering and final design, more clearly defining  entry criteria for each phase of the process, simplifying the travel  forecasting modeling, and clarifying and consistently implementing the  New Starts technical guidance and policies. The FTA Administrator has  publicly stated that FTA will continue to look for ways to further improve  the program.", "In June 2007, FTA issued in the Federal Register a number of changes to  the New Starts and Small Starts processes, including streamlining through  the elimination of a number of reporting requirements. For example, FTA  will no longer require project sponsors to submit information on operating  efficiencies and environmental benefits, nor will they be required to  submit information for evaluation for FTA\u2019s annual report if their project  is not likely to be ready for a funding recommendation. In addition, the  resubmission of information on land-use patterns for the annual report  will now be optional for project sponsors. Other changes to the processes  include expanding the evaluation criteria to a five-tiered rating scale, and  considering a project\u2019s innovative contractual agreements in the  evaluation and rating of the operating finance plan for projects. The  guidance also states that under the evaluation of \u201cother factors,\u201d if a  project is a principal element of a congestion management strategy, this  could increase a project\u2019s overall rating. Projects could also increase their  overall rating by reporting economic development; therefore, FTA  encourages project sponsors to submit such information."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Future Demand for New Starts Program Expected; Project Sponsors Seek Small Starts Program Improvements", "paragraphs": ["Our survey and interviews of project sponsors indicated that there will  likely be a future demand for New Starts funding.

According to  the project sponsors, they will likely seek New Starts funding for almost  three-fourths (72 percent, or 101) of these 141 planned New Starts, Small  Starts, and Very Small Starts projects. More specifically, they will likely  seek New Starts funding for 57 of the planned New Starts projects, 30 of  the planned Small Starts projects, and 14 of the planned Very Small Starts  projects (see fig. 6). Although the project sponsors we surveyed indicated  that they were considering a range of alternative project types in their  planning, the most commonly cited alternatives were bus rapid transit and  light rail.", "All of the Small Starts and Very Small Starts project sponsors we  interviewed viewed the new Small Starts program favorably. These project  sponsors told us that they appreciated the emphasis FTA has placed on  smaller transit projects through its new programs and the steps FTA has  taken to streamline the application process for the programs. The project  sponsors also told us that the Small Starts program, including the Very  Small Starts eligibility category, address a critical and unmet funding need,  and that they believe their projects will be more competitive under these  programs because they are vying for funding with projects and agencies of  similar size. FTA officials told us that they have been responsive in  providing assistance on the program when contacted.", "Our survey results also indicated that, through its Small Starts program,  FTA is attracting more project sponsors than before, including those that  have not previously applied for the New Starts program and also those  that would not otherwise be applying for New Starts funds. For example,  of the 30 project sponsors that intend to seek New Starts funding for their  planned Small Starts and Very Small Starts projects, 13 have not  previously applied for New Starts funding. Project sponsors also  indicated that the Small Starts program, including the eligibility category  for Very Small Starts projects, has influenced how they plan for their  ongoing projects, which are projects that have completed the alternatives  analysis phase and have moved forward into the later stages of  development, such as preliminary engineering or final design. Of the  ongoing Small Starts and Very Small Starts projects for which respondents  indicated they would be requesting New Starts funding, project sponsors  definitively reported that they would have sought New Starts funding for  only about one-quarter of those ongoing projects if the Small Starts  program, including the eligibility category for Very Small Starts projects,  had not been established."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Project Sponsors Would Like FTA to Further Streamline the Small Starts Program", "paragraphs": ["In implementing the Small Starts program, FTA has taken steps to  streamline the application and evaluation and rating processes for smaller- scale transit projects, as envisioned by SAFETEA-LU. According to our  analysis of the numbers and types of requirements for the New Starts and  Small Starts application processes, the Small Starts process has fewer  requirements. For example, in the categories of travel forecasting, project  justification, and local financial commitment, the number of requirements  was reduced. FTA also established a simplified financial evaluation  process for Small Starts, which reduced the reporting burden for qualified  projects. In addition, FTA allows simplified methods for travel forecasts  that predict transportation benefits, and it reduced the number of  requirements for the Small Starts application process. For example, the  Small Starts application process is about one-quarter fewer requirements  than those for the New Starts program. FTA also established the Very  Small Starts process, which has even fewer application requirements than  the Small Starts program. This process expedites the reporting, evaluation,  and advancement of simple and inexpensive projects. FTA\u2019s steps have  greatly reduced the amount of information to be submitted for each of the  specific requirements (see table 6).", "Despite these efforts, many of the project sponsors we interviewed find  the Small Starts application process time-consuming and too costly to  complete, and would like to see FTA further streamline the process.  Frequently, project sponsors said that the current Small Starts application  process takes as long and costs as much to complete as the New Starts  application process, even though the planned projects cost less. For  example, a project sponsor that applied to the Small Starts program told  us that FTA asks applicants to submit templates used in the New Starts  application process that call for information not relevant for a Small Starts  project, such as travel forecasts beyond the opening year, which are not  required for the Small Starts program. The project sponsor suggested that  FTA develop a separate set of templates for the Small Starts program that  would ask only for Small Starts-related information. FTA officials told us  that in these cases, they would not expect project sponsors to provide the  additional information that is not required. Another project sponsor we  interviewed told us that although FTA tried to streamline the process by  requiring ridership projections only for the opening year of Small Starts  projects, the environmental impact statement still mandates the  development of multiyear ridership projections. Such extensive ridership  projections take a considerable amount of work, staff time, and funding to  produce. FTA officials explained to us that the level of ridership  projections required is dependent on the nature of the project. Several  other project sponsors that applied to the Small Starts program, including  sponsors that used the Very Small Starts process, expressed additional  concerns about having to provide duplicate information, such as project  finance and capital cost data that can be found in other required  worksheets. FTA officials do not believe that such duplicate information is  burdensome for project sponsors to submit. Nonetheless, smaller-sized  entities that lack New Starts experience, in-house expertise, and resources  may find the process burdensome.", "In reviewing the Small Starts application process requirements, we also  found that the application is not always tailored for Small Starts applicants  and, in several instances, requests duplicate information. FTA officials  acknowledged that the Small Starts application process could be further  streamlined and said that they are working to decrease the burden by, for  example, reducing land-use reporting requirements, simplifying the rating  process, and developing specific Small Starts templates. However, FTA  officials noted that some requirements are statutorily defined or reflect  industry-established planning principles. For example, federal statute  requires that projects, even Small Starts projects, emerge from an  alternatives analysis that considers various options to address the  transportation problem at hand. Therefore, only certain aspects of the  process can be streamlined."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Project Sponsors Seek Additional Application Assistance and Consistent Information from FTA on Small Starts", "paragraphs": ["The project sponsors we interviewed, especially those that have never  applied for New Starts funding, would like more assistance from FTA in  completing the application process because some find the interim  guidance difficult to understand. Before the Small Starts and Very Small  Starts application deadline, FTA provided initial outreach to applicants.  Despite this outreach, 8 of the 12 applications were incomplete or sought  funding for ineligible projects. In some cases, the project sponsors that  submitted these applications had no past experience with the New Starts  process, limiting their familiarity with the information required for the  application. To help address this issue, FTA officials told us that, in one  instance, they provided a Very Small Starts project sponsor with a copy of  a submitted application from another project sponsor (with New Starts  program experience) to use as a guide. The Very Small Starts project  sponsor found the application to be helpful in preparing its own  application. FTA officials told us that they plan to host an informal  meeting of potential Small Starts project sponsors later this calendar year.  In addition, some project sponsors did not understand what constitutes an  eligible project. For example, one project sponsor we interviewed  submitted an application for the construction of a new station. However,  FTA officials told us that the construction of a station did not meet the  definition of a corridor-based project, as required. Another project sponsor  we interviewed told us that it believed FTA deemed its two Small Starts  and Very Small Starts projects ineligible because service was already being  provided on the proposed route (and, therefore, the proposed service  would not be new). In response, FTA officials told us that these projects  were in fact ineligible because they already had incremental  developments, including some of the elements FTA requires for Small  Starts and Very Small Starts projects, such as traffic signal priority or  preemption and branding of the proposed service. Yet, these project  sponsors were unaware that the incorporation of some of these elements  into their existing service rendered their project ineligible. We found that  although FTA\u2019s Small Starts guidance outlines the elements required for a  project to receive funding, it does not explicitly state that projects that  have already begun to incrementally incorporate these elements are  ineligible. When we discussed this concern with FTA officials, they told us  that they might consider asking project sponsors to demonstrate the cost- effectiveness of the preexisting elements to allow for such projects to be  eligible for Small Starts funding.", "The project sponsors we interviewed said they need more consistent,  reliable information from FTA. We found that on several occasions, FTA  headquarters and regional offices provided project sponsors with  inconsistent information, which contributed to the sponsors\u2019 submitting  applications for ineligible projects and submitting incomplete applications.  For example, two project sponsors said they thought their projects were  eligible after talking with FTA regional officials. However, after submitting  their applications, these project sponsors learned from FTA headquarters  officials that their projects were ineligible. Furthermore, one project  sponsor stated that officials from a regional FTA office said there was no  need to submit a separate application for the Small Starts program, since  the sponsor had previously applied to the New Starts program. Rather,  FTA regional officials said the project sponsor needed to submit only a  few additional pieces of information. However, after the project sponsor  sent this information, along with a letter to FTA requesting that the  application be transferred from the New Starts program to the Small Starts  program, FTA headquarters officials responded that the application was  incomplete. The study of the New Starts process that FTA recently  commissioned found similar inconsistencies in the information provided  by officials in its regional offices and headquarters. Therefore, the study  recommended that FTA develop internal standard operating procedures  for New Starts staff that formalize the duties and responsibilities for each  position. In addition, the study recommended implementing Web-based  technology to standardize the communication and enforcement of policies  across the program, and having FTA establish a formal policy for  responding to every project sponsor\u2019s correspondence with a formal  response or written notification. FTA officials told us that they understand  the need to ensure consistent information, and that they are already  working on developing standard operating procedures for New Starts  staff, as recommended in the study."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The recent decrease in the New Starts pipeline does not appear to be a  reflection of diminishing interest in the program. In fact, our survey  showed that there will likely be substantial demand for New Starts funding  in the future if most potential project sponsors follow through on their  plans for new transit projects. Rather, the decrease is likely due to a  combination of factors, including FTA\u2019s increased scrutiny of projects,  project sponsors\u2019 perceptions of the process as lengthy and too complex,  and project sponsors\u2019 uncertainty given the recent changes made to the  New Starts program. As FTA moves forward with the rulemaking process  for New Starts and Small Starts, it will have to balance both the need to  make the programs accessible to a range of project sponsors\u2014both large  and small agencies\u2014and the need to maintain the rigor of the evaluation  and rating process.", "Although project sponsors expressed substantial interest in both the New  Starts and the Small Starts programs, they also identified a number of  ways to improve the programs. In particular, project sponsors raised  specific concerns about the Small Starts program. Because the Small  Starts program is in its first few years of implementation, it is not  surprising that it may experience growing pains. Some of the project  sponsors may find their concerns about the program addressed as they  become more familiar and comfortable with it and as a number of  implementation details are finalized through the upcoming rulemaking  process. However, we believe that the relatively low number of Small  Starts applications received to date and the number of project sponsors  submitting ineligible applications due to unclear guidance suggest that  additional FTA action is warranted, including further streamlining the  Small Starts program, providing additional information about the program  through training and a working group, and clarifying eligibility guidance.  Although FTA has taken some steps to further streamline the Small Starts  program, continued refinement is needed to ensure a simplified and  expedited evaluation process.

We  refined each of the questions as appropriate in response to the feedback  we received.", "To conduct the questionnaire, we posted self-administered electronic  questionnaires to the World Wide Web and sent e-mail notifications to  project sponsor contacts provided to us by FTA in early February 2007. We  found after our first e-mail that some addresses were no longer valid, so  we contacted each agency by telephone to find the appropriate contact to  send the e-mail notification. We also responded to inquiries from project  sponsors. Many project sponsor contacts believed they were not the right  person to answer the questions. In these instances, we resent the e-mail  notification to the correct contact at the project sponsor. Our goal was to  find the staff member at each project sponsor who was the most  knowledgeable about the New Starts program and the Small Starts  program.", "After determining the correct contact, we e-mailed each potential  respondent a unique username and password to ensure that the project  sponsor would have access to the questionnaire. We asked the project  sponsor contact to complete the questionnaire within 2 weeks. To  encourage respondents to complete the questionnaire, we sent an e-mail  message to prompt each nonrespondent every 2 weeks after the initial   e-mail message for approximately 6 weeks. After 6 weeks, we called all  nonrespondents at least once to encourage their participation in the  questionnaire and to increase our response rate. We closed the  questionnaire on May 11, 2007.
