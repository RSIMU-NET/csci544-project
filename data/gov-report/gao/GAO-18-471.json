This compares to 37.5 percent of calls answered with an average wait time of about 23 minutes during the 2015 filing season. Taxpayer use of online services also increased, including irs.gov and its online account tool for taxpayers to view their balances due. However, answering taxpayer correspondence remains a challenge\u2014IRS was late responding to about 37 percent of correspondence as of the end of the 2018 filing season compared to about 26 percent at the same time in 2017. In 2015, GAO recommended that the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) include timeliness in handling taxpayer correspondence as part of its performance goals, but as of June 2018 Treasury had not done so. Overall, despite multiple challenges including mid-filing season changes to tax law and a computer system failure, IRS met its processing targets for individual tax returns.", "In 2018, IRS began taking steps to implement significant tax law changes from Public Law 115-97\u2014commonly referred to by the President and many administrative documents as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. To implement the changes, IRS established a centralized office to coordinate implementation across IRS offices and divisions. IRS officials cited the broad scope and complexity of the changes\u2014which will require extensive changes to tax forms, publications, and computer systems\u2014along with the 1 year time frame as key implementation challenges. Although IRS has taken steps to address these challenges, such as developing a project planning tool, GAO found that the new coordination office did not initially fully include the Human Capital Office (HCO), the division responsible for managing the agency's workforce. Based on GAO's discussions with IRS officials, representatives from HCO now attend weekly coordination meetings discussing and planning the tax law changes. Involving HCO in these discussions will better position IRS to hire new employees and train them and the existing workforce. It will also help HCO better understand training requirements and staffing needs ahead of the 2019 filing season."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Because HCO is now attending the weekly meetings, GAO is not making a related recommendation. In addition, GAO believes that its 2015 recommendation to Treasury to include timeliness in handling correspondence as part of its performance goals, which Treasury neither agreed or disagreed with, is still valid. IRS generally concurred with GAO's findings but noted concerns with interpreting the percentage of correspondence considered \u201coverage\u201d (more than 45 days old).

IRS assistors respond to taxpayer inquiries on a variety of tax law and  procedural questions and handle complex account adjustments, such as  amended returns and duplicate filings. IRS tries to respond to paper  correspondence within 45 days of receipt; otherwise, such  correspondence is considered overage. In fiscal year 2017, about 35  percent of the nearly 17.5 million pieces of correspondence IRS received  was overage, down from approximately 47 percent of 20.8 million pieces  of correspondence in fiscal year 2013. Minimizing overage  correspondence is important because delayed responses may prompt  taxpayers to write again, call, or visit IRS Taxpayer Assistance Centers  (TAC); each of which lead to additional costs. Additionally, IRS is required  to pay interest on refunds owed to taxpayers if it did not process  amended returns within 45 days.", "Online services.

On September 29, 2017, Congress passed a law which  provided tax relief related to retirement plan distributions and casualty  losses for people affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. The  law allowed storm victims to deduct disaster losses on their 2017 returns  or on amended 2016 returns. On February 9, 2018, Congress extended  these benefits to certain taxpayers affected by wildfires in California.  The President also issued major disaster declarations for many areas  affected by the hurricanes and wildfires, allowing IRS to use its authority  to postpone certain tax-related deadlines under the Robert T. Stafford  Disaster Relief and Emergency Act. The laws also offered other forms  of tax-relief\u2014such as hardship distributions from employer-sponsored  retirement plans. To address issues resulting from disaster-related legal  changes, IRS  issued press releases and public notices informing taxpayers of tax- relief options; postponed various filing and payment deadlines for individuals and  businesses affected by disasters; ensured that sites offering in-person taxpayer assistance in Puerto  Rico, Florida, and Texas were open and developed special products  to support these sites in dealing with affected taxpayers; and adapted procedures to accommodate disaster-relief efforts.", "IRS officials also said they corresponded with taxpayers they thought  were eligible for new disaster relief benefits as a result of legal changes  put in place. The officials told us that as of May 26, 2018, the agency had  assisted 37,000 taxpayers seeking live telephone assistance and worked  or closed 6,196 amended returns and 8,847 correspondences related to  Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.", "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. While many of the provisions included in the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will not affect filing until the 2019 filing season, a  few changes affected filing in 2018. For example, the threshold to claim  the medical expense deduction was temporarily lowered, allowing  individuals to claim deductions for medical expenses totaling more than  7.5 percent of their adjusted gross income for tax years 2016 and 2017.  Also, provisions similar to those described above were implemented for  certain qualified federally declared disasters that occurred in 2016. The  law passed shortly before the start of the filing season and IRS had to  recall, revise, and re-issue more than 100 products that had already been  published.", "In addition, several provisions affecting business filers presented  processing challenges during the 2018 filing season. For example, IRS  made changes to its forms to address fiscal year filers whose earnings  will be taxed at different rates for 2017 and 2018 (referred to as blended  rate) and developed forms and instructions for filers whose returns  involve the foreign earnings of foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies.  Officials told us they processed returns subject to the blended rate  provision manually and held returns affected by the foreign earnings  provision until they completed necessary programming changes for the  systems to process them in accordance with the new law. As of May 18,  2018, the agency was holding 2,265 affected individual and business  returns. IRS officials said they completed the programming required to  process all of these returns automatically by July 2, 2018.

On February 9, 2018, after some  taxpayers had already filed their 2017 taxes, Congress extended to 2017  a number of temporary tax provisions that expired at the end of 2016.  These provisions include deductions for qualified tuition and related  expenses and the ability to deduct premiums for mortgage insurance as  interest. Testifying before Congress, the Acting Commissioner of IRS  described the extensions as a major processing challenge and said this is  the only time the agency has been required to implement retroactive tax  extensions after the beginning of a filing season. To address the  extensions, IRS officials told us they  reprogrammed systems to accept taxpayer claims related to these  retroactively extended provisions;  recalled, revised, and re-released more than 50 already published  products; and held 5,624 individual returns while necessary programming changes  were made to ensure proper processing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Issues Hiring and Redistributing Work Responsibilities", "paragraphs": ["IRS faced challenges in two of its five paper processing centers related to  hiring and redistributing work responsibilities.

To realize cost savings from the decrease in paper filing as a  result of increased electronic filing, IRS began to consolidate its paper  processing centers in 2018. As part of this plan, IRS moved some  individual paper return processing to its facility in Ogden. This facility had  not processed individual returns since 2000 and IRS officials told us that  the lack of recent experience with this kind of work caused processing to  fall behind targets. For example, as of March 2, 2018, Ogden had missed  IRS targets for return processing time by between 14 and 15 days,  depending on the form type.", "Officials told us the agency had reintroduced Ogden to the work  gradually, by assigning fewer returns to the site in the first year;  nevertheless, the site still experienced delays. For example, as of March  2, Ogden had processed 10.6 percent of the 202,000 returns expected,  while the processing centers in Fresno, CA and Kansas City, MO had  processed 98.5 percent (723,000 out of 734,000) and 98.2 percent  (545,000 out of 555,000) of their expected returns respectively on the  same date.", "IRS minimized the effects of these delays on overall processing by  transferring returns initially sent to Ogden to the Kansas City location,  which enabled IRS to meet its overall processing goals. Later in the filing  season, processing at Ogden had improved, but still had not reached  IRS\u2019s goal for the site. For example, as of May 11, 2018, Ogden was at  approximately 73 percent of schedule, having processed 716,000 out of  977,000 scheduled returns. IRS officials said that responding to changes  in work flows is a normal aspect of processing across all locations, but  noted that the agency continued to monitor the situation in Ogden and  learn from the experience to guide future consolidation efforts.", "Austin. This processing facility, slated for closure in 2024, also  experienced processing delays. As we reported in 2017, and as IRS  officials told us again this year, IRS was unable to hire enough personnel  to process paper tax returns at this site, which may be due to low  unemployment rates in the area. IRS officials told us Austin planned to  hire 567 employees by early March to transfer data from paper returns to  an electronic format, but had only been able to hire 142 people, or 25  percent of that target.

IRS also reduced the  percentage of returns for which it was unable to verify wage information to  13 percent, compared to 58 percent in 2017. IRS officials told us this was,  in part, a result of receiving 224 million W-2s by February 15 compared to  214 million by the same time in 2017. Having more W-2 data available  earlier also allowed IRS to better target its selection of returns for review,  helping to reduce taxpayer burden and IRS workload. For example, IRS  had excluded 10,000 returns from review as of February 15, 2018,  compared to 3,000 during the same time in 2017.", "In addition, IRS improved its ability to identify potentially false and  fraudulent returns for returns with EITC or ACTC\u2014including those for  which it did not have W-2 data at the time of identification\u2014by developing  two new filters that automated some aspects of the manual review  process used in 2017. IRS developed the new filters based on cases of  confirmed fraud identified through systemic verification in 2017 and  selected returns with characteristics that are more likely to be fraudulent  or noncompliant. The filters select returns for review among those  reporting information that does not match corresponding W-2 data and  that IRS could not verify because it did not have W-2 data at the time of  selection. Last year, IRS identified 12,000 cases of confirmed fraud from  the 162,000 cases it selected for review. IRS officials told us that they do  not have final data at this time, but that they anticipate they will confirm  more cases of fraud and noncompliance in 2018 as a result of these  filters.", "Returns with refunds not claiming EITC or ACTC benefits are also subject  to systemic verification as well as additional fraud filters. However, for  returns not claiming these benefits, IRS does not hold refunds when it is  unable to verify wages reported by the taxpayer unless the returns are  selected by other fraud filters for review. As we reported in January 2018,  IRS cannot verify information reported for more than half of returns  submitted early in the filing season prior to issuing refunds because it  receives W-2 information throughout the filing season. In 2017 and  2018, IRS received and processed the majority of W-2s by mid- to late- February. In addition, IRS verified most wage information on returns  submitted in mid-February as being accurate. IRS verified that accurate  wage information was reported on 77 percent of returns not claiming the  EITC or ACTC submitted between February 9 and 15, 2018, representing  $10.91 billion in refunds.", "However, IRS does not have data available early in the filing season that  would help it better identify which returns are potentially fraudulent or  noncompliant.

However, IRS officials told us that  IRS has not held those refunds because of the volume of existing cases,  challenges of processing large numbers of refunds on a single day, and  other costs to the agency, such as inquiries from taxpayers about their  refunds.", "In January 2018, we recommended that IRS study the benefits and costs  of the refund hold and consider modifying it based on the study results.  For example, IRS could hold refunds for taxpayers not claiming EITC or  ACTC and release the refunds once it has the W-2 data available and has  verified the wage information. IRS officials reiterated that the potential of  verification to detect more fraud and noncompliance is limited by delays  caused by filing extensions and use of paper W-2s\u2014which are  transcribed at SSA before being transmitted to IRS. For example, IRS  had not received any paper W-2 data for tax year 2017 by the February  15 refund hold date.
