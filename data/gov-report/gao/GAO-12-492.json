This finding is similar to GAO\u0092s results from prior reviews.

Nonetheless, and similar to last year\u0092s results, for two key elements of the reports (income and expenses), GAO estimates that lobbyists could provide documentation to support approximately 93 percent of the disclosure reports for the third and fourth quarters of 2010 and the first and second quarters of 2011. According to documentation lobbyists provided for income and expenses, GAO estimates that the amounts disclosed were properly reported and supported for 63 percent of the quarterly lobbying disclosure (LD-2) reports. For lobbyists and lobbying firms listed on the LD-2 report, an estimated 86 percent filed year-end 2010 or midyear 2011 reports of federal political campaign contributions (LD-203) reports as required. For LD-203 political contributions reports, GAO estimates that a minimum of 4 percent of all LD-203 reports omitted one or more reportable political contributions that were documented in the Federal Election Commission database. Fewer lobbyists\u009717 this year versus 21 in the prior year\u0097stated that they planned to amend their LD-2 report following GAO\u0092s reviews to make correction on one or more data elements.

The majority of lobbyists who newly registered with the Secretary of the Senate and Clerk of the House of Representatives in the third and fourth quarters of 2010 and first and second quarters of 2011 filed required disclosure reports for that period. GAO could identify corresponding reports on file for lobbying activity for 88 percent of registrants.", "The majority of lobbyists felt that the terms associated with disclosure reporting were clear and understandable and the requirements were easy to meet. However, a few lobbyists reported challenges in complying with the LDA.", "The U.S. Attorney\u0092s Office for the District of Columbia (the Office) stated that it has resources and authorities to pursue civil or criminal cases for noncompliance with LDA requirements. To enhance enforcement efforts and support the 17 staff who have been working on compliance issues on a part-time basis, the Office hired one contract staff member in September 2010 who works full-time on lobbying compliance issues. The Office has primarily focused on contacting lobbyists who have potentially violated the LDA by not filing disclosure reports. In November 2011, the Office settled its first enforcement case since the enactment of the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 (HLOGA), and reached a $45,000 settlement with a lobbying firm that had been referred to the Office repeatedly for failure to file disclosure reports. More than half of the 561 lobbyists who were contacted for noncompliance with LD-2 requirements for calendar years 2009 and 2010 are now compliant.

To assess whether these  disclosure data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report,  we reviewed relevant documentation and spoke to officials responsible for  maintaining the data. Although registrations and reports are filed through  a single web portal, each chamber subsequently receives copies of the  data and follows different data cleaning, processing, and editing  procedures before storing the data in either individual files (in the House)  or databases (in the Senate). Currently, there is no means of reconciling  discrepancies between the two databases caused by the differences in  data processing. For example, Senate staff have told us during previous  reviews that they set aside a greater proportion of registration and report  submissions than the House for manual review before entering the  information into the database, and as a result, the Senate database would  be slightly less current than the House database on any given day  pending review and clearance. House staff also told us during previous  reviews that they rely heavily on automated processing, and that while  they manually review reports that do not perfectly match in formation file  for a given registrant or client, they will approve and upload such reports  as originally filed by each lobbyist even if the reports contain errors or  discrepancies (such as a variant on how a name is spelled).  Nevertheless, we do not have reasons to believe that the content of the  Senate and House systems would vary substantially. For this review, we  determined that House disclosure data were sufficiently reliable for  identifying a sample of quarterly disclosure (LD-2) reports and for  assessing whether newly filed registrants also filed required reports. We  used the House database for sampling LD-2 reports from the third and  fourth quarters of calendar year 2010 and the first and second quarters of  calendar year 2011, as well as for sampling year-end 2010 and midyear  2011 political contributions (LD-203) reports, and finally for matching  quarterly registrations with filed reports. We did not evaluate the Offices  of the Secretary of the Senate or the Clerk of the House, both of which  have key roles in the lobbying disclosure process, although we consulted  with officials from each office, and they provided us with general  background information at our request and detailed information on data  processing procedures.", "To assess the extent to which lobbyists could provide evidence of their  compliance with reporting requirements, we examined a stratified random  sample of 100 LD-2 reports from the third and fourth quarters of 2010 and  the first and second quarters of 2011. The third quarter 2010 LD-2 reports  were from our prior review and were included in the current review to  redistribute the LD-2 reports evenly across the calendar year for future  lobbying reviews. We excluded reports with no lobbying activity or with  income less than $5,000 from our sampling frame. The third quarter   2010 sample was drawn from 13,489 activity reports and we drew our  remaining sample from 38,303 activity reports filed for the fourth quarter  of 2010 and first and second quarters of 2011 available in the public  House database, as of our final download date for each quarter. This  allowed us to generalize to a population of 51,792 activity reports.  Our  sample is based on a stratified random selection, and it is only one of a  large number of samples that we may have drawn. Because each sample  could have provided different estimates, we express our confidence in the  precision of our particular sample\u2019s results as a 95 percent confidence  interval. This interval would contain the actual population value for 95  percent of the samples that we could have drawn. All percentage  estimates in this report have 95 percent confidence intervals of within plus  or minus 10.0 percentage points or less of the estimate itself, unless  otherwise noted. When estimating compliance with certain of the  elements we examined, we base our estimate on a one-sided 95 percent  confidence interval to generate a conservative estimate of either the  minimum or the maximum percentage of reports in the population  exhibiting the characteristic. the amount of income reported for lobbying activities,  the amount of expenses reported on lobbying activities,  the names of those lobbyists listed in the report,  the Houses of Congress and federal agencies that they lobbied, and  the issue codes listed to describe their lobbying activity.", "Prior to each interview, we conducted an open source search to identify  lobbyists on each report who may have held a covered official position.  We reviewed the lobbyists\u2019 previous work histories by searching lobbying  firms\u2019 websites, LinkedIn, Leadership Directories, Who\u2019s Who in American  Politics, Legistorm, and U.S. newspapers through Nexis. Prior to 2008,  lobbyists were only required to disclose covered official positions held  within 2 years of registering as a lobbyist for the client. HLOGA amended  that time frame to require disclosure of positions held 20 years before the  date the lobbyists first lobbied on behalf of the client. Lobbyist are  required to disclose previously held covered official positions either on the  client registration (LD-1) or on the first LD-2 report when the lobbyist is  added as \u201cnew.\u201d Consequently, those who held covered official positions  may have disclosed the information on the LD-1 or a LD-2 report filed  prior to the report we examined as part of our random sample. Therefore,  where we found evidence that a lobbyist previously held a covered official  position, we conducted an additional review of the publicly available  Secretary of the Senate or Clerk of the House database to determine  whether the lobbyist properly disclosed the covered official position.  Finally, if a lobbyist appeared to hold a covered position that was not  disclosed, we asked for an explanation at the interview with the lobbying  firm to ensure that our research was accurate. Despite our rigorous  search, it is possible that we failed to identify all previously held covered  official positions for all lobbyists listed. Thus, our estimate of the  proportion of reports with lobbyists who failed to properly disclose  covered official positions is a lower-bound estimate of the minimum  proportion of reports that failed to report such positions.", "In addition to examining the content of the LD-2 reports, we confirmed  whether year-end 2010 or midyear 2011 LD-203 reports had been filed  for each firm and lobbyist listed on the LD-2 reports in our random  sample. Although this review represents a random selection of lobbyists  and firms, it is not a direct probability sample of firms filing LD-2 reports or  lobbyists listed on LD-2 reports. As such, we did not estimate the  likelihood that LD-203 reports were appropriately filed for the population  of firms or lobbyists listed on LD-2 reports.", "To determine if the LDA\u2019s requirement for registrants to file a report in the  quarter of registration was met for the third and fourth quarters of 2010  and the first and second quarters of 2011, we used data filed with the  Clerk of the House to match newly filed registrations with corresponding  disclosure reports. Using direct matching and text and pattern matching  procedures, we were able to identify matching disclosure reports for  3,357, or 88 percent, of the 3,802 newly filed registrations. We began by  standardizing client and registrant names in both the report and  registration files (including removing punctuation and standardizing words  and abbreviations, such as \u201ccompany\u201d and \u201cCO\u201d). We then matched  reports and registrations using the House identification number (which is  linked to a unique registrant-client pair), as well as the names of the  registrant and client. For reports we could not match by identification  number and standardized name, we also attempted to match reports and  registrations by client and registrant name, allowing for variations in the  names to accommodate minor misspellings or typos. For these cases, we  used professional judgment to determine whether cases with typos were  sufficiently similar to consider as matches. We could not readily identify  matches in the report database for the remaining registrations using  electronic means.", "To assess the accuracy of the LD-203 reports, we analyzed stratified  random samples of LD-203 reports from the 32,301 total LD-203 reports.  The first sample contains 80 reports of the 10,646 reports with political  contributions and the second contains 80 reports of the 21,655 reports  listing no contributions. Each sample contains 40 reports from the year- end 2010 filing period and 40 reports from the midyear 2011 filing period.  The samples allow us to generalize estimates in this report to either the  population of LD-203 reports with contributions or the reports without  contributions to within a 95 percent confidence interval of plus or minus  8.2 percentage points or less, and to within 4.2 percentage points of  estimate when analyzing both samples together. We analyzed the  contents of the LD-203 reports and compared them to contribution data  found in the publicly available Federal Elections Commission\u2019s (FEC)  political contribution database. For our fiscal year 2009 report, we  interviewed staff at the FEC responsible for administering the database  and determined that the data reliability is suitable for the purpose of  confirming whether a FEC-reportable disclosure listed in the FEC  database had been reported on an LD-203 report.", "We compared the FEC-reportable contributions reporting on the LD-203  reports with information in the FEC database. The verification process  required text and pattern matching procedures, and we used professional  judgment when assessing whether an individual listed is the same  individual filing an LD-203. For contributions reported in the FEC  database and not on the LD-203 report, we asked the lobbyists or  organizations to provide an explanation of why the contribution was not  listed on the LD-203 report or to provide documentation of those  contributions. As with covered positions on LD-2 disclosure reports, we  cannot be certain that our review identified all cases of FEC-reportable  contributions that were inappropriately omitted from a lobbyist\u2019s LD-203  report. We did not estimate the percentage of other non-FEC political  contributions that were omitted (such as honoraria or gifts to presidential  libraries).", "To identify challenges to compliance, we used structured interviews and  obtained views from lobbyists included in our sample of LD-2 reports on  any challenges to compliance. In addition, we asked lobbyists to rate  various terms associated with disclosure requirements.", "To describe the resources and authorities available to the Office, we  interviewed officials from the Office and obtained information on the level  of staffing and resources dedicated to the enforcement of the LDA. The  Office provided us with information on the processes used to enforce  compliance with the LDA, and reports from the tracking system on their  number and status of referrals.", "To describe the efforts the Office has made to improve its enforcement of  the LDA, we interviewed officials from the Office and obtained information  on the processes used by the Office in following up on referrals from the  Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House. The Office provided  us with reports from the tracking system on the number and status of the  referred cases.", "The mandate does not include identifying lobbyists who failed to register  and report in accordance with LDA requirements, or whether for those  lobbyists who did register and report all lobbying activity or contributions  were disclosed.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2011 through March  2012 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
