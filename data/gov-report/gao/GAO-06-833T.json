The first key step is to develop a privacy impact assessment--an analysis of how personal information is collected, stored, shared, and managed--whenever information technology is used to process personal information. These assessments, required by the E-Government Act of 2002, are a tool for agencies to fully consider the privacy implications of planned systems and data collections before implementation, when it may be easier to make critical adjustments. The second key step is to ensure that a robust information security program is in place, as required by the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA). Such a program includes periodic risk assessments; security awareness training; security policies, procedures, and practices, as well as tests of their effectiveness; and procedures for addressing deficiencies and for detecting, reporting, and responding to security incidents. More specific practical measures aimed at preventing inadvertent data breaches include limiting the collection of personal information, limiting the time that such data are retained, limiting access to personal information and training personnel accordingly, and considering the use of technological controls such as encryption when data need to be stored on mobile devices. When data breaches do occur, notification to the individuals affected and/or the public has clear benefits, allowing people the opportunity to take steps to protect themselves against the dangers of identity theft. Although existing laws do not require agencies to notify the public when data breaches occur, such notification is consistent with agencies' responsibility to inform individuals about how their information is being accessed and used, and it promotes accountability for privacy protection. That said, care is needed in defining appropriate criteria for incidents that merit notification. Notifying individuals of security incidents that do not pose serious risks could be counterproductive and costly, while giving too much discretion to agencies could result in their avoiding the disclosure of potentially harmful breaches. Care is also needed to ensure that notices are useful and easy to understand, so that they are effective in alerting recipients to actions they may want to take to minimize the risk of identity theft. Among other things, it is important to provide context in the notice--explaining to recipients why they are receiving a notice and what to do about it. It is also important the notices be coordinated with law enforcement to avoid impeding ongoing investigations. Given that individuals may be adversely impacted by a compromise of their personal information, it is critical that they fully understand the nature of the threat and the options they have to address it."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to discuss key  challenges federal agencies face in safeguarding personally  identifiable information in their custody and taking action when  that information is compromised.

Concerns about possible identity theft resulting from  such breaches are widespread. The Federal Trade Commission  (FTC) reported in 2005 that identity theft represented about 40  percent of all the consumer fraud complaints it received during each  of the last 3 calendar years. Identity theft generally involves the  fraudulent use of another person\u2019s identifying information\u2014such as  name, address, Social Security number, date of birth, or mother\u2019s  maiden name\u2014to establish credit, run up debt, or take over existing  financial accounts.

The memo  called on agency senior privacy officials to conduct a review of  policies and processes to make sure adequate safeguards are in  place to prevent the intentional or negligent misuse of, or  unauthorized access to, personally identifiable information.", "The provisions of the Privacy Act are largely based on a set of  principles for protecting the privacy and security of personal  information, known as the Fair Information Practices, which were  first proposed in 1973 by a U.S. government advisory committee;  these principles were intended to address what the committee  termed a poor level of protection afforded to privacy under  contemporary law. Since that time, the Fair Information Practices  have been widely adopted as a standard benchmark for evaluating  the adequacy of privacy protections. Attachment 2 contains a  summary of the widely used version of the Fair Information  Practices adopted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation  and Development in 1980.", "The E-Government Act of 2002 strives to enhance protection for  personal information in government information systems by  requiring that agencies conduct privacy impact assessments (PIA). A  PIA is an analysis of how personal information is collected, stored,  shared, and managed in a federal system. More specifically,  according to OMB guidance, a PIA is to (1) ensure that handling  conforms to applicable legal, regulatory, and policy requirements  regarding privacy; (2) determine the risks and effects of collecting,  maintaining, and disseminating information in identifiable form in  an electronic information system; and (3) examine and evaluate  protections and alternative processes for handling information to  mitigate potential privacy risks.

For example, California state law requires businesses to  notify consumers about security breaches that could directly affect  them. Legal requirements, such as the California law, led  ChoicePoint, a large information reseller, to notify its customers in  mid-February 2005 of a security breach in which unauthorized  persons gained access to personal information from its databases.  Since the ChoicePoint notification, bills were introduced in at least  44 states and enacted in at least 29 that require some form of  notification upon a security breach.", "A number of congressional hearings were held and bills introduced  in 2005 in the wake of the ChoicePoint security breach as well as  incidents at other firms. In March 2005, the House Subcommittee on  Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection of the House Energy  and Commerce Committee held a hearing entitled \u201cProtecting  Consumers\u2019 Data: Policy Issues Raised by ChoicePoint,\u201d which  focused on potential remedies for security and privacy concerns  regarding information resellers.

I will focus my remarks today on key  strategic approaches for safeguarding personal information as well  as a few practical measures that could be critical in preventing data  breaches. I will not discuss at length the broader topic of  information security in the federal government, which both the  committee and GAO have addressed extensively in the past. Key  strategic approaches include the following:  Conduct privacy impact assessments (PIAs). It is important that  agencies identify the specific instances in which they collect and  maintain personal information and proactively assess the means  they intend to use to protect this information. This can be done most  effectively through the development of PIAs, which, as I previously  mentioned, are required by the E-Government Act of 2002 when  using information technology to process personal information. PIAs  are important because they serve as a tool for agencies to fully  consider privacy implications of planned systems and data  collections before those systems and collections have been fully  implemented, when it may be relatively easy to make critical  adjustments.", "In prior work we have found that agencies do not always prepare  PIAs as they are required. For example, our review of selected data  mining efforts at federal agencies determined that PIAs were not  always being done in full compliance with OMB guidance. Similarly,  as identified in our work on federal agency use of information  resellers, few PIAs were being developed for systems or programs  that made use of information reseller data because officials did not  believe they were required. Complete assessments are an important  tool for agencies to identify areas of noncompliance with federal  privacy laws, evaluate risks arising from electronic collection and  maintenance of information about individuals, and evaluate  protections or alternative processes needed to mitigate the risks  identified. Agencies that do not take all the steps required to protect  the privacy of personal information risk the improper exposure or  alteration of such information. We recommended that the agencies  responsible for the data mining efforts we reviewed complete or  revise PIAs as needed and make them available to the public. We  also recommended that OMB revise its guidance to clarify the  applicability of the E-Gov Act\u2019s PIA requirement to the use of  personal information from resellers. OMB stated that it would  discuss its guidance with agency senior officials for privacy to  determine whether additional guidance concerning reseller data was  needed.", "Ensure that a robust security program is in place. FISMA requires  each agency to develop, document, and implement an agencywide  information security program to provide security for the information  and information systems that support the operations and assets of  the agency, including those provided or managed by another agency,  contractor, or other source. Key elements of this program include  \u25cf  periodic assessments of the risk and magnitude of harm that could  result from the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption,  modification, or destruction of information or information systems;  \u25cf  risk-based policies and procedures that cost-effectively reduce risks  to an acceptable level and ensure that security is addressed  throughout the life cycle of each information system;  \u25cf  security awareness training for agency personnel, including  contractors and other users of information systems that support the  operations and assets of the agency;  \u25cf  periodic testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of information  security policies, procedures, and practices;  \u25cf  a process for planning, implementing, evaluating, and documenting  remedial action to address any deficiencies through plans of action  and milestones; and  \u25cf  procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to security  incidents.", "In prior reviews we have repeatedly identified weaknesses in almost  all areas of information security controls at major federal agencies,  and we have identified information security as a high risk area  across the federal government since 1997. In July 2005, we reported  that pervasive weaknesses in the 24 major agencies\u2019 information  security policies and practices threatened the integrity,  confidentiality, and availability of federal information and  information systems. These weaknesses existed primarily because  agencies had not yet fully implemented strong information security  management programs, as needed to fully meet FISMA  requirements. We recommended that OMB implement  improvements in its annual FISMA reporting guidance to help  improve oversight of agency information security programs. In  March 2006, we reported that OMB had taken several actions to  improve reporting and could further enhance the reliability and  quality of reported information.", "In the course of taking strategic approaches to protecting the  privacy and security of personal information, agencies will likely  consider a range of specific practical measures. Several that may be  of particular value in preventing inadvertent data breaches include  the following:  Limit collection of personal information. One item to be analyzed  as part of a PIA is the extent to which an agency needs to collect  personal information in order to meet the needs of a specific  application. Limiting the collection of personal information, among  other things, serves to limit the opportunity for that information to  be compromised. For example, key identifying information\u2014such as  Social Security numbers\u2014may not be needed for many agency  applications that have databases of other personal information.  Limiting the collection of personal information is also one of the fair  information practices, which are fundamental to the Privacy Act and  to good privacy practice in general.", "Limit data retention. Closely related to limiting data collection is  limiting retention. Retaining personal data longer than needed by an  agency or statutorily required adds to the risk that the data will be  compromised. In discussing data retention, California\u2019s Office of  Privacy Protection recently reported an example in which a  university experienced a security breach that exposed 15-year-old  data, including Social Security numbers. The university  subsequently reviewed its policies and decided to shorten the  retention period for certain types of information. Federal agencies  can make decisions up front about how long they plan to retain  personal data as part of their PIAs, aiming to retain the data for as  brief a period as necessary.", "Limit access to personal information and train personnel  accordingly. Only individuals with a need to access agency  databases of personal information should have such access, and  controls should be in place to monitor that access. Further, agencies  can implement technological controls to prevent personal data from  being readily transferred to unauthorized systems or media, such as  laptop computers, discs, or other electronic storage devices.  Security training, which is required for all federal employees under  FISMA, can include training on the risks of exposing personal data  to potential identity theft, thus helping to reduce the likelihood of  data being exposed inadvertently.", "Consider using technological controls such as encryption when  data needs to be stored on mobile devices. In certain instances,  agencies may find it necessary to enable employees to have access  to personal data on mobile devices such as laptop computers. As  discussed, this should be minimized. However, when absolutely  necessary, the risk that such data could be exposed to unauthorized  individuals can be reduced by using technological controls such as  encryption, which significantly limits the ability of such individuals  gaining access to the data. While encrypting data adds to the  operational burden on authorized individuals, who must enter pass  codes or use other authentication means to decrypt the data, it can  provide reasonable assurance that stolen or lost computer  equipment will not result in personal data being compromised, as  occurred in the recent incident at the Department of Veterans  Affairs. A decision about whether to use encryption would logically  be made as an element of the PIA process and an agency\u2019s broader  information security program.", "While these suggestions do not amount to a complete prescription  for protecting personal data, they are key elements of an agency\u2019s  strategy for reducing the risks that could lead to identity theft."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Public Notification of Data Breaches Has Clear Benefits as Well as Challenges", "paragraphs": ["I just discussed some preventive measures agencies can take to  avoid a data breach. However, in the event an incident does occur,  agencies must respond quickly in order to minimize the potential  harm associated with identity theft. Applicable laws such as the  Privacy Act currently do not require agencies to notify individuals of  security breaches involving their personal information; however,  doing so allows those affected the opportunity to take steps to  protect themselves against the dangers of identity theft. For  example, the California data breach notification law is credited with  bringing to the public\u2019s notice large data breaches within the private  sector, including at information resellers such as ChoicePoint and  LexisNexis last year. Although we do not know how many instances  of identity theft resulted from last year\u2019s data breaches, the Federal  Trade Commission has previously reported that the overall cost of  an incident of identity theft, as well as the harm to the victims, is  significantly smaller if the misuse of the victim\u2019s personal  information is discovered quickly. Arguably, the California law may  have mitigated the risk of identity theft to affected individuals by  keeping them informed about data breaches and thus enabling them  to take steps such as contacting credit bureaus to have fraud alerts  placed on their credit files, obtaining copies of their credit reports,  scrutinizing their monthly financial account statements, and taking  other steps to protect themselves. The chairman of the Federal  Trade Commission has testified that the Commission believes that if  a security breach creates a significant risk of identity theft or other  related harm, affected consumers should be notified.", "Breach notification is also important in that it can help an  organization address key privacy rights of individuals. These rights  are based on the fair information practices (see attachment 2); these  principles have been widely adopted and are the basis of privacy  laws and related policies in many countries, including the United  States. In particular, the openness principle states that the public  should be informed about privacy policies and practices, and  individuals should have ready means of learning about the use of  personal information. Breach notification is one way that  organizations\u2014either in the private sector or the government\u2014can  meet their responsibility for keeping the public informed of how  their personal information is being used and who has access to it.  Equally important is the accountability principle, which states that  individuals controlling the collection or use of personal information  should be accountable for taking steps to ensure the implementation  of the other principles, such as use limitation and security  safeguards. Public disclosure of data breaches is a key step in  ensuring that organizations are held accountable for the protection  of personal information."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Concerns Have Been Raised About the Criteria for Issuing Notices to the Public", "paragraphs": ["Although the principle of notifying affected individuals (or the  public) about data breaches has clear benefits, determining the  specifics of when and how an agency should issue such notifications  presents challenges, particularly in determining the specific criteria  for incidents that merit notification. In congressional testimony, the  Federal Trade Commission raised concerns about the threshold for  which consumers should be notified of a breach, cautioning that too  strict a standard could have several negative effects. First,  notification of a breach when there is little or no risk of harm might  create unnecessary concern and confusion. Second, a surfeit of  notices, resulting from notification criteria that are too strict, could  render all such notices less effective, because consumers could  become numb to them and fail to act when risks are truly  significant. Finally, the costs to both individuals and business are  not insignificant and may be worth considering. The FTC points out  that, in response to a security breach notification, a consumer may  cancel credit cards, contact credit bureaus to place fraud alerts on  credit files, or obtain a new driver\u2019s license number. These actions  could be time-consuming for the individual and costly for the  companies involved. Given these potential negative effects, care is  clearly needed in defining appropriate criteria for required breach  notifications.", "While care needs to be taken to avoid requiring agencies to notify  the public of trivial security incidents, concerns have also been  raised about setting criteria that are too open-ended or that rely too  heavily on the discretion of the affected organization. Some public  advocacy groups have cautioned that notification criteria that are  too weak would give companies an incentive not to disclose  potentially harmful breaches. This concern could also apply to  federal agencies. In congressional testimony last year, the executive  director of the Center for Democracy and Technology argued that if  an entity is not certain whether a breach warrants notification, it  should be able to consult with the Federal Trade Commission. He  went on to suggest that a two-tiered system may be desirable, with  notice to the Federal Trade Commission of all breaches of personal  data and notice to consumers where there is a potential risk of  identity theft. The Center for Democracy and Technology\u2019s  comments regarding the Federal Trade Commission were aimed at  commercial entities such as information resellers. A different  entity\u2014such as OMB, which is responsible for overseeing security  and privacy within the federal government\u2014might be more  appropriate to take on a parallel role with respect to federal  agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effective Notices Should Provide Useful Information and Be Easy to Understand", "paragraphs": ["Once a determination has been made that a public notice is to be  issued, care must be taken to ensure that it does its job effectively.  Designing useful, easy-to-understand notices has been cited as a  challenge in other areas where privacy notices are required by law,  such as in the financial industry\u2014where businesses are required by  the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act to send notices to consumers about  their privacy practices\u2014and in the federal government, which is  required by the Privacy Act to issue public notices in the Federal  Register about its systems of records containing personal  information. For example, as noted during a public workshop  hosted by the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Privacy Office,  designing easy-to-understand consumer financial privacy notices to  meet Gramm-Leach Bliley Act requirements has been challenging.  Officials from the FTC and Office of the Comptroller of the  Currency described widespread criticism of these notices\u2014that they  were unexpected, too long, filled with legalese, and not  understandable.", "If an agency is to notify people of a data breach, it should do so in  such a way that they understand the nature of the threat and what  steps need to be taken to protect themselves against identity theft.  In connection with its state law requiring security breach  notifications, the California Office of Privacy Protection has  published recommended practices for designing and issuing security  breach notices. The office recommends that such notifications  include, among other things,  \u25cf  a general description of what happened;  \u25cf  the type of personal information that was involved;  \u25cf  what steps have been taken to prevent further unauthorized  acquisition of personal information;  \u25cf  the types of assistance to be provided to individuals, such as a toll- free contact telephone number for additional information and  assistance;  information on what individuals can do to protect themselves from  identity theft, including contact information for the three credit  reporting agencies; and  information on where individuals can obtain additional information  on protection against identity theft, such as the Federal Trade  Commission\u2019s Identity Theft Web site (www.consumer.gov/idtheft).", "The California Office of Privacy Protection also recommends  making notices clear, conspicuous, and helpful, by using clear,  simple language and avoiding jargon and suggests avoiding using a  standardized format to mitigate the risk that the public will become  complacent about the process.", "The Federal Trade Commission has issued guidance to businesses  on notifying individuals of data breaches that reiterates several key  elements of effective notification\u2014describing clearly what is known  about the data compromise, explaining what responses may be  appropriate for the type of information taken, and providing  information and contacts regarding identity theft in general. The  Commission also suggests providing contact information for the law  enforcement officer working on the case as well as encouraging  individuals who discover that their information has been misused to  file a complaint with the Commission.", "Both the state of California and the Federal Trade Commission  recommend consulting with cognizant law-enforcement officers  about an incident before issuing notices to the public. In some  cases, early notification or disclosure of certain facts about an  incident could hamper a law enforcement investigation. For  example, an otherwise unknowing thief could learn of the potential  value of data stored on a laptop computer that was originally stolen  purely for the value of the hardware. Thus it is recommended that  organizations consult with law enforcement regarding the timing  and content of notifications. However, law enforcement  investigations should not necessarily result in lengthy delays in  notification. California\u2019s guidance states that it should not be  necessary for a law enforcement agency to complete an  investigation before notification can be given.", "During a recent public workshop on \u201cTransparency and  Accountability: The Use of Personal Information within the  Government,\u201d hosted by the DHS Privacy Office, a panelist  discussed the concept of \u201clayering\u201d notices to foster greater  understanding and comprehension by consumers. Layering involves  providing only the most important summary facts up front\u2014often in  a graphically oriented format\u2014followed by one or more lengthier,  more narrative versions in order to ensure that all information is  communicated that needs to be. The panelist noted the pros and  cons of lengthy, detailed notices versus brief, easier-to-understand  notices. Specifically, long notices have the advantage of being  complete, but this is often at a cost of not being easy to understand,  while brief, easier-to-understand notices may not capture all the  detail that needs to be conveyed. Multilayered notices were cited as  an option to achieving an easy-to-understand yet complete notice.", "In addition, DHS workshop panelists from the Federal Trade  Commission and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency  discussed the major findings of an interagency research project  concerning the design of easy-to-understand consumer financial  privacy notices. The study found, among other things, that providing  context to the notice (explaining to consumers why they are  receiving the notice and what to do with it) was key to  comprehension, and that comprehension was aided by  incorporating key visual design elements, such as use of a tabular  format, large and legible fonts, and appropriate use of white space  and simple headings.", "Although these panel discussions were not focused on notices to  inform the public of data breaches, the multilayered approach  discussed and findings from the interagency research project can be  applied to such notices. For example, a multilayered security breach  notice could include a brief description of the nature of the security  breach, the potential threat to victims of the incident, and measures  to be taken to protect against identity theft. The notice could  provide additional details about the incident as an attachment or by  providing links to additional information. This would accomplish the  purpose of communicating the key details in a brief format, while  still providing complete information to those who require it. Given  that people may be adversely affected by a compromise of their  personal information, it is critical that they fully understand the  nature of the threat and the options they have to address it.", "In summary, agencies can take a number of actions to help guard  against the possibility that databases of personally identifiable  information are inadvertently compromised, among which  developing PIAs and ensuring that a robust information security  program is in place are key. More specific practical measures aimed  at preventing inadvertent data breaches include limiting the  collection of personal information, limiting data retention, limiting  access to personal information and training personnel accordingly,  and considering using technological controls such as encryption  when data need to be stored on mobile devices. Nevertheless, data  breaches can still occur at any time, and when they do, notification  to the individuals affected and/or the public has clear benefits,  allowing people the opportunity to take steps to protect themselves  against the dangers of identity theft. Care is needed in defining  appropriate criteria if agencies are to be required to report security  breaches to the public. Further, care is also needed to ensure that  notices are useful and easy-to-understand so that they are effective  in alerting individuals to actions they may want to take to minimize  the risk of identity theft.", "As Congress considers legislation requiring agencies to notify  individuals or the public about security breaches, it should ensure  that specific criteria are defined for incidents that merit public  notification. It may want to consider creating a two-tier reporting  requirement, in which all security breaches are reported to OMB,  and affected individuals are notified only of incidents involving  significant risk.
