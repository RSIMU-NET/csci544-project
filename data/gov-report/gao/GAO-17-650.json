Submission rates for ISF-10s\u2014required for cargo destined for the United States\u2014increased from about 95 percent in 2012 to 99 percent in 2015. Submission rates for ISF-5s\u2014required for cargo transiting but not destined for the United States\u2014ranged from about 68 to 80 percent. To increase ISF-5 submission rates, CBP published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in July 2016 to clarify the party responsible for submitting the ISF-5. GAO could not determine submission rates for vessel stow plans, which depict the position of each cargo container on a vessel, because CBP calculates stow plan submission rates on a daily basis, but not comprehensively over time. CBP officials noted, though, that compliance overall is likely nearly 100 percent because Advance Targeting Units (ATU), responsible for identifying high-risk shipments, contact carriers if they have not received stow plans. GAO also could not determine submission rates for CSMs, which report container movements and status changes, because CBP does not have access to carriers' private data systems to know the number of CSMs it should receive. CBP targeters noted that they may become aware that CSMs have not been sent based on other information sources they review.", "CBP has taken actions to enforce ISF and stow plan submissions, but has not enforced CSM submissions or assessed the effects of its enforcement actions on compliance at the port level. ATUs enforce ISF and vessel stow plan compliance by using ISF holds, which prevent cargo from leaving ports, and issuing liquidated damages claims. CBP has not enforced CSM submissions because of the high volume it receives and lack of visibility into carriers' private data systems. However, when CBP targeters become aware that CSMs have not been received based on reviewing other information sources, taking enforcement actions could provide an incentive for carriers to submit all CSMs and help targeters better identify high-risk cargo. GAO's enforcement data analysis shows that ATUs used varying methods to enforce the ISF rule and that ports' ISF-10 submission rates varied. By assessing the effects of its enforcement strategies at the port level, CBP could better ensure it maximizes compliance with the rule.", "CBP officials stated that ISF rule data have improved their ability to identify high-risk cargo shipments, but CBP could collect additional performance information to better evaluate program effectiveness. Evaluating the direct impact of ISF rule data in assessing shipment risk is difficult; however, GAO identified examples of how CBP could better assess the ISF program's effectiveness. For example, CBP could track the number of containers not listed on a manifest\u2014which could pose a security risk\u2014it identifies through reviewing vessel stow plans. Collecting this type of additional performance information could help CBP better assess whether the ISF program is improving its ability to identify high-risk shipments.", "This is a public version of a sensitive report that GAO issued in May 2017.

In 2015,  approximately 10.5 million cargo shipments, including 12.1 million cargo  containers, arrived at U.S. seaports. Criminal or terrorist attacks using  cargo shipments could cause disruptions to the supply chain and limit  global economic growth and productivity. Cargo shipments can present  significant security concerns, as individuals have exploited vulnerabilities  in the supply chain by using cargo containers to smuggle narcotics,  stowaways, and other contraband. Given these vulnerabilities, there is a  risk that terrorists could use a cargo container to transport a weapon of  mass destruction or other terrorist contraband into the United States. U.S.  Customs and Border Protection (CBP), a component within the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has responsibility for  administering cargo security and reducing the vulnerabilities associated  with the global supply chain.", "In response to a requirement in the Security and Accountability for Every  Port Act of 2006 (SAFE Port Act) that DHS collect additional information  to identify high-risk cargo shipments for inspection, in January 2009, CBP  implemented the Importer Security Filing (ISF) and Additional Carrier  Requirements, generally referred to as the ISF rule. The rule requires  that importers (who order containerized and break bulk goods to be  shipped from foreign sources to the United States via oceangoing  vessels) and vessel carriers (who physically transport goods from foreign  ports to ports in the United States) submit additional cargo information,  such as country of origin, to CBP before the cargo is loaded onto U.S.- bound vessels. Specifically, importers are responsible for submitting the  ISF and vessel carriers are responsible for submitting vessel stow plans  and container status messages (CSM). According to the rule, collection of  the additional cargo information is intended to improve CBP\u2019s ability to  identify high-risk shipments and prevent the transportation of terrorist  weapons and other contraband into the United States.", "You requested that we review CBP\u2019s implementation of its ISF program  related to compliance, enforcement, and performance. Specifically, this  report addresses the following questions:  (1)  What are importers\u2019 and carriers\u2019 submission rates for ISF rule  requirements, and to what extent does CBP monitor compliance?  (2)  To what extent has CBP taken actions to enforce compliance with  the ISF rule and assessed whether its enforcement actions have  contributed to increased compliance among importers and  carriers?  (3)  To what extent has the ISF program improved CBP\u2019s ability to  identify high-risk cargo shipments prior to their arrival in the United  States, and to what extent are the data submitted under the  program accurate?", "This report is a public version of a prior sensitive report that we provided  to you. CBP deemed some of the information in the prior report Law  Enforcement Sensitive, which must be protected from public disclosure.  Therefore, this report omits sensitive information regarding enforcement  actions used at individual ports, methods for using the ISF rule data to  identify high-risk shipments, and the results of an analysis that examined  the consistency between ISF and entry data, among other things. The  information provided in this report is more limited in scope, as it excludes  such sensitive information, but it addresses the same questions as the  sensitive report and the overall methodology used for both reports is the  same.", "To determine importers\u2019 and carriers\u2019 submission rates for ISF rule  requirements, we analyzed CBP\u2019s ISF data to determine national  submission rates for ISFs from January 2012 through December 2015\u2014 the 4 most recent years of data available at the time of our review. To  assess the reliability of CBP\u2019s ISF data, we reviewed the data for obvious  errors, such as duplicative or missing fields. We discussed with CBP  officials how ISF data are processed and maintained. We determined the  data were sufficiently reliable to illustrate the national ISF submission  rate. We obtained CBP data on vessel stow plan submissions; however,  as described later in this report, we were not able to determine  submission rates because CBP was not able to provide us data on vessel  stow plans that were required, but ultimately not submitted to CBP. We  also could not determine submission rates for CSMs because CBP does  not have access to carriers\u2019 private systems to know when CSMs have  been created and should be provided to CBP. To determine the extent to  which CBP monitors importers\u2019 and carriers\u2019 compliance with ISF rule  requirements, we reviewed documents used by CBP officials to monitor  ISF and stow plan compliance. We also interviewed CBP officials located  at headquarters and at select Advance Targeting Units (ATU)\u2014units  responsible for identifying shipments that may be at risk for containing  terrorist weapons or other contraband. We selected five ATUs  responsible for shipments arriving at eight U.S. ports to reflect ports with  a range of ISF submission rates. We selected these ATUs based on  calendar year 2015 data because 2015 represented the most recent year  for which full year data were available at the time of our selection.  Although the results from our visits to the five ATUs are not generalizable  to all ATUs, the visits provided us insight into how and when ATU officials  monitor compliance of the required data.", "To determine the extent to which CBP has taken actions to enforce the  ISF rule and assessed whether its enforcement actions have contributed  to increased compliance among importers and carriers, we gathered and  analyzed data on CBP\u2019s actions to enforce the ISF rule and assessed its  actions against CBP\u2019s enforcement goals and criteria for conducting  outcome evaluations. We reviewed relevant CBP policies, including  guidance to ATUs on enforcing the ISF rule and spoke with CBP officials  to understand the steps CBP has taken to enforce the ISF rule and  assess the effects of its enforcement actions. The five ATUs we selected  to visit were chosen because they are responsible for ports that had  varying ISF submission rates and also because the ATUs employed  varying enforcement methods. Although the results from our visits to  these five ATUs are not generalizable to all ATUs across the United  States, the visits allowed us to understand how individual ATUs enforce  the ISF rule. We obtained CBP data on ISF holds and liquidated damages  claims (LDC), which are the two types of enforcement actions that ATUs  primarily use to enforce compliance with the ISF rule. Specifically, we  analyzed the hold and LDC data to determine the number of these  actions used by ATUs to enforce compliance from 2012 through 2015\u2014 the same time period we used to analyze compliance rates. To assess  the reliability of CBP\u2019s enforcement data, we reviewed the data for  obvious errors, such as duplicative or missing fields; performed a physical  case file review of several cases of LDCs at ATUs that we visited; and  discussed with CBP officials the results of our reviews. We also  discussed with CBP officials how the hold and LDC data are entered and  maintained in CBP\u2019s systems. We found CBP\u2019s data on ISF holds and  LDCs to be sufficiently reliable for reporting the number of holds and  LDCs used by ATUs and for selecting ATUs to visit. We also analyzed the  effectiveness of ISF holds as an enforcement action by developing a  statistical model measuring the association between ISF holds and the  rate at which importers complied with the requirement to submit an ISF to  CBP. We analyzed the effectiveness of ISF holds at each of the five  ATUs we visited by determining whether there were any differences in  effectiveness at the ports overseen by those ATUs. We were not able to  include LDCs in our statistical analysis because the small number of  LDCs was not sufficient to allow us to reliably assess their impact on  enforcement.", "To determine the extent to which the ISF program has improved CBP\u2019s  ability to identify high-risk cargo shipments prior to their arrival in the  United States\u2014the goal of the ISF program\u2014we reviewed quarterly  performance assessments on CBP\u2019s identification of high-risk shipments  using ISF data. We reviewed quarterly performance for calendar years  2013 through 2015 because these 3 years contained sufficient data  against which to measure the performance of the algorithm CBP uses to  identify high-risk shipments. As described later, we were not able to  determine the direct effect of ISF data on the identification of high-risk  shipments because there are a variety of factors besides ISF data that  affect a shipment\u2019s risk score. We discussed with CBP officials their plans  for assessing the ISF program consistent with requirements that call for  CBP to conduct a retrospective review of the rule. We interviewed CBP  officials and targeters at the five ATUs we visited to obtain insight on how  CBP targeters use ISF rule data to help assess the risk of arriving cargo  shipments. We also discussed targeting strategies using ISF rule data  with targeters at the five ATUs we visited. To examine the extent to which  ISF data used for targeting may be accurate, we analyzed the ISF data  for calendar years 2012 through 2015 to assess the accuracy of country  of origin data submitted to CBP.

For example, late submission of an ISF- 10 can result in a $5,000 LDC, while late filing of a vessel stow plan can  result in a $50,000 LDC. From May 2014 through June 2016, before  imposing a LDC on an importer, an ATU had to document three prior  violations, give a warning to the importer for each violation, and obtain  CBP headquarters\u2019 approval. In June 2016, CBP authorized ATUs to  issue LDCs to importers without documenting three prior violations or  obtaining headquarters\u2019 approval. LDCs for carriers still require  headquarters\u2019 approval but do not require an ATU to document three prior  violations. From 2013 through 2015, ATUs issued 67 LDCs to 20  importers and 12 carriers (see figure 6).", "While CBP generally enforces the ISF rule requirements to submit an  ISF-10 and vessel stow plan, it has not enforced the requirement that  carriers submit CSMs. None of the targeters at the ATUs we visited had  initiated any enforcement action (i.e., issued an LDC) against carriers for  not submitting CSMs, and we found no instances of an LDC issued for  CSM noncompliance in our analysis of CBP\u2019s enforcement data.  According to CBP policy, CBP\u2019s enforcement strategy is designed to  maximize importers\u2019 and carriers\u2019 compliance with the ISF rule, which  requires carriers to submit CSMs to CBP no later than 24 hours after the  CSM is entered into the carrier\u2019s equipment tracking system. Targeters  at four of the five ATUs we visited said that CSMs are useful when  assessing the risk of arriving shipments because they provide a detailed  history of containers\u2019 movements. For example, targeters can see if a  container was routed in an unusual way or transited a high-risk location.", "Officials at CBP headquarters told us that ATUs do not have enough  resources to issue an LDC for each case of CSM noncompliance  because of the very high volume of CSMs\u2014as many as 30 million per  month\u2014that CBP receives. Officials at one ATU also told us they do not  enforce the CSM requirement because CSMs are often out of date.  Although it may not be feasible to determine every instance of CSM  noncompliance, targeters may identify cases of noncompliance when  reviewing CSMs for containers of interest as they target. For example, a  targeter at one ATU reviewed a container that had arrived at the port from  Guatemala in late April 2016, but the most recent CSM for the container  was from early March 2016. Therefore, according to the targeter, CBP  likely did not receive the most recent messages from the carrier. CBP  could issue LDCs when targeters identify CSM noncompliance during the  targeting process. By enforcing the CSM requirement when targeters  identify noncompliance, carriers would have a greater incentive to submit  all CSMs, thus providing CBP targeters with more comprehensive  information that could help them better assess the risk of cargo shipments  arriving at U.S. ports\u2014the key goal of the ISF program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Our Analysis Shows an Association between the Use of Holds and Increased ISF-10 Submission Rates, and Submission Rates Varied Across Ports Using Different Enforcement Methods", "paragraphs": ["Using CBP data on ISF holds and ISF-10 submission rates, we analyzed  how CBP\u2019s use of holds as an enforcement method was associated with  ISF-10 submission rates during calendar years 2012 through 2015. Our  analysis found that, nationally, the ISF-10 submission rate increased after  July 9, 2013, when CBP began its period of full enforcement of the ISF  rule and ATUs increased their use of ISF holds (see appendixes I and  II). Nationally, the ISF-10 submission rate was about 1.7 percentage  points higher on the 30th day after CBP began full enforcement,  compared to the day before the policy change. Further, our analysis of  CBP data found that ISF-10 submission rates varied across individual  ports overseen by ATUs that primarily used LDCs or did not use any  enforcement method. Submission rates at the two ports overseen by the  ATU that used the most LDCs and comparatively few ISF holds of the  ATUs we visited, remained relatively consistent at about 95 percentage  points before and after July 9, 2013. Additionally, the ISF-10 submission  rates at these ports were lower at various times from July 2013 through  2015 in our analysis, when compared to the rates at the ports overseen  by the other four ATUs we visited. Similarly, the ISF-10 submission rate at  the port overseen by an ATU we visited that generally did not take any  enforcement actions against noncompliant importers was consistently  lower, by approximately 2 to 15 percentage points, than the rates at the  ports overseen by the other four ATUs we visited. Nevertheless,  submission rates at this ATU increased after July 9, 2013, when CBP  began full enforcement, similar to the patterns at the ports with the  highest submission rates overseen by three of the ATUs we visited. This  increase in submission rates after full enforcement began, without the  ATU\u2019s explicit use of holds, suggests that CBP\u2019s broader enforcement  policy may have had an implicit deterrent effect."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CBP Has Not Assessed the Effects of Its Enforcement Actions to Maximize Compliance", "paragraphs": ["CBP officials said CBP has not assessed the effects of its enforcement  actions\u2014ISF holds and LDCs\u2014including how its enforcement strategy  could be used to maximize importers\u2019 and carriers\u2019 compliance with the  ISF rule.

However,  submission rates vary at individual ports overseen by ATUs that enforce  the ISF requirement differently. Some ATUs use holds and others use a  combination of holds and LDCs. ATUs also use different criteria for when  they place a hold on a noncompliant shipment or issue an LDC. Some  ATUs place holds on shipments without an ISF 24 hours before the  vessel arrives at the U.S. port, while other ATUs place holds on  shipments 48 or 72 hours before the vessel arrives at the port. Further,  ATUs apply different consequences to holds, such as using the hold to  take an image of a container\u2019s contents or physically inspecting the  contents of a shipment.", "According to CBP policy, the objective of CBP\u2019s enforcement strategy is  to maximize importers\u2019 and carriers\u2019 compliance with the ISF rule.  However, officials said that CBP has not assessed whether its  enforcement actions are helping achieve the agency\u2019s objective of  maximizing compliance, particularly among those ports with relatively low  compliance rates. For example, officials said CBP has not conducted an  evaluation to determine whether a particular enforcement action or  consequence of that action is more effective than another. CBP officials  said that compliance is already high, with an average national ISF-10  submission rate of about 99 percent. While the national submission rate is  high, some ATUs oversee ports with relatively low submission rates. It is  possible that submission rates might have been higher at individual ports  if CBP had used different enforcement approaches. In a previous report,  we reviewed various methods of evaluating programs and found that  program evaluations may be needed to examine the extent to which  programs are achieving their objectives.

We discussed with CBP officials different types  of evaluations, such as case studies of individual ports, that would be  feasible for it to conduct to evaluate ATUs\u2019 different enforcement  methods. An evaluation of the effectiveness of its enforcement actions  could help inform CBP\u2019s enforcement strategy and increase compliance  at ports with relatively low ISF-10 submission rates.

However, we  identified examples of additional information CBP could collect to better  evaluate the program\u2019s effectiveness. When assessing the risk of U.S.- bound cargo shipments, CBP relies, in part, on the use of ATS, as  described earlier. In January 2011, CBP incorporated ISF data into ATS\u2019s  maritime national security weight set and since 2011 CBP staff have  assessed the performance of the updated weight set against a  performance target on a quarterly basis. The results of these  assessments show that in 11 of the 12 quarters during calendar years  2013 through 2015, the maritime national security weight set performed  better than a random inspection of shipments in identifying contraband.  However, determining the direct effect of ISF data on the identification of  high-risk shipments is not always possible because a shipment\u2019s risk  score could be based on a variety of factors other than ISF data. As a  result, it is difficult to know the full effect of ISF data alone in identifying  shipments that ultimately contained contraband.", "According to CBP targeters we spoke with, for shipments that ATS  identified as high-risk, having the ISF data early in the targeting process,  such as names and addresses, and more specific descriptions of cargo  than what a manifest provides, helps them better research shipments.  Also, some targeters we spoke with have used the ISF data to conduct  discretionary targeting and identify shipments for examination that were  not already identified by ATS as high risk. According to CBP, vessel stow  plans also help CBP assess shipment risk by allowing CBP to identify  unmanifested containers\u2014containers and their associated contents not  listed on a vessel\u2019s manifest\u2014that pose a security risk in that no  information is known about their origin or contents. CBP prepares daily  reports identifying unmanifested containers arriving in the United States.  Further, according to CBP, CSMs help with shipment risk assessments by  providing CBP with information about containers\u2019 movements and their  status (i.e., empty or full) that could indicate heightened security risks.", "While CBP officials told us it is difficult to evaluate the direct impact of ISF  rule data in identifying high-risk shipments, collecting additional  performance information could help CBP assess and demonstrate  whether ISF rule data are contributing to the program\u2019s goals. In our 2012  report addressing different types of evaluations for answering varied  questions about program performance, we found that a good evaluation  design should identify data sources and collection procedures to obtain  relevant, credible information to determine how well a program is  working. CBP, according to ISF program officials, has not evaluated the  effectiveness of the program because it believes that compliance is  already quite high, including a 99 percent submission rate for ISF-10s.", "Although submission rates can be helpful in determining the extent to  which the required ISF data are being provided to CBP, it is important to  also demonstrate how or whether the ISF rule data are actually achieving  the broader program goal of improving CBP\u2019s ability to assess cargo  shipments\u2019 risks. For example, tracking the number of unmanifested  containers that ATUs discover as a result of reviewing vessel stow plans  could better reflect one benefit of the program. Additionally, identifying  instances in which ATUs discover or seize contraband as a result of  targeters reviewing ISF rule data when conducting discretionary targeting  would provide CBP with examples of how the data result in the  identification of high-risk shipments.
