The allocation process for HUD-VASH vouchers is a  collaborative approach that relies on three sets of data to determine  geographic need: HUD point-in-time data on homeless veterans needing  services in the area, VAMC data on the number of contacts with  homeless veterans, and performance data from PHAs and VAMCs.  Based on this analysis of geographic need (adjusted by the number of  vouchers received in previous years\u2019 allocations), HUD and VA identify  communities that should receive VASH vouchers. The agencies then  determine the exact number to allocate in proportion with each  community\u2019s level of need. VA then identifies VAMCs from these  communities to participate in HUD-VASH, taking into account VA\u2019s case  management resources. HUD considers a PHA\u2019s administrative  performance and in consultation with VA identifies PHAs located in the  jurisdiction of the VAMCs and invites them to apply for HUD-VASH  vouchers.

A  dishonorable discharge generally disqualifies an individual from  receiving VA benefits.", "Case management: According to VAMC staff, a psychosocial  assessment, which evaluates the veteran\u2019s clinical and service needs,  helps them to determine an appropriate level of case management for  each veteran. This involves considering whether the veteran has (1)  complex service needs or health conditions, such as serious mental  illness or substance use disorder; (2) nonchronic service needs that  could be overcome or managed with treatment; or (3) few or minor  service needs and is employable. Prior to enrollment in HUD-VASH,  each veteran must agree to participate in case management.  According to VA guidance, case managers must document the  veteran\u2019s HUD-VASH enrollment using a HOMES form. For veterans  who do not enter the program, the form lists reasons the veteran did  not enter, including the veteran\u2019s refusal to agree with the terms of the  program (case management). In Los Angeles, New York, Washington,  D.C., and Wyoming, VAMC staff explained that they required veterans  to sign a case management agreement. VA officials told us that this  was a local management practice rather than a requirement based on  the HUD-VASH handbook. Following enrollment, the case manager  and the veteran work together to develop an individualized treatment  plan with goals that are revisited over the course of the veteran\u2019s  participation in HUD-VASH.

However, several VAMC  staff told us that VA makes every effort to re-engage veterans in case  management before proceeding with termination for nonparticipation. If  VA determines that the veteran no longer requires case management  services, the veteran may continue to receive the HUD-VASH housing  subsidy. In such cases, the VA case manager should notify the PHA that  case management is no longer required but that the veteran\u2019s eligibility  for a housing voucher remains unchanged. If the PHA has a voucher  available in its regular section 8 program, the PHA can offer that voucher  to the veteran and make the HUD-VASH voucher available to another  homeless veteran.", "As previously noted, VA refers veterans who meet its requirements for  HUD-VASH to PHAs, subject to voucher availability. The HUD-VASH  handbook requires that if there are no available case management  openings or vouchers, HUD-VASH program staff place the veteran on an  interest list. According to VA, this list consists of all individuals who have  been in contact with HUD-VASH staff and expressed interest in the  program. These persons are subsequently screened for eligibility and a  determination is made regarding acceptance. If a veteran is not eligible  but vouchers are available, staff would make a referral to other VA or  community resources.

For example, up to 80 days may  elapse from the time a PHA must submit VMS data to the time that  VMS information is available for analysis. According to VA, the  agency typically has provided Dashboard data to Congress within 50  days after the end of each reporting month.", "HUD\u2019s VMS and VA\u2019s Dashboard data are comparable when veteran  participation is categorized by location; however, these respective data  sources are not tied to personally identifying information.

According to VA officials, once  VA fully implements new reporting mechanisms, HOMES data will enable  VA to provide summary status reports and identify information for veteran  records used to create the summary totals. Further, they said that the  agreement will allow VA to provide HUD with HUD-VASH data including  the participating VAMC and PHA, and personally identifying information  for each veteran. According to HUD officials, HUD intends to compare  these records with PIC data (which include personally identifying  information) and then the agencies plan to coordinate with field offices to  resolve discrepancies. As of June 2012, the information-sharing  agreement was under review. The agencies expected to complete final  revisions to the agreement by June 25, 2012 and execute the agreement  by August 2012. If VA fully implements HOMES as a data source for  reporting purposes and the agencies execute the agreement as planned,  it would allow the agencies to match case records in the event of data  discrepancies. Although the agreement is not expected to affect VA\u2019s  monthly report submissions to Congress, according to the agencies, the  information-sharing agreement should further improve their ability to  validate HUD-VASH data on an ongoing basis."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "HUD-VASH Data Show the Program Has Moved Veterans into Housing", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "HUD-VASH Performance", "paragraphs": ["Information VA reports for the HUD-VASH program has focused on  voucher utilization (such as the number of veterans housed), but HOMES  is supposed to provide VA with additional data on veteran outcomes.

Nearly 31,200 veterans lived in HUD-VASH-supported  housing as of March 28, 2012; veterans in housing represented about 83  percent of the vouchers authorized under the program. In addition, PHAs  issued 4,046 vouchers to veterans who were actively seeking a lease and  VAMCs reserved 620 vouchers for veterans undergoing PHA validation  as of the same date. According to VA, the department\u2019s goal is for  veterans in housing to represent at least 88 percent of authorized HUD- VASH vouchers by September 30, 2012.

For  VAMCs further from the goal, such as the Sheridan VAMC in Wyoming  (70 percent in housing), challenges with getting veterans placed in  housing may be related to local housing markets. For example, Sheridan  VAMC staff told us that there was a lack of affordable housing in the area.  Similarly, staff at Greater Los Angeles Health Care System (79 percent in  housing) told us that suitable housing stock (meeting program  requirements for cost and housing quality) was limited, particularly in the  West Los Angeles area where the VAMC facility is located. VA data show  that both VAMCs had assigned 100 percent of their authorized vouchers  to a veteran as of March 2012. However, nearly 30 percent of the  Sheridan VAMC\u2019s vouchers and 21 percent of the Greater Los Angeles  Health Care System\u2019s vouchers were assigned to veterans actively  seeking housing at that time.

The study compared results  for 105 HUD-VASH vouchers set aside for Housing First and 70  vouchers that followed VA\u2019s usual treatment process. VA found that,  under Housing First, veteran placement into housing took, on  average, 35 days from admission, compared with 223 days under the  usual treatment process. Additionally, under Housing First, a reduced  proportion of veterans had used emergency room and inpatient  mental health services, and the housing retention rate was 98 percent  after 1 year, compared with 86 percent under the usual treatment  process. The pilot was expanded to 13 additional sites in fiscal year  2012, with VA and HUD monitoring for 3 years.

According to  VA, within the sample, 37 percent of exits were positive, 23 percent  were negative, 30 percent were neutral, and there were insufficient  data for 10 percent of exits. VA officials told us that VA and HUD will  work together to conduct a more in-depth study of veterans leaving  the program for adverse reasons to identify the major factors involved.  The officials informed us that as of March 2012, the departments were  in the process of obtaining OMB approval to follow up with veterans  who had left HUD-VASH.", "VA has launched a 3-site research study comparing the effectiveness  of four different intervention methods for veterans with substance use  disorders and mental health problems. Methods tested will include  standard case management, intensive case management, tele- coaching, and electronic interactive practices.

VA\u2019s current  monthly reports, which show the number of veterans housed under the  program, do not address housing stability. However, VA\u2019s October 2011  report to Congress gave some indication of general voucher turnover and  housing tenure.

As previously noted, for fiscal year  2012, VA\u2019s goal is for VAMCs to refer veterans accepted into HUD-VASH  to the PHA within 15 days of acceptance into the program. However, PHA  staff discussed challenges associated with receiving timely HUD-VASH  referrals from the partnering VAMC, particularly at the beginning of a new  allocation year. In 9 of the 10 locations, PHA staff told us that delayed  referrals from VA slowed the voucher utilization process. While PHAs  generally can begin accepting referrals once HUD awards the vouchers,  delayed referrals from VA extended the time frame between a PHA  receiving the vouchers and getting the voucher holder into housing. Staff  at King County Housing Authority in Seattle suggested that VA\u2019s initial  delay in making HUD-VASH referrals was related to VA needing to hire  and assign case managers, while HUD could move quickly to pass  funding on to the PHAs to issue vouchers. Staff at two VAMCs  acknowledged the challenge in making initial referrals to the PHA. In one  location, the staff explained that to provide an adequate number of case  managers, they would need to know how many new vouchers had been  added and, therefore, how many new HUD-VASH veterans they would  need to serve. Moreover, once new case managers were hired, they had  to undergo training and orientation, resulting in additional delays. Staff in  several PHA locations noted that VAMC referral time frames had been  improving.", "HUD-VASH case manager workload. VA\u2019s goal is to have a ratio of 1  case manager to 25 veterans. However, when we contacted VAMCs in  January and February 2012, several VAMC staff told us that some case  managers had 40 or more cases, as the following examples illustrate:  In South Dakota, staff at the Meade County Housing and  Redevelopment Commission expressed general concern that the  workload for the case manager serving their area may have been  unreasonable or otherwise impractical. According to staff at Black  Hills Health Care System, which partners with the housing authority,  the case manager assigned to Meade County and other locations  managed 51 cases in total.", "Similarly, case managers at James A. Haley VAMC in Tampa had  between 45 and 50 cases. Staff at the Tampa Housing Authority told  us that more intensive case management could reduce or eliminate  veteran terminations from HUD-VASH due to nonpayment or other  violations of the housing agreement.", "Staff at Greater Los Angeles Health Care System told us that efforts  were under way to reduce their average caseload of 45 per case  manager. The facility was accepting applications for additional case  managers and also planning to contract with an external entity to  supplement case management services.", "VA has made efforts to address staffing at its VAMCs, and when we later  contacted two of the VAMCs identified with challenges, the staff told us  that hiring additional case managers had reduced their caseloads  significantly. Additionally, VA provided us with a report on HUD-VASH  program hiring as of February 29, 2012. The report showed that 95  percent of program positions across all VISNs were filled. Among the  VAMCs we contacted, the percentage of HUD-VASH positions filled  ranged from 50 percent to 100 percent. Case managers represent the  majority of HUD-VASH positions, but some facilities have also hired  clinical supervisors, substance use disorder specialists, peer support and  housing specialists, and other program support staff.", "Identifying housing for veterans. Staff at VAMCs in several locations  told us that veterans experienced challenges with finding housing. In  Wyoming, the VAMC staff explained that the market for affordable  housing was tight in Casper and Sheridan, areas served by the VAMC.  Additionally, they said that the partnering PHA that served Sheridan  recently reduced the maximum allowable housing assistance payment  from $595 to $571 and this amount limited access to decent housing in  the area. The staff added that many landlords also have been reluctant to  rent to veterans with criminal histories. VAMC staff in South Dakota  similarly noted that a partnering PHA had decreased the housing  allowance for the area it served while some landlords had increased their  rents. They explained that they used communications with a local  homeless coalition, community stakeholders, and landlords to identify  options for affordable housing. At Greater Los Angeles Health Care  System, the staff told us that a housing specialist had been hired and kept  staff informed of new housing stock while working with developers and  realtors to identify suitable housing. According to the VAMC staff, the  housing specialist also has conducted outreach to educate landlords on  HUD-VASH and advocate for veterans, making them aware that case  management will be available to HUD-VASH tenants.", "Move-in resources for veterans. Both PHA and VAMC staff discussed  challenges veterans experience accessing the funds and household items  that they needed to move in once they found a suitable housing unit. In  some instances, veterans were delayed in moving into their units because  of a lack of available funds to pay rental application fees, security  deposits for rent or utilities, and the first month\u2019s rent. Such delays could  affect VA\u2019s goal for placing veterans into housing within 100 days of being  accepted into the program.", "The availability of resources to help veterans varied among locations, but  generally was more limited outside of larger cities. Two of the 10 locations  had a consistent source that could provide this type of assistance to  veterans. For example, New York City has a Department of Homeless  Services that provides a range of services to homeless individuals.  Through this entity, HUD-VASH veterans could receive assistance with  security deposits, first month\u2019s rent, and household items. In Seattle,  HUD-VASH veterans could access a limited-term Human Services and  Veterans Levy that assisted veterans, military personnel and their  families, and others in need through a variety of housing and supportive  services. In other locations, VAMC and PHA staff told us that veterans  had relied on local public or nonprofit assistance and on Homeless  Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program funds that were temporarily  provided under the Recovery Act. Additionally, several said that they  hoped veterans would be able to use funds that would be provided under  the new Supportive Services for Veteran Families grant program.Homeless Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program funds are no  longer available and the other sources mentioned, according to the staff,  often were insufficient or were not guaranteed.", "In some locations, the VAMC staff had developed other approaches to  mitigating this challenge for veterans. For example, at several facilities,  including Greater Los Angeles Health Care System, Black Hills Health  Care System in South Dakota, and Washington, D.C. VAMC, the staff  explained that they solicited landlords\u2019 cooperation in waiving or  spreading out up-front fees. Additionally, staff at White River Junction  VAMC in Vermont had developed a handbook for veterans participating in  VA\u2019s homeless programs that included a community resources guide.  They explained that the guide was included to assist veterans with  obtaining furniture, household items, and other resources they needed to  move into housing.", "In April 2012, HUD released a best practices document that included  practices submitted by PHAs and VAMCs that administer HUD-VASH.  According to HUD, the purpose of the document is to share effective  strategies for administering HUD-VASH and highlight the efforts of  specific sites and other partners. According to HUD officials, VA was  involved in soliciting best practices from VAMCs and reviewed the  document that HUD developed. HUD intends to revise the document over  time. While the document was developed from the housing standpoint, it  includes information on strategies for carrying out procedures pertaining  to general PHA and VAMC management. More specifically, it describes  the ways in which individual sites have addressed specific challenges  such as those identified previously. For example, in addition to the Los  Angeles VAMC hiring a housing specialist, the document described other  facilities\u2019 efforts to direct veterans to suitable housing by contracting with  a nonprofit housing referral organization, maintaining a list of potential  housing options in the VAMC\u2019s service area, and conducting targeted  landlord outreach. Similarly, several PHAs had established a loan fund or  trust fund to assist veterans with move-in costs, and one PHA applied for  county Community Development Block Grant funds to assist veterans  with security and utility deposits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Advocacy Organizations Generally Shared Positive Views of HUD-VASH and Also Suggested Program Improvements", "paragraphs": ["Advocates for veterans and the homeless that we contacted generally  agreed that HUD-VASH was essential in helping homeless veterans to  access housing and long-term treatment. Representatives at one of the  organizations stated that the long-term housing HUD-VASH provides was  crucial to addressing the immediate and long-term needs of homeless  individuals and that combining case management with housing was  appropriate for veterans with the most significant problems. Additionally,  representatives at two organizations told us that HUD and VA sharing a  common strategic goal had been beneficial and that program  administrators had been responsive to the HUD-VASH community.  Moreover, they noted that the program\u2019s administration had improved  over time. Specifically, they explained that VA had been willing to make  changes to improve HUD-VASH, including in terms of leadership.", "The advocates offered suggestions for improving the HUD-VASH  program, including the following.", "One advocate suggested that the program should continue to target  those with the greatest need for assistance and explore flexibility for  service delivery mechanisms, including having case managers  conduct more work in communities and outside of the traditional  VAMC appointment approach. Related to this point, recently the  Veterans Health Administration Homeless Program National Director  noted that VA was taking steps to have more of a presence in the  community. This included hiring HUD-VASH case managers living in  communities where veterans were being served and seeking more  opportunities to have case managers co-located with community- based organizations.", "A second advocate thought it would be useful to remove the section 8  limits on project-based housing under HUD-VASH to allow developers  to allocate portions of higher-quality, mixed-use developments for  project-based HUD-VASH vouchers. The representative explained  that this would be particularly helpful in locales with limited affordable  housing and in areas that are desirable (particularly for female  veterans with dependent children). HUD officials clarified that PHAs  can make the case to HUD to have funding for project-based HUD- VASH vouchers exceed the voucher budget authority limit of 20  percent. According to HUD officials, exceeding the limit must be tied  to effective administration of HUD-VASH, and HUD had not received  any such requests as of May 2012.", "A third advocate expressed that VA should increase its outreach to  veteran service organizations to advertise to veterans who may not be  participating in VA programs. VA officials told us that VA has a  national outreach initiative under way that includes collaborating with  veteran service organizations to make information on HUD-VASH and  other VA programs more readily available.", "Finally, a fourth advocate emphasized that sufficient resources  needed to be committed to HUD-VASH in support of the goal of  ending veteran homelessness.

In addition, we reviewed  federal strategic plans that address veteran homelessness to obtain  information on VA\u2019s and HUD\u2019s goals related to reducing veteran  homelessness. We interviewed officials at the Veterans Health  Administration within VA and in HUD\u2019s Office of Public and Indian  Housing and Office of Community Planning and Development. We  reviewed VA and HUD Office of Inspector General reports pertaining to  HUD-VASH and our previous reports. We selected a purposive, non- representative sample of 10 locations in which to interview management  and staff at VA medical centers (VAMC) and their partnering public  housing agencies (PHA) (see fig. 4). Results of these interviews cannot  be projected to other VAMCs or PHAs. We selected the 10 locations (9  states and the District of Columbia) based on several criteria, including a  significant presence of homeless veterans in and a large allocation of  HUD-VASH vouchers to the state, identified best practices or challenges  in administering the HUD-VASH program, and geographic diversity. To  obtain information on the presence of homeless veterans by state, we  reviewed the jointly developed veteran supplements to HUD\u2019s 2009 and  2010 Annual Homeless Assessment Reports to Congress. We used  information from HUD on annual HUD-VASH voucher allocations by PHA  and partnering VAMC for fiscal years 2008 through 2010.", "To address our first objective, we reviewed eligibility requirements in the  HUD-VASH statute to assess how VA and HUD are to determine that  veterans who participate in HUD-VASH meet the statutory eligibility  criteria. We also reviewed requirements specific to VA in the Veterans  Health Administration\u2019s HUD-VASH handbook and a HUD-VASH  resource guide developed by the National Center for Homelessness  among Veterans. To obtain specific information on how VA screened  veterans to determine if they were eligible for the program, we  interviewed VAMC management and staff in the selected 10 locations.  The centers are responsible for screening and evaluating veterans for  acceptance into HUD-VASH, referring veterans to partnering PHAs, and  coordinating veterans\u2019 case management under HUD-VASH. Similarly, to  obtain more specific information on how PHAs (following HUD\u2019s  procedures) screened veterans referred by partnering VAMCs, we  interviewed management and staff at PHAs that partner with the 10  VAMCs to assess veterans and also manage various aspects of the  housing process. In our interviews with VAMC and PHA staff, we asked  about their general procedures for administering HUD-VASH, including  how they made eligibility determinations based on VA\u2019s requirements and  HUD\u2019s guidelines, respectively. We also discussed cooperation at the  local level between partnering VAMCs and PHAs.", "To address our second objective, we reviewed program manuals and  guidance on data that VA and HUD collect on HUD-VASH, their data  collection mechanisms, and reliability controls. We interviewed VA and  HUD officials to determine what HUD-VASH information the agencies  report and the systems they use for collecting and reporting the related  data. We obtained and reviewed selected monthly Dashboard-based  reports that VA provided to Congress during fiscal years 2011 and 2012  to identify the data elements typically reported for HUD-VASH; we  reviewed VA program data through March 2012. While VA provides  monthly voucher utilization reports to Congress, HUD reports to Congress  on HUD-VASH only upon request. To identify the steps that VA takes to  help ensure the reliability of its data, we interviewed knowledgeable VA  officials about the purpose, structure, and quality controls used to capture  or report HUD-VASH program data using VA\u2019s Dashboard and HOMES.
