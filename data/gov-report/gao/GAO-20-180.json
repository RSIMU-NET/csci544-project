For example, for fiscal years 2018 and 2019, NNSA used separate work breakdown structures\u2014a method of dividing a project into successive levels of detail\u2014to collect data for some offices. Without a common work breakdown structure, NNSA cannot ensure that it can collect reliable financial data across its sites. NNSA plans to assess the feasibility of implementing a common work breakdown structure, in response to GAO's January 2019 recommendation.

At most sites, the M&O contractors track their financial data in a way that does not align with how NNSA requests the contractors report the data. M&O contractors use professional judgment to crosswalk, or map, the financial data from their business systems to the NNSA structures to report the data. NNSA's data quality checks on the M&O contractors' financial data focus on data formatting and ensuring the data match the agency's accounting system. NNSA does not have a process to verify whether the contractors accurately crosswalk their financial data. Under NNSA's financial integration policy, the program director for financial integration is to, among other things, execute a plan to improve cost analysis, comparability, and reporting consistency among programs and M&O contractors. By developing an internal process for NNSA to verify how the M&O contractors crosswalk their financial data to the work breakdown structures, NNSA will have better assurance that it is collecting accurate financial data that are comparable across the M&O contractors, that satisfy the needs of Congress and other stakeholders, and that address long-term issues with its ability to report the total costs of its programs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making four recommendations, including that NNSA implement an internal process to verify the M&O contractors' crosswalks of their financial data to NNSA's work breakdown structures for reporting information.

However, this has resulted in NNSA and Congress having difficulty  understanding the total costs of NNSA\u2019s programs\u2014especially programs  for which work is conducted at multiple sites\u2014and comparing costs  across its contractors. As we have emphasized, effective management  and oversight of the contracts, projects, and programs that support  NNSA\u2019s mission are dependent upon the availability of enterprise-wide  cost information that is accurate and reliable. This information is needed  to, among other things, identify the costs of activities and ensure the  validity of NNSA\u2019s cost estimates.

To address this issue, the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2014 required NNSA to develop and submit to Congress a  plan for improving and integrating financial management of the nuclear  security enterprise. NNSA submitted its plan in February 2016, and in  January 2017 we found the plan did not provide the framework needed to  guide NNSA\u2019s effort to improve and integrate financial management of the  nuclear security enterprise. Subsequently, the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 required NNSA to implement  common financial reporting, to the extent practicable, for the nuclear  security enterprise by December 23, 2020. According to the act, the  common financial reporting system is to include the following:  1.  common data reporting requirements, including reporting of financial  data by standardized labor categories, labor hours, functional  elements, and cost elements;  2.  a common work breakdown structure; and  3.  definitions and methodologies for identifying and reporting costs for  programs of record and base capabilities.", "According to NNSA\u2019s financial integration policy, the purpose of the  agency\u2019s common financial reporting effort is to collect standardized  financial management data; increase transparency of financial  accountability; and improve cost analysis, comparability, and reporting  consistency among programs and M&O contractors. The policy also  states that the program director for financial integration is to manage and  coordinate all NNSA activities to meet National Defense Authorization Act  requirements, develop and maintain clear and consistent reporting  requirements, analyze enterprise-wide financial data using leading  business best practices, and monitor the effects of financial integration,  among other responsibilities.

NNSA also  executes portions of its missions across several other DOE sites, such as  the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Washington and the Oak  Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. At this time, NNSA\u2019s common  financial reporting efforts are focused on the eight sites, as required by  the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017.", "NNSA\u2019s sites are owned by the federal government but managed and  operated by M&O contractors. According to DOE, the use of M&O  contracts is supported by an underlying principle: the federal government  employs highly capable companies and educational institutions to  manage and operate government-owned or -controlled scientific,  engineering, and production facilities because these companies and  educational institutions have greater flexibility than the government in  bringing scientific and technical skills to bear. As we previously found, an  M&O contract is characterized by, among other things, a close  relationship between the government and the contractor for conducting  work of a long-term and continuing nature.", "To support its missions, NNSA is organized into program offices that  oversee the agency\u2019s numerous programs. For example, the Office of  Defense Programs oversees the B61-12 Life Extension Program, and  the Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation oversees the Nuclear  Smuggling Detection and Deterrence Program.

NNSA is required to follow Managerial Cost Accounting  Standards. The principal purpose of Managerial Cost Accounting  Standards is to determine the full cost of delivering a program or output to  allow an organization to assess the reasonableness of this cost or to  establish a baseline for comparison. The standards state that federal  agencies should accumulate and report the costs of their activities on a  regular basis for management information purposes. The standards also  state that agencies should allow flexibility for agency managers to  develop costing methods that are best suited to their operational  environment. Such information is important to Congress and to NNSA  managers as they make decisions about allocating federal resources,  authorizing and modifying programs, and evaluating program  performance. Separate standards\u2014referred to as federal Cost  Accounting Standards\u2014govern how NNSA\u2019s M&O contractors structure  and account for their costs. Federal Cost Accounting Standards provide  direction for the consistent and equitable distribution of a contractor\u2019s  costs to help federal agencies more accurately determine the actual costs  of their contracts and the contractor\u2019s costs associated with specific  projects and programs.", "To comply with federal Cost Accounting Standards, M&O contractors  classify costs as either direct or indirect when they allocate these costs to  programs. Direct costs are assigned to the benefitting program or  programs. Indirect costs\u2014costs that cannot be assigned to a particular  program, such as costs for administration and site support\u2014are to be  accumulated, or grouped, into indirect cost pools. The contractor is to  estimate the amount of indirect costs to distribute to each program  (accumulated into indirect cost pools) and make adjustments by the end  of the fiscal year to reflect actual costs. The contractor is then to distribute  these costs proportionally across all programs based on a rate in  accordance with the contractor\u2019s cost allocation model. The final program  cost is the sum of the total direct costs plus the indirect costs distributed  to the program.", "In implementing these allocation methods, federal Cost Accounting  Standards provide contractors with flexibility regarding the extent to which  they identify incurred costs directly with a specific program and how they  collect similar costs into indirect cost pools and allocate them among  programs. Therefore, different contractors may allocate similar costs  differently because the contractors\u2019 cost allocation models differ\u2014that is,  a cost classified as an indirect cost at one site may be classified as a  direct cost at another. Because each contractor can allocate similar  indirect costs differently and contractors may change the way they  allocate indirect costs over time, it is difficult to compare contractors\u2019  costs among sites and accurately calculate total program costs when  work for a program is conducted at multiple sites.", "The seven NNSA M&O contractors and NNSA\u2019s program offices account  for and track costs differently. We previously found that NNSA\u2019s M&O  contractors have historically developed their own processes to manage  and track costs for work at each site even when their work contributes to  the same program. These processes have generally differed from the  ones NNSA program offices have developed to describe the scope of its  programs. This makes it difficult for NNSA and others to track and  compare costs for analogous activities across programs, contractors, and  sites. For example, in May 2018, we found that NNSA\u2019s work breakdown  structure for the B61-12 Life Extension Program and its $7.6 billion cost  estimate (at that time) did not include $648 million in activities that were  undertaken by other NNSA programs, such as research and  development, test and evaluation activities, and infrastructure elements.", "Leading practices for developing work breakdown structures state that a  work breakdown structure should include all activities that contribute to a  program\u2019s end product, and should not treat contributing activities  separately.", "DOE\u2019s and NNSA\u2019s financial management and accounting system\u2014the  Standard Accounting and Reporting System (STARS)\u2014provides budget  execution, financial accounting, and financial reporting capabilities for the  department. STARS is also integrated with other agency systems for  procurement, funds distribution, travel, and human resources. The M&O  contractors\u2019 financial systems must be able to directly provide cost reports  to NNSA\u2019s financial management system. The primary source of cost  data contained in STARS comes from summary-level cost reports  provided by M&O contractors, which they report for NNSA\u2019s  appropriations at the budget and reporting code level. Program offices  access STARS financial data through the DOE Office of the Chief  Financial Officer\u2019s integrated data warehouse. While financial data  collected through STARS represent DOE\u2019s official financial data, the data  are not detailed and therefore may not satisfy the information needs of  NNSA\u2019s program offices. For example, STARS financial data do not  differentiate labor costs from other programmatic costs, nor do they  provide detailed information about the costs of activities that contribute to  program costs. In addition, according to M&O contractor representatives,  if one M&O contractor provides funding to another contractor, such as to  conduct testing, NNSA does not have the ability in STARS to identify that  funding was transferred.", "In the absence of an automated managerial cost accounting system that  collects data from financial systems and relevant operating systems to  consistently and uniformly produce useful cost information, NNSA\u2019s  program offices developed various systems, tools, and spreadsheets to  track relevant cost information. Specifically, NNSA\u2019s program offices  separately collect cost information from M&O contractors that is more  detailed than costs reported through STARS. Collecting these data  requires M&O contractors to map, or \u201ccrosswalk,\u201d their cost data to the  work breakdown structures of one or more of NNSA\u2019s program offices.  Some program offices collect financial data through ad hoc data calls,  rather than regular data calls. Some tools the program offices use include  program management systems or spreadsheets designed to meet each  program office\u2019s programmatic, budgetary, and project requirements. For  example, the Office of Defense Programs built the Enterprise Portfolio  Analysis Tool in 2007 to capture financial data from the M&O contractors  for its programs.", "Also, in 2007, officials from the Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation  developed a program management system designed to integrate and  manage data such as scope, schedule, budget, and cost at the program  level with greater detail than the data in STARS. The Office of Safety,  Infrastructure, and Operations later adopted this system and called it the  G2 program management system. M&O contractors use the G2 system  to upload crosswalks of financial data for those program offices\u2019 work  breakdown structures after the costs were incurred. This process allows  M&O contractors to report detailed financial data to the respective  program offices every month. The process to track cost information is  different for each program office and depends on the tool used and the  information collected. However, for all program offices the process to  track cost information is in addition to the financial reporting that M&O  contractors provide for STARS (see fig. 2)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NNSA\u2019s Approach to Implementing Common Financial Reporting", "paragraphs": ["To implement common financial reporting and standardize financial  reporting by the M&O contractors across programs and sites, NNSA is  pursuing an approach in which the agency collects M&O contractors\u2019  financial data in a common reporting framework using an NNSA-wide  data reporting and analysis tool. M&O contractors produce crosswalks of  their financial data and submit the data to NNSA using a data reporting  and analysis tool called CostEX. NNSA then stores the reported financial  data in the DOE Office of the Chief Financial Officer\u2019s integrated data  warehouse. The Office of Defense Programs has used this process to  collect financial data from the M&O contractors for its programs since  fiscal year 2017. NNSA implemented this process for the broader  common financial reporting effort in fiscal year 2018. Figure 3 illustrates  NNSA\u2019s data management process for common financial reporting.", "To implement common financial reporting, NNSA established a common  reporting framework using agreed-upon work breakdown structures and  common cost elements and definitions. However, in January 2019, we  found that NNSA did not establish a common work breakdown structure  for all of the participating program offices, although the agency had  established 22 common cost elements and definitions. Specifically, the  Offices of Defense Programs, Emergency Operations, Defense Nuclear  Security, and Counterterrorism and Counterproliferation used NNSA\u2019s  common work breakdown structure, while the Offices of Safety,  Infrastructure, and Operations and Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation  used their own programmatic work breakdown structures.", "The M&O contractors crosswalk their internal financial data into a work  breakdown structure for each of the participating program offices (either  NNSA\u2019s common work breakdown structure or a programmatic work  breakdown structure) using common cost elements and definitions. The  M&O contractors\u2019 business systems capture their financial data at a more  detailed level than is needed for common financial reporting. Each M&O  contractor tracks financial data for its site based on how it manages the  work using projects, tasks, and expenditure types. For example, M&O  contractors collect time and attendance data from their employees based  on the number of hours spent working on a project for the pay period. The  M&O contractors aggregate this information across multiple employees to  report on labor costs for a project. When the M&O contractors prepare  their data for common financial reporting, site managers identify the  component(s) of the applicable work breakdown structure and cost  elements with which the project aligns and crosswalk their financial data  to the NNSA structure using professional judgment. Figure 4 shows an  example of how an M&O contractor crosswalks its financial data into an  NNSA work breakdown structure in CostEX.", "After the M&O contractors submit their financial data in CostEX, NNSA  performs data quality and accuracy checks of the M&O contractors\u2019 data,  referred to as \u201cdata validation\u201d and \u201cdata reconciliation.\u201d NNSA performs  data validation using CostEX, which automatically checks each row for  data quality\u2014such as confirming that the correct contractor is entering  data for the site\u2014and formatting based on 45 validation checks. CostEX  identifies data that do not pass the validation check as errors and rejects  them, and the M&O contractor corrects and resubmits the data until it  passes the validation check. NNSA performs data reconciliation with  STARS using CostEX at the budget and reporting code level. CostEX  extracts STARS data for selected budget and reporting codes and  compares it with the data the M&O contractors submitted for common  financial reporting. CostEX identifies data that differ from the STARS data  by more than $1 as an error and rejects the data, and the M&O contractor  corrects and resubmits the data until it passes the reconciliation check.

NNSA continues to use CostEX to collect financial data from the M&O  contractors and stores the data in DOE\u2019s integrated data warehouse.", "Develop a policy. NNSA developed a policy for common financial  reporting. NNSA began developing the policy in October 2016 and  approved it in February 2019.", "Establish common cost elements and definitions. NNSA established  common cost elements and definitions prior to our January 2019 report.  An NNSA official said NNSA established the cost elements and  definitions based on data that the M&O contractors could readily provide  from their business systems. In fiscal year 2019, NNSA used the  established cost elements to collect the M&O contractors\u2019 data and added  a requirement for the contractors to report data on unpaid commitments.", "NNSA officials are considering adding cost elements in the future, such  as additional details on labor categories. NNSA is working with the M&O  contractors to ensure they can provide the additional data.", "Identify and report costs for programs of record and base  capabilities. NNSA has not yet identified and reported costs for all  programs of record or costs for base capabilities. The National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 required NNSA to establish  definitions and methodologies for identifying and reporting costs for  programs of record and base capabilities as part of its efforts to  implement common financial reporting. According to the program director  for financial integration, NNSA establishes its programs of record in its  congressional budget justification and other documents to align with  agency appropriations, which include Weapons Activities, Defense  Nuclear Nonproliferation, and Federal Salaries and Expenses. Through  common financial reporting in fiscal year 2018, NNSA collected financial  data from the M&O contractors for $8.9 billion of $13 billion from these  appropriations. In May 2018, NNSA issued guidance that identified 25  base capabilities that the M&O contractors used to develop their site  strategic plans. We reviewed the M&O contractors\u2019 site strategic plans for  2018 and found that the contractors identified base capabilities for their  sites, but did not include information about the costs to maintain each  sites\u2019 base capabilities. NNSA is working to determine whether or how  to collect information on the cost of base capabilities through the M&O  contractor site strategic planning process in coordination with the  common financial reporting effort. We will continue to monitor NNSA\u2019s  progress in addressing this requirement.", "Implement a common work breakdown structure. NNSA has not yet  implemented a common work breakdown structure across the program  offices in the nuclear security enterprise, but plans to assess the  feasibility of implementing a common structure in fiscal year 2020. The  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 requires NNSA  to develop a common work breakdown structure as part of its efforts to  implement common financial reporting. In January 2019, we found that  NNSA decided not to pursue a common work breakdown structure.  Rather, NNSA collected financial data from the M&O contractors using a  common work breakdown structure for four program offices and used  different, programmatic work breakdown structures for two other program  offices. As we found in January 2019, these two offices did not want to  change their work breakdown structures to the common structure. For  example, the Office of Safety, Infrastructure, and Operations did not want  to change its work breakdown structure because it uses the structure for  scope, schedule, and risk management, in addition to budget and cost.  We recommended that NNSA implement a common work breakdown  structure across its participating program offices because without doing  so, NNSA could not ensure that its efforts would result in the collection of  reliable, enterprise-wide financial data that satisfies the needs of  Congress and enables NNSA to report the total costs of its programs. At  the time of that report, NNSA neither agreed nor disagreed with the  recommendation. The agency stated that it would continue to use its  current approach, while focusing on enhancing analysis and reporting to  provide comparative data across the enterprise. Once this was  completed, NNSA planned to assess the effectiveness of the approach  and evaluate what changes, if any, were necessary to the work  breakdown structures to meet the overarching objectives of common  financial reporting.", "In May 2019, in response to our recommendation, NNSA changed its  approach and decided to conduct an assessment in fiscal year 2020 of  the feasibility of implementing a common work breakdown structure  across all participating program offices. To do so, NNSA plans to collect  M&O contractors\u2019 financial data in fiscal year 2020 using both the  common work breakdown structure for all program offices and\u2014 specifically for the Offices of Safety, Infrastructure, and Operations and  Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation\u2014the programmatic work breakdown  structures while it assesses the feasibility of a common work breakdown  structure. NNSA decided to take this approach to assess the potential  benefits while mitigating potential risks to the program offices that use the  data collected through the programmatic work breakdown structures to  oversee their programs. NNSA officials said that reporting the same data  using two different work breakdown structures will require additional  resources for the M&O contractors to prepare their data submissions,  which NNSA does not view as a long-term solution for common financial  reporting.", "NNSA planned to collect data using these two approaches in parallel  starting in November 2019 and make a decision on whether to implement  a common work breakdown structure across the nuclear security  enterprise in March 2020. NNSA plans to assess the feasibility of  implementing a common work breakdown structure using criteria such as  (1) whether using a common work breakdown structure reduces burden  on the M&O contractors, (2) how much it will cost NNSA to update other  program management systems, (3) whether NNSA can collect financial  data quickly enough to meet the needs of the program offices, and (4)  whether financial data collected using the common work breakdown  structure provides program offices with comparable data to support  existing program analysis.", "Collect financial data from M&O contractors. Since our January 2019  report, the M&O contractors submitted their financial data for fiscal years  2018 and 2019 for the participating program offices using CostEX.  However, NNSA and the M&O contractors faced challenges in collecting  accurate and consistent financial data for common financial reporting  across the nuclear security enterprise. Specifically, NNSA faced  challenges in (1) fully implementing its data validation and reconciliation  process, (2) collecting financial data from each M&O contractor for all of  the program offices, and (3) communicating information about changes in  a timely manner.", "First, NNSA faced challenges fully implementing its data validation and  reconciliation process for fiscal year 2018. NNSA designed CostEX to  automatically validate the M&O contractors\u2019 data to check data quality  and formatting and perform data reconciliation with STARS. However,  according to an NNSA official, for fiscal year 2018, the agency manually  reconciled the M&O contractors\u2019 fiscal year 2018 data with STARS to  identify and fix issues with the process prior to automation. For example,  an NNSA support contractor manually submitted and reconciled data for  one M&O contractor that manages two sites because the M&O contractor  submits combined data for the two sites into STARS, but NNSA collects  financial data for common financial reporting by site. For the fiscal year  2019 data collection effort, NNSA officials said they corrected the  submission issue and CostEX was able to automatically reconcile the  M&O contractors\u2019 data with STARS. Another M&O contractor\u2019s fiscal year  2018 financial data did not reconcile each month with STARS. NNSA  officials and representatives from the M&O contractor said the  reconciliation issue was due to timing differences between when the  contractor reported data into STARS and CostEX. Specifically, M&O  contractor representatives for the site said that when NNSA is delayed in  collecting data for common financial reporting in CostEX, the relationships  between the data reported into STARS and CostEX will have changed,  which may result in reconciliation errors. During that time, the site  changed how it tracked some of the data, which led to differences in how  the data were provided for STARS and common financial reporting, and  which caused the reconciliation errors. NNSA officials said they resolved  the issue with the M&O contractor for fiscal year 2019 and completed  data collection in October 2019.", "Second, NNSA faced challenges in collecting data from each M&O  contractor for all of the participating program offices. Specifically, the  Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation made ongoing changes to its  work breakdown structure templates throughout the fiscal year 2018 data  collection effort. This resulted in challenges for the M&O contractors when  reporting data for this program office. NNSA did not collect complete  fiscal year 2018 financial data for this office, in part because one of the  contractors had significant data validation and reconciliation errors,  resulting in data that NNSA could not validate and reconcile.", "Third, NNSA faced challenges in communicating information about  changes to the work breakdown structure in a timely manner to M&O  contractors. Leading project management practices emphasize the  importance of establishing and implementing change control processes,  which include reviewing and approving all change requests, documenting  the changes, and communicating the decisions. In fiscal years 2018 and  2019, not all NNSA programs consistently ensured that changes to the  work breakdown structure were approved, documented, or communicated  to the M&O contractors in a timely manner because NNSA had not  established and implemented a work breakdown change control process.  NNSA established aspects of such a process, in which program offices  submitted changes to the work breakdown structures to the financial  integration team so the team could upload the changes into CostEX and  notify the M&O contractors of the changes prior to their data submissions.  However, according to officials with the financial integration team, the  federal program managers did not always follow the process. Officials  with the financial integration team said that in some instances, the sites\u2019  program managers contacted the M&O contractors directly to request  changes to their work breakdown structures. The financial integration  team identified issues with the program offices\u2019 work breakdown  structures when the M&O contractors\u2019 data could not be validated and  reconciled. In such instances, the financial integration team contacted the  program managers to request the updated work breakdown structures for  CostEX. Further, the existing process does not include some aspects of  change control processes that are consistent with leading practices.", "Approving changes. Under the existing process, the financial  integration team does not check whether changes that federal  program managers submit to them have been reviewed and  approved, at a minimum, by program office management prior to  making changes to the work breakdown structures in CostEX. The  program director for financial integration said that they defer to the  program offices to ensure that program office management review  and approve changes to the work breakdown structure before the  program managers submit these changes to the financial integration  team.", "Documenting changes. NNSA officials said that not all program  offices have tracked changes to their work breakdown structures over  time. NNSA\u2019s Office of Defense Programs has a process for tracking  changes to its work breakdown structure, but that process\u2014or a  similar process\u2014was not utilized consistently by all of NNSA\u2019s other  program offices. If the program offices do not track the changes to  their work breakdown structures over time, they cannot ensure the  data are comparable across fiscal years. According to officials, NNSA  built a tool in CostEX to track work breakdown structure changes  across fiscal years. NNSA officials said the tool was tested at the end  of fiscal year 2019 by the Office of Defense Programs. NNSA plans to  test using the tool to track changes for the other program offices in  fiscal year 2020.", "Communicating decisions. NNSA did not always communicate  changes to the work breakdown structure to the M&O contractors in a  timely manner. Representatives from the seven M&O contractors  stated that they encountered challenges in submitting their data in  CostEX on multiple occasions throughout fiscal years 2018 and 2019  because federal program managers in some offices made frequent  changes to the work breakdown structures that often were not  communicated to the M&O contractors in a timely manner. When work  breakdown structures change, representatives from the seven M&O  contractors said they have to redo the crosswalk of their financial data  to the new work breakdown structures before they submit the data\u2014 this takes time and additional resources and may result in delayed  data submissions. Representatives from three of the M&O contractors  said the frequency of changes to the work breakdown structures  decreased for the fiscal year 2019 data collection effort, but  representatives from six M&O contractors said they continued to  encounter challenges when changes were made to the work  breakdown structures.", "Without establishing and systematically implementing a work breakdown  structure change control process, NNSA will not be able to verify that, at a  minimum, program office management has approved changes to the work  breakdown structure or that these changes have been documented,  potentially leading to challenges in ensuring that the data are comparable  over time. Furthermore, NNSA cannot ensure that changes to the work  breakdown structures are communicated to the M&O contractors in a  timely manner, which results in contractors using additional time and  resources to address validation or reconciliation errors.", "Publish and analyze data. NNSA has published the M&O contractors\u2019  financial data for fiscal years 2018 and 2019, but NNSA has not  conducted agency-wide analysis of the data. The NNSA financial  integration team has a website for common financial reporting from which  the program offices can download financial data. However, an NNSA  official stated that agency-wide analysis of the data was not feasible for  fiscal years 2018 or 2019 because NNSA did not use a common work  breakdown structure for all participating program offices. In addition, an  NNSA official stated that the agency needs to collect at least 3 years of  data to produce useful NNSA-wide findings.", "Some of the NNSA program offices have started to analyze the financial  data collected through the common financial reporting effort. For  example, the Office of Defense Programs is using financial data collected  through common financial reporting for program evaluation and to make  budgetary decisions. In addition, an NNSA official from the Office of  Counterterrorism and Counterproliferation stated that the office has used  financial data from common financial reporting to identify and address  accounting issues, such as identifying previously unidentified unspent  funds carried over from prior fiscal years and redirecting these funds to  support program activities in fiscal year 2019. However, some of the  program offices have not used the data collected through common  financial reporting for various reasons. For example, officials from the  Office of Safety, Infrastructure, and Operations stated that the fiscal year  2018 data were not useful for analysis because they were not collected in  a timely manner. NNSA officials said they completed data validation and  reconciliation of the M&O contractors\u2019 fiscal year 2018 financial data in  February 2019\u2014nearly halfway through the following fiscal year\u2014making  the data late and not useful for that office\u2019s purposes. Additionally,  officials from the Office of Defense Nuclear Security stated that they have  not used the data collected through the common financial reporting effort  because they want to ensure that the data are accurate and consistent  before using it for decision-making."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NNSA\u2019s Approach Provides Limited Assurance That Data Collected are Accurate and Consistent to Perform Agency-Wide Data Analysis", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "NNSA Has Not Verified Whether Contractors Accurately Crosswalk Financial Data to Work Breakdown Structures", "paragraphs": ["As discussed previously, M&O contractors crosswalk their financial data  into a reporting framework using work breakdown structures and common  cost elements and definitions, and they submit their data to NNSA using  CostEX. To help ensure the accuracy of the data, NNSA performs data  quality checks of the M&O contractors\u2019 financial data submitted using  CostEX. If NNSA cannot validate and reconcile the submitted data using  the agency\u2019s processes, it rejects and returns the data to the M&O  contractor to correct the errors. NNSA also provides the M&O  contractors with error reports from CostEX that they can use to identify  and correct errors.", "Each M&O contractor has established processes to check data quality  prior to submitting the data to NNSA in CostEX. For example,  representatives from all of the M&O contractors said they reviewed their  data for missing information and errors before submitting the data into  CostEX. In addition, all of the M&O contractors performed checks to  compare their data submissions for common financial reporting with their  STARS submissions before submitting the data into CostEX. After the  M&O contractors complete their internal data quality checks, they submit  their financial data into CostEX.", "At most sites, M&O contractor representatives said the way their site  tracks financial data does not align with how NNSA requests the data be  reported in the work breakdown structure and cost elements. Officials  from NNSA\u2019s Office of Cost Estimating and Program Evaluation said that  because the M&O contractors do not track their financial data using  NNSA work breakdown structures, the contractors have to make  decisions using professional judgment as to how to crosswalk their  project costs, raising concerns that each M&O contractor may make  different decisions about how to allocate costs. The officials said this may  result in data that are not accurate or comparable for conducting agency- wide analysis.", "We identified several limitations to the approach NNSA uses to collect  common financial data that could affect the accuracy and consistency of  the data:", "NNSA\u2019s data reconciliation process does not ensure M&O  contractors\u2019 financial data are accurate. M&O contractors identified  potential issues with using STARS for reconciliation to ensure data  accuracy. For example, two M&O contractors said that errors can  sometimes occur in their monthly STARS reporting. Errors in STARS  can be created when a number is mistyped or corrections are made to  purchase card or time sheet information. Once the M&O contractor  submits its data to STARS, errors cannot be corrected until at least  the following month. However, because the common financial  reporting data must reconcile with STARS, the M&O contractor has to  submit financial data into CostEX that includes the error. The program  director for financial integration said a process is in place for the M&O  contractors to identify any issues with STARS reporting and correct  their reported data in the future.", "More significantly, some M&O contractors said they make changes to  their data before submitting it into CostEX to ensure that the data  reconcile. Specifically, representatives from two M&O contractors said  they compare their financial data for common financial reporting with  their STARS data submission. If data from the two systems do not  match for small dollar amounts, the contractors manually make  adjustments to the data for common financial reporting rather than  making the corrections in their business systems. The representatives  also said they do not notify NNSA officials of the manual changes.", "NNSA requires that financial data for common financial reporting  reconcile with STARS. Specifically, NNSA rejects M&O contractor  financial data that differs from the STARS data by more than $1.  According to federal standards for internal control, management  should define objectives clearly to enable the identification of risks  and define risks tolerances. For the fiscal year 2018 data collection  effort, NNSA documentation indicated that M&O contractors reported  financial data for $8.9 billion of costs and reconciled the data with their  STARS cost reporting to a total difference of $5.03. According to an  NNSA official, M&O contractors reported financial data for $10.2  billion of costs and reconciled the data with STARS to a total  difference of $8.97 for fiscal year 2019. However, NNSA has limited  assurance that the financial data provided internally reconcile as  required because the agency does not know the extent of changes  that M&O contractors made to ensure the data reconcile with STARS  or the potential effects of those changes on the accuracy of the data.  Assessing the extent to which M&O contractors make manual  changes to ensure reconciliation with STARS for common financial  reporting and determining the effect of these changes could provide  additional assurance that the financial data collected through common  financial reporting are accurately reported.", "M&O contractors crosswalk site projects and tasks to NNSA  work breakdown structures, resulting in the potential for  differences in how costs are allocated. Each M&O contractor  tracks financial data for its site based on how it manages the work  using projects and tasks, as allowed by federal Cost Accounting  Standards. When a site\u2019s projects and tasks do not align with NNSA\u2019s  work breakdown structure, site program managers identify the  component of the NNSA work breakdown structure with which the  project and tasks best align and crosswalk their financial data to the  NNSA structure using professional judgment. One site program  manager said it is sometimes challenging to identify which of their  internal projects and tasks aligns with the NNSA work breakdown  structure, especially when internal projects have similar names to  describe different project scopes. Another site program manager said  the site\u2019s projects and tasks closely align with the NNSA work  breakdown structure approximately 30 to 40 percent of the time, and  contractor representatives use professional judgment to crosswalk the  remaining 60 to 70 percent of their projects and tasks.", "To create the crosswalk, site program managers consider which  NNSA program the project mostly supports. It can be difficult to  crosswalk the site data into NNSA\u2019s work breakdown structure,  especially for work that benefits multiple weapons programs. For  example, a site program manager said that the site\u2019s project to  develop inert material for NNSA\u2019s high explosives activities supports  multiple weapons programs. The site tracks that work as one project,  but NNSA\u2019s work breakdown structure requires that the costs be  reported across multiple programs. When M&O contractors make  decisions to crosswalk their financial data using professional  judgment, the contractors do not provide information to NNSA on how  the costs are allocated. By verifying this information, NNSA could  ensure that allocation decisions are made consistently across the  nuclear security enterprise.", "M&O contractors provided different financial data for the same  projects. M&O contractors continue to report financial data for some  program offices into multiple systems, including the G2 program  management system, WebPMIS, and spreadsheets. For fiscal year  2018, NNSA compared financial data that the M&O contractors  reported, for two NNSA program offices, into the G2 program  management system and the CostEX tool used for common financial  reporting and found differences between the data reported for the  same budget and reporting codes and levels of the work breakdown.  The program director for financial integration said he worked with the  program offices and identified the cause of the differences in the data.", "NNSA cannot ensure the accuracy of the data submitted for common  financial reporting because NNSA does not have an internal process to  verify whether M&O contractors crosswalk their financial data accurately  from their business systems to the NNSA work breakdown structure.  According to federal standards for internal control, management should  use quality information to achieve the agency\u2019s objectives. Under the  financial integration policy, the program director for financial integration is  responsible for executing a plan for NNSA to achieve enterprise-wide  financial integration to collect standardized financial management data;  increase transparency of financial accountability; and improve cost  analysis, comparability, and reporting consistency among programs and  M&O contractors. The program director for financial integration said that  verifying whether the M&O contractors properly crosswalk their data to  the work breakdown structure is an area in which the agency should  improve its common financial reporting effort. NNSA officials stated that  the common financial reporting effort does not have a process to validate  financial data that are more detailed than STARS and indicated that until  the agency has assurances the reported data are accurate, NNSA should  not use that more detailed data for agency decision-making. By  developing an internal process for NNSA to verify the M&O contractors\u2019  crosswalks, the agency will have better assurance that the data collected  through common financial reporting will produce accurate, enterprise- wide financial data that is comparable across the M&O contractors and  that satisfies the needs of Congress and other stakeholders. Further, this  would help address long-term issues with NNSA\u2019s ability to report the  total costs of its programs, in accordance with Managerial Cost  Accounting Standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NNSA Has Not Verified Whether Contractors Accurately Crosswalk Financial Data to Cost Elements", "paragraphs": ["As part of common financial reporting, M&O contractors crosswalk their  financial data to NNSA\u2019s cost elements. Cost elements capture discrete  costs of a particular activity of work and include direct costs such as labor  and equipment and indirect costs such as general and administrative  costs. In March 2018, NNSA established 22 cost elements and  definitions\u2014including 10 indirect cost elements\u2014that the M&O contractors use to report financial data. As we found in our January 2019  report, NNSA officials said this was a critical step toward implementing  common financial reporting because without common cost elements, the  agency was limited in its ability to report lower-level costs consistently  across programs and sites. In addition, having the M&O contractors  report financial data across common cost elements would allow NNSA to  improve its management of programs across the enterprise. NNSA  developed the cost elements and definitions in consultation with the M&O  contractors based on the data they could provide because officials said it  is important for the contractors to report accurate financial data using the  NNSA cost elements.", "M&O contractors manage their sites\u2019 financial data using expenditure  types to track the costs of their projects. These expenditure types capture  similar costs as the cost elements, but at a more detailed level, and are  specific to each individual M&O contractor based on how the contractor  manages its expenses. M&O contractors have flexibility to determine how  they structure their work and the expenditures they track in their financial  systems consistent with Cost Accounting Standards. Based on our review  of M&O contractor documents, M&O contractors varied significantly in the  number of expenditure types they tracked. For example, the M&O  contractor for one of the national laboratories tracked its financial data  using over 900 expenditure types, while another national laboratory used  around 50 expenditure types. NNSA officials said that the number of  expenditure types at the sites varies based on the nature of the work  performed at each site.", "Most of the M&O contractors cannot crosswalk their expenditures to  certain NNSA cost elements because of how they track costs in their  systems. Specifically, representatives from five of the M&O contractors  said they cannot accurately crosswalk their indirect expenditure types to  NNSA\u2019s indirect cost elements because their systems do not capture the  data in the way that NNSA wants these data reported. M&O contractors  have discretion to classify which costs are considered indirect, and costs  for similar activities can be allocated differently by each contractor. In  fiscal year 2018, NNSA\u2019s M&O contractors reported spending $3.5 billion  on indirect activities. Generally, in cases in which the M&O contractors  could not crosswalk their indirect costs to specific NNSA cost elements,  representatives from one of the M&O contractors said they allocated their  indirect costs to NNSA\u2019s cost elements using percentages, while others  said they reported data that did not adhere to the NNSA cost elements.", "Below are examples of situations in which M&O contractors were not able  to accurately report expenditures into NNSA\u2019s indirect cost elements:", "Representatives from one M&O contractor said they could not  accurately report financial data for the general and administrative cost  element and site support from other overhead cost elements because  the site did not capture its data in that way. As a result, the M&O  contractor allocated its indirect costs using formulas and composite  rates, rather than reporting actual cost data to NNSA.", "Representatives from two M&O contractors said they could not  accurately report financial data across the site support and  infrastructure support cost elements because the structure of their  indirect cost pool did not allow them to track those expenditures  separately. As a result, representatives from one of the M&O  contractors said they reported all of their infrastructure expenditures to  the site support cost element.", "NNSA officials said they were aware of the M&O contractors\u2019 issues with  reporting their expenditure types using the NNSA cost elements. Although  M&O contractors are required to provide financial data using NNSA\u2019s cost  elements, the program director for financial integration said he was aware  that M&O contractors report some indirect costs for separate cost  elements to a single cost element in CostEX, meaning that they do not  accurately report some indirect costs based on NNSA\u2019s definitions.  Additionally, the financial integration team identified differences between  indirect cost data collected from the M&O contractors for common  financial reporting and data reported to another group in NNSA\u2019s Office of  Management and Budget. NNSA plans to conduct a review of the data  reported through the two efforts to determine the cause of the differences.  Officials from the Office of Safety, Infrastructure, and Operations stated  that it is important that the common financial reporting effort is able to  collect accurate information on M&O contractors\u2019 costs related to  infrastructure spending.", "NNSA is aware of the challenges its M&O contractors have with  accurately reporting their expenditure types against the NNSA cost  elements.

M&O contractors reporting data  based on allocated\u2014as opposed to actual\u2014costs is not ideal because  NNSA cannot ensure that each M&O contractor is consistently applying  the allocation and because the data may not be standardized and  comparable across the sites, which affects the quality of the data.
