Among the goals of the initiatives are reducing regulatory burden, requiring more rigorous regulatory analysis, and enhancing oversight. The initiatives have been beneficial in a number of ways, but they also were often less effective than anticipated. GAO's reviews suggest at least four overall strengths or benefits associated with existing initiatives: (1) increasing the attention directed to rules and rule making, (2) increasing expectations regarding the analytical support for proposed rules, (3) encouraging and facilitating greater public participation in rule making, and (4) improving the transparency of the rule-making process. On the other hand, at least four recurring reasons help explain why reform initiatives have not been more effective: (1) limited scope and coverage of various requirements, (2) lack of clarity regarding key terms and definitions, (3) uneven implementation of the initiatives' requirements, and (4) a predominant focus on just one part of the regulatory process, agencies' development of rules. As Congress develops its regulatory reform agenda, the lessons and opportunities identified by GAO's body of work suggest two avenues that might provide a useful starting point. The first would be to broadly revisit the procedures, definitions, exemptions, and other provisions of existing initiatives to determine whether changes are needed to better achieve their goals. As a second avenue to explore, GAO's reviews found that the regulatory process could benefit from more attention to evaluations of existing regulations, although recognizing some of the difficulties associated with carrying out such evaluations. The lessons that could be learned from retrospective reviews could help to keep the regulatory process focused on results and inform future action to meet emerging challenges. This is a particularly timely point to be reviewing the regulatory process. The long-term fiscal imbalance facing the United States, along with other significant trends and challenges, establishes the case for change and the need to reexamine the base of the federal government and all of its existing programs, policies, functions, and activities. No single approach or reform can address all of the questions and program areas that need to be revisited. However, federal regulation is a critical tool of government, and regulatory programs play a key part in how the federal government addresses many of the country's needs. Therefore, reassessing the regulatory framework must be part of that long-term effort to transform what the federal government does and how it does it."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss reform initiatives that have been  instituted over the years to improve the federal regulatory process.   Congress has often asked GAO to evaluate the effectiveness of procedures  and requirements established by certain initiatives.  Our work included  reviews of agencies\u2019 compliance with the initiatives and provided us  opportunities to examine the outcomes of various reforms.  My remarks  today are based on this broad body of regulatory work and some of the  significant common themes and lessons that have emerged.", "In brief, over the last 25 years Congresses and Presidents initiated a  number of regulatory reforms for a variety of purposes, such as reducing  regulatory burdens or improving the information available to decision  makers and the public about proposed rules.  Our reviews indicated that  some of these initiatives have yielded mixed results.  There have been  benefits associated with the initiatives, but they were often less effective  than intended.  Time and again we noted how features such as the limited  scope of the initiatives, unclear definitions, and broad exemptions affected  the results of these reforms.  Also, while many of these initiatives added  more requirements at the beginning of the regulatory process, fewer of  their provisions have focused on evaluating the actual benefits and costs of  rules once implemented and using such information to revise existing  regulations and inform future action.", "For these reasons, as this subcommittee begins to develop its regulatory  reform agenda, we suggest two avenues that might provide a useful starting  point.  First, the subcommittee might wish to broadly revisit the  procedures, definitions, exemptions, and other provisions of existing  initiatives to determine whether changes are needed to better achieve their  goals.  Second, to keep the regulatory process focused on results meeting  emerging challenges, we found that the process could benefit from more  attention on evaluations of existing regulations and the lessons that could  be learned from such retrospective reviews.

Reassessing the regulatory framework must be  part of that discussion."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Regulatory Reform Initiatives Reveal Some Common Strengths and Weaknesses", "paragraphs": ["Federal regulation is a basic tool of government.

The public policy goals and benefits of regulations include,  among other things, ensuring that workplaces, air travel, foods, and drugs  are safe; that the nation\u2019s air, water and land are not polluted; and that the  appropriate amount of taxes is collected.  The costs of these regulations  are estimated to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars, and the benefits  estimates are even higher.  Given the size and impact of federal regulation,  it is no surprise that Congresses and Presidents have taken a number of  actions to refine and reform the regulatory process within the past 25  years.  One goal of such initiatives has been to reduce regulatory burdens  on affected parties, but other purposes have also played a part.  Among  these are efforts to require more rigorous analyses of proposed rules and  thus provide better information to decision makers, to enhance oversight  of rule making by Congress and the President, and to promote greater  transparency and participation in the process.", "Over the last decade, at the request of Congress, GAO has released over 60  reports and testimonies reviewing the implementation of various  regulatory reform initiatives.  Some initiatives, such as the Paperwork  Reduction Act (PRA), Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), Unfunded  Mandates Reform Act (UMRA), and Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory  Planning and Review, have undergone repeated scrutiny.  While our  reviews identified specific strengths and weaknesses of individual  initiatives, it may be more worthwhile to focus on crosscutting strengths  and weaknesses.  The common strengths we identified largely mirror the  general purposes of various reform initiatives.  The common weaknesses  reflect issues associated with both the design and implementation of the  initiatives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Initiatives Increase Attention on Proposed Rules and Raise Expectations of the Rule- Making Process", "paragraphs": ["Our reviews suggest at least four overall strengths or benefits that have  been associated with existing regulatory reform initiatives: (1) increasing  the attention directed to rules and rule making, (2) increasing expectations  regarding the analytical support for proposed rules, (3) encouraging and  facilitating greater public participation in rule making, and (4) improving  the transparency of the rule-making process.", "First, the simple fact that such initiatives bring added attention to rules and  the rule-making process is an important benefit.  As we have pointed out in  prior reports, oversight of agencies\u2019 rule making can result in useful  changes to rules.  Furthermore, awareness of this added scrutiny may  provide an important indirect effect.  For example, in a previous GAO  review, Department of Transportation officials told us that they will not  even propose certain regulatory provisions because they know that the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which reviews significant  agency draft rules under Executive Order 12866, will not find them  acceptable.  Similarly, there is evidence that the focus placed on potential  mandates under UMRA may have helped to discourage or limit the costs of  federal mandates.", "Second, several of the reform initiatives have increased the analytical  requirements and expectations in the regulatory process.  These initiatives  have raised the bar for agencies regarding the information and analysis  needed to support policy decisions underlying regulations.  Simply put, the  initiatives call for more analysis of the effects\u2014both benefits and costs\u2014of  proposed regulations before they are implemented.  Whether imposed by  statute or executive order, these initiatives seek to answer a basic question,  \u201cWhat are the consequences of this rule?\u201d  Closely related are other  requirements that encourage agencies to identify and consider alternatives  when developing regulations.  Executive Order 12866, for example, asks  agencies to first identify and assess available alternatives to direct  regulation.  Initiatives such as RFA and UMRA ask agencies to identify  regulatory alternatives that will be less burdensome to regulated parties.", "Third, some of the reform initiatives have encouraged and facilitated  greater public participation and consultation in rule making.  Initiatives  such as the E-Government Act and the Government Paperwork Elimination  Act encourage agencies to allow the public to communicate with them by  electronic means.  Other initiatives require additional consultation by  agencies with the parties that might be affected by rules under  development.  These initiatives ask that agencies seek input earlier in the  process, rather than waiting for the public to comment on proposals  published in the Federal Register.", "A final shared strength of many of these initiatives, and one closely  connected to the three previous items, is that they help to improve the  transparency of the regulatory process.  In prior work, we have cited  transparency as a regulatory best practice.  By providing more information  about potential effects and alternatives, requiring more documentation and  justification of agencies\u2019 decisions, and facilitating public access to and  queries about such information, regulatory reform initiatives can help  make the process more open.  We recommended that more could be done  to increase transparency, and we have also highlighted the value of  transparency when agencies had particularly clear and complete  documentation supporting their rule making.  As the Administrator of  OMB\u2019s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) pointed out,  openness can help to \u201ctransform the public debate about regulation to one  of substance \u2026 rather than process.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Recurring Weaknesses Might Explain Why Reform Initiatives Have Not Been More Effective", "paragraphs": ["Despite these strengths, the overall results and effectiveness of regulatory  reform initiatives have often been mixed.  This may be particularly true  when results of the initiatives are compared to the goals and purposes  originally established for them.  For example, despite the goals set for the  reduction of paperwork burdens under PRA, we have repeatedly testified  about the growth in burden hours imposed by federal information  collections.  We similarly reported that initiatives such as UMRA, the  executive order on federalism, and requirements imposed under Section  610 of RFA for reviews of existing rules, have had little impact on agencies\u2019  rule making.  Our reviews have identified at least four general reasons that  might explain why reform initiatives have not been more effective: (1) the  limited scope and coverage of various requirements, (2) lack of clarity  regarding key terms and definitions, (3) uneven implementation of the  initiatives\u2019 requirements, and (4) a predominant focus on just one part of  the regulatory process, agencies\u2019 development of rules.", "First, we have pointed out significant limits in the scope and coverage of  certain reform initiatives.  UMRA provides one example of the effect of  definitional limitations, exceptions, and thresholds on restricting an  initiative\u2019s coverage.  As we noted in a report last year, part of the reason  for the relatively small number of rules identified as containing mandates  under UMRA could be traced to 14 different restrictions on the  identification of federal mandates under the Act.  Furthermore, our  analysis of all 122 major or economically significant rules (generally, rules  with an impact of $100 million or more) published in 2001 and 2002 also  showed that more than one of these restrictions applied to 72 percent of  the 65 rules that were not identified as containing federal mandates under  UMRA but nonetheless appeared to result in significant financial effects on  nonfederal parties.", "UMRA, along with RFA, also illustrates the potential domino effect of  building reform requirements on other procedural requirements.  Both acts  only apply to rules for which an agency publishes a notice of proposed rule  making.  However, agencies can publish final regulatory actions without  notices of proposed rule making using either good cause, categorical, or  statute-specific exceptions to the Administrative Procedure Act\u2019s notice  and comment requirements.   In one of our prior reports, we estimated  that about half of all final regulatory actions published by agencies were  issued without going through the proposed rule stage.  Although many  final rules without proposed rules were minor actions, in both that analysis  and our recent UMRA review there were major rules that did not have  notices of proposed rule making.", "Another recurring message in our reports has been the effect of unclear  terms and definitions that affect the applicability of requirements.   Combined with the discretion given rule-making agencies to interpret the  requirements in reform initiatives, it is not surprising that we have  observed uneven implementation across agencies.  In particular, we have  often cited the need to clarify key terms in the Regulatory Flexibility Act.   RFA requires analyses and other actions to help address concerns about  the impact of regulations on small entities, but the requirements do not  apply if the agency head certifies that the agency\u2019s rule will not have a  \u201csignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.\u201d   However, the Act neither defines this key phrase nor places clear  responsibility on any party to define it consistently across government.  As  a result, we found that agencies had different interpretations of RFA\u2019s  requirements.  We said in a series of reports that, if Congress wanted to  strengthen the implementation of RFA, it should consider amending the Act  to define the key phrases or provide some other entity with clearer  authority and responsibility to interpret RFA\u2019s provisions.  To date,  Congress has not acted on our recommendations.  Again, there is a domino  effect associated with this uncertainty, because other reform initiatives,  such as the requirement for agencies to review existing rules under Section  610 of RFA and a requirement to provide compliance assistance guides to  regulated entities, only apply if an agency has determined the rule will have  a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.", "Sometimes, though, it might not be uncertainty over the provisions of an  initiative that help to limit its effectiveness, but rather an agency\u2019s  implementation of the requirements.  For example, as noted in our recent  report on the Paperwork Reduction Act, one of the provisions aimed at  helping to achieve the goals of minimizing burden while maximizing utility  is a requirement for chief information officers (CIO) to review and certify  information collections.  However, our analysis of case studies showed  that CIOs provided these certifications despite often missing or inadequate  support from the program offices sponsoring the collections.  We  recommended that OMB clarify the kinds of support it asks agency CIOs to  provide for certifications and that heads of certain agencies direct  responsible CIOs to strengthen agency support for CIO certifications,  including with regard to the necessity of collection, burden reduction  efforts, and plans for the use of information collected.", "Our reports over the years have also highlighted issues regarding agencies\u2019  implementation of analytical requirements, such as the economic analyses  that support regulations.  Although the economic performance of some  federal actions is assessed prospectively, few federal actions are monitored  for their economic performance retrospectively.  In addition, our reviews  have found that economic assessments that analyze regulations  prospectively are often incomplete and inconsistent with general economic  principles.  Moreover, the assessments are not always useful for  comparisons across the government, because they are often based on  different assumptions for the same key economic variables.  In our recent  report on UMRA, we noted that parties from various sectors expressed  concerns about the accuracy and completeness of agencies\u2019 cost estimates,  and some also emphasized that more needed to be done to address the  benefits side of the equation.  Our reviews have found that not all benefits  are quantified and monetized by agencies, partly because of the difficulty in  estimation.", "Finally, although not an explicit finding in any of our reports, it is clear  when stepping back to look at the big picture presented by the set of  reform initiatives and our body of regulatory work that these initiatives  primarily target one particular phase of the regulatory process, agencies\u2019  development of rules.  While rule making is clearly an important point in  the process when the specific substance and impact of regulations are most  open to public debate, other phases also help determine the effectiveness  of regulation.  Few of the reform initiatives contain major requirements or  processes that address those other phases in the life cycle of regulations\u2014 from the underlying statutory authorizations, through effective  implementation and monitoring of compliance with regulatory provisions,  to evaluation and revision of existing rules.  For example, only UMRA  explicitly addresses the potential effect of legislative proposals in creating  mandates that would ultimately be implemented through regulations, and  that element of UMRA has generally been viewed as among its most  effective elements.  We have reported that agencies sometimes have little  rule-making discretion, so in some cases concerns raised about  burdensome regulations are traceable to the statutes underlying the  regulations, rather than a failure of an agency to comply with rule-making  requirements.  With regard to other phases in the regulatory process, RFA  is unique among statutory requirements in having a provision (Section 610)  for reviews of existing rules, although it is limited to rules with significant  effects on small entities.  Executive Order 12866 also includes some  provisions to encourage agencies to review and revise existing rules.  It is  not clear, however, that either the Section 610 or the executive order look  back provisions have been consistently and effectively implemented."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Opportunities Exist to Refine Existing Reform Initiatives and Explore New Ways to Transform the Regulatory Process", "paragraphs": ["As this subcommittee begins to develop its regulatory reform agenda, our  body of work on regulatory issues, and also on results-oriented government  management, suggests two general avenues of effort you may want to  consider as useful starting points.  One avenue is to revisit the procedures,  definitions, exemptions, and other provisions of existing initiatives to  determine whether changes might be needed to better achieve their goals.   Second, the subcommittee may wish to explore options to more effectively  and productively evaluate existing regulations and the results they have  generated.  Not only could such retrospective evaluations help to inform  Congress and other policymakers about ways to improve the design of  regulations and regulatory programs, but they could play a part in the  overall reexamination of the base of the federal government that we have  recommended in our recent work on addressing 21st century challenges.", "With respect to the first avenue, my testimony to this point indicates that  there are ample opportunities to revisit and refine existing regulatory  reform initiatives.  Although progress has been made to implement  recommendations and matters for consideration we have raised in our  prior reports, there are still unresolved issues.  In particular, Congress may  want to consider whether some provisions of existing statutory initiatives  need to be amended to make those initiatives more effective.  We still  believe, for example, that Congress should clarify key terms and definitions  in RFA or provide another entity with the authority and responsibility to do  so.", "We also believe there is some value to taking a broader look at how all of  the pieces of existing initiatives have, or have not, contributed to achieving  the purposes intended.  For example, we suggested in our recent review of  PRA that a new approach might be required to address burden reduction.   As illustrated by our work on lessons learned about UMRA in the 10 years  since it was enacted, such reviews can reveal opportunities and options for  both reinforcing the strengths and addressing the weaknesses that have  emerged in practice.  The options can take a number of different  directions.  For example, in our work on UMRA, concerns about the scope  of coverage were most frequently raised by the many knowledgeable  parties we consulted, but issues and options were also identified regarding  enforcement, consultation, and the analytic framework, among other  topics.  In undertaking reviews of existing initiatives, it will be important to  also revisit the reasons why particular limitations and exceptions were  included in the initiatives to begin with.  As pointed out in the UMRA work,  this probably needs to be an inclusive effort to be successful, involving all  affected parties in the debate to find common ground if changes are to be  accepted.", "The second broad avenue I would suggest the subcommittee consider in its  reform agenda would be to explore using retrospective evaluations of  existing regulations.  Such evaluations could help to keep the regulatory  process focused on results and identify ways to better meet emerging  challenges.  Among the potential benefits of more retrospective analysis of  federal regulations are that it could enable policymakers to better gauge  actual benefits and costs and whether regulations are achieving their  desired goals, bring additional accountability to the regulatory process,  identify opportunities to revise existing regulations, and provide  information that could lead to better decisions regarding future  regulations.", "In our work this year on both UMRA and economic performance measures,  we clearly heard from the experts we consulted that they believe more  retrospective analysis is needed and, further, that there are ways to  improve the quality and credibility of the analyses that are done.  In the  UMRA work, parties had particularly strong views about the need for better  evaluation and research of federal mandates, including those imposed by  regulations.  The most frequently suggested option to address this issue  was to do more postimplementation evaluation of existing mandates or  \u201clook backs\u201d at their effectiveness.  As one of the parties pointed out,  retrospective evaluation of regulations is useful because rules can change  people\u2019s behavior in ways that cannot be predicted prior to  implementation.  In our recent workshop where we obtained the views of  experts about the use of economic performance measures, such as a  comparison of benefits and costs (net benefits) and cost-effectiveness,  participants identified several gaps in the application of these measures to  analyze federal regulations and programs.  For example, while some  agencies have done retrospective economic performance assessments, the  participants said that in general federal agencies often do not assess the  performance of regulations or existing programs retrospectively, even  though this information could be useful in managing programs. However,  there are also challenges to effectively implementing retrospective  evaluations.  For example, we previously identified some of the difficulties  regulatory agencies face in demonstrating the results of their work, such as  identifying and collecting the data needed to demonstrate results, the  diverse and complex factors that affect agencies\u2019 results (for example, the  need to achieve results through the actions of third parties), and the long  time period required to see results in some areas of federal regulation.   There is also a potential balance concern because, as I noted earlier, it may  be more difficult to quantify the benefits of regulations than it is to quantify  the costs.", "Finally, I want to emphasize that this is a particularly timely point to be  reviewing the regulatory process because of the long-term fiscal imbalance  facing the United States, along with other significant trends and challenges.   The 21st century challenges that we have been highlighting this year  establish the case for change and the need to reexamine the base of the  federal government and all of its existing programs, policies, functions, and  activities.  We recognize that a successful reexamination of the base of the  federal government will entail multiple approaches over a period of years.   No single approach or reform can address all of the questions and program  areas that need to be revisited.  However, federal regulation is a critical tool  of government, and regulatory programs play a key part in how the federal  government addresses many of the country\u2019s needs.  Asking the questions  necessary to begin reexamining the federal regulatory process is an  important first step in the long-term effort to transform what the federal  government does and how it does it.", "Madam Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.

The Act also requires agencies to ensure that publicly accessible  federal Web sites contain electronic dockets for their proposed rules,  including all comments submitted on the rules and other relevant  materials.  The E-Government Act also established an Office of Electronic  Government within OMB, headed by an administrator appointed by the  President."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Related Executive Orders and Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["In addition to congressional regulatory reform initiatives enacted in  statutes, it is important to also recognize the key role that presidential  initiatives have in the regulatory process.  Centralized review of agencies\u2019  regulations within the Executive Office of the President has been part of  the rule-making process for more than 30 years.  The formal process by  which OIRA currently reviews agencies\u2019 proposed rules and final rules is  essentially unchanged since Executive Order 12866 was issued in 1993.   Under Executive Order 12866, OIRA reviews significant proposed and final  rules from all agencies, other than independent regulatory agencies, before  they are published in the Federal Register.", "The executive order states, among other things, that agencies should assess  all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives, including both  quantitative and qualitative measures.  It also provides that agencies should  select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (unless a statute  requires another approach).  Among other principles, the executive order  encourages agencies to tailor regulations to impose the least burden on  society needed to achieve the regulatory objectives.  The executive order  also established agency and OIRA responsibilities in the review of  regulations, including transparency requirements.  OIRA provides guidance  to federal agencies on implementing the requirements of the executive  order, such as guidance on preparing economic analyses required for  significant rules.", "There are also other orders that impose requirements on agencies during  rule making, such as Executive Order 13132 on federalism that requires  agencies to prepare a federalism summary impact statement for actions  that have federalism implications.  Also, in January 2005, OMB published  a final bulletin on peer review that establishes minimum standards for  when peer review is required for scientific information, including stricter  minimum standards for the peer review of \u201chighly influential\u201d scientific  assessments, and the types of peer review that should be considered by  agencies in different circumstances.  The selection of an appropriate peer  review mechanism is left to the agency\u2019s discretion.", "More detailed information about these various initiatives is available in the  related GAO products listed at the end of this testimony."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Economic Performance: Highlights of a Workshop on Economic  Performance Measures.
