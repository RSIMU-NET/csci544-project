It assesses (1) what is known about progress made towards the interim CAP goals; and (2) how, if at all, quarterly progress reviews reflected GPRAMA requirements and leading practices for reviews, as well as how reviews contributed to improved cross-agency performance and collaboration. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed CAP goal status updates and other documents from OMB and CAP goal progress-review meetings, and interviewed OMB staff and CAP goal representatives.

The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA) requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to coordinate with agencies to: (1) establish outcome-oriented, federal government priority goals (known as cross-agency priority, or CAP, goals) with annual and quarterly performance targets and milestones; and (2) report quarterly on a single website now known as Performance.gov the results achieved for each CAP goal compared to the targets. In February 2012, OMB identified 14 interim CAP goals and subsequently published five quarterly updates on the status of the interim CAP goals on Performance.gov. While updates for eight of the goals included data that indicated performance towards an overall planned level of performance, only three also contained annual or quarterly targets that allowed for an assessment of interim progress. Updates for the other six goals did not report on progress towards a planned level of performance because the goals lacked either a quantitative target or the data needed to track progress. The updates on Performance.gov also listed planned activities and milestones contributing to each goal, but some did not include relevant information, including time frames for the completion of specific actions and the status of ongoing efforts. The incomplete information in the updates provided a limited basis for ensuring accountability for the achievement of targets and milestones.", "OMB Quarterly Progress Reviews. GPRAMA also requires that OMB\u2014with the support of the Performance Improvement Council (PIC)\u2014review CAP goal progress quarterly with goal leaders. OMB instituted processes for reviewing progress on the goals each quarter, which involved the collection of data from goal leaders and the development of a memorandum for the OMB Director. However, the information included in these memorandums was not fully consistent with GPRAMA requirements. For example, GPRAMA requires OMB to identify strategies for improving the performance of goals at risk of not being met, but this was not consistently done. Without this information, OMB leadership and others may not be able to adequately track whether corrective actions are being taken, thereby limiting their ability to hold officials accountable for addressing identified risks and improving performance.", "Leading Practices for Reviews. At the CAP-goal level, goal leaders for two CAP goals and one sub-goal instituted in-person progress reviews with officials from contributing agencies that were broadly consistent with the full range of leading practices for reviews, such as leadership involvement in reviews of progress on identified goals and milestones, and rigorous follow-up on issues identified through these reviews. In these cases, goal managers reported there were positive effects on performance, accountability, and collaboration. In contrast, review processes used by other goal leaders did not consistently reflect the full range of leading practices. Effective review processes consistently engage leaders and agency officials in efforts to identify and address performance deficiencies, and to ensure accountability for commitments. Thus, not using them may result in missed opportunities to hold meaningful performance discussions, ensure accountability and oversight, and drive performance improvement."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making seven recommendations to OMB to improve the reporting of performance information for CAP goals and ensure that CAP goal progress reviews meet GPRAMA requirements and reflect leading practices.

We also interviewed  sub-goal leaders from the Closing Skills Gaps and Entrepreneurship and  Small Business CAP goals to learn more about their involvement in  quarterly review processes for their CAP goals, and to learn of any impact  the CAP goal designation or review processes had at the sub-goal level.  We selected these goals to reflect one review process that involved  regular meetings between the goal leader and contributors dedicated to  reviewing progress (Closing Skills Gaps), and one that did not rely on  regular meetings at the CAP-goal level to review progress  (Entrepreneurship and Small Business). Our findings from these  interviews cannot be generalized to the other CAP goals.

Updates to eight of the goals  included quarterly, biannual, or annual data that indicated performance  achieved to date toward the target identified in the goal statement. Three  of the eight goals (Cybersecurity, Energy Efficiency, and Strategic  Sourcing) also contained the required annual or quarterly targets that  defined planned levels of performance, which allowed for an assessment  of interim progress.

In contrast, the  updates for the other five goals did not contain annual or quarterly  targets, which made it difficult to determine whether interim progress  towards the goals\u2019 overall planned levels of performance was being  made. For example, updates to the Exports goal included data on the  total amount of U.S. exports by quarter for calendar years 2012 and 2013  but did not include a target level of performance for those years or  quarters. Therefore, it was unclear whether the goal\u2019s overall planned  level of performance of doubling U.S. exports by the end of 2014 is on  track to be met.

OMB agreed with the  recommendation, and in the quarterly updates to the CAP goals  published in December 2012 and March 2013, OMB added some of the  departments, agencies, and programs we identified in our work to some  CAP goals\u2019 lists of contributors.

In addition  to the memorandums developed for the Director of OMB, OMB published  more detailed information through the quarterly status updates available  on Performance.gov.", "OMB and PIC staff told us that to support OMB\u2019s quarterly review efforts,  PIC staff were to conduct assessments rating the overall health of  implementation efforts and goal leader engagement. They were also to  assess the execution status of each goal, including the quality and trend  of performance indicators. One purpose of these assessments was to  identify areas where risks, such as goal leader turnover, could affect the  ability to achieve the planned level of performance. Consistent with this  intent, several of the quarterly OMB review memorandums we examined  highlighted turnover in goal leader or deputy goal leader positions as  risks, and suggested the need to find or approve replacements. Although  PIC staff have been tasked with assessing these elements of CAP goal  implementation, and said that there was a shared understanding between  involved staff as to how these assessments would be carried out, the PIC  has not documented its procedures or criteria for conducting these  assessments. Standards for internal control in the federal government  emphasize the importance of documenting procedures, including those  for assessing performance. Without clearly established criteria and  procedures, PIC staff lack a means to: consistently assess  implementation efforts and execution across all goals; bring any  deficiencies, risks, and recommended improvements identified to the  attention of leadership; and ensure consistent application of criteria over  time.", "While these quarterly review memorandums identified one goal as being  at risk of not achieving the planned level of performance, and identified  other instances where progress on goals had been slower than planned,  the memorandums did not consistently outline the strategies that were  being used to improve performance or address identified risks. For  example, the Cybersecurity CAP goal was the one goal specifically  described as being at risk of not achieving the planned level of  performance, both in these memorandums and in the status updates on  Performance.gov. Specifically, the memorandum for the third quarter of  fiscal year 2012 identified the risk of not achieving the planned level of  performance, and outlined seven specific risks facing the goal and the  steps being taken to mitigate them. Similarly, the memorandum for the  second quarter of fiscal year 2013 also acknowledged that some  agencies were at risk of not meeting their Cybersecurity CAP goal  targets. However, in contrast to the earlier memorandums, no information  was included about the specific steps that were being taken to mitigate  these risks, although information on planned and ongoing actions to  improve government-wide implementation was included in the milestones  section of the status update for that quarter on Performance.gov.", "The memorandum for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 also  acknowledged that the pace of progress on the STEM Education and  Closing Skills Gaps goals had been slower than expected. While the  memorandum stated that additional OMB attention was needed to  support implementation and assure sufficient progress, no information on  the specific strategies being employed to improve performance was  mentioned. According to OMB staff, however, these memorandums were  used to inform subsequent conversations with OMB leadership, which  would build on the information presented in the memorandums.", "Furthermore, because the data necessary to track progress for some  goals were unavailable, the Director of OMB would not have been able to  consistently review progress for all CAP goals, or make a determination  about whether some CAP goals were at risk of meeting their planned  levels of performance. This fact was acknowledged in the quarterly review  memorandums for quarters one and two of fiscal year 2013, which  acknowledged that progress on three goals (Entrepreneurship and Small  Business, Job Training, and STEM Education) was difficult to track, and  that additional work was needed on data collection. However, no  information on the specific steps that were being taken to address these  shortcomings was included. A lack of specific information about the steps  being taken to mitigate identified risk areas and improve performance  could hinder the ability of OMB leadership\u2014and others\u2014to adequately  track the status of efforts to address identified deficiencies or risks and to  hold officials accountable for taking necessary actions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CAP Goal Leaders Established Processes to Review Progress, but Their Consistency with Leading Practices and Their Effects on Performance and Collaboration Varied", "paragraphs": ["GPRAMA Requirement for Goal Leader and Agency Involvement in Progress Reviews  As part of the quarterly review process, GPRAMA requires that the Director of OMB review each  priority goal with the appropriate lead government official, and include in these reviews officials  from the agencies, organizations, and program activities that contribute to the achievement of the  goal.", "According to OMB staff, to encourage goal leaders and contributing  agencies to take ownership of efforts to achieve the goals, OMB gave  goal leaders flexibility to use different approaches to engage agency  officials and review progress at the CAP-goal level. While guidance  released by OMB in August 2012 encouraged goal leaders to leverage  existing interagency working groups, committees, and councils in the  management of the goals as much as practicable, it did not include  information on the purpose of reviews, expectations for how reviews  should be conducted to maximize their effectiveness as a tool for  performance management and accountability, or the roles that CAP goal  leaders and agency officials should play in the review process. Again,  standards for internal control in the federal government emphasize the  importance of documenting procedures for reviewing performance against  established goals and objectives.", "This is in contrast to the detailed guidance that OMB released for agency  priority goal and agency strategic objective reviews, which outlined the  specific purposes of the reviews, how frequently they should be  conducted, the roles and responsibilities of agency leaders involved in the  review process, and how the reviews should be conducted. We also  found that this guidance for reviews at the agency level was broadly  consistent with the leading practices for performance reviews that we  previously identified. While no official guidance was published to guide  how reviews involving goal leaders and staff from contributing agencies  could be conducted for the CAP goals, OMB staff said the principles of  the guidance released for agency reviews, which reflected many of the  leading practices, was referenced in conversations with CAP goal leaders  and teams.", "OMB has emphasized that flexibility is needed to ensure that goal leaders  can use review processes that are appropriate given the scope of  interagency efforts, the number of people involved, and the maturity of  existing reporting and review processes. The guidance for agency  reviews gave agencies flexibility to design their performance review  processes in a way that would fit the agency\u2019s mission, leadership  preferences, organizational structure, culture, and existing decision- making processes. In our previous work, we detailed how several federal  agencies had implemented quarterly performance reviews in a manner  consistent with leading practices, but which were also tailored to the  structures, processes, and needs of each agency. In this way, flexible  implementation of review processes is possible within a framework that  encourages the application of leading practices.", "A lack of clear expectations for how progress should be reviewed at the  CAP-goal level resulted in a number of different approaches being used  by goal leaders to engage officials from contributing agencies to review  progress on identified goals and milestones, ranging from regular in- person review meetings led by the CAP goal leader to the review of  written updates provided to the goal leader by officials from contributing  agencies.

The processes used by other CAP goal leaders to  engage agency officials in the review of progress did not reflect the full  range of leading practices.", "Leadership Involvement. Leading practices indicate that leaders should  use frequent and regular progress reviews as a leadership strategy to  drive performance improvement and as an opportunity to hold people  accountable for diagnosing performance problems and identifying  strategies for improvement. The direct and visible engagement of  leadership is vital to the success of such reviews. Leadership involvement  helps ensure that participants take the review process seriously and that  decisions and commitments can be made. The goal leaders managing  the Cybersecurity and Closing Skills Gaps goals, as well as the  BusinessUSA sub-goal, were directly involved in leading in-person  reviews for these goals, and in using them as opportunities to review  progress, identify and address performance problems, and hold agency  officials accountable for progress on identified goals and milestones, as  detailed in table 1.", "Data Collection and Review Meeting Preparation. Leading practices  also indicate that those managing review processes should have the  capacity to collect, analyze, and communicate accurate, useful, and  timely performance data, and should rigorously prepare for reviews to  enable meaningful performance discussions. The collection of current,  reliable data on the status of activities and progress towards goals and  milestones is critical so that those involved can determine whether  performance is improving, identify performance problems, ensure  accountability for fulfilling commitments, and learn from efforts to improve  performance. The ability to assess data to identify key trends and areas  of strong or weak performance, and to communicate this to managers  and staff effectively through materials prepared for reviews, is also  critical. As detailed in table 2, those supporting the Cybersecurity and  Skills Gap goals, and the BusinessUSA sub-goal, instituted processes to  regularly collect and analyze data on progress towards identified goals  and milestones, and to ensure these data would be communicated  through materials prepared for review meetings.", "Participation by Key Officials. Leading practices indicate that key  players involved in efforts to achieve a goal should attend reviews to  facilitate problem solving. This is critical as their participation enables  those involved to break down information silos, and to use the forum  provided by the review to communicate with each other, identify  improvement strategies, and agree on specific next steps. Reviews for  both the Cybersecurity and Closing Skills Gaps CAP goals, and the  BusinessUSA sub-goal, were structured so that relevant agency officials  playing a key role in efforts to carry out the goal were included, as  detailed in table 3.", "Review Follow-Up. Leading practices indicate that participants should  engage in sustained follow-up on issues identified during reviews, which  is critical to ensure the success of the reviews as a performance  improvement tool. Important follow-up activities include identifying and  documenting specific follow-up actions stemming from reviews, those  responsible for each action item, as well as who will be responsible for  monitoring and follow-up. Follow-up actions should also be included as  agenda items for subsequent reviews to hold responsible officials  accountable for addressing issues raised and communicating what was  done. Goal managers for the Cybersecurity and Closing Skills Gap CAP  goals, as well as the BusinessUSA sub-goal, took steps to follow up on  action items identified in these meetings, and to ensure that steps were  taken towards their completion, as detailed in table 4.", "Review Effects. Goal leaders and managers we interviewed said that  these review processes were valuable in driving improved performance,  establishing a greater sense of accountability for progress on the part of  contributors, and in providing a forum for interagency communication and  collaboration. For example, according to DHS staff involved in the  management of the Cybersecurity CAP goal, implementation of Personal  Identity Verification (PIV) requirements across the federal government  had been stagnant for several years prior to the introduction of  cybersecurity as a CAP goal. The review process was used to hold  agencies accountable for improved PIV implementation, which helped  bring an increased focus on the issue and drive recent progress. Since  the reviews were instituted in 2012, DHS has reported improved PIV  adoption in civilian agencies, which has increased from 1.24 percent in  fiscal year 2010, to 7.45 percent in fiscal year 2012, to 19.67 percent in  the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013. According to data from DHS, while  still falling short of the target, this has contributed to the overall increase  in PIV adoption across the federal government\u2014including both civilian  agencies and the Department of Defense\u2014from 57.26 percent in fiscal   DHS  year 2012 to 66.61 percent in fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013.staff also added that agencies generally had not previously collaborated  on cybersecurity issues or worked to identify best practices. According to  DHS staff, the reviews have created an important point of collaboration  between DHS, OMB, National Security Staff, and agencies, and provided  an opportunity to inform agencies of best practices and connect them with  other agencies that are meeting their targets to learn from them.", "Similarly, OPM officials and sub-goal leaders involved in the management  of the Closing Skills Gap CAP goal said that the quarterly review  meetings were a critical means to ensure sub-goal leaders and staff were  demonstrating progress. Having sub-goal leaders report out on progress,  and hear about the progress made in other sub-goal areas, provided  additional pressure for continuous improvement and the need to remain  focused on driving progress towards their goals. Having the goal leader  lead the review was also a way to demonstrate leadership commitment to  the achievement of each sub-goal. According to OPM officials and sub- goal leaders, the review meetings also served as an important forum for  discussing innovative approaches being taken to address skills gaps in  different areas, opportunities for collaboration to address challenges  shared by different sub-goals, and how leaders could leverage the efforts  of other sub-goals to drive progress on their own.", "The BusinessUSA sub-goal leader said that having it as the basis for a  CAP sub-goal elevated the cross cutting nature of the initiative. In  addition to reviewing performance information and the status of  deliverables, discussions at inter-agency Steering Committee meetings  were used to discuss how contributors could work together to meet the  initiative\u2019s performance goals. This communication and coordination led  to connections between agencies and to discussions about how programs  could be working in a more integrated way. For example, these  discussions were used to identify ways that programs could more  effectively integrate program information on the BusinessUSA website to  increase customer satisfaction."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Goal Leaders Did Not Use Review Processes Consistent with the Full Range of Leading Practices for Reviews", "paragraphs": ["We found that the processes used by other CAP goal leaders to engage  agency officials in the review of progress, which are summarized in  appendix IV, did not reflect the full range of leading practices. For  example, the process for reviewing progress on the Job Training CAP  goal involved staff from the PIC collecting updates on recent milestones  from agencies, which were then compiled in the quarterly status update  and reviewed by the goal leader. This approach was used by the goal  leaders for the Broadband and STEM Education CAP goals to review  progress as well. While goal leaders and managers for these goals  indicated that they used the collection and review of information as an  opportunity to communicate with officials from contributing agencies, this  approach contrasts with OMB guidance for reviews of agency priority  goals, which states explicitly that performance reviews should not be  conducted solely through the sharing of written communications. As OMB  noted in its guidance, in-person engagement of leaders in performance  reviews greatly accelerates learning and performance improvement, and  personal engagement can demonstrate commitment to improvement,  ensure coordination across agency silos, and enable rapid decision  making.", "While not employing the full range, goal leaders for a number of goals did  use processes that reflected one or more leading practices. For example,  many CAP goal leaders led or participated in interagency meetings with  representatives of contributing agencies. While these were used to  facilitate interagency communication and collaboration on the  development of plans and policies, it was unclear whether many of these  meetings were consistently used to review progress on identified CAP  goals and milestones. The goal leader for the Strategic Sourcing CAP  goal used processes that reflected leadership involvement, participation  by key officials, and the collection and analysis of relevant data.  Specifically, according to goal managers, the goal leader led regular  meetings of the Strategic Sourcing Leadership Council (SSLC), which  were attended by senior procurement officials from eight agencies that  combine to make up almost all of the federal government\u2019s total  procurement spending.", "To prepare for each SSLC meeting, staff from OMB\u2019s Office of Federal  Procurement Policy (OFPP) held a meeting for supporting staff from each  agency, who would then prepare the SSLC member from their agency for  the issues to be discussed in the SSLC meeting. OFPP also established  a regular data collection process where each agency would report on its  adoption and spending rates for two strategic sourcing options, which  would then be used for the purposes of reporting on the CAP goal.  However, it was unclear how regularly, if at all, SSLC meetings were used  to engage agency officials in the review of data on agency adoption of,  and spending on, strategic sourcing options, or how regularly meetings  were used to review progress that was being made towards the CAP  goal. It was also unclear what mechanisms, if any, were used to ensure  rigorous follow-up on issues raised in these meetings, a key leading  practice, as there were no official meeting minutes maintained. The lack  of an official record could hinder follow-up and accountability for any  identified actions that need to be taken."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Goal Leaders Reported Minimal Effects on Performance and Collaboration", "paragraphs": ["Representatives of some goals stated that it was difficult to isolate the  impact of the CAP goal designation, and its associated reporting and  review requirements, on performance and collaboration. According to  some goal managers, because their interim goals were based on  initiatives that had been previously established in executive orders or  Presidential memorandums, much of the interagency activity supporting  their efforts would have happened without the CAP goal designation and  its reporting and review requirements. For example, a manager for the  Data Center Consolidation CAP goal told us that the previously  established Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative was used to  drive progress and that the CAP goal designation and quarterly reporting  and review requirements had little impact. Similarly, Job Training CAP  goal managers said that interagency collaboration on job training issues  had been established prior to the creation of the CAP goal, that the goal\u2019s  reporting and review requirements were incidental to the contributors\u2019  ongoing work, and that it did not add an additional level of accountability  for the completion of job training initiatives. However, this is a goal where  no data were reported to demonstrate its impact on federal job training  programs, and which was identified in multiple OMB reviews as having  slower than anticipated progress due, in part, to extended periods of time  in which there was no deputy CAP goal leader to provide support  necessary to improve coordination and collaboration.", "While many CAP goal leaders and staff we interviewed noted the  progress they had made with their existing interagency meetings and  approaches, a lack of clear expectations or guidance for how review  processes at the CAP goal level should be carried out can lead to a  situation where reviews are implemented in a manner that is not informed  by, or fully consistent with, leading practices. This could result in missed  opportunities to realize the positive effects on performance and  accountability that can stem from the implementation of review processes  that regularly and consistently involve leaders and agency officials in the  analysis of performance data to identify and address performance  deficiencies, and use rigorous follow-up to ensure accountability for  commitments."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Many of the meaningful results that the federal government seeks to  achieve require the coordinated efforts of more than one federal agency.  GPRAMA\u2019s requirement that OMB establish CAP goals offers a unique  opportunity to coordinate cross-agency efforts to drive progress in priority  areas.

The reporting and review requirements for the CAP goals, and  leading practices for the reviews, are designed to ensure that relevant  performance information is used to improve performance and results, and  that OMB and goal leaders actively lead efforts to engage all relevant  participants in collaborative performance improvement initiatives and hold  them accountable for progress on identified goals and milestones.", "OMB reported performance information in the quarterly CAP goal status  updates it published on Performance.gov. While updates for most goals  reported data on performance towards the identified planned level of  performance, the information in the updates did not always present a  complete picture of progress towards identified goals and milestones.

Updates for the other 6 of the 14 goals  did not report on performance towards the goal\u2019s primary performance  target because the goal was established without a quantitative target or  because goal managers were unable to collect the data needed to track  performance. In other cases, planned activities that were identified as  contributing to the goal were sometimes missing important elements,  including alignment with the strategies for goal achievement they  supported, a time frame for completion, or information on their  implementation status. The incomplete picture of progress that many of  the updates gave limited the ability of goal leaders and others to ensure  accountability for the achievement of targets and milestones.", "Holding regular progress reviews that are consistent with GPRAMA  requirements and the full range of leading practices can produce positive  effects on performance and collaboration. Engaging contributors in  regular reviews of data on performance can help ensure interagency  efforts are informed by information on progress towards identified goals  and milestones, which can be used to identify and address areas where  goal or milestone achievement is at risk. Reviews can also be used to  reinforce agency and collective accountability for the achievement of  individual and shared outcomes, helping to ensure that efforts to improve  performance or address identified risks are implemented. Lastly, reviews  can be used to foster greater collaboration, ensuring opportunities for  communication and coordination between officials involved in efforts to  achieve shared outcomes. While OMB and CAP goal leaders instituted  processes for reviewing progress on the interim CAP goals, if GPRAMA  requirements and leading practices for reviews are not consistently  followed, it may result in missed opportunities to improve performance,  hold officials accountable for achieving identified goals and milestones,  and ensure agency officials are coordinating their activities in a way that  is directed towards the achievement of shared goals and milestones."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Director of OMB take the following three actions:  Include the following in the quarterly reviews of CAP goal progress, as  required by GPRAMA: a consistent set of information on progress  made during the most recent quarter, overall trends, and the likelihood  of meeting the planned level of performance; goals at risk of not  achieving the planned level of performance; and the strategies being  employed to improve performance.", "Work with the PIC to establish and document procedures and criteria  to assess CAP goal implementation efforts and the status of goal  execution, to ensure that the PIC can conduct these assessments  consistently across all goals and over time.", "Develop guidance similar to what exists for agency priority goal and  strategic objective reviews, outlining the purposes of CAP goal  progress reviews, expectations for how the reviews should be carried  out, and the roles and responsibilities of CAP goal leaders, agency  officials, and OMB and PIC staff in the review process.", "To ensure that OMB and CAP goal leaders include all key contributors  and can track and report fully on progress being made towards CAP  goals overall and each quarter, we recommend that the Director of OMB  direct CAP goal leaders to take the following four actions:  Identify all key contributors to the achievement of their goals;  Identify annual planned levels of performance and quarterly targets for  each CAP goal;", "Develop plans to identify, collect, and report data necessary to  demonstrate progress being made towards each CAP goal or develop  an alternative approach for tracking and reporting on progress  quarterly; and", "Report the time frames for the completion of milestones; the status of  milestones; and how milestones are aligned with strategies or  initiatives that support the achievement of the goal."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report for review and comment to the Director  of OMB, the Secretaries of Commerce and Homeland Security, the  Director of the Office of Personnel Management, the Administrator of the  Small Business Administration, as well as the officials we interviewed to  collect information on the interim CAP goals from the Council on  Environmental Quality, Department of Education, Department of Labor,  Department of Veterans Affairs, National Science Foundation, and the  Office of Science and Technology Policy.

According to OMB staff, during these  reviews participants reviewed metrics from across the agency\u2019s information  technology portfolio, which included, in some cases, those related to data center  consolidation.  Each quarter staff supporting the goal leader would collect updated information on  contributing agency priority goals for the purposes of updating the quarterly status  update.  Each quarter the deputy goal leader would collect updated information on goals and  milestones from the leaders of each of 10 sub-goals for the purposes of developing  the quarterly status update.  The deputy goal leader would follow-up with sub-goal leaders or agency officials, as  necessary, to address issues or questions about the status of efforts. The goal leader  would then review and approve the quarterly status update.  Some sub-goal leaders would hold in-person meetings with officials from contributing  agencies to, among other things, review progress on identified goals and milestones.  See appendix III for information on interagency groups that were used to manage  efforts for four of the sub-goals.  Each quarter the goal leader, with the assistance of staff from Commerce and the  PIC, would collect updated information on relevant agency metrics and activities for  the purposes of updating the quarterly status update.  Periodic meetings of the Export Promotion Cabinet/Trade Promotion Coordinating  Committee, and its Small Business and other working groups, were also used to  discuss the status of export promotion efforts and progress on specific deliverables.  Each year OMB would collect and report data on agency improper payment rates.  Staff from the OMB Office of Federal Financial Management led monthly meetings  with agency representatives to discuss the implementation of the Do Not Pay  initiative, which was designed to contribute to the reduction of improper payments.

After this goal was revised in the second quarter of 2013, a new review process to  track agency adherence to the goal was under development by OMB.  Twice a year the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) would collect and review  quantitative and qualitative data on agency progress towards established  sustainability goals, including the reduction of agency greenhouse gas emissions.  Following the collection of these data, the goal leader hosted meetings of the  Steering Committee on Federal Sustainability, which were used to discuss federal  sustainability policy and progress on sustainability goals.  According to CEQ staff, the goal leader and CEQ staff would meet with  representatives from agencies about sustainability issues on an ad hoc basis. In  instances where there was a gap between an agency\u2019s actual performance and the  target established in that area, the goal leader, or other staff from CEQ, would meet  with officials from that agency to discuss ways to address the performance gap.   Each quarter the goal leader would collect updated information on agency milestones  for inclusion in the quarterly status updates.  Progress on some identified strategies to achieve the goal, such as the National  Science Foundation\u2019s efforts to improve undergraduate STEM education, were  reviewed at the agency level. After progress was reviewed at the agency level the  information was passed onto the goal leader and reported publicly in the quarterly  status update.  Each quarter the General Services Administration would collect data on agency  adoption and spending rates for the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI)  solutions for domestic delivery and office supplies.  The Strategic Sourcing Leadership Council met bi-monthly to guide the creation and  adoption of new FSSI options, and, as part of that effort, might review quarterly data  on agency adoption and spending rates.
