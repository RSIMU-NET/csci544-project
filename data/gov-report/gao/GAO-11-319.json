Among other things, OPA established the Interagency Coordinating Committee on Oil Pollution Research (interagency committee) to coordinate an oil pollution research program among federal agencies, including developing a plan, having the National Academy of Sciences review that plan, and reporting to Congress on the interagency committee's efforts biennially. The 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion and fire led to the largest oil spill in U.S. history, raising new concerns about the effects of oil spills. GAO was asked to assess the extent to which the interagency committee has facilitated the coordination of federal agencies' oil pollution research. (The Chairman, Subcommittee on Energy and Environment, House Committee on Science and Technology, now retired; and Representative Woolsey initiated this request.) In part, GAO analyzed committee documents and biennial reports and interviewed agency officials and nonfederal research entities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies have conducted at least 144 research projects on oil pollution since 2003, but the interagency committee has played a limited role in coordinating this research, according to GAO's analysis of interagency committee reports and documents. For example, agencies conducted research on identifying the toxicity of nonpetroleum oils recovering oil from the sea floor. The interagency committee issued a research plan mandated by OPA in 1997 that set research priorities. This plan, however, did not fully address the recommendations on a draft plan made by the National Research Council, the organization through which the National Academy of Sciences provides most of its advice. For example, the National Research Council noted that the interagency committee should review and evaluate past and present oil pollution research to help guide federal efforts and to avoid duplication. The interagency committee has captured some member agencies' oil pollution research in its biennial reports to Congress, but it has not evaluated whether past research has advanced the 1997 research priorities; instead, the reports summarized projects. Without such an assessment, Congress may be less able to oversee the contributions of federal research to preventing and responding to oil spills. In addition, although OPA did not require that the interagency committee revise its 1997 plan, the National Research Council noted the need to continually reassess a comprehensive research plan. However, the interagency committee has not done so; consequently, the plan does not reflect changes in the oil production and transportation sectors since 1997, such as a significant increase in deepwater drilling. In September 2010, the interagency committee chair began to inventory completed research and categorize research projects according to the 1997 plan's research priorities, and the chair told GAO that the interagency committee will begin to update the 1997 plan in 2011. OPA also directed the interagency committee to coordinate a comprehensive research program of oil pollution research among the member agencies, in cooperation with external stakeholders, such as industry, research institutions, state governments, and universities. An interagency member official told GAO that the committee helped foster interagency cooperation between two agencies comparing two types of testing to determine the effectiveness of certain chemicals in dispersing oil in sea water; However, more generally, the interagency committee took limited action to foster communication among member agencies between 1997 and 2009, when the chair proposed updating the 1997 plan, according to some member agency officials. Although the interagency committee's meetings have occurred once or twice annually for the past 2 years, they occurred irregularly before then. Additionally, member agencies were not consistently represented in the interagency committee. In October 2010, to better communicate with interagency committee member agencies, among others, the interagency committee launched a Web site, which provides transcripts from its past public meetings and biennial reports to Congress."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends, among other things, that the interagency committee coordinate efforts to evaluate the contributions of completed research and provide, in its 2012 biennial report to Congress, an update of its efforts to revise its research plan.

OPA also established  the Interagency Coordinating Committee on Oil Pollution Research (the  interagency committee) to coordinate a comprehensive program of oil  pollution research, technology, development, and demonstration among  federal agencies. OPA, as amended, requires the U.S. Coast Guard to chair  the 13-member interagency committee. In addition, the chair is required to  report every 2 years to Congress on the committee\u2019s past activities and  future plans for oil pollution research. OPA also directed the interagency  committee to develop a comprehensive research and technology plan to  lead federal oil pollution research. In response to this directive, the  interagency committee issued a plan in 1997 to guide research on oil  pollution prevention and response.

Federal agencies have conducted at  least 144 research projects related to this issue, but the interagency  committee, established to develop a comprehensive research and  development program on oil spill prevention and response, has been  incomplete in its accounting for research projects and has done little until  recently to coordinate the federal research effort.", "The chair of the interagency committee has recognized the need for a  proactive approach to coordination, and the committee\u2019s recent effort to  inventory member agencies\u2019 research projects is a necessary step to  understanding past research. However, this effort will be incomplete  without an evaluation of whether this research addressed knowledge gaps  identified in the 1997 plan. Without such an evaluation, Congress may be  unable to provide effective oversight on the progress made in federal  efforts to conduct research on oil pollution prevention and response.  Furthermore, Coast Guard officials expect the drafting of a revised  research plan to begin during summer 2011, but the revision of the plan  has already been delayed because of the Deepwater Horizon incident, and  the interagency committee could take several years to complete the  planned revision, as it did in the 1990s with the 1997 research plan.  Moreover, in the past, the interagency committee has not reached out  effectively to identify and consult with key nonfederal stakeholders who  could provide insight into the research that may need to be conducted, as  it was directed to do by OPA. Without such outreach, the committee may  be missing opportunities to advance knowledge across sectors and to  avoid duplication of research efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to better identify oil pollution risks, determine research priorities,  and coordinate research efforts, we recommend that the Commandant of  the U.S. Coast Guard direct the chair of the interagency committee to take  the following three actions, in coordination with member agencies:    Evaluate the contributions of past research to current knowledge on oil  pollution prevention and response and report the results of these  evaluations, including remaining gaps in knowledge, in its biennial reports  to Congress.", "Provide a status update regarding the revision of the research plan, as well  as a schedule for completing the revision, in the next biennial report due  in 2012, which will cover 2010 and 2011.", "Establish a more systematic process to identify and consult with key  nonfederal stakeholders on oil pollution risks and research needs on an  ongoing basis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided the departments of Commerce, Defense, Energy, Homeland  Security, the Interior, and Transportation; EPA; and NASA with a draft of  this report for review and comment.

We interviewed  cognizant agency officials on the extent of coordination among committee  member agencies and, in September 2010, we attended a public meeting of  the interagency committee to observe efforts to coordinate oil pollution  research. We also interviewed external stakeholders, including officials  from California, Louisiana, and Texas, and the Oil Spill Recovery Institute,  a nonprofit research organization. We selected these organizations  because all were listed in the interagency committee\u2019s research plan as  stakeholders. The findings from the officials we interviewed, however,  cannot be generalized to other states or organizations. We also reviewed  and analyzed interagency committee documentation to assess efforts to  evaluate research projects and determine progress made toward  completing research goals. We reviewed committee documentation and  interviewed cognizant agency officials about any current and emerging oil  pollution risks, as well as how they were identified.", "To determine the number of research projects conducted by member  agencies, we reviewed the interagency committee\u2019s biennial reports to  Congress. While we intended to count the number of projects conducted  since completion of the 1997 research plan, we could not count projects  for fiscal years (1) 1997 and 1998 because the biennial report that includes  those years did not include any research projects initiated after  completion of the research plan; (2) 1999 and 2000 because the  interagency committee was not required to report on its progress for those  two years in accordance with the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset  Act of 1995, and did not do so; and (3) 2000, 2001, and 2002 because the  interagency committee\u2019s biennial reports included publications and not  projects. Also, we could not confirm whether individual publications  corresponded to a single project. Because of concerns about the  availability and reliability of data, we were not able to identify all research  projects completed during those years; however, we believe we captured  the majority of the projects with our methodology because we were able  to interview program officials from each member agency that conducted  oil pollution research and confirm our approach and our list of projects  with them.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2010 to March 2011 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
