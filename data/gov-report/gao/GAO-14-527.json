As the figure shows, Coast Guard resources included vessels (cutters), aircraft, and law enforcement detachments. The number of cutter days, aircraft hours, and law enforcement detachment days the Coast Guard provided for drug interdiction operations in the transit zone varied during fiscal years 2009 through 2012, and then sharply declined in fiscal year 2013. For example, in fiscal year 2012, the Coast Guard provided 1,947 cutter days for transit zone operations and in fiscal year 2013 the Coast Guard provided 1,346 days\u2014a 30 percent decline. During fiscal years 2009 through 2013, the Coast Guard met targets for its primary drug interdiction mission performance measure\u2014the removal rate of cocaine from noncommercial vessels in the transit zone\u2014once, in fiscal year 2013.

According to Coast Guard officials, these additional resources are drawn from other missions, such as alien migrant interdiction. Beginning in September 2012, the Coast Guard implemented a surge operation to provide additional vessels and aircraft to regularly patrol Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. According to Coast Guard officials, the increased vessel and aircraft deployments have since become the new baseline level of resources to be provided for drug interdiction operations there. According to Coast Guard data, the number of vessel hours spent conducting drug interdiction operations in these territories more than tripled from fiscal years 2009 through 2013. Similarly, the number of maritime patrol aircraft hours spent conducting drug interdiction operations in the territories increased\u2014from about 150 flight hours in fiscal year 2011 to about 1,000 hours in fiscal year 2013."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making recommendations in this report.

To reduce the  supply of illicit drugs flowing into and through the territories and to  address the growing violence, officials from the territories have sought  increased assistance from federal agencies. The Coast Guard, in  particular, has been tasked by DHS to increase vessel and aircraft  deployments for drug interdiction operations in the area. However, the  Coast Guard faces the challenge of balancing increasing drug interdiction  resource demands for its limited vessels and aircraft in Puerto Rico and  the U.S. Virgin Islands with demands for those it deploys across the  transit zone, while also meeting resource requirements for its other  missions, such as Alien Migrant Interdiction and Search and Rescue.", "You asked us to review the Coast Guard\u2019s drug interdiction resource  allocation and mission performance in the transit zone and in Puerto Rico  and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

We reviewed Coast Guard-provided data on deployments of resources to  JIATF-S during fiscal years 2009 through 2013, which included vessel  and aircraft hours provided for the drug interdiction mission and resource  deployment targets. We also reviewed and analyzed Coast Guard drug  interdiction mission performance data for fiscal years 2009 through 2013  and compared the performance data against mission performance  targets. In addition, we interviewed Coast Guard officials at Coast Guard  headquarters and at field units that are responsible for planning and  conducting drug interdiction operations and tracking deployment and  mission performance. Specifically, we met with officials from the Coast  Guard\u2019s Atlantic and Pacific Area Commands, and the Coast Guard\u2019s  Seventh District (Miami, Florida) and Eleventh District (Alameda,  California). We met with officials from these two districts because these  two districts are the only Coast Guard districts that have operational roles  for drug interdiction and apprehension in the transit zone\u2014with the  Seventh District responsible for Caribbean Sea operations and the  Eleventh District responsible for eastern Pacific Ocean operations.

One part of the ONDCP strategy to disrupt the illicit drug  market focuses interdiction efforts on seizing cocaine and other illicit  drugs in the transit zone that are bound for the United States (arrival  zone) from South America (source zone). Virtually all of the cocaine  shipped to the United States travels through the transit zone from South  America\u2014entering Central America, Mexico, and the Caribbean en route  to the United States. The transit zone is a 6 million square mile area that  encompasses Central America, Mexico, the eastern Pacific Ocean, the  Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea. The transit zone is divided into  four maritime trafficking routes: Eastern Pacific, Western Caribbean,  Central Caribbean, and Eastern Caribbean. Drug traffickers use go-fast  boats, fishing vessels, submersible vessels, noncommercial aircraft, and  other types of conveyances to smuggle cocaine from the source zone to  Central America, Mexico, and the Caribbean en route to the United  States.", "ONDCP\u2019s strategy for drug interdiction in the transit zone is focused on  cocaine because ONDCP has identified cocaine as a leading drug threat  to the United States. According to Coast Guard officials, the largest  estimated share of cocaine has been smuggled through the Eastern  Pacific and Western Caribbean routes of the transit zone for nearly two  decades. For example, the principal source of information about cocaine  flow in the transit zone is the CCDB. According to the CCDB, in fiscal  year 2013, approximately 84 percent of the estimated cocaine flow, as  measured in metric tons, was by noncommercial maritime means through  these two routes. Figure 1 shows a map indicating the source, transit, and  arrival zones\u2014with the fiscal year 2013 estimated noncommercial  maritime cocaine flow through the four smuggling routes and the locations  of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands within the transit zone.", "As the southernmost points of entry into the United States and the only  U.S. territories within the transit zone, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin  Islands are key entry points for illicit drugs being smuggled into the United  States. Like the continental United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S.  Virgin Islands are considered part of the arrival zone, yet they are located  geographically within the Eastern Caribbean route of the transit zone.  According to a 2011 Department of Justice National Drug Intelligence  Center report, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are attractive  targets for illicit drug smuggling because of their proximity to the source  zone and Puerto Rico\u2019s location within the United States\u2019 Customs  zone. According to Coast Guard officials, the illicit drug flow through the  Central and Eastern Caribbean routes generally consists of maritime  smuggling from South America to the Dominican Republic and eventual  transshipment to Puerto Rico (secondary flow) and, to a lesser extent,  maritime smuggling directly from South America to Puerto Rico and the  U.S. Virgin Islands (primary flow). CCDB drug flow estimates show that in  fiscal year 2013, about 3 percent of the cocaine flow in the transit zone  was smuggled toward Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The  Department of Justice has reported that most of this flow is destined for  the continental United States\u2014with the rest remaining on the islands for  local consumption. However, estimates indicate that illicit cocaine  smuggling toward Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands has increased  each year since fiscal year 2009. For example, according to CCDB  estimates, cocaine flow toward Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands  has more than doubled in recent years, from 6.4 metric tons in fiscal year  2009 to 17.3 metric tons in fiscal year 2013.", "Federal and local government officials in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin  Islands have raised concerns about the illicit drug flow and have identified  it as a key contributor to the high levels of murder and other violent crime  on the islands. In particular, homicide rates in the two territories have  risen in recent years, and federal and local officials have linked the rise of  the homicide rates, in part, to illicit cocaine trafficking on the Island.  According to a 2014 study by the United Nations Office on Drugs and  Crime, the 2010 homicide rate in Puerto Rico was about 27 per 100,000  persons and in the U.S. Virgin Islands it was about 53 per 100,000  persons\u2014more than 5 times (Puerto Rico) and 11 times (U.S. Virgin  Islands) the U.S. national rate.

Coast Guard officials reported that this places  a premium on the need for good intelligence on potential drug-smuggling  vessels and the effective placement of assets to interdict them.", "According to Coast Guard officials, the Coast Guard\u2019s decision to provide  additional resources to Sector San Juan resulted from Coast Guard  analyses that found Sector San Juan lacked sufficient vessels and aircraft  to reduce maritime drug smuggling into Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin  Islands. For example, according to an August 2012 Coast Guard  memorandum, Sector San Juan\u2019s fleet of vessels faced readiness  concerns and lacked the capability to effectively conduct operations  against the primary drug flow of go-fast boats smuggling illicit drugs from  South America into Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Further, the  memorandum notes that the Coast Guard did not have maritime patrol  aircraft permanently assigned to the territories. According to the  memorandum, the only permanently assigned Coast Guard aircraft in  Puerto Rico were helicopters based in the northwest corner of the island  and their endurance and position made them impractical for patrolling the  eastern approaches to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.", "Coast Guard officials reported that the Coast Guard has not received  additional resources to support Operation Unified Resolve. Rather, to  implement the operation, the Coast Guard reported that it supplemented  its annual allocation of vessels and aircraft to Sector San Juan by  reallocating medium endurance cutters and maritime patrol aircraft to  Puerto Rico from other locations within the Coast Guard\u2014largely from the  Coast Guard\u2019s Seventh District. According to Coast Guard officials,  these vessels and aircraft, in general, had previously been allocated for  alien migrant interdiction operations. As noted earlier and as further  described in appendix I, the Coast Guard\u2019s process for allocating drug  interdiction resources is focused on meeting commitments for strategic  priorities, such as JIATF-S transit zone operations, first, before dividing  up its remaining resources among its field locations such as Sector San  Juan. In this way, the Coast Guard reported that the additional resources  provided for Operation Unified Resolve did not come at the expense of its  JIATF-S deployments.", "Beyond Operation Unified Resolve, the Coast Guard is scheduled to  modernize Sector San Juan\u2019s vessel fleet. According to Coast Guard  officials, during fiscal years 2015 and 2016, the Coast Guard plans to  replace Sector San Juan\u2019s six 110-foot patrol boats with six new 154-foot  fast response cutters (FRC). According to Coast Guard officials, the  FRCs\u2019 impact on the drug interdiction mission will be significant, as the  FRC is expected to provide (1) increased interdiction capabilities; (2)  improved sea keeping; (3) greater endurance; (4) the ability to deploy a  pursuit-capable small boat; (5) improved weapons systems; and (6)  improved command, control, and communications systems. Coast Guard  officials reported that Sector San Juan would accommodate a mix of the  new FRCs and 110-foot patrol boats until the 110-foot patrol boats are  phased out by the end of fiscal year 2016. According to senior officials  from Sector San Juan, the additional resources Sector San Juan is  utilizing for Operation Unified Resolve, along with the scheduled arrival of  the six FRCs by the end of 2016, will put Sector San Juan in a better  position to meet its mission needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Coast Guard Has Deployed More Resources for Drug Interdiction in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands in Recent Years Vessel Deployments Have Increased", "paragraphs": ["According to Coast Guard data, the total amount of vessel hours in  support of drug interdiction operations in the Sector San Juan area of  responsibility more than tripled in recent years\u2014from 2,051 hours in fiscal  year 2009 to 6,839 hours in fiscal year 2013. According to the data,  much of the increase in vessel drug interdiction operational hours  occurred from fiscal years 2012 through 2013, when the Coast Guard  was implementing Operation Unified Resolve. Coast Guard data show  that medium endurance cutters accounted for a rising share of the drug  interdiction vessel operational hours, increasing from 3 percent in fiscal  year 2011 to 28 percent in fiscal year 2013. In fiscal year 2013, drug  interdiction operations accounted for 40 percent of reported medium  endurance cutter and patrol boat hours in the Sector San Juan area of  responsibility.operational hours in support of the drug interdiction mission has risen  since 2009 in response to increased drug-smuggling events and the  additional resources provided for Operation Unified Resolve beginning in  late fiscal year 2012.", "According to Coast Guard officials, the number of vessel  Figure 8 shows the total vessel hours (major cutter and patrol boat hours)  the Coast Guard reported for conducting drug interdiction operations in  the Sector San Juan area of responsibility during fiscal years 2009  through 2013, as well as, the relative share of the vessel hours provided  by Sector San Juan and other Coast Guard locations.", "According to Coast Guard data, maritime patrol aircraft resource hours  reported for drug interdiction operations in the Sector San Juan area of  responsibility declined during fiscal years 2009 through 2011, before  increasing considerably in fiscal years 2012 and 2013. For example, in  fiscal year 2011, the Coast Guard reported conducting 148 flight hours  patrolling Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and this number more  than tripled to 502 hours in fiscal year 2012 before doubling to 1,000  hours in fiscal year 2013. The Coast Guard attributes this considerable  increase of flight hours in recent years to increased aircraft provided in  support of Operation Unified Resolve. Since implementing Operation  Unified Resolve in September 2012, the Coast Guard has conducted  surveillance patrols of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands using  maritime patrol aircraft and crews forward deployed from Coast Guard  field locations in the continental United States.

According to Coast Guard officials, as of March  25, 2014, Operation Unified Resolve had led to the removal of 32,669  kilograms of cocaine and roughly 11,000 pounds of marijuana. Further,  Coast Guard officials reported that since deploying additional vessels and  aircraft for Operation Unified Resolve in September 2012, the Coast  Guard found the estimated primary flow of cocaine into Puerto Rico to be  considerably higher than previously thought. For example, according to  CCDB data provided by the Coast Guard, the estimated noncommercial  maritime primary flow of cocaine toward Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin  Islands more than doubled, from 7.1 metric tons in fiscal year 2012 to  14.9 metric tons in fiscal year 2013.and secondary noncommercial maritime drug flow toward Puerto Rico  and the U.S. Virgin Islands during fiscal years 2009 through 2013."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We are not making recommendations in this report.

The Coast Guard\u2019s process for allocating drug interdiction  resources is focused on meeting commitments for strategic priorities,  including for the Joint Interagency Task Force South (JIATF-S)\u2014a  reporting unit of the Department of Defense\u2019s Southern Command that  oversees detection and monitoring operations of drug-smuggling events  in the transit zone. The Coast Guard allocates drug interdiction resources  for these strategic priorities, first, before dividing up its remaining  resources among its Atlantic and Pacific Area Commands for further  allocation to Coast Guard districts and sectors across the United States.  The Coast Guard determines the targets for the amount of time selected  vessels, aircraft, and law enforcement detachments (LEDET) are  provided to JIATF-S for transit zone operations\u2014through an annual  operational planning process that considers factors including resource  requirements for strategic priorities, evolving maritime risks, and the  availability of vessels and aircraft. Through this process, the Coast Guard  reviews JIATF-S resource requests and sets resource targets.

These  requirements specify the capabilities (types of vessels or aircraft) and  corresponding capacities (number of days for vessels or resource  hours for aircraft). The DHS Office of Policy\u2019s Counter Illicit Trafficking  Section communicates the resource requests to the Coast Guard with  resource hour requests for Coast Guard cutters, boats, aircraft, and  LEDETs.", "Second, Coast Guard planners determine the amount of resources  that the Coast Guard intends to provide in the upcoming fiscal year.  The Coast Guard considers its support for JIATF-S drug interdiction  operations as one of three strategic commitment priorities. In this way, Coast Guard planners determine the number of vessel days and  aircraft hours to provide to JIATF-S before allocating remaining  vessels and aircraft to its field locations across the United States for  other missions (as described in more detail below). The Coast Guard  determines its JIATF-S resource targets based on various factors,  including strategic priority and resource availability.", "Third, the Coast Guard provides its JIATF-S resource target\u2014or  Statement of Intent\u2014to the DHS Office of Counter Illicit Trafficking,  which liaises with JIATF-S and the Office of National Drug Control  Policy (ONDCP). The Statement of Intent details target levels of  resources the Coast Guard intends to provide to JIATF-S for the next  fiscal year. The Statement of Intent outlines asset availability level  targets for major cutters, maritime patrol aircraft, and other resources,  such as deployable forces. DHS then combines the Coast Guard  Statement of Intent with those of Customs and Border Protection  (CBP) and submits an overall DHS Statement of Intent to ONDCP and  JIATF-S.", "Fourth, after allocating resources for JIATF-S and other strategic  commitments, the Coast Guard divides its remaining resource hours  for vessels and aircraft between its Pacific and Atlantic Area  Commands. Coast Guard officials reported that the Coast Guard\u2019s  field units use a greater variety of vessels for coastal drug interdiction  operations than provided to JIATF-S. These generally include the  110-foot patrol boats in addition to a variety of smaller boats. For  example, whereas the Coast Guard generally provides major cutters  to JIATF-S, field units rely on a greater variety of smaller vessels to  conduct coastal drug interdiction operations because the missions are  conducted much closer to shore than are JIATF-S operations.", "Outside of JIATF-S, the Coast Guard\u2019s Seventh District (headquartered in  Miami, Florida, and having responsibility for the Caribbean area including  Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and Eleventh District  (headquartered in Alameda, California, and having responsibility for the  Eastern Pacific area, including coastal areas from the U.S.-Mexico border  to South America) have accounted for the largest shares of the Coast  Guard\u2019s drug interdiction resource hours. According to Coast Guard  officials, these districts\u2019 areas of responsibility include high drug-trafficking  areas, and therefore drug interdiction accounts for a larger mission focus  than at other Coast Guard districts.", "From fiscal years 2009 through 2013, the Coast Guard\u2019s budget included  about $1.2 billion per year for its drug interdiction mission.
