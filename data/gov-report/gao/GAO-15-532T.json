The panel concluded that the lack of a stable, executable plan for modernization is a fundamental weakness for NNSA. Similarly, GAO found in 2013 that the Stockpile Stewardship Management Plan has shown changes in long-term budget and schedule estimates from year to year\u2014for example, NNSA's stockpile budget estimates for 2014 through 2031 increased by about $27 billion compared with the 2012 stockpile budget estimates for the same time period.

NNSA agreed and appears to be implementing this recommendation.", "As noted in GAO's 2015 high risk report, NNSA has a long history of identifying corrective actions and declaring them successfully resolved, only to follow with the identification of additional actions. As GAO has reported, this suggests that NNSA does not have a full understanding of the root causes of its contract and project management challenges. In its prior reports, GAO has made numerous recommendations to correct NNSA's project management problems. While NNSA has initiated some actions and made some progress, the agency has not taken action on many of these recommendations, including improving cost estimating capabilities and employing a rigorous analysis of alternatives to ensure that key capital asset and program decisions will both meet mission needs and be cost-effective. This suggests a lack of urgency or commitment on DOE's part to address identified challenges.", "NNSA's Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation (DNN) programs have made progress securing vulnerable nuclear materials, but significant challenges remain. For example, GAO found in 2011 that NNSA faced challenges accounting for and ensuring the security of U.S. weapons-usable nuclear materials. GAO recommended that NNSA improve its process for securing these materials. Although NNSA disagreed, it has since taken some steps to prioritize its efforts. In addition, prior GAO work has raised concerns about the effectiveness of DNN program management and implementation, particularly with regard to execution of its plutonium disposition program, performance measures, and sustainability.", "NNSA faces challenges in its governance of the nuclear security enterprise. The Augustine-Mies Panel highlighted such challenges in its report. The report addresses issues and concerns that GAO has also previously described in its work. For example, consistent with GAO's 2015 update to its high risk list, the Panel noted that NNSA major projects have been a continuing source of program schedule delays and cost overruns and that, as a result, NNSA needs to strengthen its cost estimating capabilities. The report also recommended that NNSA leadership employ a rigorous analysis of alternatives early in the decision process as the basis for assessing and validating program requirements, which is consistent with past GAO recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss our recent work on some of the  pressing management challenges the National Nuclear Security  Administration (NNSA) is facing.

NNSA sites include laboratories,  production plants, and a test site, which are owned by the U.S.  government but managed and operated by contractors. According to  NNSA documents, NNSA\u2019s funding has increased steadily from $9.6  billion in fiscal year 2009 to $11.4 billion in fiscal year 2015\u2014 approximately 42 percent of the Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) total fiscal  year 2015 budget\u2014to support its mission and related activities.", "Since the end of the cold war, key portions of the nuclear security  enterprise\u2019s weapons production infrastructure have aged and become  outdated, prompting congressional and executive branch decision makers  to call on DOE to develop plans to modernize the infrastructure.

To  meet these goals, NNSA refurbishes weapons in the stockpile to extend  their operational lives; replaces or renovates research, development, and  production facilities that date back to the 1940s and 1950s; and performs  simulations and laboratory experiments to ensure existing nuclear  weapons remain safe and reliable. In fiscal year 2011, the administration  pledged over $88 billion to NNSA over 10 years for operations and  modernization, including the refurbishment of weapons in the current  stockpile and construction of facilities to support these refurbishments.", "Building from the policy priorities communicated in the Nuclear Posture  Review, NNSA\u2019s Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan (SSMP),  which is updated annually, provides information on modernization and  operations plans and budget estimates over the next 25 years.

Our 2013 report similarly found that NNSA\u2019s SSMP has shown  changes in plans and long-term budget estimates from year to year and  that some assumptions on future spending estimates may not be realistic.  For example, in 2013 we found that:", "The planned schedules for key weapons LEPs had changed. For  example, key dates for the W78/88 LEP were pushed several years  into the future. Specifically, this program shifted from a 2021 first- production-unit and 2031 completion time frame in the fiscal year  2012 SSMP to a 2025 first-production-unit and 2036 completion time  frame in the fiscal year 2014 SSMP.

We noted that some of  these changes were due to decisions made by the Nuclear Weapons  Council. For example, according to the 2014 SSMP, the Nuclear  Weapons Council directed changes to the planned schedules for  some of the LEPs to accommodate the number and scope of all  LEPs, which contributed to increases in the stockpile budget  estimates.", "NNSA had not included estimated costs to construct both the Uranium  Processing Facility (UPF) and the Chemistry Metallurgy Replacement  Facility (CMRR). We recommended that NNSA include in its  estimates at least a range of budget estimates for known future  expenses for large capital projects even when a fully developed cost  estimate had not been developed. NNSA agreed with this  recommendation and the 2015 SSMP included estimates for these  major large capital projects, which had previously been excluded. In  addition, in the 2014 SSMP, NNSA also changed its methodology for  developing budget estimates for LEPs. For example, NNSA officials  said that the 2012 budget estimates for LEPs were based on an older  LEP because there was not enough data at that time from recent and  ongoing LEPs to develop cost models. In contrast, NNSA officials  told us that they based their 2014 estimates on more reliable data  from an ongoing LEP.", "Our 2013 report also found that some assumptions in the SSMP may be  unrealistic. NNSA\u2019s budget estimates to operate and maintain its existing  facilities and infrastructure remain relatively flat through 2031 at about  $1.5 billion per year (in constant dollars). However, much of NNSA\u2019s  existing facilities and infrastructure were constructed more than 50 years  ago and are reaching the end of their useful lives. As a result, the agency  is undertaking a number of improvement projects to modernize and  maintain these facilities. We concluded that it may not be realistic for  NNSA to assume that its annual budget estimates for operations and  maintenance of facilities from 2014 to 2031 can remain relatively flat  when its aging facilities will likely need additional resources to maintain  them in the future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NNSA Does Not Fully Understand the Causes of Its Contract and Project Management Problems and Appears Resistant to Implementing GAO\u2019s Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["In our February 2015 update to our high risk list, we expressed concern  that DOE, including NNSA, may not have adequately identified the root  causes of its contract and project management challenges.

Our 2015 high  risk update described a sequence of actions starting in 2008, when DOE  issued a root cause analysis and a corrective action plan that identified  what DOE considered to be the 10 most significant issues in managing its  contracts and projects, and the actions needed to mitigate these issues.  These issues included problems with front-end planning, project funding,  accountability, cost estimating, contract and project management  workforce, and project oversight. DOE issued another report in 2011  that stated that the corrective actions it implemented from its 2008 plan  had effectively mitigated most of the root causes of these issues.  However, the department continued to identify additional root causes and  corrective actions and recommendations to address its persistent contract  and project management challenges.

In November  2014, DOE issued another report on project management that identified  four key factors that contribute to project management success or failure  at DOE: front-end planning, project funding, accountability, and project  oversight. The report also included 21 recommendations to address  continuing project management challenges. Notably, all four of these  factors are among those discussed in DOE\u2019s 2008 root cause analyses  and among those that DOE said in 2011 it had at least partially mitigated.  As we noted in our February 2015 update to our high risk list,long history of identifying additional corrective actions suggests that it has  not always fully understood the causes of its contract and project  management problems.", "More importantly, DOE\u2019s December 2014 project management report  included a description of actions to address the four key factors it had  identified; however it did not discuss why the previous attempts to  address these issues had either failed or why these problems had  reemerged. For example, the 2008 corrective action plan found front-end  planning as one of the top 10 issues contributing to the department\u2019s  contract and project management problems. The corrective actions DOE  identified in that report included developing a more detailed internal front- end planning process, such as identifying and defining specific  assumptions for technical design and nuclear safety requirements.  However, this is contrary to DOE\u2019s 2011 report that stated that the  department had fully or partially completed all corrective measures from  2008, including those related to front-end planning. In addition, the 2008  report identified a number of areas where DOE had continuing  challenges, including cost estimating and an inadequate number of  federal contracting and project management personnel. For cost  estimating, our November 2014 report also found that DOE and NNSA  cost estimating requirements and guidance for projects and programs  generally did not reflect best practices for developing cost estimates.  For federal personnel, our February 2015 high risk report found that DOE  did not meet the criteria for having the capacity (people and resources) to  resolve contract and project management problems. Our report cited a  DOE workforce analysis from 2013 that concluded that DOE had an  extremely low number of contract specialists. We also noted in our report  that this workforce analysis did not include the other key staff members  normally included in the description of the acquisition workforce, such as program and project managers and contracting officer representatives.In contrast to these findings, DOE reported, in 2011, that it would  complete its efforts to improve cost estimating later that year, and that  had substantially completed its efforts to enhance the federal contract and  project management workforce."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE Appears Resistant to Implementing Recommendations Intended to Improve DOE Project Management Problems", "paragraphs": ["We have previously noted instances where DOE appeared resistant to  implementing some of our recommendations to correct DOE\u2019s project  management problems.

We continue to believe that a  root cause analysis should be conducted for all projects that experience  cost increases or schedule delays above a threshold established by the  department.

In both reports, DOE agreed with the  recommendations, but it did not indicate whether it would implement  them. In November 2014, we noted that DOE had a history of struggling  to complete many of its major construction projects within initial cost and  schedule estimates. We found that DOE and NNSA cost estimating  requirements and guidance for projects and programs generally do not  reflect best practices for developing cost estimates. We also found in  November 2014 that, because DOE and NNSA do not require reviews of  program cost estimates, the extent of weaknesses in program cost  estimates is largely unknown. DOE itself, in 2008, identified inadequate  cost estimating capability as one of the top 10 most significant issues  contributing to its contract and project management challenges. To  address these issues, we recommended that DOE, among other things,  revise its requirements and guidance for projects and programs to ensure  DOE and NNSA and its contractors develop cost estimates in accordance  with cost estimating best practices, and that independent reviews of  programs are conducted periodically. DOE agreed with these  recommendations. However, DOE did not specify a timeline for  implementing many of these recommendations, indicating to us DOE\u2019s  lack of urgency or commitment in correcting these issues.", "In the second report, issued in December 2014, we examined how DOE  selects approaches for its projects to meet mission requirements. In this  report, we found that several of DOE\u2019s major construction projects,  including some of NNSA\u2019s, had incurred significant cost increases and  schedule delays, and that DOE was in the process of reassessing the  originally selected project alternative for each project. We found that  neither DOE\u2019s requirements nor its guidance for analyzing alternatives  conformed to best practices, and therefore DOE could not have  confidence that applying its requirements and guidance would lead to a  reliable analysis. A reliable analysis is critical to ensuring that key capital  asset and program decisions will both meet mission needs and be cost- effective. To address these issues, we recommended that DOE  incorporate all best practices into its analysis-of-alternatives  requirements.

In addition, we found that NNSA had made little  progress in converting research reactors in Russia from the use of HEU.  At that time, NNSA planned to complete the conversion or verify the  shutdown of 71 HEU-fueled research reactors and related facilities in  Russia by 2020; however, Russia had not agreed to convert any of these  facilities. Nonetheless, Russia verified to NNSA in February 2010 that it  had shut down three of its research reactors, and NNSA achieved an  agreement in principle to conduct conversion feasibility studies on six  additional Russian research reactors.", "In addition, in September 2011, we found that DNN and U.S. agencies  faced significant challenges in accounting for and ensuring the security of  U.S. weapons-usable nuclear materials as a result of foreign nuclear  research and commercial power activities.

In October  2012, we issued a report examining the Megaports Initiative and found  that the continuity and sustainability of the Megaports program could be a  concern going forward. We found that NNSA had not finalized a long-term  plan for ensuring the sustainability of the Megaports Initiative and  recommended that NNSA finalize a sustainability plan for ensuring  ongoing operations after NNSA transfers all equipment, maintenance,  operations, and related financial responsibilities to partner countries.

We recommended that NNSA  develop and maintain useful and reliable measures to assess the  performance of the initiative. NNSA agreed with our recommendations  and, in fiscal year 2014, added a new metric that tracks the cumulative  number of sites that are being maintained by the host country.", "Finally, the effectiveness of NNSA\u2019s nuclear nonproliferation mission  depends in part on the agency\u2019s plutonium disposition program, and we  found in 2014 NNSA faces challenges in this regard. The plutonium  disposition program has represented a significant portion of the DNN  budget over the past 5 years, ranging from approximately 18 percent of  the DNN budget request in fiscal year 2015 to approximately 36 percent  of the DNN budget request in fiscal year 2013. This program is a key  element of the U.S. commitment to dispose of 34 metric tons of weapons  grade surplus plutonium under the Plutonium Management and  Disposition Agreement between the United States and Russia.

In addition, the Augustine-Mies Panel  found specific shortfalls in critical skills for program management, cost  estimation, and resource management and recommended that NNSA  leadership analyze the level and skill mix of the workforce necessary to  meet future needs and invest in the needed skills in the workforce. Our  high risk update noted that DOE, including NNSA, did not have the  capacity (people and resources) to resolve contract and project  management problems. We reported that DOE, including NNSA, had  taken some actions to address capacity issues, but these actions have  not yet ensured that the department has the capacity to fully address its  contract and project management challenges.", "On implementation of corrective actions plans, the panel noted that there  have been numerous previous studies with numerous valid  recommendations, many of which recurred in the panel\u2019s assessment as  well. The panel noted, however, that there was not a well-established  process for reviewing these recommendations, performing root cause  analysis of them, taking corrective action where appropriate, and then  following up to ensure that the corrective actions are institutionalized. The  panel recommended that nuclear security enterprise leadership develop a  process to provide accountability and follow up on findings and  recommendations from studies and reviews, both internal and external. In  December 2014, the Secretary issued a memo stating that DOE would  strengthen the role of the Energy Systems Acquisition Advisory Board  and establish a project management risk committee to provide agency- wide project management risk assessment and expert advice. As we  noted in our 2015 high risk update, this initiative demonstrates the  continued commitment of top leadership to address its contract and  project management challenges, but DOE\u2019s cycle of identifying root  causes, recommendations and corrective actions\u2014which DOE declares  successful, only to later issue another set of root causes and corrective  actions\u2014raises concerns that DOE has not fully identified the root causes  behind these problems.", "The panel also examined NNSA\u2019s oversight of its management and  operating (M&O) contractors and raised questions regarding the impact  and effectiveness of contract requirements and performance metrics on  mission execution. We have ongoing work examining NNSA\u2019s contract  oversight policies and guidance that examines NNSA\u2019s approach to  overseeing and evaluating its M&O contractors and how NNSA  determines the extent to which it can use contractor assurance systems   This report is expected to be  for deciding M&O contractor award fees.completed in May 2015.", "Chairman Sessions, Ranking Member Donnelly, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
