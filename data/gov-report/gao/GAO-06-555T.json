The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), an independent agency headed by five commissioners, regulates and oversees security at the plants.

Specifically, trained threat assessment staff made recommendations for changes based on an analysis of demonstrated terrorist capabilities. The resulting DBT requires plants to defend against a larger terrorist threat, including a larger number of attackers, a refined and expanded list of weapons, and an increase in the maximum size of a vehicle bomb. Key elements of the revised DBT, such as the number of attackers, generally correspond to the NRC threat assessment staff's original recommendations, but other important elements do not. For example, the NRC staff made changes to some recommendations after obtaining feedback from stakeholders, including the nuclear industry, which objected to certain proposed changes, such as the inclusion of certain weapons. NRC officials said the changes resulted from further analysis of intelligence information. Nevertheless, GAO found that the process used to obtain stakeholder feedback created the appearance that changes were made based on what the industry considered reasonable and feasible to defend against rather than on what an assessment of the terrorist threat called for. Nuclear power plants made substantial security improvements in response to the September 11, 2001, attacks and the revised DBT, including security barriers and detection equipment, new protective strategies, and additional security officers. It is too early, however, to conclude that all sites are capable of defending against the DBT because, as of March 30, 2006, NRC had conducted force-on-force inspections at 27, or less than half, of the 65 nuclear power plant sites. NRC has improved its force-on-force inspections--for example, by conducting inspections more frequently at each site. Nevertheless, in observing three inspections and discussing the program with NRC, GAO noted potential issues in the inspections that warrant NRC's continued attention. For example, a lapse in the protection of information about the planned scenario for a mock attack GAO observed may have given the plant's security officers knowledge that allowed them to perform better than they otherwise would have. A classified version of GAO's report provides additional details about the DBT and security at nuclear power plants."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our recent work on security of the  nation\u2019s 103 operating commercial nuclear power plants, located at 65  sites in 31 states. My testimony today is based on our report being released  today, entitled Nuclear Power Plants: Efforts Made to Upgrade Security,  but the Nuclear Regulatory Commission\u2019s Design Basis Threat Process  Should Be Improved (GAO-06-388).", "As you know, nuclear power plants were among the targets considered in  the original plan for the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.  Furthermore, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC),  which regulates and oversees the safe operation and security of nuclear  power plants, there continues to be a general credible threat of a terrorist  attack on the nation\u2019s commercial nuclear power plants, in particular by al  Qaeda and like-minded Islamic terrorist groups. Such an attack could  cause a release of radioactive material and endanger public health and  safety through exposure to an elevated level of radiation.", "To defend against a potential terrorist attack, NRC issues and enforces  security-related regulations and orders, and nuclear power plant licensees  implement security measures to meet NRC requirements. In particular,  NRC formulates a design basis threat (DBT)\u2014the threat that plants must  defend against\u2014and tests plants\u2019 ability to defend against the DBT. The  DBT characterizes the elements of a potential attack, including the  number of attackers, their training, and the weapons and tactics they are  capable of employing. NRC periodically reviews the potential terrorist  threat to determine whether to make changes to the DBT. Most recently,  NRC revised the DBT in April 2003 in response to the September 11  terrorist attacks. After revising the DBT, NRC required nuclear power  plant sites to submit new security plans by April 29, 2004, for its review  and approval and to implement the security described in their new plans  by October 29, 2004. In November 2004, NRC began using its force-on- force inspection program to test sites\u2019 ability to defend against the revised  DBT. This program employs mock terrorist attacks as the principal means  to test the sites\u2019 security.", "The DBT does not represent the maximum size and capability of a terrorist  attack that is possible but, rather, NRC\u2019s assessment of the threat that the  nuclear power plants must at all times be prepared to defend against \u201cto  ensure adequate protection of public health and safety.\u201d Furthermore,  NRC regulations do not require nuclear power plants to protect against  attacks by an \u201cenemy of the United States,\u201d whether a foreign government  or other person. NRC originally included this provision in its regulations  in 1967 (prior to issuing the first DBT for nuclear power plants). According  to NRC officials, the provision was intended to address the possibility that  Cuba might launch an attack on a nuclear power plant in Florida. In  revising the DBT in April 2003, NRC did not use this provision to exempt  plants from defending against terrorist groups such as al Qaeda but,  rather, stated that a private security force (such as at a nuclear power  plant) cannot reasonably be expected to defend against all threats\u2014for  example, airborne attacks. Importantly, NRC works with other federal  agencies to coordinate an integrated response to a terrorist threat or  attack on a nuclear power plant.", "Our March 2006 report examined (1) the process NRC used to develop the  April 2003 DBT for nuclear power plants, (2) the actions nuclear power  plants have taken to enhance security in response to the revised DBT, and  (3) NRC\u2019s efforts to strengthen the conduct of its force-on-force  inspections. For the report, we reviewed documents detailing the process  NRC used to revise the DBT and interviewed the NRC commissioners and  staff. We also visited four nuclear power plant sites (one in each of the  four NRC regions) to observe the security enhancements that sites made  to address the revised DBT, and we reviewed a sample of NRC\u2019s baseline  and force-on-force inspection reports. GAO staff with security expertise  accompanied us on our visits in order to assist in our review of the sites\u2019  security strategies. Finally, we observed a total of three force-on-force  inspections at two other sites. We performed our work from November  2004 through January 2006 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["NRC is an independent agency established by the Energy Reorganization  Act of 1974 to regulate the civilian use of nuclear materials. It is headed by  a five-member commission, with one commission member designated by  the President to serve as chairman and official spokesperson. The  commission as a whole formulates policies and regulations governing  nuclear reactor and materials safety and security, issues orders to  licensees, and adjudicates legal matters brought before it. Security for  commercial nuclear power plants is addressed by NRC\u2019s Office of Nuclear  Security and Incident Response. This office develops policy on security at  nuclear facilities and is the agency\u2019s security interface with the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the intelligence and law  enforcement communities, the Department of Energy (DOE), and other  agencies. Within this office, the Threat Assessment Section assesses  security threats involving NRC-licensed activities and develops  recommendations regarding the DBT for the commission\u2019s consideration.", "The DBT for radiological sabotage applied to nuclear power plants  identifies the terrorist capabilities (or \u201cadversary characteristics\u201d) that  sites are required to defend against. The adversary characteristics  generally describe the components of a ground assault and include the  number of attackers; the size of a vehicle bomb; and the weapons,  equipment, and tactics that could be used in an attack. Other threats in the  DBT include a waterborne assault and the threat of an insider. The DBT  does not include the threat of an airborne attack.", "Force-on-force inspections are NRC\u2019s performance-based means for  testing the effectiveness of nuclear power plant security programs. These  inspections are intended to demonstrate how well a nuclear power plant  might defend against a real-life threat. In a force-on-force inspection, a  professional team of adversaries attempts to reach specific \u201ctarget sets\u201d  within a nuclear power plant that would allow them to commit  radiological sabotage. These target sets represent the minimum pieces of  equipment or infrastructure an attacker would need to destroy or disable  in order to commit radiological sabotage that results in an elevated release  of radioactive material to the environment. NRC also conducts baseline  inspections at nuclear power plants. During these inspections, security  inspectors examine areas such as officer training, fitness for duty,  positioning and operational readiness of multiple physical and technical  security components, and the controls the licensee has in place to ensure  that unauthorized personnel do not gain access to the protected area.  NRC\u2019s policy is to conduct a baseline inspection at each site every year,  with the complete range of baseline inspection activities conducted over a  3-year cycle. For both force-on-force and baseline inspections, licensees  are responsible for immediately correcting or compensating for any  deficiency in which NRC concludes that security is not in accordance with  the approved security plans or other security orders."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NRC\u2019s Process for Revising the DBT Was Generally Logical and Well Defined, but Some Changes Were Not Clearly Linked to an Analysis of the Terrorist Threat", "paragraphs": ["The process by which NRC revised the DBT for nuclear power plants was  generally logical and well defined in that trained threat assessment staff  made recommendations for changes based on an analysis of demonstrated  terrorist capabilities.

However, while the final version of the revised DBT  generally corresponded to the original recommendations of the threat  assessment staff, some elements did not, which raised questions about the  extent to which the revised DBT represents the terrorist threat."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "NRC\u2019s Process for Revising Its DBT Was Generally Logical and Well Defined", "paragraphs": ["NRC made its 2003 revisions to the DBT for nuclear power plants using a  process that the agency has had in place since issuing the first DBT in the  late 1970s. In this process, NRC staff trained in threat assessment use  reports and secure databases provided by the intelligence community to  monitor information on terrorist activities worldwide. (NRC does not  directly gather intelligence information but rather receives intelligence  from other agencies that it uses to formulate the DBT for nuclear power  plants.) The staff analyze this information both to identify specific  references to nuclear power plants and to determine what capabilities  terrorists have acquired and how they might use those capabilities to  attack nuclear power plants in the United States. The staff normally  summarize applicable intelligence information and any recommendations  for changes to the DBT in semiannual reports to the NRC commissioners  on the threat environment.", "In 1999, the NRC staff began developing a set of criteria\u2014the adversary  characteristics screening process\u2014to decide whether to recommend  particular adversary characteristics for inclusion in the DBT and to  enhance the predictability and consistency of their recommendations. The  staff use initial screening criteria to exclude from further consideration  certain adversary characteristics, such as those that would more likely be  used by a foreign military than by a terrorist group. For adversary  characteristics that pass the initial round of screening, the threat  assessment staff apply additional screening factors, such as the type of  terrorist group that demonstrated the characteristic. For example, the staff  consider whether an adversary characteristic has been demonstrated by  transnational or terrorist groups operating in the United States, or by  terrorist groups that operate only in foreign countries. Finally, on the basis  of their analysis and interaction with intelligence and other agencies, the  staff decide whether to recommend that the commission include the  adversary characteristics in the DBT for nuclear power plants. NRC\u2019s  Office of Nuclear Security and Incident Response, which includes the  Threat Assessment Section, reviews and endorses the threat assessment  staff\u2019s analysis and recommendations.", "Terrorist attacks have generally occurred outside the United States, and  intelligence information specific to nuclear power plants is very limited.  As a result, one of the NRC threat assessment staff\u2019s major challenges has  been to decide how to apply this limited information to nuclear power  plants in the United States. For example, one of the key elements in the  revised DBT, the number of attackers, is based on NRC\u2019s analysis of the  group size of previous terrorist attacks worldwide. According to NRC  threat assessment staff, the number of attackers in the revised DBT falls  within the range of most known terrorist cells worldwide. NRC staff  recommendations regarding other adversary characteristics also reflected  the staff\u2019s interpretation of intelligence information. For example, the staff  considered a range of sizes for increasing the vehicle bomb in the revised  DBT and ultimately recommended a size that was based on an analysis of  previous terrorist attacks using vehicle bombs. Intelligence and law  enforcement officials we spoke with did not have information  contradicting NRC\u2019s interpretation regarding the number of attackers or  other parts of the NRC DBT but did point to the uncertainty regarding the  size of potential attacks and the relative lack of intelligence on the  terrorist threat to nuclear power plants.", "In addition to analyzing intelligence information, NRC monitored and  exchanged information with DOE, which also has a DBT for comparable  facilities that process or store radiological materials and are, therefore,  potential targets for radiological sabotage. However, while certain aspects  of the two agencies\u2019 DBTs for radiological sabotage are similar, NRC  generally established less rigorous requirements than DOE\u2014 for example,  with regard to the types of equipment that could be used in an attack. The  DOE DBT includes a number of weapons not included in the NRC DBT.  Inclusion of such weapons in the NRC DBT for nuclear power plants  would have required plants to take substantial additional security  measures. Furthermore, DOE included other capabilities in its DBT that  are not included in the NRC DBT. Despite these differences, both agencies  used similar intelligence information to derive key aspects of their DBTs.  For example, both DOE and NRC based the number of attackers on  intelligence on the size of terrorist cells, and DOE officials told us they  used intelligence similar to NRC\u2019s to derive the number of attackers.  Likewise, DOE and NRC officials provided us with similar analyses of  intelligence information on previous terrorist attacks using vehicle bombs.  DOE and NRC officials also told us that most vehicle bombs used in  terrorist attacks are smaller than the size of the vehicle bomb in NRC\u2019s  revised DBT."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changes to the Threat Assessment Staff\u2019s Initial Recommendations Were Not Clearly Linked to an Analysis of the Terrorist Threat", "paragraphs": ["While NRC followed a generally logical and well-defined process to revise  the DBT for nuclear power plants, two aspects of the process raised a  fundamental question\u2014the extent to which the DBT represents the  terrorist threat as indicated by intelligence data compared with the extent  to which it represents the threat that NRC considers reasonable for the  plants to defend against. These two aspects were (1) the process NRC  used to obtain stakeholder feedback on a draft of the DBT and (2) changes  made by the commissioners to the NRC staff\u2019s recommended DBT.", "With regard to the first aspect, the process NRC used to obtain feedback  from stakeholders, including the nuclear industry, created the appearance  of industry influence on the threat assessment regarding the  characteristics of an attack. NRC staff sent a draft DBT to stakeholders in  January 2003, held a series of meetings with them to obtain their  comments, and received written comments. NRC specifically sought and  received feedback from the nuclear industry on what is reasonable for a  private security force to defend against and the cost of and time frame for  implementing security measures to defend against specific adversary  characteristics. During this same period, the threat assessment staff  continued to analyze intelligence information and modify the draft DBT.", "In its written comments on the January 2003 draft DBT, the Nuclear  Energy Institute (NEI), which represents the nuclear power industry,  objected to a number of the adversary characteristics the NRC staff had  included. Subsequently, the NRC staff made changes to the draft DBT,  which they then submitted to the NRC commissioners. The changes made  by the NRC staff\u2014in particular, the size of the vehicle bomb and list of  weapons that could be used in an attack\u2014reflected some (but not all) of  NEI\u2019s objections. For example, NEI wrote that some sites would not be  able to protect against the size of the vehicle bomb proposed by NRC  because of insufficient land for installation of vehicle barrier systems at a  necessary distance. Instead, NEI agreed that it would be reasonable to  protect against a smaller vehicle bomb. Similarly, NEI argued against the  inclusion of certain weapons because of the cost of protecting against the  weapons. NEI wrote that such weapons (as well as the vehicle bomb size  initially proposed by the NRC staff) would be indicative of an enemy of the  United States, which sites are not required to protect against under NRC  regulations. In its final recommendations to the commissioners, the NRC  staff reduced the size of the vehicle bomb to the amount NEI had  proposed and removed a number of weapons NEI had objected to. On the  other hand, NRC did not make changes that reflected all of the industry\u2019s  objections. For example, NRC staff did not remove one particular weapon  NEI had objected to, which, according to NRC\u2019s analysis, has been a staple  in the terrorist arsenal since the 1970s and has been used extensively  worldwide.", "With regard to the commissioners\u2019 review and approval of the NRC staff\u2019s  recommendations, the commissioners largely supported the staff\u2019s  recommendations but also made some significant changes that reflected  policy judgments. Specifically, the commissioners considered whether any  of the recommended changes to the DBT constituted characteristics  representative of an enemy of the United States, which sites are not  required to protect against under NRC regulations. In approving the  revised DBT, the commission stated that nuclear power plants\u2019 civilian  security forces cannot reasonably be expected to defend against all  threats, and that defense against certain threats (such as an airborne  attack) is the primary responsibility of the federal government, in  coordination with state and local law enforcement officials. Based on such  considerations, the commission voted to remove two weapons the NRC  staff had recommended for inclusion in the revised DBT based on its  threat assessment. However, the document summarizing the commission\u2019s  decision to approve the revised DBT did not provide a reason for  excluding these weapons. For example, the commission did not indicate  whether its decision was based on criteria, such as the cost for nuclear  power plants to defend against an adversary characteristic or the efforts of  local, state, and federal agencies to address particular threats. In our view,  the lack of such criteria reduced the transparency of the commission\u2019s  decisions to make changes to the threat assessment staff\u2019s  recommendations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Nuclear Power Plants Made Substantial Changes to Their Security to Address the Revised DBT, but NRC Inspections Have Uncovered Problems", "paragraphs": ["The four nuclear power plant sites we visited made substantial changes in  response to the revised DBT, including measures to detect, delay, and  respond to the increased number of attackers and to address the increased  vehicle bomb size. These security enhancements were in addition to other  measures licensees implemented\u2014such as stricter requirements for  obtaining physical access to nuclear power plants\u2014in response to a series  of security orders NRC issued after September 11, 2001. According to NEI,  as of June 2004, the cost of security enhancements made since September  11, 2001, for all sites amounts to over $1.2 billion.", "To enhance their detection capabilities, the four sites we visited installed  additional cameras throughout different areas of the sites and instituted  random patrols in the owner-controlled areas. Furthermore, the sites we  visited installed a variety of devices designed to delay attackers and allow  security officers more time to respond to their posts and fire upon  attackers. The sites generally installed these delay devices throughout the  protected areas as well as inside the reactor and other buildings. Sites also  enhanced their ability to respond to an attack by constructing bullet- resistant structures at various locations in the protected area or within  buildings, increasing the minimum number of security officers defending  the sites at all times, and expanding the amount of training provided to  them. (See fig. 1 for an example of a bullet-resistant structure.) According  to NRC, other sites took comparable actions to defend against the revised  DBT.", "In addition to adding measures designed to detect, delay, and respond to  an attack, the licensees at the four sites we visited installed new vehicle  barrier systems to defend against the larger vehicle bomb in the revised  DBT. In particular, the licensees designed comprehensive systems that  included sturdy barriers to (1) prevent a potential vehicle bomb from  approaching the sites and (2) channel vehicles to entrances where security  officers could search them for explosives and other prohibited items. The  vehicle barrier systems either completely encircled the plants (except for  entrances manned by armed security officers) or formed a continuous  barrier in combination with natural or manmade terrain features, such as  bodies of water or trenches, that would prevent a vehicle from  approaching the sites.", "In general, the four sites we visited all implemented a \u201cdefense-in-depth\u201d  strategy, with multiple layers of security systems that attackers would  have to defeat before reaching vital areas or equipment and destroying or  disabling systems sufficient to cause an elevated release of radiation off  site. The sites varied in how they implemented these measures, primarily  depending on site-specific characteristics such as topography and on the  degree to which they planned to interdict attackers within the owner- controlled area and far from the sites\u2019 vital area, as opposed to inside the  protected area but before they could reach the vital equipment. For  example, one site with a predominantly external strategy installed an  intrusion detection system in the owner-controlled area so that security  officers would be able to identify intruders as early as possible. The site  was able to install such a system because of the large amount of open,  unobstructed space in the owner-controlled area. In contrast, security  managers at another site we visited described a protective strategy that  combined elements of an external strategy and an internal strategy. For  example, the site identified \u201cchoke points\u201d\u2014locations attackers would  need to pass before reaching their targets\u2014inside the protected area and  installed bullet-resistant structures at the choke points where officers  would be waiting to interdict the attackers. NRC officials told us that  licensees have the freedom to design their protective strategies to  accommodate site-specific conditions, so long as the strategies satisfy  NRC requirements and prove successful in a force-on-force inspection.", "In addition to the security enhancements we observed, security managers  at each site described ways in which they had exceeded NRC requirements  and changes they plan to make as they continue to improve their  protective strategies. For example, security managers at three of the sites  we visited told us the number of security officers on duty at any one shift  exceeded the minimum number of security officers that NRC requires be  dedicated to responding to attacks. Similarly, in at least some areas of the  sites, the new vehicle barrier systems were farther from the reactors and  other vital equipment than necessary to protect the sites against the size of  vehicle bomb in the revised DBT.", "Despite the substantial security improvements we observed at the four  sites we visited, it is too early to conclude, either from NRC\u2019s force-on- force or baseline inspections, that all nuclear power plant sites are capable  of defending against the revised DBT for the following two reasons:    First, as of March 30, 2006, NRC had completed force-on-force inspections  at 27 of the 65 sites, and it is not planning to complete force-on-force  inspections at all sites until 2007, in accordance with its 3-year schedule.  NRC officials told us that plants have generally performed well during  force-on-force inspections. However, we observed a force-on-force  inspection at one site in which the site\u2019s ability to defend against the DBT  was at best questionable. The site\u2019s security measures appeared  impressive and were similar to those we observed at other sites.  Nevertheless, some or all of the attackers were able to enter the protected  area in each of the three exercise scenarios. Furthermore, attackers made  it to the targets in two of the scenarios, although the outcomes of the two  scenarios were called into question by uncertainties regarding whether the  attackers had actually been neutralized before reaching the targets. As a  result, NRC decided to conduct another force-on-force inspection at the  site, which we also observed. The site made substantial additional security  improvements\u2014at a cost of $37 million, according to the licensee\u2014and  NRC concluded after the second force-on-force inspection that the site  had adequately defended against a DBT-style attack.", "Second, we noted from our review of 18 baseline inspection reports and 9  force-on-force inspection reports that sites have encountered a range of  problems in meeting NRC\u2019s security requirements. NRC officials told us  that all sites have implemented all of the security measures described in  their new plans submitted in response to the revised DBT. However, 12 of  the 18 baseline inspection reports and 4 of the 9 force-on-force inspection  reports we reviewed identified problems or items needing correction. For  example, during two different baseline inspections, NRC found (1) an  intrusion detection system in which multiple alarms were not functioning  properly, making the entire intrusion detection system inoperable,  according to the site, and (2) three examples of failure to properly search  personnel entering the protected area, which NRC concluded could reduce  the overall effectiveness of the protective strategy by allowing the  uncontrolled introduction of weapons or explosives into the protected  area. According to NRC, the licensees at these two sites, as well as at the  other sites where NRC inspection reports noted other problems, took  immediate corrective actions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NRC Has Significantly Improved the Force- on-Force Inspection Program, but Challenges Remain", "paragraphs": ["NRC has made a number of improvements to the force-on-force inspection  program, several of which address recommendations we made in our  September 2003 report on NRC\u2019s oversight of security at commercial  nuclear power plants. We had made our recommendations when NRC was  restructuring the force-on-force program to provide a more rigorous test  of security at the sites in accordance with the DBT, which was also under  revision. For example, we recommended that NRC conduct the  inspections more frequently at each site, use laser equipment to better  simulate attackers\u2019 and security officers\u2019 weapons, and require the  inspections to make use of the full terrorist capabilities stated in the DBT.  Actions NRC has taken that satisfy these recommendations include  conducting the exercises more frequently at each site (every 3 years rather  than every 8 years), and NRC so far is on track to complete the first round  of force-on-force inspections on schedule, by 2007. Furthermore, NRC is  using laser equipment to simulate weapons, and the attackers in the force- on-force exercise inspections that we observed used key adversary  characteristics of the revised DBT, including the number of attackers, a  vehicle bomb, a passive insider, and explosives.", "Nevertheless, we identified issues in the force-on-force inspection  program that could affect the quality of the inspections and that continue  to warrant NRC\u2019s attention. For example, the level of security expertise  and training among controllers\u2014individuals provided by the licensee who  observe each security officer and attacker to ensure the safety and  effectiveness of the exercise\u2014varied in the force-on-force inspections we  observed. One site used personnel with security backgrounds while  another site used plant employees who did not have security-related  backgrounds but who volunteered to help. In its force-on-force inspection  report for this latter site, NRC concluded that the level of controller  training contributed to the uncertain outcome of the force-on-force  exercises, which resulted in NRC\u2019s conducting a second force-on-force  inspection at the site.", "Furthermore, we noted that the force-on-force exercises end when a site\u2019s  security force successfully stops an attack. Consequently, at sites that  successfully defeat the mock adversary force early in the exercise  scenario, NRC does not have an opportunity to observe the performance  of sites\u2019 internal security\u2014that is, the strategies sites would use to defeat  attackers inside the vital area. When we raised this issue, NRC officials  appeared to recognize the benefit of designing the force-on-force  inspections to test sites\u2019 internal security strategies but said that doing so  would require further consideration of how to implement changes to the  force-on-force inspections. Based on our observations of three force-on- force inspections, other areas where NRC may be able to make further  improvements included the following:    ensuring the proper use of laser equipment;    varying the timing of inspection activities, such as the starting times of the  mock attacks, in order to minimize the artificiality of the inspections;    ensuring the protection of information about the planned scenarios for the  mock attacks so that security officers do not obtain knowledge that would  allow them to perform better than they otherwise would; and   providing complete feedback to licensees on NRC inspectors\u2019 observations  on the results of the force-on-force exercises.", "Mr. Chairman, this completes my prepared statement.
