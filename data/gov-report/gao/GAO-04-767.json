As of September 2003, about 80 percent of the 240 federally funded medical research projects for Gulf War illnesses had been completed. In recent years, VA and DOD funding for this research has decreased, federal research priorities have changed, and interagency coordination of Gulf War illnesses research has waned. In addition, VA has not reassessed the extent to which the collective findings of completed Gulf War illnesses research projects have addressed key research questions. The only assessment of progress in answering these research questions was published in 2001, when findings from only about half of all federally funded Gulf War illnesses research were available. Moreover, it did not identify whether there were gaps in existing Gulf War illnesses research or promising areas for future research. This lack of comprehensive analysis leaves VA at greater risk of failing to answer unresolved questions about causes, course of development, and treatments for Gulf War illnesses. In a separate effort, DOD has conducted 50 investigations since 1996 on potential hazardous exposures during the Gulf War. Generally, these investigations concluded that there were limited exposures by troops to some hazards and, at most, limited short- or long-term adverse effects expected from these exposures. As of April 2003, all investigations were complete. Federal agencies have funded seven research projects related to cancer incidence among Gulf War veterans. However, several limitations exist that affect research related to cancer incidence. For example, some cancers may take many years to develop and be detected. In addition, some research projects studying cancer incidence have not studied enough Gulf War veterans to reliably assess cancer incidence. Research may also be impeded by incomplete federal data on the health characteristics of Gulf War veterans. RAC's efforts to provide advice and make recommendations on Gulf War illnesses research to the Secretary of VA may have been hampered by VA senior administrators' incomplete or unclear information sharing and limited collaboration on research initiatives and program planning. VA and RAC are exploring ways to improve collaboration, including VA's hiring of a senior scientist who would both guide VA's Gulf War illnesses research and serve as the agency's liaison for routine updates to the advisory committee.

While about 700,000 U.S. military  personnel were deployed during this conflict, casualties were relatively  light compared with previous major conflicts. However, approximately  80,000 veterans have reported various symptoms in the years following the  war, and scientists have agreed that many veterans have unexplained  illnesses. Gulf War illnesses are characterized by one or more symptoms  that do not conform to a characteristic diagnosis. Such symptoms  commonly include fatigue, muscle and joint pains, headaches, memory  loss, skin rash, diarrhea, and sleep disturbances. In addition to concerns  about unexplained illnesses, many Gulf War veterans also have elevated  concerns that possible exposures to chemical or biological warfare agents,  or environmental contaminants, may be associated with an increased risk  of developing cancer. Past research projects have found associations  between some of these substances and different types of cancers.", "Gulf War veterans\u2019 reports of illnesses have prompted numerous federal  research projects on the nature, extent, and treatment of Gulf War  illnesses. Federal Gulf War illnesses research projects have been funded  primarily by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Department of  Defense (DOD), and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  Each agency separately sponsors and funds research projects, though a  few are conducted jointly. In 1993, the President made the Secretary of VA  responsible for coordinating research activities undertaken or funded by  the executive branch of the federal government on the health  consequences of service in the Gulf War. In 2002, a congressionally  mandated federal advisory committee\u2014the VA Research Advisory  Committee on Gulf War Veterans\u2019 Illnesses (RAC)\u2014was established to  provide advice on federal Gulf War illnesses research needs and priorities  to the Secretary of VA. The committee is made up of members of the  general public, including non-VA researchers and veterans\u2019 advocates.", "Separately from this research, DOD has conducted investigations on  specific events that took place during the Gulf War to identify possible  exposures to potentially hazardous chemical agents, such as sarin,  mustard, and benzyl bromide. In addition, DOD has conducted  investigations of potential occupational and environmental hazards,  including depleted uranium from munitions, smoke from oil well fires,  pesticides, petroleum, and fuels. DOD has published a number of reports  that discuss the findings of these Gulf War investigations.", "Because of these concerns, we are reporting on (1) the status of federal  research and investigations on Gulf War illnesses, (2) the efforts that have  been made by VA and DOD to monitor cancer incidence among Gulf War  veterans, and (3) VA\u2019s communication and collaboration with RAC.", "To examine these issues, we interviewed senior officials within VA and  DOD and senior managers with each agency\u2019s relevant research offices.  We analyzed pertinent agency documents, including annual reports to  congressional committees describing research priorities, ongoing and  completed projects, and agency funding. Additionally, we interviewed RAC  officials, attended a RAC meeting, and reviewed RAC reports and  recommendations.

In the winter of 1991, the allied forces attacked Iraq in an air  campaign and subsequent invasion by ground forces (Operation Desert  Storm). Despite the harsh environment, illness, injury, and death rates  among approximately 700,000 U.S. military personnel were significantly  lower than in previous major conflicts. Yet, shortly after the war, some  veterans began reporting health problems that they believed might be due  to their participation in the war. VA, DOD, HHS, and other federal agencies  initiated research and investigations into these health concerns and the  consequences of possible hazardous exposures.", "In 1993, the President designated VA as the lead coordinator of research  activities on the health consequences of service in the Gulf War.  Subsequently, in 1998, the Congress expanded VA\u2019s coordination to  include all Gulf War health-related activities. These activities include  ensuring that the findings of all federal Gulf War illnesses research are  made available to the public and that federal agencies coordinate outreach  to Gulf War veterans in order to provide information on potential health  risks from service in the Gulf War and corresponding services or benefits.  The Secretary of VA is required to submit an annual report on the results,  status, and priorities of federal research activities related to the health  consequences of military service in the Gulf War to the Senate and House  Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committees. VA has provided these reports to  congressional committees since 1995. In May 2004, VA issued its annual  report for 2002. VA has carried out its coordinating role through the  auspices of interagency committees, which have changed over time in  concert with federal research priorities and needs. The mission of these  interagency committees has evolved to include coordination for research  on all hazardous deployments, including but not limited to the Gulf War.  (See fig. 1.)", "Federal research efforts for Gulf War illnesses have been guided by  questions established by the interagency Research Working Group (RWG),  which was initially established under the Persian Gulf Veterans  Coordinating Board (PGVCB) to coordinate federal research efforts. From  1995 through 1996, RWG identified 19 major research questions related to  illnesses in Gulf War veterans. In 1996, the group added 2 more questions  regarding cancer risk and mortality rates to create a set of 21 key research  questions that serves as an overarching strategy in guiding federal  research for Gulf War illnesses. (See app. II for the list of key questions.)  The 21 research questions cover the extent of various health problems,  exposures among the veteran population, and the difference in health  problems between Gulf War veterans and control populations. In 1998,  RWG expanded federal Gulf War illnesses research priorities to include  treatment, longitudinal follow-up of illnesses, disease prevention, and  improved hazard assessment; however, RWG did not add any new  research questions. With regard to veterans\u2019 health status, the research  questions cover the prevalence among veterans and control populations of    symptoms,    symptom complexes,   illnesses,    altered immune function or host defense,    birth defects,   reproductive problems,    sexual dysfunction,    cancer,    pulmonary symptoms,    neuropsychological or neurological deficits,    psychological symptoms or diagnoses, and    mortality.", "With regard to exposure, the research questions cover    Leishmania tropica (a type of parasite),    petroleum,    petroleum combustion products,    specific occupational/environmental hazards (such as vaccines and    chemical agents,    pyridostigmine bromide (given to troops as a defense against nerve    psychophysiological stressors (such as exposure to extremes of human  suffering).", "Separately from these research efforts, DOD is responsible for  investigating and reporting incidents of possible chemical and biological  agent exposures and other potential occupational and environmental  hazards.

RAC, which is composed of members of the general  public, including non-VA researchers and veterans\u2019 advocates, was tasked  with assisting VA in its research planning by exploring the entire body of  Gulf War illnesses research, identifying gaps in the research, and  proposing potential areas of future research. VA provides an annual  budget of about $400,000 for RAC, which provides salaries for two full- time employees and one part-time employee and supports committee  operating costs. RAC\u2019s employees include a scientific director and support  staff who review published scientific literature and federal research  updates and collect information from scientists conducting relevant  research. RAC\u2019s staff provide research summaries for discussion and  analysis to the advisory committee through monthly written reports and at  regularly scheduled meetings. RAC holds public meetings several times a  year at which scientists present published and unpublished findings from  Gulf War illnesses research.

VA officials  said that although Gulf War illnesses research continues, the agency is  expanding the scope of its research to include the potential long-term  health effects in troops who served in hazardous deployments other than  the Gulf War. In October 2002, VA announced plans to commit up to $20  million for research into Gulf War illnesses and the health effects of other  military deployments. Also in October 2002, VA issued a program  announcement for research on the long-term health effects in veterans  who served in the Gulf War or in other hazardous deployments, such as  Afghanistan and Bosnia/Kosovo. As of April 2004, one new Gulf War  illnesses research project was funded for $450,000 under this program  announcement.", "Although DOD has historically provided the majority of funding for Gulf  War illnesses research, DOD officials stated that their agency currently has  no plans to fund new Gulf War illnesses research projects.  Correspondingly, DOD has not funded any new Gulf War illnesses  research in fiscal year 2004, except as reflected in modest supplements to  complete existing projects and a new award pending for research using  funding from a specific appropriation. DOD also did not include Gulf War  illnesses research funding in its budget proposals for fiscal years 2005 and  2006. DOD officials stated that because the agency is primarily focused on  the needs of the active duty soldier, its interest in funding Gulf War  illnesses research was highest when a large number of Gulf War veterans  remained on active duty after the war\u2014some of whom might develop  unexplained symptoms and syndromes that could affect their active duty  status. Since 2000, DOD\u2019s focus has shifted from research solely on Gulf  War illnesses to research on medical issues of active duty troops in current  or future military deployments. For example, in 2000 VA and DOD  collaborated to develop the Millennium Cohort study, which is a  prospective study evaluating the health of both deployed and nondeployed  military personnel throughout their military careers and after leaving  military service.

Hospitalization studies of Gulf War veterans  are applicable only to those veterans who seek care in specific hospitals  included in the studies; veterans who use other health care systems are  not included. Mortality studies of Gulf War veterans are limited because  only veterans who have died of cancer are captured; other veterans who  have not died, but have been diagnosed with cancer, are not included.  Additionally, some general health studies of Gulf War veterans may use  self-reported data only, which may not be accurate unless validated by  objective physical or laboratory findings.

RAC  officials stated that throughout March and April 2004, VA and RAC  officials had been jointly developing a new research program  announcement for Gulf War illnesses. In addition, VA has proposed that  RAC will be able to recommend scientists for inclusion in the scientific  merit review panels.

VA and RAC are exploring new  approaches to improve information sharing and collaboration.
