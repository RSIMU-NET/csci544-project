For example, DOD did not require project proposal packages to document information about the recipient unit's absorptive capacity. In addition, assessments of recipient unit baseline capabilities did not always include all information required by agency guidance to facilitate project assessment. Lastly, 13 of 54 project proposals did not include required estimates of annual sustainment costs. The sharp increase in funding for program activities in fiscal year 2015, as shown in the figure above, heightens the importance of documenting consideration of key planning elements to provide decision makers sufficient information about recipient units' ability to use and sustain assistance.

These 61 projects account for 28 percent of the $2  billion DOD allocated for this program in those years.", "To conduct these assessments, DOD uses a standard framework for  evaluating the capabilities and performance of each recipient unit.  Baseline assessments, discussed earlier, rate the recipient unit\u2019s level of  capability and performance before project implementation on a 5-point  scale on which 1 is defined as the ability to perform some basic tasks to  at least a low standard of performance and 5 is defined as the ability to  perform most of the advanced tasks for the unit\u2019s missions and to operate  almost continuously throughout its assigned area of operations. Following  implementation, DOD conducts assessments using the same 5-point  scale to report on changes in the recipient unit\u2019s level of capability and  performance. Comparing the change in a recipient unit\u2019s capability and  performance rating between the baseline and post-implementation  assessments indicates the recipient unit\u2019s positive, neutral, or negative  change since the provision of assistance. According to a DOD contractor  who leads the project assessments, these ratings do not solely represent  the effect of the provision of training and equipment on the recipient unit\u2019s  capability and performance, as other factors may contribute to the change  in performance level. DOD implemented its Global Train and Equip  assessment framework in fiscal year 2012 and baseline assessments  became a requirement of project proposals in fiscal year 2013. Projects  proposed and implemented in earlier years were not required to have a  baseline assessment at the time of proposal. However, for the purpose of  assessing changes in recipient unit capacity, DOD established  hypothetical baseline ratings for some recipient units by inquiring about  those units\u2019 capabilities prior to receipt of assistance.", "Of the 61 projects assessed, 18 were for recipient units for which DOD  had not conducted or established a hypothetical assessment of baseline  capabilities. The remaining 43 projects, representing 21 percent of the  208 projects implemented in fiscal years 2006 through 2013, were for  recipient units for which DOD conducted both an assessment of baseline  capabilities and capabilities following project implementation. As shown in  figure 6, of these 43 projects, the recipient units of 35 were assessed as  having increased by at least one rating level\u2014most often from level 1 to 2  or from level 2 to 3\u2014following project implementation. For seven of those  35 projects, DOD reported that recipient unit capabilities increased by at  least two levels. For example, DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2012 assessment report  noted that a project implemented in fiscal year 2010 intended to build  partner nation air force capacity to execute precision-guided strikes  against terrorist targets indicated that the recipient unit\u2019s new capabilities  enabled strikes on a terrorist target that diminished terrorists\u2019 capacity to  plan attacks. The remaining eight projects were directed to recipient units  assessed as having realized no change in capability. For example, one of  these four projects was intended to bolster a partner nation force\u2019s ability  to enable sustained border security operations. At the time of the  assessment, the recipient unit was using assistance for pre-deployment  activities rather than to conduct envisioned border operations.", "DOD\u2019s assessment reports and supporting documents, as well as agency  officials we interviewed, also described some factors that can affect the  extent to which DOD is able to achieve Global Train and Equip project  objectives, including proposal design and interpretation, equipment  delivery and procurement, partner nation shortfalls, and workforce  management.", "Proposal design and interpretation. Project proposal designs that  did not adequately capture recipient unit needs and capabilities  challenged the achievement of project objectives. For example,  DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2013 assessment of a fiscal year 2011 project  indicated that the design of a light ballistic protection system for  partner nation helicopters did not take into consideration the location  of navigation lights and associated inspection and maintenance  procedures. The assessment suggested that communication and  design collaboration between the United States and the partner nation  could have identified and eliminated this issue. The assessment also  indicated that changes to the aircraft had to be certified by the original  equipment manufacturer per an agreement between the partner  nation and the Russian government. Since the changes had not been  approved by the Russian authorities, the aircraft were not permitted to  fly with troops. DOD\u2019s assessment described this as a critical  shortcoming. In addition, DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2013 assessment of a  fiscal year 2011 counterterrorism project indicated that several  elements were not well designed. For instance, some vehicles  provided were considered unsuitable for use in the terrain in which  they would be used and did not have an identified need or associated  concept of operations. As pictured in figure 7, this same assessment  reported that spotting scopes provided to enhance counterterrorism  capabilities were too tall for use in a prone position, exposing the  spotter.", "Combatant command officials indicated that project proposals are at  times developed by individuals who lack subject matter expertise.  Unclear descriptions of desired capabilities in proposal documents  may make it difficult for project implementers and officials conducting  assessments to interpret the intent of the proposals. Further, DOD  officials indicated that because of institutionalized staff turnover in  U.S. embassies, the officials overseeing project implementation may  not have been responsible for project development and are less likely  to understand the capabilities of the intended recipient units or the  capability gaps that could be addressed by equipment and training.", "Equipment delivery and procurement. Equipment delivery and  procurement challenges can make it difficult to achieve desired  capability-building objectives. For example, DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2013  assessment report indicated that 7 of the 11 recipient units assessed  experienced equipment procurement and delivery issues. The  majority of projects provided to these recipients indicated  discrepancies between the number of items requested in  congressional notifications and the number of items delivered. For  instance, a fiscal year 2013 assessment of a fiscal year 2009 project  to equip the recipient unit to conduct counterterrorism operations in  urban settings reported that the unit received half the desired number  of body armor sets, one additional bulldozer, and 10 fewer night vision  rifle scopes than originally proposed. The report indicated that it was  unclear how the bulldozers were being employed in tactical  operations. In addition, incorrect equipment was delivered to some  partner nations. For example, one fiscal year 2013 project  assessment indicated that a recipient unit received left-hand drive  vehicles despite project plans for right-hand drive vehicles. Similarly, a  fiscal year 2012 assessment of a fiscal year 2009 project to bolster  the recipient unit\u2019s aerial interdiction operations found that the  incorrect surveillance equipment was delivered to the recipient unit.  When the cockpit surveillance monitors were installed, the equipment  was in the pilot\u2019s line of sight, rendering the equipment unusable per  original project design.", "Partner nation shortfalls. Shortfalls of partner nations, including their  use of assistance for purposes other than those originally envisioned  and inability to maintain and sustain equipment, can negatively affect  the achievement of project objectives. For example, the fiscal year  2013 assessments and supporting documentation of fiscal year 2008  and 2009 projects to train and equip a partner nation counterterrorism  unit indicated that the recipient unit had not been assigned to conduct  counterterrorism operations as envisioned. In this instance, although  the recipient unit, at the time of congressional notification, was  intended to conduct urban counterterrorism operations, the  assessment team found that the recipient unit had subsequently been  assigned to execute urban internal defense operations. Nonetheless,  DOD\u2019s assessment indicated that the recipient units were more  capable of conducting internal defense and counterterrorism  operations. In addition, DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2012 assessment of a fiscal  year 2010 project to enhance maritime domain awareness found that  a recipient unit\u2019s inability to maintain related equipment limited  operational performance. The recipient unit reportedly had difficulty  recruiting and training personnel to operate and maintain the  equipment, and also lacked spare parts. Similarly, DOD\u2019s fiscal year  2012 assessment and supporting documentation of a fiscal year 2008  project intended to provide coastal radar surveillance noted that the  delivered equipment and training might have helped the recipient unit  earn a level 3 or 4 capability and performance rating, but maintenance  and sustainment issues reduced its rating to level 2\u2014an increase of  only one level over its baseline assessment.", "Workforce management. DOD officials indicated that workforce  challenges, particularly related to turnover and staffing levels, inhibit  effective project design, program implementation, and oversight. They  noted that workforce turnover within the policy oversight office was  systemic and that program oversight responsibilities historically entail  more work than available personnel can manage. DOD officials  indicated that they increased office staff by three permanent positions  in fiscal year 2015. According to SO/LIC officials, as of February  2016, the policy oversight office had six permanent employees\u2014four  civilians and two military\u2014who provide oversight of Global Train and  Equip and other DOD counterterrorism partnership program activities.  In addition, other non-permanent staff and temporary detailees are  sometimes assigned to help oversee the program\u2019s key functions. In  addition, DOD officials indicated that, for several projects, the  associated embassy\u2019s security cooperation office responsible for  implementing projects in-country had staffing limitations that affected  their ability to supervise project delivery and implementation, maintain  equipment delivery records, and gauge the recipient units\u2019  implementation of the projects. Further, a U.S. Africa Command  official stated that combatant command and policy oversight office  staffing challenges inhibit effective proposal development,  implementation, oversight, and sustainment of projects."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Building partner capacity is a central focus of the U.S. counterterrorism  strategy, as underscored by the allocation of $675 million for Global Train  and Equip program activities in fiscal year 2015\u2014a sharp increase  compared to the $275 million annual average in the preceding 6 years.  Although DOD has established a methodical interagency process to  develop and select security assistance project proposals that considers  key security sector assistance planning elements, it did not require  documentation of recipient unit absorptive capacity or fully document  support for consideration of other key elements in planning fiscal year  2015 projects. Fully documenting the basis of project approval decisions  could enhance transparency, provide additional assurance that resources  are efficiently allocated, and help to ensure the long-term benefits of  projects and careful use of scarce U.S. and partner nation resources. In  addition, DOD has not consistently fulfilled its congressional reporting  requirements for the program in a timely manner. DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2013,  2014, and 2015 assessment reports were late.

We assessed the reliability of these data by interviewing  cognizant agency officials and comparing the data with previously  published data, as well as verifying them with congressional notifications.  We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To address these objectives, we analyzed program guidelines, project  proposal documents, and congressional notifications. We discussed  topics regarding the project proposal process and key elements of project  planning, project documentation, and project assessment with officials  from the Department of State (State) and DOD, geographic combatant  commands in whose areas of responsibility partner nations received fiscal  year 2015 assistance, and three selected U.S. embassies in Kenya,  Jordan, and Latvia. We selected these countries based on factors such  as the amount of funds the countries have been allocated, the maturity of  projects, project assessment experience, and geographic distribution.", "To assess the extent to which DOD considered and documented  consideration of key elements of security sector assistance for projects it  planned to implement in fiscal year 2015, we analyzed agency documents  and interviewed agency officials. We reviewed Presidential Policy  Directive 23 on Security Sector Assistance (PPD 23), which identified four  key elements to be considered for security sector assistance programs:  (1) project objectives that address partner needs, (2) the absorptive  capacity of the recipient unit, (3) the baseline capabilities of the recipient  unit, and (4) the arrangements for the sustainment of the project. To  determine the extent to which DOD considered these elements, we  interviewed State and DOD officials who develop and review proposals to  discuss (1) how they use information included in project proposal  packages to consider key planning elements and (2) other factors they  consider in developing and reviewing proposals that may not be  documented. Further, we reviewed congressional notifications SO/LIC  develops subsequent to agency approval to determine the extent to which  those documents include\u2014and thus imply consideration of\u2014information  about the four key planning elements. To determine the extent to which  DOD requested documentation about and fully documented consideration  of these elements, we analyzed the agency guidance and the content of  agency-approved fiscal year 2015 project proposals for their inclusion.  DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2015 program guidance states each project proposal  package should include four documents: a completed standardized  project proposal, a baseline assessment of the capabilities of the recipient  unit, a proposed equipment list for the project, and a Chief of Mission  concurrence letter. DOD guidance also requires a country team  assessment for projects involving night vision devices or other sensitive  technology. Each project proposal package was independently reviewed  by two analysts for the inclusion of the four elements. The analysts  resolved any disagreements through discussion of the information used to  make their independent determinations. We ultimately reported on  information included in 54 fiscal year 2015 project proposal packages. We  excluded proposals for four fiscal year 2015 projects that redirected  assistance originally approved and procured for Yemen in previous fiscal  years but which could not be delivered because of political unrest.", "With respect to our reporting on support for information about baseline  assessments, congressional notifications lay out a standardized  assessment framework to be used to assess the effects of projects. This  framework includes a baseline assessment that DOD requires to be  completed for inclusion in project proposal packages. DOD provided  baseline assessments for 51 of 54 fiscal year 2015 project proposals  notified to Congress. We analyzed these 51 baseline assessment  documents included in fiscal year 2015 project proposal packages against  DOD internal guidance to assess the completion of the required baseline  assessment sections.", "We also analyzed congressional notifications for projects DOD planned to  implement in fiscal year 2015 to assess the extent to which they included  required information related to the four key planning elements and with  respect to requirements included in the fiscal year 2015 NDAA. Each  congressional notification was independently reviewed by two analysts for  the inclusion of eight required elements. The analysts resolved any  disagreements through discussion of the information used to make their  independent determinations. We ultimately reported on information  included in congressional notifications for 41 fiscal year 2015 projects that  were subject to the requirements in the fiscal year 2015 NDAA. For this  analysis, we did not include the congressional notifications for 4 projects  that redirected assistance originally approved and procured for Yemen in  previous fiscal years but which could not be delivered because political  unrest. Because these projects were planned in prior fiscal years, they  were subject to different legislative and agency guidance. We also did not  include 13 agency-approved project notifications to Congress submitted  before the December 2015 passage of the fiscal year 2015 NDAA  because these were not subject to the new requirements.", "To assess the extent to which DOD has reported on the achievement of  project objectives since fiscal year 2009, we reviewed agency documents  and interviewed agency officials. In particular, we analyzed DOD\u2019s four  annual project assessment reports and supporting documents from fiscal  years 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 as well as the assessment framework  handbook. We analyzed DOD project implementation and funding data to  determine the number and value of implemented projects that DOD had  assessed between fiscal years 2006 and 2013. We also analyzed  submission dates for each assessment report against deadlines identified  in the fiscal year 2012 NDAA. Further, to examine the extent to which  DOD\u2019s assessments and supporting documents reported progress in  building partner capacity, we compared original baseline recipient unit  capability and performance levels assessed at the time projects were  proposed with recipient unit capability levels assessed following the  delivery of program assistance. DOD uses a standard framework for  evaluating the capabilities and performance of each recipient unit. DOD  implemented its assessment framework for the Global Train and Equip  program in fiscal year 2012, and baseline assessments became a  requirement of project proposals in fiscal year 2013. Baseline  assessments rate the recipient unit\u2019s level of capability and performance  before project implementation on a 5-point scale, with 1 defined as the  ability to perform some basic tasks to at least a low standard of  performance and 5 as the ability to perform most of the advanced tasks  for the unit\u2019s missions and to operate almost continuously throughout its  assigned area of operations. Following implementation, project  assessments and supporting documents use the same framework to  report on changes in the recipient unit\u2019s level of capability and  performance on the same 5-point scale. Projects proposed and  implemented in earlier years were not required to have a baseline  assessment at the time of proposal. However, for the purpose of  assessing changes in capacity, DOD established hypothetical baseline  ratings of some recipient units by inquiring about those units\u2019 capabilities  prior to receipt of program assistance. Following implementation, project  assessments and supporting documents use the same framework to  report on changes in the recipient unit\u2019s level of capability and  performance on the same 5-point scale. DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2012, 2013,  2014, and 2015 reports included assessments of the recipient units of 61,  or 29 percent, of the 208 projects implemented in fiscal years 2006  through 2013. Of these 61 project assessments we reviewed, 43 were  directed to recipient units where DOD had conducted both an assessment  of recipient unit\u2019s baseline capabilities and the recipient unit\u2019s capabilities  following project implementation. Assessing the change in a recipient  unit\u2019s capability and performance rating between the baseline and post- implementation assessments indicates the recipient unit\u2019s positive,  neutral, or negative change since the provision of assistance. To  determine that the data included in DOD\u2019s assessments were sufficiently  reliable for our purposes of reporting on those assessments, we met with  DOD and contracted officials responsible for conducting and reviewing  project assessments to gather information about their processes for  assessing recipient unit capabilities. We also reviewed the qualifications  and experience of the officials conducting the project assessments, which  included military experience that was relevant to the project and recipient  units being assessed. In addition, we reviewed DOD\u2019s project  assessment guidance and their template for conducting project  assessments, which was consistently used in the assessments we  reviewed. Further, the preponderance of project assessments resulting in  modest increases in recipient unit capabilities lends credibility to the  assessment process. For example, our review of DOD\u2019s project  assessments indicated that the majority of the recipient units\u2019 capability  levels increased from level 1 to 2, or from level 2 to 3 following project  implementation. None of the recipient units\u2019 capability levels were  assessed as having increased to level 5 following project implementation.  We did not conduct independent assessments to systematically validate  results included in DOD\u2019s reports. We determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "In addition, we reviewed the assessment reports to identify factors  affecting the extent to which project objectives were achieved. We also  gathered information about key factors affecting the extent to which  project objectives were achieved from interviews with DOD officials  responsible for implementing the program, including officials from DOD\u2019s  policy guidance and oversight office, Joint Staff, and geographic  combatant commands, and embassies in three selected countries, and  with officials at State\u2019s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs and Africa  Regional Bureau. We grouped the factors identified through our review of  DOD\u2019s assessments and supporting documents, and conversations with  agency officials into four categories of key factors on which we reported:  (1) proposal design and interpretation, (2) equipment delivery and  procurement, (3) partner nation shortfalls, and (4) workforce  management.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2015 to April 2016 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Nonetheless, all 54 project proposals identified at  least one potential source of funds for sustainment purposes. The most  often cited sources of funds identified in those statements were partner  nation funds (47 of 54) and State\u2019s Foreign Military Financing (FMF)  program (16 of 54). As we have previously reported, DOD\u2019s fiscal year  2016 project proposal template requests information on the availability of  FMF and other available U.S. resources if a partner nation is unlikely to  cover the expected costs of maintenance. State and DOD officials  acknowledged that, regardless of the intentions documented in long-term  sustainment plans for fiscal year 2015 projects, partner nation and State  FMF funds\u2014the two most commonly identified sources for long-term  project sustainment\u2014may not be available in future years.", "First, State and DOD officials identified several reasons why they do not  have full confidence in sustainment plans predicated on the availability of  partner nation funds. Officials explained that long-term sustainment plans  for projects were not always discussed with partner nation officials.  Projects are not guaranteed for funding until after proposals have been  submitted and approved. Sensitive to the potential challenges of raising  the expectations of partner nation counterparts, U.S. officials do not  always have direct discussions about long-term planning for projects that  might not come to fruition. In instances where long-term sustainment  planning is discussed with partner nation officials, partner nation behavior  may not conform to DOD and State\u2019s plan. For example, embassy  officials explained that their partner nation counterparts may indicate  during planning discussions that they would sustain the equipment with  national resources but then use those resources for other purposes  because of unforeseen needs or changes in priorities. Furthermore, DOD  and State officials added that the economic conditions of some recipients  call into question the validity of long-term sustainment planning that relies  on partner nation funds. For example, officials from both State and DOD  noted that recipient partner nations in Africa (accounting for $272 million  of the $675 million allocated in fiscal year 2015) do not likely have  sufficient national funds available to sustain all approved projects.", "Second, DOD and State officials acknowledge that FMF program  resources may not be sufficient to carry out plans for long-term project  sustainment. We have previously reported that FMF funds may not be  available as planned for the sustainment of some projects. Agency  officials noted that this longstanding concern has been compounded by  the additional Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund resources obligated for  the program in fiscal year 2015. Even if sufficient FMF funds are  available, U.S. officials were uncertain about the extent to which some  partner nations would use FMF resources for project sustainment. State  provides FMF assistance to certain partner nations as grants and loans  for the acquisition of U.S. defense equipment, services, and training.  State and DOD officials can work with partner nations to develop a  spending plan to include funding to sustain projects, but partner nations  could prioritize the use of FMF resources for other purposes.", "Officials from DOD\u2019s policy oversight office are aware of the sustainment  challenges that the program and recipient partner nations face. They  suggested that the ability to use funding made available for the program  to sustain projects implemented in previous fiscal years could help  address some such challenges. However, fiscal year 2012 congressional  committee report language accompanying that year\u2019s NDAA notes that  resources authorized for the program are not intended to fund long-term  sustainment. DOD officials stated that they have drafted a legislative  proposal that could modify this restriction.
