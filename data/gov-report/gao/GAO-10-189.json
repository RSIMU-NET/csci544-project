As of August 2009, VA's Veterans Health Administration (VHA) had 32 major ongoing construction projects with an estimated total cost of about $6.1 billion and average cost per project of about $191 million. Some of these projects were initiated as part of VA's Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services (CARES) process, which was a comprehensive assessment of VHA's capital asset requirements. In response to a congressional request, GAO (1) described how costs and schedules of current VHA major construction projects have changed, (2) determined the reasons for changes in costs and schedules, and (3) described the actions VA has taken to address cost increases and schedule delays. To do its work, GAO reviewed construction documents, visited three construction sites, and interviewed VA officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While about half of the 32 major ongoing construction projects are within their budget, 18 projects have experienced cost increases and 11 have experienced schedule delays since they were first submitted to Congress. Five projects have experienced a cost increase of over 100 percent. For example, the cost of a new medical center in Las Vegas rose from an initial estimate of $286 million to over $600 million, an increase of about 110 percent. Thirteen projects have experienced cost increases of between 1 and 100 percent. In addition, 11 projects have experienced schedule delays, 4 of which are more than 24 months. There are several reasons for construction project cost increases and schedule delays, including VA preparing initial cost estimates that were not thorough, significant changes to project scope after the initial estimate was submitted, and unforeseen events such as an increase in the cost of construction materials. According to VA officials, VA prepared numerous estimates during the CARES process, and some of these estimates used rudimentary estimating techniques such as average cost-per-square-foot and were completed by VA staff that did not have cost estimating expertise. The scope of some projects changed after VA submitted an estimate to Congress, which increased the projects' costs. For example, the scope for the original design for a new medical center in Las Vegas did not fully account for the amount of medical services the center would need to provide. As a result, the original estimate of $286 million rose to over $600 million. VA has taken steps to improve initial construction project cost estimates, but could better assess the risks to costs and schedules. VA plans to prepare more comprehensive estimates after approving projects and before submitting them to Congress. It is not clear how effective this new process will be, but it could improve VA's estimates. While VA contractors follow construction scheduling procedures that generally meet best practices, VA does not conduct cost or schedule risk analyses, which use statistical techniques to predict risks that can lead to cost increases and schedule delays. Thus, VA cannot quantify the largest risks to a project or mitigate those risks. For example, GAO conducted a schedule risk analysis for a medical center in Las Vegas and found that there is a 50 percent chance that the project won't be finished until more than 6 months after its estimated completion date. VA also does not require an integrated master schedule that includes VA and contractor efforts for all project phases, which can be critical to a project's success."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) operates one of the largest health  care systems in the country.

To  determine potential new major construction projects, VHA officials  identify gaps in health service during their strategic planning process, and  VHA officials in field offices develop capital needs plans to fill these  service gaps. These capital plans are then reviewed by a Capital  Investment Panel that gives each proposed project a score based on a  number of factors, including, among other things, the plan\u2019s effect on  health care, safety, and energy use. The Capital Investment Panel then  produces a priority list of projects, and the Secretary of VA determines  how many projects to request for funding each year and works with the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to produce VA\u2019s part of the  President\u2019s budget. Some large projects, such as the construction of a new  medical center, can be divided into distinct phases and funded over  several years. When the President submits VA\u2019s budget to Congress, the  budget includes a prospectus for each proposed major construction  project. This prospectus includes, among other things, a cost estimate for  the project that VA staff has assembled. In addition, some prospectuses  include an estimated month and year that the project will be completed,  although this is not required by law. This prospectus is the initial estimate  that VA sends to Congress. Congress uses this information to authorize  and appropriate funds for the project.", "In 1999, we reported that with better management of its large, aged capital  assets, VA could significantly reduce the funding used to operate and  maintain underused, unneeded or inefficient properties. We further noted  that the savings could be used to enhance health care services for  veterans. Thus, we recommended that VA develop market-based plans for  realigning its capital assets. In response, VA initiated a process known as  the Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services (CARES)\u2014a  comprehensive, long-range assessment of its health care system\u2019s capital  asset requirements. As a result of CARES, VA requested funding for about  30 new major construction projects in fiscal years 2004 and 2005. While 8  of these projects have been completed, many are among the 32 ongoing  projects. This effort required VA to prepare initial estimates for each  project over the course of a few months. In the 2 years prior to CARES, VA  proposed fewer than five major construction projects each fiscal year.  According to VA, the CARES process was a onetime major initiative.  However, its lasting result was to provide a set of tools and processes that  allow VA to continually determine the future resources needed to provide  health care to our nation\u2019s veterans.", "VA\u2019s Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) is  responsible for administering major construction projects. Once a project  has been authorized by law and Congress appropriates funds for it, CFM  staff contracts with an architect/engineering (A/E) firm to design the  project. The A/E firm develops an architectural design for the project and  also produces a cost estimate for the entire project. This cost estimate is  generally more detailed and accurate than the initial cost estimate. After  the project has been designed, CFM then solicits bids for project  construction and awards a construction contract. The construction  contractor is responsible for developing a detailed construction schedule.  CFM reviews the construction schedule and also assigns CFM engineers to  work on-site as project managers to monitor the construction process  until the facility is ready to be turned over to local VA staff. Once  construction begins, the construction company is generally responsible for  cost increases and schedule overruns under the terms of the fixed-price  contract, unless VA and the contractor agree to a change order to the  construction contract to modify scope, account for unforeseen conditions,  or remedy a design error.", "We have reported that cost estimates that are completed when a project is  in the conceptual stage have a high degree of uncertainty. As a project  progresses, this degree of uncertainty decreases because risks are  mitigated or realized. However, we have also found that cost estimates  tend to be lower than the final project costs because program managers  and decision-makers do not always consider all of the potential risks to a  project and tend to be optimistic when planning a project.", "Cost estimating requires both science and judgment.

According to VA officials in Cleveland, VA reduced the original scope of  the project by excluding room for 30 new patient beds in the new facility  so that the project could stay within its budget. However, VA will make  space for the 30 beds by expanding part of its existing facility through  separate facility funds. VA staff made other changes to the original plan for  the new facility, such as deleting balconies from patient\u2019s rooms and using  more concrete and less steel in the structure, so that the facility could be  completed within budget.

Specifically, in 2004 VA had  about 3 months to provide initial cost estimates to Congress so that  Congress could consider authorizing these projects and appropriating  funds for them in fiscal years 2004 and 2005. According to VA, a number of  VA staff worked to produce these initial estimates, including staff that had  limited cost estimating expertise. The 30 projects included three new large  medical centers in Las Vegas, Nevada; Denver, Colorado; and Orlando,  Florida. Estimates prepared for these 30 projects were prepared quickly  and sometimes based on rudimentary designs. For example, VHA officials  in Syracuse told us that they had about 6 weeks to prepare their initial  estimate for a new spinal cord injury center, which they did by using  analogous estimating techniques such as the cost-per-square foot of new  construction in Syracuse. As a result, the initial estimate was only a rough  order-of-magnitude estimate. We have reported that, while it is possible to  develop a rough order-of-magnitude estimate in days, a first-time budget- quality estimate would likely require many months.

However,  VA later determined that a much larger medical center was needed in Las  Vegas after it became clear that an inpatient medical facility it shares with  the Department of Defense would not be adequate to serve the medical  needs of local veterans. This decision greatly increased the cost, delayed  the completion date of the project, and required a modified authorization  and an additional appropriation from Congress. Since the estimate for the  Las Vegas medical center was based on a preliminary design for an  expanded clinic, additional functions had to be added to the clinic design  to provide the services necessary for the medical center. This expansion of  the scope of the project resulted in both a cost increase and schedule  delay for the project.", "In Syracuse, New York, the original design of a new Spinal Cord  Injury/Disease (SCI/D) center that is being built on the campus of the VA  medical center did not include money for additional parking. However,  after the project had been authorized by Congress and was in design, VA  officials in Syracuse commissioned a study to examine future parking  needs at the medical center. The study concluded that, based on the new  SCI/D center and projected demand from patients and staff, there should  be an additional 429 to 528 parking spaces at the medical center. As a  result of this study, VA officials in Syracuse decided to add two floors to  the existing parking garage at an estimated cost of $10 million. Based on  the parking garage addition and other changes to the project, VA received  a modified authorization in 2006 and an appropriation of $23.8 million in  fiscal year 2008 for the SCI/D center. More information about the new  SCI/D center in Syracuse is in appendix IV.", "Failure to involve stakeholders early in the process can also lead to  changes in scope. In Syracuse, the Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA)  objected to some aspects of the design of the SCI/D center. For example,  PVA advocated for a dedicated entrance from the parking garage to the  SCI/D center, which is being built on the fourth floor of the medical center.  This dedicated entrance would allow veterans with spinal cord injuries to  enter the center directly from the parking garage, without requiring the  veterans to go down to the street from the parking garage, outside to the  main entrance of the medical center, then up to the 4th floor of the  medical center for treatment.

The objective  of the analysis is to develop a probability distribution of possible  completion dates that reflect the project and its quantified risks. This  analysis can help project managers both understand the most important  risks to the project and to focus on mitigating these risks. We conducted a  schedule risk analysis of the construction schedule for the new medical  center in Las Vegas, Nevada, that is scheduled to be completed on August  22, 2011. We conducted on-site interviews with staff who are working on  the project in Las Vegas and asked them to discuss potential risks to the  project, including how the risk would affect the project\u2019s timeline and the  likelihood of the risk occurring. Using this information, we developed a list  of risks to the project (such as the chance that the design is inadequate or  that labor is not available) and how each risk would impact the duration of  specific activities in the schedule. We then used modeling software to run  a Monte Carlo simulation, which consisted of the computer-generated  results of 3,000 estimates of the future schedule based on the activities in  the schedule, the chance that some activities would be affected by some  risks, and the predicted affect of those risks on the duration of each  activity.

VA is working to complete some preliminary design work on projects and  improve initial estimates so that they are more likely to be closer to the  actual costs and schedules of a project, but the effect of these changes on  VA\u2019s initial estimates remains to be seen. While VA is taking steps to  improve its initial estimates, it does not always conduct a cost risk  analysis, which would allow project managers to better identify issues that  could lead to cost escalation and improve managers\u2019 ability to make  informed decisions on how to minimize cost risks. VA has also not used a  schedule risk analysis to determine the likelihood of a major project being  completed on time. We recognize that conducting a cost risk and schedule  risk analysis takes both financial resources and some time and that it may  only be appropriate to conduct these analyses when a project is  particularly costly, complex, or has a compressed schedule. However, the  overall effect of the analyses is to provide VA, congressional  decisionmakers, and other stakeholders with more precise information  about when a project will be completed and the main risks to a project  being completed on time. With this information, VA could provide more  accurate schedule estimates to stakeholders and could also work to  mitigate risks to the project and ensure that the project is completed on  time.

We then  analyzed the cost estimates and schedules prepared for the three projects  we visited and interviewed VA project managers and engineers,  contractors, and cost estimators and schedulers to ascertain the extent to  which their estimates and schedules compared with the best practices  identified in previous GAO work.", "We used the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide (GAO-09-3SP),  as criteria to analyze cost estimates. For this guide, GAO cost experts  assessed 12 measures consistently applied by cost-estimating  organizations throughout the federal government and industry and  considered best practices for developing reliable cost-estimates. We  analyzed the cost estimating practices used by VA in developing its cost  estimates against these 12 best practices. After reviewing documentation  submitted by the VA and information obtained during interviews, we  determined the extent that the cost estimates met the characteristics of  cost estimating best practices for the three projects we reviewed. For the  purpose of this review, we grouped these practices into four  characteristics of a high-quality and reliable cost estimate. They are    Comprehensive: The cost estimates should include both government and  contractor costs of the project over its full life cycle, from inception of the  project through design, development, deployment, and operation and  maintenance to retirement of the project. They should also provide a level  of detail appropriate to ensure that cost elements are neither omitted nor  double counted, and they should document all cost-influencing ground  rules and assumptions.", "Well-documented: The documentation should address the purpose of the  estimate, the project background and system description, its schedule, the  scope of the estimate (in terms of time and what is and is not included),  the ground rules and assumptions, all data sources, estimating  methodology and rationale, the results of the risk analysis, and a  conclusion about whether the cost estimate is reasonable. Therefore, a  good cost estimate\u2014while taking the form of a single number\u2014is  supported by detailed documentation that describes how it was derived  and how the expected funding will be spent in order to achieve a given  objective. For example, the documentation should capture in writing such  things as the source data used and their significance, the calculations  performed and their results, and the rationale for choosing a particular  estimating method or reference. Moreover, this information should be  captured in such a way that the data used to derive the estimate can be  traced back to, and verified against their sources. Finally, the cost estimate  should be reviewed and accepted by management to ensure that there is a  high level of confidence in the estimate and the estimating process.", "Accurate: The cost estimates should provide for results that are unbiased,  and they should not be overly conservative or optimistic. Estimates are  accurate when they are based on an assessment of most likely costs,  adjusted properly for inflation, and contain few, if any, minor mistakes. In  addition, the estimates should be updated regularly to reflect material  changes in the project, such as when schedules or other assumptions  change so that the estimate is always reflecting current status. Among  other things, the estimate should be grounded in documented assumptions  and a historical record of cost estimating and actual experiences on other  comparable projects.", "Credible: The cost estimates should discuss any limitations of the  analysis because of uncertainty or biases surrounding data or  assumptions. Major assumptions should be varied, and other outcomes  recomputed to determine how sensitive they are to changes in the  assumptions. Risk and uncertainty analysis should be performed to  determine the level of risk associated with the estimate. Further, the  estimate\u2019s results should be crosschecked, and an independent cost  estimate conducted by a group outside the acquiring organization should  be developed to determine whether other estimating results produce  similar results.", "Our review of project schedules was based on research that identified a  range of best practices associated with effective schedule estimating. In  addition, we obtained the consulting services of David Hulett, Ph.D., to  assist in our risk analysis of the Las Vegas Medical Center project  schedule. We analyzed documentation submitted by the VA project office  and construction staff for three of VA\u2019s major medical construction  projects. We also conducted multiple interviews with project managers,  contractors, and schedulers to determine the extent that projects\u2019 current  schedule met the best practice criteria. These practices include    Capturing all activities: The schedule should reflect all activities (steps,  events, outcomes, etc.) as defined in the project\u2019s work breakdown  structure, to include activities to be performed by both the government  and its contractors.", "Sequencing all activities: The schedule should be planned so that it can  meet project critical dates. To meet this objective, activities need to be  logically sequenced in the order that they are to be carried out. In  particular, activities that must finish prior to the start of other activities  (i.e., predecessor activities) as well as activities that cannot begin until  other activities are completed (i.e., successor activities) should be  identified. Identifying interdependencies among activities that collectively  lead to the accomplishment of events or milestones can be used as a basis  for guiding work and measuring progress.", "Assigning resources to all activities: The schedule should realistically  reflect what resources (i.e., labor, material, and overhead) are needed to  do the work, whether all required resources will be available when they  are needed, and whether any funding or time constraints exist.", "Establishing the duration of all activities: The schedule should reflect  how long each activity will take to execute. In determining the duration of  each activity, the same rationale, data, and assumptions used for cost  estimating should be used for preparing the schedule. Further, these  durations should be as short as possible and should have specific start and  end dates. Excessively long periods needed to execute an activity should  prompt further decomposition of the activity so that shorter execution  durations will result.", "Integrating schedule activities horizontally and vertically: The  schedule should be horizontally integrated, meaning that it should link the  products and outcomes associated with already sequenced activities (see  previous section). These links are commonly referred to as \u201chand offs\u201d and  serve to verify that activities are arranged in the right order to achieve  aggregated products or outcomes. The schedule should also be vertically  integrated, meaning that traceability exists among varying levels of  activities and supporting tasks and sub-tasks. Such mapping or alignment  among levels can enable different groups to work to the same master  schedule.", "Establishing the critical path for all activities: Using scheduling  software the critical path\u2014the longest duration path through the  sequenced list of activities\u2014should be identified. The establishment of a  project\u2019s critical path is necessary for examining the effects of any activity  slipping along this path. Potential problems that may occur on or near the  critical path should also be identified and reflected in the scheduling of the  time for high-risk activities (see float below).", "Identifying float between activities: The schedule should identify  float\u2014the time that a predecessor activity can slip before the delay affects  successor activities\u2014so that schedule flexibility can be determined. As a  general rule, activities along the critical path typically have the least  amount of float.", "Conducting a schedule risk analysis: A schedule risk analysis uses a  good critical path method schedule and data about project schedule risks  as well as Monte Carlo simulation techniques to predict the level of  confidence in meeting a project\u2019s completion date, the amount of time  contingency needed for a level of confidence, and the identification of  high-priority risks. This analysis should focus not only on critical path  activities but also on other schedule paths that may become critical. A  schedule/cost risk assessment recognizes the inter-relationship between  schedule and cost and captures the risk that schedule durations and cost  estimates may vary due to, among other things: limited data, optimistic  estimating, technical challenges, lack of qualified personnel, and other  external factors. As a result, the baseline schedule should include a buffer  or a reserve of extra time. Schedule reserve for contingencies should be  calculated by performing a schedule risk analysis. As a general rule, the  reserve should be held by the project manager and applied as needed to  those activities that take longer than scheduled because of the identified  risks. Reserves of time should not be apportioned in advance to any  specific activity since the risks that will actually occur and the magnitude  of their impact is not known in advance.", "Updating the schedule using logic and durations to determine the  dates: The schedule should use logic and durations in order to reflect  realistic start and completion dates for project activities. The schedule  should be continually monitored to determine when forecasted  completion dates differ from the planned dates, which can be used to  determine whether schedule variances will affect downstream work.  Maintaining the integrity of the schedule logic is not only necessary to  reflect true status, but is also required before conducting a schedule risk  analysis. The schedule should avoid logic overrides and artificial  constraint dates that are chosen to create a certain result on paper.  Individuals trained in critical path method scheduling should be  responsible for updating the schedule.", "Based on our work, we determined the extent that estimates and  schedules for the three projects we selected met the best practices  criteria.", "Not Met\u2014Project officials provided no evidence that satisfies any of the    Minimally Met\u2014Project officials provided evidence that satisfies a small  portion of the criterion,   Partially Met\u2014Project officials provided evidence that satisfies about half    Substantially Met\u2014Project officials provided evidence that satisfies a large  portion of the criterion, and   Met\u2014Project officials provided complete evidence that satisfies the entire  criterion.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2008 through  December 2009 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.

The Brecksville  medical center was primarily a nursing home care unit and psychiatric  care facility and the Wade Park medical center was primarily a surgical  care facility. According to VA, it was very expensive to operate and  maintain the two physical locations. Patients needing immediate care at  the Brecksville medical center were sometimes taken to local area  hospitals instead of the Wade Park medical center because of the distance  between the two medical centers.

In addition, a property acquisition that took longer than  expected delayed the project schedule by nine months. Part of the land  that the bed tower is being built on was donated to the City of Cleveland  for use as parkland.

The original design of a new SCI/D center did not include money for  additional parking. However, when the project had been approved by  Congress and was in design, VA officials in Syracuse commissioned a  study to examine future parking needs at the Syracuse medical center. The  study concluded that, based on the new SCI/D center and projected  demand from patients and staff, there should be an additional 429 to 528  parking spaces at the medical center.

The original estimate to Congress  was based on plans for a large VA clinic. However, VA later determined  that a much larger medical center was needed in Las Vegas after it became  clear that an inpatient medical facility it shares with DOD would not be  adequate to serve the medical needs of local veterans. Since the estimate  for the Las Vegas medical center was based on a preliminary design for an  expanded clinic, additional functions had to be added to the clinic design  to provide the services necessary for the medical center. This expansion of  the scope of the project resulted in both a cost increase and schedule  delay for the project. According to VA officials, a lack of planning and the  omission of key facilities contributed to the cost increases. Specifically,  VA officials stated that the original cost estimate did not correctly  anticipate the amount of preparation that the site needed. For example,  the original estimate did not include funding for the roads and street lights  required for the facility. In addition, the medical center could not  anticipate that the Department of Homeland Security would institute new  requirements for federal facilities as part of its continuing response to the  events of September 11, 2001, which resulted in further cost increases. VA  officials also explained that the nationwide increase in construction, the  rebuilding in the New Orleans area since hurricane Katrina, and the local  building boom in Las Vegas have driven up the cost of material and labor.  The Las Vegas area had several multi-billion dollar projects underway.  Locally, construction costs increased over 20 percent in 2006 and 2007  while the standard that VA uses for contingencies is 5 percent. To  illustrate, VA staff told us that Las Vegas builders had tied up almost 80  percent of the nation\u2019s large cranes used to build tall buildings.", "According to VA officials, in response to the increasing costs, the VA and  the architectural/engineering firm preparing the medical center design  reduced the scope of work for the final phase of the project. Gross square  footage was reduced from about 900,000 square feet to 785,000 square feet  and they eliminated extra space between floors for mechanical and  electrical cables that would have made maintenance easier. They also  reduced warehouse space and space for administrative offices because  estimators were concerned that the project could not be completed with  the funds available. The medical center warehouse, which is used to store  maintenance and medical supplies, was reduced to one-third of its  originally proposed size. As, a result, the hospital will need to acquire  warehouse storage and procure warehouse management services from  contractors outside of the VA facility.", "The economic recession that began in 2008 led several companies to  suspend their construction projects in Las Vegas, and there was greater  competition among construction firms to construct the hospital. This  change in the construction market led to a significantly lower cost of  construction than VA staff had anticipated, and VA now estimates that the  total project will cost about $100 million less than estimated. As a result,  VA officials explained they are taking steps to add these features back into  the medical center prior to completion. For example, a utility tunnel  running from the utility building to the medical center was added back to  the project once the construction contract was awarded and VA saw they  had funds available. Adding this tunnel will reduce operating and  maintenance costs for the medical center.

VA officials told us that they do not conduct SRAs and that  a risk analysis is typically not performed in the construction industry. In  August and September 2009, we performed our own schedule risk analysis  on the construction schedule. Specifically, we analyzed the C07P  schedule, which was the latest statused version available to us at the time  of the analysis.", "A schedule risk analysis uses statistical techniques to predict a level of  confidence in meeting a program\u2019s completion date. This analysis focuses  on critical path activities and on near-critical and other activities, since any  activity may potentially affect the program\u2019s completion date. The objective  of the simulation is to develop a probability distribution of possible  completion dates that reflect the program and its quantified risks. From the  cumulative probability distribution, the organization can match a date to its  degree of risk tolerance. For instance, an organization might want to adopt a  program completion date that provides a 70 percent probability that it will  finish on or before that date, leaving a 30 percent probability that it will  overrun, given the schedule and the risks. The organization can thus adopt a  plan consistent with its desired level of confidence in the overall integrated  schedule. This analysis can give valuable insight into what-if drills and  quantify the impact of program changes.", "In developing a schedule risk analysis, probability distributions for each  activity\u2019s duration have to be established. Further, risk in all activities  must be evaluated and included in the analysis. Some people focus only on  the critical path, but because we cannot know the durations of the  activities with certainty, we cannot know the true critical path.  Consequently, it would be a mistake to focus only on the deterministic  critical path when some off-critical path activity might become critical if a  risk were to occur. Typically, three-point estimates\u2014that is, best, most  likely, and worst case estimates\u2014are used to develop the probability  distributions for the duration of workflow activities.", "Once the distributions have been established, a Monte Carlo simulation  uses random numbers to select specific durations from each activity  probability distribution and calculates a new critical path and dates,  including major milestone and program completion. The Monte Carlo  simulation continues this random selection thousands of times, creating a  new program duration estimate and critical path each time. The resulting  frequency distribution displays the range of program completion dates  along with the probabilities that these dates will occur. Table 10 provides a  range of dates and the probability of the project completing on those dates  or earlier, based on our 3,000-iteration Monte Carlo simulation. For  example, according to our SRA, there is a 5 percent chance that the  project will finish on or before December 1, 2011. Likewise, there is an 80  percent chance that the project will finish on or before May 17, 2012.", "Because completion on any date is uncertain, it is more realistic to show a  range of possible completion dates than to focus on a single date. In  deciding which percentile to use for prudent scheduling, there is no  international best practice standard. The chosen percentile depends on the  riskiness and maturity of the project. For some projects we emphasize the  80th percentile as a conservative promise date. While the 80th percentile  may appear overly conservative, it is a useful promise date if a number of  new but presently unknown risks (i.e., \u201cunknown unknowns\u201d) are  anticipated. The 50th percentile date may expose the project to overruns.", "In the case of the medical center construction schedule, our analysis  concludes that VA should realistically expect turnover from the general  contractor between March 1, 2012, and May 17, 2012, the 50th and 80th  percentiles, respectively. The must finish date of August 29, 2011, is very  unlikely. Our analysis shows the probability of completing medical center  turnover by October 20, 2011, is less than 1 percent with the current  schedule without risk mitigation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Identified risks", "paragraphs": ["The project executive identified 22 different risks as a preliminary exercise  to our SRA. Using these risks as a basis for discussion, we interviewed 14  experts familiar with the project, including VA resident engineers, general  contractor officials, and A/E consultants. Each interviewee was asked four  general questions:  1.  To provide an estimate of the probability an identified risk will  occur on the project in such a way that some activity durations are  affected. The estimated probability is translated into the percentage of  the iterations that are chosen at random during the simulation. For  example, if the expert believed weather has a 10 percent chance of  affecting some activities, then, on average, weather risk will occur in  10 percent of the Monte Carlo iterations. 2.  If the interviewee believed the risk could occur, the interviewee was  asked to identify which activities\u2019 durations would be affected. For  example, activities related to steel erection or concrete pouring may be  affected if the weather risk occurs. 3.  Upon identifying affected activities, interviewees were then asked to  provide a 3-point estimate for the impact on duration. These are low,  most likely, and high impact estimates. Estimates were provided as  percentages, which were applied to the activity durations in the Monte  Carlo simulation if the risk occurred. For example, if the weather risk  occurs, a 10-day steel erection activity may be affected a minimum of  110 percent, a most likely of 150 percent, or a maximum of 200 percent  (i.e., the 3-point estimates for steel erection if weather risk occurs are  11 days minimum, 15 days most likely, and 20 days maximum). If the  risk does not occur, there is no change to the original estimated  duration. 4.  Finally, interviewees were asked to identify any risks they believe  we did not account for.", "We began the interviews with 22 risks and through the interview process  identified 11 more risks. During data analysis, some risks were  consolidated with others or eliminated due to a low amount of data. In all,  20 risks were identified and incorporated into the Monte Carlo simulation.  These include 18 risk drivers, 1 schedule duration risk, and 1 overall  system commissioning activity that was not included in the baseline  schedule. The final risk drivers used in the SRA are:    Occupancy needs may change.    Design may be inadequate.    Steel design may be inadequate.", "Medical technology may change.    Work may be misfabricated.    Equipment may not meet design requirements.    Subcontractors may fail.    Suppliers may not deliver equipment on time.    Resident Engineer (RE) staffing may be inadequate.    Contractor field office staffing may be inadequate.    Architect/Engineer (A/E) staffing may be inadequate.    Labor may not be available.    Contractor coordination problems may exist.    Communication between RE, contractor, and A/E may be ineffective.    May experience problems testing systems.    Construction disciplines may not be coordinated.    Vendor drawings may not be submitted on time.    Change orders under $100,000 may affect schedule.", "Most risks received multiple responses during the interviews. During data  analysis, we combined and analyzed data from the interviews to create  ranges and probabilities for each of the 18 risk drivers.", "Because risks are multiplicative, several risks occurring on the same  activity may overestimate the true risk. That is, in the Monte Carlo  simulation, risks occur in a series, one after another, so that an activity  that has several risks may be unrealistically extended if all risks occur. For  example, drawing approval activities may possibly be affected by RE,  contractor field office, or A/E staffing being inadequate, as well as the  schedule duration risk. If all risks occurred, drawing approval activities  will most likely be overestimated. In reality, an activity may successfully  recover from two or more risks simultaneously, so that the actual risk is  not multiplicative. Therefore, to avoid overestimation of risk, the impact  ranges of risks that occur together are reduced. That is, the 3-point  duration estimates for risks that occur together frequently were reduced;  in this particular analysis, we decreased the estimated duration impact  ranges by a factor of 0.3. This adjustment helps temper any over-estimated  risk caused by a multiplication of risk factors.", "Of the 6,098 activities in the schedule, 3,193 had risk drivers assigned to  them.

That is, we are interested in identifying  which risks have the largest impact on the schedule, because these are the  risks that should be targeted first for mitigation.", "To find the marginal impact of a risk on the total project risk at a certain  percentile, the Monte Carlo simulation is performed with the risk  removed. The difference between the finish dates of the simulation with all  the risks and the simulation with the missing risk yields the marginal  impact of the risk. Table 11 gives the priority of risks at the 80th percentile  and the marginal impact of each risk.", "The marginal impact directly translates to potential calendar days saved if  the risk is mitigated. Once risks are prioritized at the percentile desired by  management, a risk mitigation workshop can be implemented to deal with  the high-priority risks in order. The prioritized list of risks will form the  basis of the workshop, and risk mitigation plans can be analyzed using the  risk model to determine how much time might be saved. Project managers  cannot expect to completely mitigate any one risk nor is it reasonable to  expect to mitigate all risks. In addition, risk mitigation will add to the  project budget.
