However, only 2 of the 10 participants earned a bonus payment in PY1 for achieving cost savings and meeting diabetes quality-of-care targets. The remaining 8 participants met most of the quality targets, but did not achieve the required level of cost savings to earn a bonus. Many of the participants' care coordination programs were not in place for all of PY1. CMS's design for the PGP Demonstration was generally a reasonable approach for rewarding participating physician groups for achieving cost-savings and quality-of-care targets, but created challenges. CMS's decision to use comparison groups, adjust for Medicare beneficiaries' health status, and include a quality component in the design helped ensure that bonus payments were attributable to demonstration-specific programs and that cost-savings were not achieved at the expense of quality. However, the design created challenges. For example, neither bonuses nor performance feedback for PY1 were given to participants until after the third performance year had begun. CMS provides participants with quarterly claims data sets, but most participants report they do not have the resources to analyze these data sets and generate summary reports on their progress and areas for improvement. The large relative size of the 10 participating physician groups (all had 200 or more physicians) compared with most U.S. physician practices (less than 1 percent had more than 150 physicians) gave the participants certain size-related advantages that may make broadening the payment approach used in the demonstration to other physician groups and non-group practices challenging. Their larger size provided the participants with three unique size-related advantages: institutional affiliations that allowed greater access to financial capital, access to and experience with using electronic health records systems, and prior experience with pay-for-performance programs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Medicare spending for physician services paid through Medicare\u2019s Part B  fee-for-service (FFS) program grew rapidly from 2000 to 2006, increasing  from $37 billion in 2000 to $58 billion in 2006, at an average annual growth  rate of almost 8 percent, outpacing the national economy\u2019s annual average  growth rate for that period of 5.2 percent. Growth in Medicare spending  for physician services has heightened congressional concerns about how  physicians are reimbursed under the Medicare FFS payment system as  well as the long-term fiscal sustainability of the Medicare program. The  Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) and other experts  believe that the method for paying physicians under the current Medicare  FFS payment system is contributing to the rapid growth in Medicare  expenditures, because the FFS payment system generally does not  encourage physicians to make efficient use of resources, encourage  coordination of physician services with services paid under the Medicare  Part A program, or encourage improvements in quality of care. Some  private sector insurers that pay physicians on an FFS basis have recently  implemented payment systems, referred to as pay-for-performance, in  which a portion of a physician\u2019s or hospital\u2019s payment is based on meeting  performance measures designed to improve the quality of care. Congress  mandated in the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement  and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA) that the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency that oversees the Medicare program,  conduct demonstrations to test incentive-based alternative payment  methods for physicians reimbursed under Medicare FFS. The Physician  Group Practice (PGP) Demonstration was the first of several physician  pay-for-performance demonstrations CMS has implemented. In line with  BIPA\u2019s mandate and the ongoing concerns about growth in Medicare  spending for physician services, CMS\u2019s PGP Demonstration aims to  encourage the coordination of Part A and Part B services, promote  efficiency through investment in administrative processes, and reward  physicians for improving health outcomes.", "CMS\u2019s PGP Demonstration tests a hybrid payment methodology that  combines Medicare FFS payments with a bonus payment that participating  physician groups can earn by demonstrating savings through better  management of patient care and services and meeting quality-of-care  performance targets. Performance for the demonstration is based on the  success of the entire physician group practice, and not on the individual  performance of any one physician. CMS stated that it chose to focus on  large physician group practices because these organizations influence a  significant amount of Medicare expenditures and have sufficient Medicare  beneficiary volume to calculate Medicare savings or losses under the  demonstration. CMS initially designed the PGP Demonstration for a 3-year  period and recently, December 2007, continued the demonstration for a  fourth performance year. CMS solicited participation from physician  practices across the United States, and selected 10 physician group  practices with at least 200 or more physicians that were multispecialty  physician groups, which had the capacity to provide a variety of types of  clinical services. The first year of the demonstration, referred to as  performance year one (PY1), ran from April 1, 2005, through March 31,  2006, and the fourth performance year will end on March 31, 2009.", "In July 2007, CMS reported the results of PY1. As a result of their efforts, 2  of the 10 participating physician groups participating in the PGP  Demonstration earned a performance bonus payment. Specifically, the  Marshfield Clinic and the University of Michigan Faculty Group Practice  earned bonuses of approximately $4.6 million and $2.8 million,  respectively. As a part of the overall design of the demonstration, to obtain  bonus payments, each participant had to generate cost savings to  Medicare of more than 2 percent relative to a unique comparison group of  Medicare beneficiaries intended to be similar to Medicare beneficiaries  treated by that participant. Only participants that earned this cost-savings  portion of the bonus also were eligible to increase their bonus payments if  they met certain disease-specific, quality-of-care performance targets. CMS  selected 10 diabetes management measures as the quality-of-care  performance targets, and in PY1, all 10 participants achieved 7 or more of  CMS\u2019s 10 quality-of-care targets. Performance year two (PY2) and  performance year three (PY3) used the same bonus payment methodology,  with two exceptions: (1) other disease-specific quality measures are  phased in over time and (2) the share of any bonus earned by meeting  quality targets increases each year. While the specific quality-of-care  measures for each year were selected by CMS, each participating  physician group had the latitude to determine what programs\u2014such as  patient care coordination and administrative processes\u2014it would  implement to both generate cost savings and meet the quality measures.", "No one savings or quality management program was required to be  implemented uniformly.", "BIPA required us to report on the progress of the PGP Demonstration. As  discussed with the committees of jurisdiction, in this report we examined  for the first performance year of the demonstration: (1) what actions the  participating physician groups took to achieve cost savings and meet the  CMS-set, diabetes quality-of-care targets, (2) the extent to which the PGP  Demonstration design was a reasonable approach to rewarding  participating physician groups for cost-savings and quality performance,  and (3) potential challenges involved in broadening the payment approach  used in the demonstration from the 10 large participating physician groups  to other physician groups and nongroup practices.", "To determine the programs used by the participating physician groups for  the PGP Demonstration, we analyzed data we collected through written  questionnaires and interviews. We supplemented this information by  conducting site visits to 5 of the 10 locations. We included in our analysis  new programs or expansions of existing programs created in response to  the demonstration. To determine the extent to which the PGP  Demonstration design was reasonable, we analyzed documents on the  overall design and bonus payment methodology we obtained from CMS,  analyzed data collected through the questionnaire, and used interviews we  conducted with representatives of the participating physician groups and  CMS. We also reviewed and analyzed CMS documents on the design of the  PGP Demonstration. To determine the potential challenges involved in  broadening the payment approach used in the demonstration to other  physician practices, we compared selected characteristics of the 10  participating physician groups with all physician practices in the United  States, and we also relied on interviews with the participating physician  group practices, CMS officials, and relevant industry experts. In doing our  work, we tested the reliability of the data and determined they were  adequate for our purposes. We conducted this performance audit from  May 2006 through December 2007 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives.

Participants that received cost-savings bonuses were  also eligible to receive additional bonuses for meeting certain quality  targets. Both the cost-savings and quality bonuses are in addition to  payments physicians receive under Medicare FFS. There are three main  steps in CMS\u2019s bonus payment methodology to determine which  participants are awarded bonus payments and the amount of these  bonuses: (1) determination of eligibility for performance bonus payments,  (2) determination of the size of the bonus pool, and (3) determination of  actual bonus payments earned. (See fig. 1.)", "For the first step of the bonus payment methodology, to determine  eligibility for receiving bonus payments, participating physician groups  had to generate savings greater than 2 percent of their target expenditure  amounts, relative to a comparison group of beneficiaries intended to have  similar characteristics. CMS stated that the purpose of the 2 percent  savings threshold was to further account for the possibility of random  fluctuations in expenditures rather than actual savings. CMS also stated  that it used separate comparison groups for each of the participants to  distinguish the effect of the demonstration\u2019s incentive payments from  trends among Medicare beneficiaries unrelated to the demonstration.  Operationally, Medicare beneficiaries were assigned to the comparison  groups or to the participating physician groups retrospectively at the  conclusion of each performance year, using Medicare claims data sent to  CMS by providers following the delivery of care. As a part of the process  of selecting beneficiaries for each comparison group that were similar to  those served by the participating physician group they were being  compared with, CMS ensured that beneficiaries (1) resided in the same  geographic service areas as the beneficiaries assigned to the  corresponding physician group; (2) had received at least one office or  outpatient service, referred to as an evaluation and management (E&M)  service, in that performance year; and (3) had not received any E&M  services from the corresponding physician group that year or had been  assigned to the participant\u2019s group of beneficiaries in any previous  performance year.", "For step two, determining the size of the bonus pools, participating  physician groups that generated savings beyond the 2 percent threshold  were eligible to receive up to 80 percent of those savings as potential  bonuses. The remaining 20 percent, and all other savings not awarded to  the participants, were retained by the Medicare program.", "In the third step, the determination of actual bonus amounts earned,  eligible participating physician groups could receive up to the full amount  available in their bonus pools as cost-savings bonuses and quality-of-care  bonuses. Specifically, for PY1, 70 percent of the bonus pool was awarded  as a cost-savings bonus to participants who met the 2 percent cost-savings  threshold, and up to 30 percent of the bonus pool could have been  awarded as a quality-of-care bonus, for those who met the cost-savings  threshold. The quality-of-care bonus was awarded to participants that met  or exceeded various quality-of-care targets within an area of clinical focus  selected by CMS, in collaboration with other organizations and the  participating physician groups. In PY1, CMS focused on diabetes  management, and required participants to meet targets on a set of 10  diabetes measures, including whether a beneficiary received an eye exam  or foot exam. To meet the quality-of-care target for each of the diabetes  measures, a participant had to either improve its performance by a certain  amount relative to its baseline performance or meet a national set of  performance measures, referred to as HEDIS\u00ae measures, established by  the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA). Participants  could also receive a prorated share of the quality-of-care bonus, based on  success meeting some, but not all, of the quality-of-care targets.", "While the bonus payment methodology will remain the same throughout  the demonstration, CMS added other quality-of-care measures and  increased the relative significance of the quality-of-care measures in PY2  and PY3. In PY2, quality-of-care measures pertaining to CHF and coronary  artery disease (CAD) were added to the existing diabetes measures. In  PY3, quality-of-care measures pertaining to the management of  hypertension and screening for breast and colorectal cancer were added  to the existing diabetes, CHF, and CAD measures. The proportion of the  bonus pool dedicated to meeting the quality-of-care targets\u201430 percent in  PY1\u2014also increased in each performance year. For PY2, the potential  quality-of-care bonus increased to 40 percent of the potential bonus pool,  and the proportion of the bonus pool that will be paid as a cost-savings  bonus decreased to 60 percent.

Our  analysis showed that for 9 of the 10 participants at least half of  demonstration-specific, full-time equivalents (FTE) were devoted to care  coordination programs. (See table 3.) Participants told us they selected  care coordination programs that provided post-acute care because they  believed these programs would reduce future hospitalizations and yield  the most cost savings in the shortest amount of time. For example, both  Billings Clinic and Park Nicollet Health Services used a telephonic  interactive voice response (IVR) system to monitor patients\u2019 health status  at home following a hospitalization or another significant health event.", "Approximately half of the care coordination programs were case- management programs that targeted high-cost, high-risk patients with  multiple medical conditions, while the other half were disease- management programs that treated patients with a specific disease, such  as CHF. Seven participants focused on case-management programs by  using care managers for patients with multiple medical conditions to  reduce hospitalizations. For example, an official from the Dartmouth- Hitchcock Clinic stated that the clinic\u2019s primary strategy for the PGP  Demonstration was to reduce hospitalizations and readmissions through  more effective discharge planning, such as calling patients at home  following their hospital discharge and encouraging them to schedule  follow-up appointments with their physicians. Three participants  committed the majority of their resources to disease-management  programs; two of the three participants told us they focused on CHF  because it is a costly disease to treat and would therefore generate savings  within the first performance year. Other diseases, such as diabetes, could  take several years to generate cost savings. CHF and diabetes are two of  the most common chronic diseases among Medicare beneficiaries,  according to recent health policy research.", "All 10 participating physician groups reported that their care coordination  programs were making progress in both achieving cost savings and  providing broader benefits to their programs and communities. In  particular, four participants reported declines in hospitalizations for  patients enrolled in their CHF care coordination programs. For example,  Park Nicollet Health Services reported a 61 percent reduction in  hospitalizations for patients enrolled in its CHF care-management  program, which utilized an IVR to interact with patients on a daily basis.  Park Nicollet representatives estimated this program saved $4,680 yearly,  on average, for each patient enrolled in the program. Because the  demonstration included other Medicare and non-Medicare patients, its  benefits extended beyond the patients assigned to Park Nicollet for the  demonstration. Further, several participants stated that collaboration and  information sharing among the 10 participants on designing and  implementing programs and analyzing data resulted in improvements to  their demonstration programs, which broadly benefit their organizations.  Representatives from St. John\u2019s Health Systems stated that creating a care- coordination program had additional benefits, including the adoption of  such programs by other health systems and physician groups throughout  the community.", "Despite early positive indicators of cost savings, the full impact of  programs implemented for the PGP Demonstration, particularly in care  coordination, is largely unknown for a variety of reasons, including that  many programs were not in place for all 12 months of the first  performance year.

By the beginning  of PY2, only 6 of the 10 participants had all of their care coordination  programs operational. Officials from participating physician groups stated  that program implementation delays were caused by program complexity,  the process of gaining management approval for significant program start- up costs, and educating physicians about the programs.

For example,  Marshfield Clinic implemented electronic alerts in its EHR system to  remind clinical staff to provide care, such as immunizations. Participants  primarily used electronic methods for physician feedback as a tool for  physicians to track their performance and that of their peers to improve  their internal operations and patient care. For example, Geisinger Health  System\u2019s physician feedback system provided physicians with access to  monthly reports for each physician, which compared each physician\u2019s  performance in meeting the quality-of-care measures. According to  administrators from Geisinger, this transparent approach fostered positive  competition among its physicians to improve quality of care. Participants  also invested in IT by creating electronic patient or disease-specific  databases or lists referred to as patient registries to better identify patients  eligible for enrollment in diabetes programs. The St. John\u2019s Health System,  which did not have an EHR system, created an electronic patient registry  to track patients with diabetes and to alert physicians to provide certain  tests.", "Six of the participating physician groups relied to a greater extent on a  team-based approach to improve care processes. Using a team-based  approach, participants expanded the roles and responsibilities of  nonphysician staff such as nurses, medical assistants, and care managers  so that they worked more effectively with physicians to deliver quality  care. Although the demonstration required additional quality reporting,  officials from two of the participating physician groups stated that they  were able to treat the same number of patients in a day. For example,  Dartmouth-Hitchcock Clinic used care managers who were nurses to  maximize the effectiveness of patients\u2019 office visits. These staff scheduled  lab tests in advance of patients\u2019 office visits when appropriate, developed  patient action plans, and communicated with physicians before and after  patients\u2019 arrivals.

In addition to improving documentation, these initiatives  served as reminders to physicians to complete diabetes-related tests and  exams and also reduced the burden of data collection for reporting  purposes. For example, IRMA created paper forms that were added to  patient records to collect data on tests as they were conducted. In addition  to improving documentation, these forms were intended to relieve some of  the burden of collecting data for smaller practices within the organization.

In particular, three aspects of the  PGP Demonstration design were consistent with established  methodological practices considered effective: a rigorous research study  design to isolate the effects of the demonstration\u2019s incentives, a risk- adjustment approach to adjust for changes in patient health status, and a  quality component to help ensure that participating physician groups did  not achieve cost savings at the expense of quality.", "CMS used a rigorous research design to enable it to isolate the  effectiveness of the actions taken by each of the participants in the  demonstration. Specifically, CMS used a modified \u201cpre-test/post-test\u201d  control group design that is generally viewed by experts as an effective  way to control for some of the most common threats to internal validity, in  this case the ability of the study design to measure the true effects of  CMS\u2019s incentive payments. The features of CMS\u2019s study design included a  separate comparison group for each participant to distinguish the effects  of the demonstration\u2019s incentives from unrelated spending trends in the  participants\u2019 service areas. Comparison groups\u2019 beneficiaries are from the  participants\u2019 geographic service areas and, as such, are affected by the  same local market trends as the participants. In addition, the study design  included a baseline period, before the demonstration began, that helped to  control for trends that may have occurred without demonstration-related  interventions. A standard pre-test/post-test control group design would  have randomly assigned beneficiaries to either a comparison group or a  participant\u2019s beneficiaries. To avoid having to restrict or control  beneficiaries\u2019 choice of providers and health care services, and to continue  to operate within the Medicare FFS system while the demonstration was  in place, CMS modified this standard approach. Rather than assigning  beneficiaries randomly at the start of the demonstration to participant or  comparison groups, the agency retrospectively assigned beneficiaries at  the end of each year based on the beneficiaries\u2019 natural use of outpatient  E&M services.", "CMS also used a rigorous risk-adjustment approach to adjust for changes  in patients\u2019 health-care status. Without these adjustments, CMS could not  have been reasonably assured that changes in spending growth were not  attributable to changes in patients\u2019 health care status, and the severity and  complexity of diagnosis. For the PGP Demonstration, CMS tailored the  CMS-Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) model, the risk-adjustment  model that it currently uses to make capitation payments to Medicare  managed care plans. This model accounts for changes in the health status  of beneficiaries.", "Furthermore, CMS incorporated a quality component into the research  design, which helped ensure that participants would not achieve cost  savings at the expense of quality. The quality-of-care measures CMS  selected were based on a consensus of experts and were developed in  collaboration with the American Medical Association and quality  assurance organizations and with input from the participants. In addition,  CMS has placed an increased emphasis on quality in its bonus payment  methodology for future years.

Specifically, CMS provided participants with  performance feedback and bonus payments regarding their efforts in PY1  in three phases beginning 12 months after the end of PY1. In April 2007,  CMS provided each participant with a cost-savings summary report  displaying its success in controlling Medicare expenditures for PY1 and  the size of its cost-savings bonus pool. (See fig. 4.) A little over 2 months  later, CMS provided each participant with a detailed settlement sheet  displaying its individual cost-savings and quality-of-care bonuses for PY1.  It was not until July 2007, 15 months after the end of PY1, that the two  participants that earned a demonstration bonus for PY1\u2014the Marshfield  Clinic and the University of Michigan Faculty Group Practice\u2014received  their bonus payments of $3.4 million and $2.1 million, respectively.", "CMS officials explained that generating feedback for the participating  physician groups required 15 months because the demonstration design  depended on the time-consuming process of retrospectively analyzing  Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 claims and chart-based data. Specifically, CMS  officials stated that the process of calculating participants\u2019 cost-savings  bonuses required at least 12 months after the conclusion of the first  performance year\u20146 months to accrue claims data that were sufficiently  complete and a second 6 months to analyze and calculate the bonus  amounts. In addition, they stated that the calculation of the quality-of- care bonus required an additional 3 months to audit and reconcile chart- based data with claims-based data pertaining to the 10 diabetes quality-of- care measures. CMS officials stated that to calculate the cost-savings  bonus they chose to use a claims file that was 98 percent complete  because they wanted to ensure that the feedback they provided to  participants was accurate. CMS officials also stated that the time frames  for providing performance feedback and bonus payments to participants  in PY1 will be the same for PY2 and PY3.", "Officials from all 10 participating physician groups expressed concern  about the length of time CMS took to provide them with performance  feedback and bonus payments. Several participants stated that they had  difficulty making adjustments to their programs and improving their  overall performance because of delayed feedback and payments. One  official from the Novant Medical Group stated that the 15-month time lag  in receiving bonus payments would prevent the organization from  reinvesting these resources into demonstration-related programs and  improving them for subsequent performance years. In addition, two of the  participants told us that other pay-for-performance programs they have  participated in have used payment methodologies that yielded more timely  performance feedback or bonus payments. For example, officials from the  University of Michigan Faculty Group Practice indicated that a pay-for- performance program sponsored by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan  provided them twice a year with feedback for meeting certain quality-of- care targets.", "In response to these concerns, CMS has been working to provide each  participating physician group with a quarterly Medicare patient claims  data set related to beneficiaries they served. Initially, data sets were  provided quarterly and focused on identifying patients with chronic  conditions who had a hospital admission or emergency room visit. In July  2007, CMS provided each participating group with a data set on hospital  inpatient, outpatient, and physician information consisting of the Medicare  claims of beneficiaries likely to be included in the PY2 cost-savings  calculations. In September 2007, CMS responded to participants\u2019 requests  for quarterly claims data that would allow them to assess their cost- savings performance during the performance year, by providing them with  a revised data set. CMS\u2019s most recent data set included Medicare inpatient,  outpatient, and physician claims data for beneficiaries likely to be  included in the year-end cost-savings calculation. The data set includes  information on these beneficiaries for the first quarter of PY3. CMS noted  that it will not provide equivalent information pertaining to comparison  group beneficiaries because these data are too time-consuming to  assemble.", "While CMS\u2019s provision of ongoing quarterly data sets to participants is  timelier than the information provided before, most participants told us  they do not have the necessary resources to analyze these data sets in a  timely manner. This lack of timely actionable data could hinder  participants\u2019 ability to adjust their programs on a more \u201creal-time\u201d basis.  Officials from only 2 of the 10 participants told us they would able to  analyze and use the quarterly data sets CMS provided. Consequently, the  data sets are not as useful as providing CMS-generated quarterly reports,  similar to the final reports CMS provided on participants\u2019 progress in  achieving cost-savings and quality-of-care targets. CMS may not be able to  provide quarterly reports that include comparison group trends or provide  quality-of-care data that rely on chart-based data because of complexity  and cost. However, CMS could provide participants with estimates on  their growth in per-beneficiary expenditures each quarter, as well as  changes in the profile of the beneficiaries who are likely to be assigned to  the participants. CMS could also use more readily available claims data to  provide quarterly estimates of participants\u2019 progress in meeting the  quality-of-care targets. In PY1, for example, that would have included  reporting progress on 4 of the 10 claims-based quality targets on diabetes,  such as whether a beneficiary received an eye exam."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Use of a Uniform 2 Percent Savings Threshold for All Participants May Have Made Earning a Bonus More Challenging for Particular Providers", "paragraphs": ["CMS officials said they adopted the use of a uniform 2 percent threshold to  ensure that savings generated really were due to demonstration-related  programs. Just as CMS used individual comparison groups for each  participant, CMS could have used separate savings thresholds that more  closely reflected the market dynamics of each participant\u2019s overall area  instead of a uniform savings threshold chosen based on historical data  averaged across the 10 participants. However, use of different thresholds  for each participant, according to CMS officials, would have been complex  and would have generated additional administrative burden in processing  bonus payments.", "Nevertheless, the use of a uniform savings threshold\u20142 percent\u2014that all  participating physician groups had to achieve before becoming eligible for  a bonus payment may have made earning bonus payments more  challenging for particular providers, specifically those with already low  Medicare spending growth rates or those that had comparison group  providers with low spending growth rates. Participants with low relative  spending may have had difficulty generating annual Medicare savings of  greater than 2 percent compare to those participants with high spending  growth rates before the demonstration began, some participants argued.  Supporting this concern is the wide variation in the amount participants  spent per beneficiary in the year prior to the demonstration, which ranged  from $6,426 to $11,520, after adjusting for health status. In addition,  participants with comparison groups that had relatively low spending  growth may have faced more of a challenge reducing their spending below  2 percent of their comparison groups\u2019 spending than participants with  comparison groups that had higher relative spending growth. In fact, both  participants that received a bonus, Marshfield Clinic and the University of  Michigan Faculty Group Practice, were measured against comparison  groups with high relative spending growth rates\u2014the 2 largest among the  10 participants. While their success cannot necessarily be attributed to the  high relative spending of their comparison groups, the high spending  growth of the comparison groups against which they were measured may  have had some effect."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Participant Concerns", "paragraphs": ["In addition, several participating physician groups noted selected concerns  particular to their local markets. For example, officials from one  participating physician group expressed concern that CMS did not  adequately adjust for the conversion of several hospitals in their market to  critical access hospitals (CAH), which generally receive higher Medicare  payments. Participant officials noted that their physician group treat more  patients from these hospitals, which resulted in a higher spending trend  and lower likelihood of obtaining a cost-savings bonus. CMS stated that  the agency will examine this issue as part of its evaluation at the  conclusion of the PGP Demonstration.", "Several participating physician groups were also concerned that their  groups had more beneficiaries with specialist visits relative to their  comparison groups. As a result, participants providing more specialty  care may have had less control over the health outcomes of these  beneficiaries. However, analyses conducted by CMS showed that these  participants provided 80 percent or more\u2014a predominant share\u2014of the  E&M services for most of the beneficiaries assigned to them in PY1,  regardless of specialty, and had meaningful opportunities to influence  beneficiary health care expenditures. CMS officials stated that they will  continue examining this issue and other related issues brought to their  attention by the participants as part of their evaluation of the  demonstration."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Participating Physician Groups Had Several Size-Related Advantages, Which May Pose Challenges in Broadening the Payment Approach Used in the Demonstration to More Participants", "paragraphs": ["The large size of the 10 participating physician groups compared with the  majority of physician practices operating in the U.S. gave the participants  certain size-related advantages that might make broadening the payment  approach used in the demonstration to more participants challenging. The  10 participating physician groups had significantly higher numbers of  physicians, higher annual medical revenues, and higher numbers of  supporting staff, and were more likely to be multispecialty practices than  most practices in the U.S. Specifically, the participating physician groups  generally had three unique size-derived advantages: institutional  affiliations that allowed greater access to financial capital, access to and  experience using EHR systems, and experience prior to the PGP  Demonstration with pay-for-performance programs.", "While all the participating physician groups in the demonstration have 200  or more physicians in their practices, significantly less than 1 percent of  the approximately 234,000 physician practices in the U.S. in 2005 had 151  or more physicians in their practice. (See fig. 5.) By contrast, practices  with only 1 or 2 physicians comprised 83 percent of all practices.  Furthermore, while all 10 participants were multispecialty practices,   68 percent of the all practices in the U.S. were single-specialty practices,  which are generally smaller organizations. The 10 participating physician  groups were also large compared with other physician practices in terms  of annual medical revenues and nonphysician staff. Participants generated  an average of $413 million in annual medical revenues in 2005 from  patients treated by their group practice, far greater than the revenues  generated by single specialty practices in the U.S. Only about 1 percent of  single specialty practices had revenues greater than $50 million. In  addition, these physician groups and their affiliated entities, such as  hospitals, employed approximately 3,500 nonphysician FTEs, over 100  times more than the average single-specialty practice.", "Their larger relative size gave the 10 physician groups participating in the  PGP Demonstration three size-related advantages over smaller physician  practices, which may have better prepared them to participate in the  demonstration\u2019s payment model and implement programs encouraged by  the demonstration. First, participants typically had institutional affiliations  with an integrated delivery system, a general hospital, or a health  insurance entity. Specifically, 9 of the 10 participating physician groups  were a part of an integrated delivery system, 8 were affiliated with a  general hospital, and 5 were affiliated with an entity that marketed a  health insurance product. In contrast, a representative of the Medical  Group Management Association estimated that approximately 15 percent  of all physician practices in the U.S. have an affiliation with a general  hospital.", "As a result of these affiliations, participating physician groups generally  have greater access to the relatively large amounts of financial capital  needed to initiate or expand programs. On average, each participating  physician group invested $489,354 to initiate and expand its  demonstration-related programs and $1,265,897 in operating expenses for  these programs in PY1. (See app. III.) Specifically for individual programs,  participants reported spending an average of $190,974 to initiate and  $409,332 to operate case management programs in PY1, almost twice the  spending associated with any other type of program. (See table 5.) Several  participants reported that the majority of their individual program  expenditures were labor costs for care managers. Officials from several  participating physician groups said that smaller practices might have  difficulty implementing similar programs because they may not have the  financial resources to do so.", "The second advantage the 10 large participating physician groups had over  smaller physician practices is a greater likelihood of having or acquiring  EHR systems, which was essential in participants\u2019 ability to gather data  and track progress in meeting quality-of-care targets. Eight of the 10  participating physician groups had an EHR in place before the  demonstration began, and the 2 other participants, out of necessity,  developed alternative methods for gathering patient data electronically  specifically for the demonstration, such as creating patient registries. In  contrast, only an estimated 24 percent of all physician practices in the  United States had either a full or partial EHR in 2005, and large practices  were more likely to have EHRs than small practices. These systems  enable physician group practices with multiple locations, such as the 10  participating physician groups, to share patient information and other  administrative resources across a wide geographic area. Health care  information technology experts believe that the primary reason smaller  physician practices have not implemented EHRs is their cost, estimated at  $15,000 and $50,000 per physician. In addition, experts estimated that  annual maintenance costs add between 15 and 25 percent of the initial per  physician investment. Furthermore, experts noted that small practices  tend to pay more per physician for EHR systems than larger physician  practices because larger physician practices are better able to spread the  fixed costs of these systems across more physicians.", "Finally, the third size-related advantage that most of the 10 participating  physician groups had over smaller physician practices was the larger  groups\u2019 experience with other pay-for-performance systems prior to  participating in the PGP Demonstration. Overall, 8 of the 10 participants  had previous experience with pay-for-performance programs initiated by  private or public sector organizations. This experience may have eased  their adjustment to the PGP Demonstration and afforded them greater  initial and overall success. For example, the University of Michigan  Faculty Group Practice\u2019s participation in a pay-for-performance system  sponsored by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan offered the physician  group incentives to upgrade its chronic care infrastructure. In addition to  experience with pay-for-performance programs, generally, the majority of  the 10 participating physician groups had experience with specific  elements of pay-for-performance, such as physician bonus compensation  methods and physician feedback processes. Representatives from some of  the participating physician groups stated that their exposure to one of  these various elements of pay-for-performance elements prior to the PGP  Demonstration may have enabled their organizations to adjust to the  demonstration more rapidly."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The care coordination programs used by the participating physician  groups show promise in achieving cost savings and improving patient  outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries. As a result of the demonstration,  participating physician groups generated several different approaches for  coordinating patient care across inpatient and physician settings for high- risk and high-cost patients, such as those with CHF, and better managing  patients with diabetes, the quality-of-care target for the demonstration set  by CMS. Additional years of the demonstration may be needed, however,  for CMS to collect and analyze the information necessary to fully evaluate  the effectiveness of these care coordination programs and their potential  for cost savings in this demonstration. Only one participant had all of its  care coordination programs operational for all 12 months of PY1, and  participants did not receive timely feedback from CMS on their progress  until PY3 had already begun.", "While CMS\u2019s demonstration design was generally reasonable, the lengthy  time CMS took to provide participating physician groups with  performance feedback and bonus payments may limit more widespread  use in other demonstrations, or use as an alternative method for paying  physicians group in Medicare FFS. The lack of timely and actionable  performance feedback also hinders participants\u2019 ability to improve their  programs in response to data. Providing performance feedback and bonus  payments to participants more than 12 months after the end of the  measurement period precludes physician groups from adjusting their  program strategies on a more \u201creal-time\u201d basis. CMS has recently taken  action to provide participants with quarterly claims data sets on their  beneficiaries for PY3, but most participants indicated they would have  difficulty analyzing such data to determine their progress in achieving  cost-savings and quality-of-care targets.", "Measuring participants\u2019 performance using a comparison group where  beneficiaries were retrospectively assigned after the end of a performance  year, as used in this demonstration, may be impractical for more  widespread use beyond this demonstration because physician groups  cannot accurately predict on an ongoing basis whether they would be able  to generate cost-savings and receive bonus payments. In addition, the use  of a uniform savings threshold amount, such as the 2 percent used in this  demonstration, raises questions about whether this approach provides a  disincentive for physician groups that have lower spending. Physician  groups with fewer than 200 physicians\u2014the vast majority of practices in  the United States\u2014may also have more difficulty than larger practices,  such as the participants in this demonstration, absorbing the start-up and  annual-operating costs of the care coordination programs and  implementing them without EHR systems that many groups believed were  necessary to achieve cost savings while maintaining and improving the  quality of care.", "As the PGP Demonstration continues, data will become available to CMS  to determine how much influence factors such as the delay in the start-up  of participating physician groups\u2019 care coordination programs and its  decision to use a uniform 2 percent threshold, and other factors, may have  had on participants\u2019 ability to earn bonus payments. Consequently, it is  understandably too early to determine the success of the PGP  demonstration, but evidence so far indicates that the care coordination  programs initiated by the participants show promise, but that the wider  applicability of the payment methodology used in the demonstration may  be more limited."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Administrator of CMS provide participating  physician groups with interim summary reports that estimate participants\u2019  progress in achieving cost-savings and quality-of-care targets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["CMS reviewed a draft of this report and provided comments, which appear  in appendix IV.
