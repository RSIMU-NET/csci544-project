To address this, in July 2017, CMS issued revised procedures through which it can recoup funds for eligibility errors, beginning in fiscal year 2022.

The Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (CMS)\u2014within the Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS)\u2014is responsible for overseeing states\u2019 compliance with  Medicaid eligibility requirements, including recouping funds spent in error,  as the accuracy of states\u2019 determinations can have significant implications  for federal and state spending.", "To qualify for Medicaid coverage, individuals generally must fall within  certain categories or populations, and must meet the eligibility criteria  associated with an eligibility group that is covered by the state.  Depending on the group, individuals must meet certain financial eligibility  criteria, such as having income below specified levels. Individuals must  also meet nonfinancial criteria such as citizenship and residency  requirements. Individuals may meet the criteria for more than one  category and eligibility group; that is, they could have more than one  potential basis for their eligibility.

In such cases, a state enrolls the individual under one  basis of eligibility following its procedures.", "In recent years, there have been changes to Medicaid eligibility rules and  CMS\u2019s oversight of eligibility determinations. The Patient Protection and  Affordable Care Act (PPACA) made changes to Medicaid eligibility rules,  providing states the option to expand eligibility to certain nonelderly  adults, as well as requiring changes to Medicaid eligibility processes  beginning in 2014. For example, PPACA specified a new way for states  to calculate income for most nonelderly, nondisabled Medicaid applicants  and included requirements related to electronic verification of Medicaid  applicants\u2019 information. Given the changes required by PPACA, CMS  suspended its programs for measuring Medicaid eligibility errors\u2014such  as the enrollment of ineligible individuals and the improper denial of  eligible individuals\u2014for fiscal years 2015 through 2018. Thus, less is  known about the accuracy of states\u2019 Medicaid eligibility determinations  during that time period. You asked us to review states\u2019 Medicaid eligibility  determinations.

These states were selected to  obtain variation in program characteristics, including whether the state  opted to expand Medicaid eligibility as a result of PPACA; had integrated  all bases of eligibility under a single eligibility system; and whether the  state allowed CMS, through its Federally Facilitated Exchange, to  determine Medicaid eligibility on its behalf. For the selected states, we  reviewed documentation of their policies and procedures, eligibility  system rules, and Medicaid application questions. We also interviewed  officials from each selected state\u2019s Medicaid agency and, if applicable,  partner agencies responsible for eligibility determinations.

In verifying individuals\u2019 eligibility,  states must assess specified financial and nonfinancial information.", "Financial: Individuals applying for Medicaid generally must have an  income below a certain limit. PPACA requires states to calculate the  income for most nondisabled, nonelderly applicants using a uniform  method based on modified adjusted gross income (MAGI), which is  derived from a federal tax-based definition of income. States have  more flexibility in determining how to calculate incomes for individuals  whose eligibility is determined on the basis of age or disability,  because their income is not calculated using MAGI-based methods.  For example, states may disregard certain types or amounts of  income for these MAGI-exempt populations. Additionally, individuals  eligible on the basis of age or disability generally must also have  assets\u2014cash or real or personal property that are owned and can be  converted to cash\u2014below specified standards that vary by state.", "Nonfinancial: Individuals applying for Medicaid must also satisfy  certain nonfinancial criteria. For example, to be eligible for Medicaid  individuals generally must be residents of the state in which they are  applying and must be either citizens of the United States or certain  noncitizens, such as lawful permanent residents.", "States generally have flexibility in the sources of information they use to  verify applicants\u2019 financial eligibility and citizenship or immigration status.  However, to the extent practicable, states must use third party sources of  data for these verifications prior to requesting documentation from the  applicant. When data from reliable third party sources are inconsistent  with information from an application, the state must have processes in  place to resolve these inconsistencies, such as through requesting  additional documentation or accepting the applicant\u2019s attestation.  Additionally, states may accept self-attestation for some eligibility criteria,  such as residency in the state and household composition (which is used  in determining if applicants\u2019 income is below the limit).", "Once a state determines that an individual meets relevant financial and  nonfinancial eligibility criteria, the state enrolls the individual into Medicaid  under one basis of eligibility. Examples of bases of eligibility include those  applicable to children, pregnant women, individuals eligible for  Supplemental Security Income (SSI)\u2014a program that provides cash  assistance to low-income adults and children with disabilities\u2014and other  low-income adults under age 65 in states that expanded their Medicaid  populations under PPACA. (See table 1.)", "Since individuals may meet the criteria for more than one category and  eligibility group, they could have more than one basis of eligibility. For  example, a child who is pregnant could meet the criteria applicable to  children and those applicable to pregnant women. However, a state  would enroll each individual under one basis of eligibility. CMS  regulations specify that when states determine applicants eligible based  on MAGI criteria, they must notify these individuals of the benefits and  services available through any MAGI-exempt bases of eligibility for which  they may qualify, in order to provide the individual information about  whether to request a MAGI-exempt eligibility determination. However,  CMS officials explained that they advise states that they do not need to  inform applicants of benefits and services under other eligibility groups if  there is no meaningful difference in the benefits or cost-sharing that the  individual would receive under one basis compared to another. CMS  officials also noted that they have provided further guidance to states on  assigning bases of eligibility, including that if an individual meets the  criteria for more than one basis, the state should enroll the person into the  most beneficial coverage in terms of factors such as the benefit package  and out-of-pocket costs.", "In 2014, CMS issued a framework based on federal rules for states to use  in developing their systems to assess individuals\u2019 bases of eligibility.  The framework describes a hierarchy for states to use in developing their  eligibility systems that begins with bases related to receipt of other federal  benefits, such as SSI and federally funded foster care and adoption  assistance, which often result in automatic eligibility for Medicaid.  Following these bases of eligibility, states are to assess eligibility for  bases subject to MAGI-based income rules, and should first evaluate for  mandatory coverage before evaluating for optional coverage. Federal  rules allow for some exceptions to this sequence, such as when an  individual who may be eligible for bases subject to MAGI-based income  rules requests consideration under a MAGI-exempt basis to access  certain additional benefits, such as long-term services and supports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal and State Oversight of Eligibility Determinations", "paragraphs": ["CMS has historically operated two distinct, but complementary programs  to oversee states\u2019 eligibility determinations in the Medicaid program.", "The Medicaid Eligibility Quality Control (MEQC) program, which is  implemented by states and overseen by CMS, was created in 1978 to  monitor the accuracy and timeliness of Medicaid eligibility  determinations in order to avoid inappropriate payments and eligibility  decision delays. MEQC was also designed to identify methods to  reduce and prevent errors related to incorrect eligibility determinations  by having states review sample cases to independently verify  eligibility criteria and then report the results to CMS.", "The Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) program is CMS\u2019s  process to estimate the national Medicaid improper payment rate in  accordance with the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002, as  amended, and Office of Management and Budget guidance. To  calculate the Medicaid improper payment rate through PERM, CMS  computes an annual rolling average of improper payment rates across  all states based on a 3-year rotation cycle of 17 states each year.  PERM is comprised of three components, including one that  measures errors in state determinations of Medicaid eligibility.", "For fiscal years 2015 through 2018, CMS suspended MEQC and the  eligibility component of PERM to provide states with time to adjust to  eligibility process changes in PPACA; in its place, CMS required states to  implement pilots to assess the accuracy of their eligibility determinations.  As a result, CMS did not publish an updated national estimate of improper  payments due to Medicaid eligibility errors for fiscal years 2015 through  2018. Eligibility reviews under PERM, which are conducted by a federal  contractor, resumed in July 2017 for fiscal year 2019. In November  2019, CMS released an updated national estimate of Medicaid eligibility  errors, which reflected results of the first 17 states reviewed under the  new PERM process. Going forward, states are to resume MEQC  reviews in the 2 years between their PERM reviews. The MEQC reviews  will focus, in part, on specific areas of improvement for each state. For  example, states might choose to focus on specific populations, such as  whether pregnant women were assigned to the appropriate eligibility  group, or specific processes, such as asset verification.", "The Medicaid statute includes a provision for CMS to recoup, or disallow,  federal funds related to erroneous payments for ineligible individuals and  overpayments for eligible individuals. The provision generally requires  CMS to recoup funds from states for eligibility-related improper payments  if the state\u2019s eligibility error rate exceeds 3 percent. CMS has general  authority to recoup funds from states when it determines that an  expenditure of federal funding is not an allowable expense; according to  CMS, however, this general authority does not apply to eligibility-related  errors, given the separate specific statutory authority. Therefore, it is the  view of the agency that CMS cannot recoup funds from states whose  eligibility-related improper payment rate is below the 3 percent threshold.", "In addition to the PERM and MEQC oversight, state auditors review  Medicaid eligibility determinations, including through audits conducted at  the auditors\u2019 initiative and as part of audits required by provisions of the  Single Audit Act of 1984. To guide auditors in performing reviews under  the Single Audit Act, the Office of Management and Budget issues a  document referred to as the Compliance Supplement, which identifies  important compliance requirements that the federal government expects  to be considered as part of such an audit. Beginning in fiscal year 2014,  the Compliance Supplement directed auditors to forgo review of eligibility  determinations for individuals whose income is calculated based on  MAGI. The supplement noted that testing was being performed under  Medicaid eligibility review pilots, which would serve as CMS\u2019s oversight  during the initial years of PPACA implementation when the MEQC and  the eligibility component of PERM were suspended. In June 2019, the  Office of Management and Budget issued the 2019 Compliance  Supplement that included changes to permit state auditors to test  eligibility determinations of both MAGI and MAGI-exempt populations to  ensure enrollees qualify for the Medicaid program and are in the  appropriate enrollment category."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Basis of Eligibility Decisions Can Vary Among Selected States despite Consideration of Similar Factors", "paragraphs": ["The five selected states in our review considered similar factors when  ranking the bases of eligibility to which individuals are assigned\u2014such as  bases related to children, pregnant women, or disabled individuals\u2014but  the resulting basis of eligibility in which individuals were placed could  vary. Each of the five states ranked bases of eligibility by comparing how  beneficial they were for enrollees across several key factors, and ordered  the bases into a hierarchy starting with the most beneficial, according to  officials. The states\u2019 eligibility systems were programmed to apply these  hierarchies in deciding each individual\u2019s basis of eligibility; when an  individual was potentially eligible for more than one basis of eligibility, the  system would assign them to the basis highest in the ranking.", "The key factors the selected states considered in ranking the bases of  eligibility, according to state officials, included (1) whether eligibility was  related to the receipt of benefits from other programs, (2) the services  provided through the benefit package, and (3) the financial implications  for the individual.", "Eligibility related to other programs. The selected states ranked  bases of eligibility associated with enrollment in other federal and  state assistance programs at or near the top of their hierarchies. For  instance, eligibility associated with receipt of SSI was generally at the  top of the states\u2019 hierarchies, and eligibility associated with receipt of  federal foster care and adoption assistance benefits was ranked  above other bases for which a child might be eligible.", "Services included in the benefit package. Bases of eligibility that  conveyed additional benefits, such as long-term services and  supports, were ranked higher. Similarly, bases that offered limited  benefits, such as only covering family planning services or assistance  with cost-sharing for Medicare beneficiaries (i.e., the Medicare  Savings Program) were ranked lower in the selected states\u2019  hierarchies.", "Financial impact. The selected states ranked bases of eligibility  lower if they were associated with additional financial requirements for  the individual, such as asset tests as a condition of eligibility, or out- of-pocket costs once enrolled. For example, bases of eligibility that  required applicants to make copayments to receive certain services,  or to pay a monthly premium, were ranked lower than those without  such costs.", "Although the selected states considered similar factors when deciding an  individual\u2019s basis of eligibility for Medicaid, a similarly situated individual  could be enrolled under a different basis of eligibility in one state versus  another state. Decisions varied across states, in part, because of  differences in (1) how states factored in the length of the enrollment  period; and (2) the degree to which states\u2019 eligibility systems and  processes were integrated.", "Length of the enrollment period. Officials in selected states  considered the length of the enrollment period when deciding bases of  eligibility for certain populations, such as pregnant mothers (pregnant  women who were also eligible as caretakers of dependent children).  Pregnant women who are eligible for Medicaid have continuous  eligibility, which guarantees enrollment through at least 60 days  postpartum regardless of income changes. For this reason, Oklahoma  enrolled pregnant mothers under a basis of eligibility applicable to  pregnant women. In contrast, Virginia enrolled pregnant mothers  under a basis of eligibility applicable to caretakers, because it has a  12-month enrollment period. However, pregnant women have  continuous eligibility through at least 60 days postpartum regardless  of income changes or whether they are enrolled as caretakers or on  some other basis. As such, if a pregnant woman enrolled as a  caretaker no longer met the income standard for a caretaker, for  example, she could still remain eligible through her postpartum period.  Alternatively, a woman enrolled under a pregnancy-related basis of  eligibility would be redetermined for eligibility at the end of her  postpartum period and could continue enrollment as a caretaker if she  continued to meet the financial and other eligibility criteria. CMS  noted that such variations in eligibility policies are allowable and  expected among state Medicaid programs.", "Eligibility system integration. Differences in the degree to which  selected states integrated their eligibility systems affected how  individuals were assessed for potential bases of eligibility and  potentially resulted in different eligibility determinations. Officials in  four of our five selected states\u2014New Mexico, Oklahoma, Tennessee,  and Virginia\u2014reported operating unified or integrated eligibility  systems through which individuals could be considered for both MAGI  and MAGI-exempt bases of eligibility. The fifth state, Maryland, had  separate eligibility systems for MAGI and MAGI-exempt bases of  eligibility, so an individual would need to apply through both systems  to have all potential bases of eligibility considered. As such, an  individual who is over age 65 and a caretaker of a dependent child  would have to submit two separate applications to be assessed for all  potential bases of eligibility in Maryland. Depending on the system to  which he or she applied, that individual could be enrolled in a less  beneficial basis of eligibility or denied eligibility for Medicaid. For  example, the individual might be determined ineligible for full Medicaid  benefits and enrolled in a Medicare Savings Program, in which  Medicaid covers out-of-pocket costs related to Medicare benefits.  (See fig. 1.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Audits Identified Multiple Issues Related to the Accuracy of Eligibility Determinations; Selected States Had Processes Designed to Address Many Identified Issues", "paragraphs": ["Our review of 47 state and federal audits across 21 states identified  multiple issues affecting the accuracy of states\u2019 Medicaid eligibility  determinations. The accuracy issues identified in the audits we reviewed  generally fell into nine broad categories, such as eligibility determinations  made with incorrect or incomplete income or asset information,  unresolved discrepancies between what applicants reported as their  income and electronic data sources, and unidentified or unaddressed  changes in circumstances, such as changes in household income or  size. (See table 2.)", "Within these nine broad categories, the audits identified several specific  accuracy issues, including states that were not conducting income checks for individuals reporting no income; not terminating the enrollment of individuals who had moved out of enrolling individuals who did not provide required information (such as  proof of citizenship) on a timely basis; months or years behind schedule in conducting required eligibility not acting on\u2014or not having adequate systems in place to detect\u2014 changes in enrollees\u2019 circumstances that could affect eligibility, such  as changes in income or household composition.", "See table 3 for examples of audit findings related to each of the accuracy  issue categories, and appendix I for an overview of the key findings for  each audit we reviewed.", "In some cases, the accuracy issues identified by auditors resulted in  errors in eligibility determinations, such as instances when applicants  were determined eligible even though their incomes were above the  applicable limit, or instances in which the state did not enroll eligible  individuals. However, in other instances, the accuracy issues identified by  auditors did not result in erroneous eligibility determinations. For example,  in some cases the audit found that a state determined that an applicant  was eligible based on incorrect or incomplete financial information;  however, auditors found that the applicant would have still been eligible  for Medicaid even after reviewing additional financial information. In other  cases, auditors found that eligibility determinations complied with state  policies and federal requirements, but that changes in state policies\u2014 such as using additional data sources or checking sources more  frequently\u2014could provide more information that could be used to improve  eligibility determinations. For example, audits in three states found that  the quarterly wage data the states used to verify income did not detect  certain nonwage income; that income could have been identified had the  states chosen to use state or federal tax data as a verification source.  Auditors in one of these states (Louisiana) also found that checking  income data during individuals\u2019 coverage period, such as on a quarterly  basis, could have saved the state tens of millions of dollars in managed  care fees for individuals whose incomes exceeded eligibility thresholds  during their enrollment period.", "The selected states we reviewed reported having processes in place that  were designed to avoid or address many, but not all, of the accuracy  issues identified. The following are examples of the states\u2019 processes  related to specific accuracy issues.", "Incorrect or incomplete income or asset information. All five selected  states we reviewed reported checking electronic data sources to verify  income, including for individuals who report $0 in income. Officials from  some states noted, however, that the electronic sources they have  chosen to use do not include all relevant types of income, such as self- employment income. The five states also reported having electronic  asset verification systems to verify financial assets, such as bank and  retirement accounts for applicants subject to asset limits. One state (New  Mexico) reported that it recently implemented an asset verification system  that includes information from financial institutions, property ownership  records, and vehicle licensing.", "Eligibility redeterminations not made in a timely manner. To help  ensure that redeterminations are made in a timely manner, all five  selected states reported conducting automatic redeterminations for at  least some MAGI enrollees using electronic data sources to confirm  continued eligibility. The proportion of MAGI enrollees whose eligibility  was automatically redetermined ranged from about 10 to 80 percent.  Officials from Virginia, which was cited by auditors in 2015 as having  significant delays in conducting redeterminations, reported that automatic  redeterminations have helped improve timeliness. Where automatic  eligibility redeterminations are not conducted\u2014such as for enrollees  whose incomes could not be confirmed through electronic sources or who  are eligible on a MAGI-exempt basis\u2014the five selected states reported  having systems in place to generate a redetermination packet or notice to  be sent to enrollees prior to the end of their eligibility period. Officials  reported that enrollees who do not complete their redetermination would  be disenrolled, with states varying in how quickly they would take such  action. For example, Oklahoma officials reported that the state  automatically terminates enrollment for individuals who do not reply with  the required information by the end of their coverage period. In contrast,  Virginia officials reported that redeterminations for which no response  was provided are kept open, pending eligibility worker action; the state\u2019s  systems do not automatically terminate enrollment.", "Unresolved income discrepancies. Officials in the five selected states  reported that their eligibility systems automatically identify income  discrepancies. For example, Oklahoma officials indicated that if there is  more than a 5 percent difference in the income reported on the  application and the income from electronic data sources, their system  either alerts eligibility workers or automatically sends a request for  additional information to the enrollee.", "Individuals enrolled in incorrect basis of eligibility. According to state  officials, their eligibility systems have automated checks to reassess the  eligibility for individuals reaching certain milestones, such as the  maximum age for their basis of eligibility (i.e., children reaching adulthood  and adults reaching age 65) and pregnant women who are approaching  the end of their 60-day postpartum period. For example, to help ensure  individuals are correctly assigned to the appropriate basis of eligibility,  officials in Maryland noted that they apply system edits that preclude  individuals who are pregnant, age 65 or older, or enrolled in Medicare  from being incorrectly assigned to the new adult group.", "Unidentified or unaddressed changes in circumstances. Officials  from the five selected states indicated that they generally had systems in  place to identify if an enrollee had died or moved out of state. For  example, officials from the five selected states reported conducting  periodic checks of residency through the Public Assistance Reporting  Information System\u2014a federal data source that identifies individuals  receiving benefits in other states\u2014and following up with identified  enrollees to see if they still reside in the state. None of the selected states  conducted regular reviews to identify changes in MAGI enrollees\u2019  incomes during the enrollment period, although one state\u2014Oklahoma\u2014 planned to implement interim checks of income in response to a recent  change in state law. Oklahoma also reported that it conducted quarterly  checks of wage data for MAGI-exempt enrollees.", "Use of incomplete or incorrect information on household  composition. The selected states generally did not have processes in  place to detect accuracy issues related to household composition,  although officials in four of the five states\u2014Maryland, New Mexico,  Oklahoma, and Virginia\u2014noted that eligibility information from other  benefit programs may be compared with Medicaid files to detect changes  or discrepancies in household membership."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Previous Reviews CMS Used for Measuring Eligibility Errors Were Insufficient to Recoup Funds from States; New Procedures Are in Place for 2022", "paragraphs": ["In 1983, CMS implemented its statutory requirement to recoup funds  associated with Medicaid eligibility-related improper payments for states  with an eligibility error rate above 3 percent through its MEQC program.  The MEQC program required states to randomly sample Medicaid  enrollees to verify eligibility. Claims related to enrollees determined  ineligible were tallied and compared with total claims for the sample  universe to calculate an error rate. Following federal validation, states  were subject to recoupment of all or part of the federal funds expended  related to erroneous state payments over the 3 percent error rate  threshold.", "However, in 1992, HHS\u2019s Departmental Appeals Board\u2014the  department\u2019s final level of administrative review\u2014concluded that the  MEQC error rate was not sufficiently accurate to provide reliable evidence  to support recoupment of funds due to the small sample size from which  the error rate was calculated. Consequently, the appeals board stated  that it was \u201cimpossible to conclude with a reasonable certainty that the  States failed to meet their target rates\u2026.\u201d As a result of this opinion,  CMS provided states the option, beginning in 1994, to either continue  operating a traditional MEQC program or to conduct what CMS referred  to as \u201cMEQC pilots,\u201d which focused on prospective improvements in  eligibility determinations, rather than calculation of error rates. Since the  \u201cMEQC pilots\u201d did not produce an error rate, CMS could not recoup  federal funds expended due to erroneous eligibility determinations for  states participating in the pilots. Between 2012, the earliest year for which  CMS has maintained records, and 2014 when CMS suspended the  MEQC program, 39 states participated in these \u201cMEQC pilots\u201d exempting  them from possible recoupment of funds due to eligibility errors. While  the other 12 states that continued to operate traditional MEQC programs  could still be subject to recoupment of funds, CMS officials reported that  no recoupments related to eligibility errors had occurred since the 1992  appeals board ruling, because none of these states had an error rate  exceeding the 3 percent threshold. Thus, CMS has not recouped federal  funds due to eligibility errors in decades.", "However, the agency has introduced new procedures through which it  can, under certain circumstances, begin to recoup funds based on  eligibility errors in fiscal year 2022. Specifically, in July 2017, CMS issued  new regulations that included changes to its PERM process to satisfy the  statutory requirements for recouping funds that MEQC was previously  designed to operationalize. Under the revised PERM rules, CMS  calculated an eligibility error improper payment rate beginning with the  cohort of states under review for the fiscal year 2019 reporting period.  However, it will not recoup funding from states with error rates exceeding  the 3 percent threshold until states have a second review under the  revised PERM rules, which will occur for the first cohort of states in fiscal  year 2022. This allows each state the opportunity to implement  improvements based on its initial PERM review and the MEQC review it  will conduct in the off-cycle years to reduce the error rate or demonstrate  a \u201cgood faith effort\u201d to do so.", "CMS officials recognize the benefits of using state and federal audits,  such as audits we reviewed for this report, as part of a broader strategy to  improve program integrity and oversee states\u2019 eligibility determination  processes. However, CMS officials told us they do not have the authority  to recoup federal funds related to eligibility errors identified outside of the  PERM process, such as through state single audits. According to CMS  officials, this is because of the specific statutory instruction limiting  recoupments to instances when eligibility-related errors exceed the 3  percent error rate threshold, and because PERM is the process that CMS  uses to calculate that error rate. The President\u2019s fiscal year 2020 budget  request included a legislative proposal to expand HHS\u2019s authority to issue  disallowances for eligibility errors. Specifically, the proposal requests  legislative authority to permit HHS to issue disallowances outside of PERM and allow HHS,  including the HHS-OIG, to extrapolate findings on beneficiary eligibility  to ensure federal recovery of incorrect eligibility determinations; and eliminate the current 3 percent threshold for states\u2019 eligibility-related  improper payments. In place of the current 3 percent disregard, HHS  would issue rulemaking specifying criteria for the recoupment of  funds, including limiting them to instances of monetary loss, such as  cases in which ineligible individuals received benefits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Determining whether individuals are eligible for Medicaid is a complex  process that is vulnerable to error. The processes used to measure the  extent of eligibility errors have been, and will continue to be, in a state of  transition over the next several years as CMS implements its new PERM  procedures and states implement improvements after their initial PERM  reviews under these new procedures. Because CMS has not had a  complete national estimate of improper payments due to eligibility errors  since 2014, policymakers and other stakeholders have had an incomplete  picture of the extent of eligibility errors in the Medicaid program nationally.  This state of flux will make the findings from federal and state audits an  even more important source of information on the accuracy of states\u2019  eligibility determinations. As we have previously reported, oversight of the  Medicaid program could be further improved through leveraging and  coordinating program integrity efforts with state auditors to further  improve the integrity of the Medicaid program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS for review and comment.
