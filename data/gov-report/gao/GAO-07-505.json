Fewer than half the items GAO selected for testing could be located. Most of the missing items were information technology (IT ) equipment. Given recent thefts of laptops and data breaches, the requesters were concerned about the adequacy of physical inventory controls over VA IT equipment. GAO was asked to determine (1) the risk of theft, loss, or misappropriation of IT equipment at selected locations; (2) whether selected locations have adequate procedures in place to assure accountability and physical security of IT equipment in the excess property disposal process; and (3) what actions VA management has taken to address identified IT inventory control weaknesses. GAO statistically tested inventory controls at four case study locations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["A weak overall control environment for VA IT equipment at the four locations GAO audited poses a significant security vulnerability to the nation's veterans with regard to sensitive data maintained on this equipment. GAO's Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government requires agencies to establish physical controls to safeguard vulnerable assets, such as IT equipment, which might be vulnerable to risk of loss, and federal records management law requires federal agencies to record essential transactions. However, GAO found that current VA property management policy does not provide guidance for creating records of inventory transactions as changes occur. GAO also found that policies requiring annual inventories of sensitive items, such as IT equipment; adequate physical security; and immediate reporting of lost and missing items have not been enforced. GAO's statistical tests of physical inventory controls at four VA locations identified a total of 123 missing IT equipment items, including 53 computers that could have stored sensitive data. The lack of user-level accountability and inaccurate records on status, location, and item descriptions make it difficult to determine the extent to which actual theft, loss, or misappropriation may have occurred without detection. GAO also found that the four VA locations reported over 2,400 missing IT equipment items, valued at about $6.4 million, identified during physical inventories performed during fiscal years 2005 and 2006. Missing items were often not reported for several months and, in some cases, several years. It is very difficult to investigate these losses because information on specific events and circumstances at the time of the losses is not known. GAO's limited tests of computer hard drives in the excess property disposal process found hard drives at two of the four case study locations that contained personal information, including veterans' names and Social Security numbers. GAO's tests did not find any remaining data after sanitization procedures were performed. However, weaknesses in physical security at IT storage locations and delays in completing the data sanitization process heighten the risk of data breach. Although VA management has taken some actions to improve controls over IT equipment, including strengthening policies and procedures, improving the overall control environment for sensitive IT equipment will require a renewed focus, oversight, and continued commitment throughout the organization."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In light of reported weaknesses in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)  inventory controls and reported thefts of laptop computers and data  breaches, you were concerned about the adequacy of controls over VA  information technology (IT) equipment. In July 2004, we reported that the  six VA medical centers we audited lacked a reliable property control  database, which did not produce a complete and accurate record of  current inventory and compromised effective management and security of  agency assets. We found that key policies and procedures established by  VA to control personal property provided facilities with substantial  latitude in conducting physical inventories and maintaining their property  management systems, which resulted in reduced property accountability.  For example, VA\u2019s Handbook 7127/3, Materiel Management Procedures  allowed the person responsible for custody of VA property to attest to the  existence of that property rather than requiring independent verification.  Also, personnel at some locations interpreted a policy that established a  $5,000 threshold for property that must be inventoried as a license to  ignore VA requirements to account for sensitive, lower cost items that are  susceptible to theft or loss, such as personal computers and peripheral  equipment. Personnel at the VA medical centers, which are part of the  Veterans Health Administration (VHA), located fewer than half of the 100  items we selected for testing at each of five medical centers and 62 of 100  items at the sixth medical center. Most of the items that could not be  located were computer equipment. Based on our work, we concluded in  our July 2004 report that these weak practices, combined with lax  implementation, resulted in low levels of accountability and heightened  risk of loss.", "During 2006, VA employed nearly 235,000 employees and relied on an  undetermined number of contractors, volunteers, and students to support  its operations. VA provided these individuals a wide range of IT  equipment, including desktop and laptop computers, monitors and  printers, personal digital assistants, unit-level workstations, local area  networks, and medical equipment with memory and data  processing/communication capabilities. VA information resource  management (IRM) and property management personnel share  responsibility for management of IT equipment inventory.", "This report responds to your request that we perform follow-up work to  determine (1) the risk of theft, loss, or misappropriation of IT equipment  at selected VA locations; (2) whether selected VA locations have adequate  procedures in place to assure physical security and accountability over IT  equipment in the excess property disposal process; and (3) what actions  VA management has taken to address identified IT equipment inventory  control weaknesses. In assessing the risk of theft, loss, or   misappropriation of IT equipment, you also asked that we consider the  results of physical inventories performed by the four case study locations  covered in this audit and the six medical centers we previously audited.", "To achieve our first two objectives, we used a case study approach,  selecting VA medical centers located in Washington, D.C., Indianapolis,  Indiana, and San Diego, California; associated clinics; and VA headquarters  organizations for our test work. To determine the risk of theft, loss, or  misappropriation of IT equipment at these locations, we statistically tested  IT equipment inventory to determine the effectiveness of controls relied  on for accurate recording of inventory transactions, including existence  (meaning IT equipment items listed in inventory records exist and can be  located), user-level accountability, and inventory record accuracy. As  requested, we also obtained and analyzed the results of physical  inventories performed by the case study locations covered in our current  and our previous audits. In addition, our investigator assessed physical  security of IT equipment storerooms and procedures for reporting lost and  missing items to VA law enforcement officials at our four current case  study locations. To determine if the four case study locations had adequate  procedures in place for proper disposal of excess IT equipment, we  assessed procedures for security and accountability of excess IT  equipment and independently tested a limited selection of computer hard  drives for proper removal of data and compliance with VA property  management policies. We performed sufficient procedures to determine  that inventory data at the test locations were reliable for the purpose of  our audit.

We also found that  critical inventory system data fields, such as user and location, were often  blank. Completion of these data fields would have created records of  essential transactions for IT inventory events. Because property  management system inventory records were incomplete and out-of-date, it  is not possible to determine the timing or events associated with lost IT  equipment as a basis for holding individual employees accountable.", "In addition to failures in our tests for accurate user organization and  location, we found that the inventory system data field for identifying IT  coordinators at headquarters units was often blank or incorrect. The IT  coordinator role, which is unique to VA headquarters offices, is intended  to provide an additional level of control for tracking and managing  assignment of IT equipment within each headquarters organizational unit.  Our tests for accurate and complete information on headquarters IT  coordinators found 85 errors out of a sample of 344 records tested. We  estimated the failure rate for the IT coordinator records at VA  headquarters units to be 47 percent. Further, although VA headquarters  officials told us they use hand receipts for user-level accountability of  mobile IT equipment that can be removed from VA offices for use by  employees who are on travel or are working at home, we found this  procedure was not used consistently. For example, we requested hand  receipts for 15 mobile IT equipment items in our statistical sample that  were being used by VA headquarters employees. These items either could  be or were taken off-site. We received 9 hand receipts\u20141 that had expired,  6 that were dated after the date of our request, and 2 that were valid.  Officials at the three medical centers we tested were able to provide hand  receipts for IT equipment that was being used by their employees at home.", "Officials at all four case study locations expressed concerns that it would  be difficult and burdensome to implement user-level accountability for IT  equipment, particularly in the case of shared workstations used by  multiple employees. However, Washington, D.C., medical center officials  initiated actions to establish user-level accountability for individual  employees and unit heads who have shared workstations. In March 2007,  Washington, D.C., medical center officials implemented a policy for user- level accountability and began training their employees on the new  requirements. The new policy requires employees to sign personal custody  receipts for IT equipment assigned to them, and it requires supervisors to  be responsible for IT equipment that is shared among staff in their  sections. The policy states that users of IT equipment will be held  accountable for acts deemed inappropriate or negligent and that  employees are personally and financially responsible for loss, theft,  damage, or destruction of government property caused by negligence.

VA policy requires that when property items are  determined to be lost or missing, they are to be listed in a Report of Survey  and an investigation is to be conducted into the circumstances of the loss  before these items are written off in the property records. As of      February 28, 2007, the four case study locations covered in our current  audit reported over 2,400 missing IT equipment items with a combined  original acquisition value of about $6.4 million as a result of inventories  they performed during fiscal years 2005 and 2006. Based on information  obtained through March 2, 2007, the five case study locations we  previously audited had identified over 8,600 missing IT equipment items  with a combined original acquisition value of over $13.2 million.

The  Washington, D.C., medical center performed a wall-to-wall physical  inventory in response to our July 2004 report, which found that previously  performed physical inventories of IT equipment were ineffective. In this  case, inventory results reflected several years of activity involving IT  inventory records that had not been updated and lost and missing IT  equipment items that had not previously been identified and reported.  Although the San Diego medical center had performed periodic physical  inventories, it had not followed VA policy for including sensitive items,  such as IT equipment valued at less than $5,000. As a result, the San Diego  medical center\u2019s Reports of Survey are not a good indicator of the extent  of lost and missing IT equipment at this location.

For example, VA headquarters officials told us that during  renovations of headquarters offices 10 years ago, IT equipment was  relocated to office space designated as storerooms. When this space had  to be vacated for renovation, the IT equipment had to be relocated, and  many items were sent to disposal.

Each sample item for a test location was  subsequently weighted in our analysis to account statistically for all items  in the population for that location, including those that were not selected.", "We performed tests on statistical samples of IT equipment inventory  transactions at each of the four case study locations to assess whether the  system of internal controls over physical IT equipment inventory was  effective (i.e., provided reasonable assurance of the reliability of inventory  information and accountability of the individual items). For each IT  equipment item in our statistical sample, we assessed whether (1) the item  existed (meaning that the item recorded in the inventory records could be  located), (2) inventory records and processes provided adequate  accountability, and (3) identifying information (property number, serial  number, model number, and location) was accurate. We explain the  results of our existence tests in terms of control failures related to missing  items and recordkeeping errors. The results of our statistical samples are  specific to each of the four test locations and cannot be projected to the  population of VA IT transactions as a whole. We present the results of our  statistical samples for each population as (1) our projection of the  estimated error overall and for each control attribute as point estimates  and (2) the two-sided, 95 percent confidence intervals for the failure rates.", "Our investigator supported our tests of IT physical inventory controls by  assessing physical security and reporting of missing items for purposes of  law enforcement investigations. As part of our assessment, our  investigator interviewed VA Police at the three medical centers and federal  agency law enforcement officers at VA headquarters about reports and  investigations of lost, stolen, and missing IT equipment. Our investigator  also met with physical security specialists at each of the test locations to  discuss the results of physical security inspections and the status of VA  actions on identified weaknesses.", "To determine if the four test locations had adequate procedures for  control and removal of data from hard drives of IT equipment in the  property disposal process, our IT security specialist selected a limited  number of computer hard drives for testing. We attempted to test a total of  10 hard drives in each category\u2014drives with data and drives that had been  sanitized\u2014at each of the four test locations. Because some hard drives we  selected were damaged or computer systems pulled for hard drive testing  did not contain hard drives, the number of hard drives actually tested was  less than the number we selected for testing. At the San Diego medical  center, 5 hard drives selected for testing that were labeled as unerased had  in fact been sanitized, and we included these hard drives in our  sanitization testing. Table 9 shows the numbers of hard drives tested at the  four locations we audited.", "In performing these tests, our specialist used SMARTTM and Foremost  software. SMARTTM is a software utility that has been designed and  optimized to support forensic data practitioners and information security  personnel in pursuit of their respective duties and goals. SMARTTM is  currently used by federal, state, and local law enforcement; U.S. military  and intelligence organizations; accounting firms; and forensic data  examiners. Foremost is a program used to recover files based on their  headers, footers, and internal data structures. Foremost, originally  developed by the United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations  and the Center for Information Systems Security Studies and Research, is  now available to the general public. In addition, our investigator  performed physical security inspections and assessed accountability over  computer hard drives in the disposal process.", "To identify management actions taken in response to previously identified  control weaknesses, we interviewed VA officials at our test locations,  walked through the IT inventory processes to observe controls as  implemented, and met with VA\u2019s Chief Information Officer (CIO). We also  obtained and reviewed copies of new and revised VA policies and  procedures.", "We briefed VA managers at our test locations and VA headquarters,  including VA medical center directors, VA headquarters information  resource management and property management officials, and VA\u2019s CIO  on the details of our audit, including our findings and their implications.  On April 9, 2007, we requested comments on a draft of this report. We  received comments on June 22, 2007, and have summarized those  comments in the Agency Comments and Our Evaluation section of this  report. We conducted our audit work from September 2006 through March  2007 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards, and we performed our investigative work in accordance with  standards prescribed by the President\u2019s Council on Integrity and  Efficiency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Veterans Affairs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Gayle L.
