In response, Congress passed the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act of 1994 (FACE), which made it a federal offense to engage in violent or obstructive conduct intended to interfere with people seeking or providing reproductive health services. Abortion clinic violence remains an issue of national concern.", "In response to your request, this report provides information on (1) the occurrence of abortion clinic incidents before and after FACE, as reported to us by representatives of clinics that abortion rights groups identified as having experienced relatively high levels of incidents before the enactment of FACE; (2) views regarding FACE and its effectiveness from representatives of these clinics, selected police departments and U.S. Attorney offices, and other representatives from the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), national abortion rights organizations, and national anti-abortion organizations; (3) efforts by local and federal law enforcement agencies following the enactment of FACE, and satisfaction with these agencies; and (4) any court cases pertaining to FACE and the courts\u2019 rulings in those cases.", "To provide this information, we surveyed representatives of 42 clinics that had experienced relatively high levels of incidents before FACE according to data collected by abortion rights groups, a sample of 15 police departments that serve the areas where those clinics are located, and 36 U.S. Attorney offices whose districts include those clinics. We based our sampling plan on clinics that reportedly experienced relatively high levels of violence before FACE; therefore, the views we obtained are illustrative, rather than representative of all groups in the country. Our survey results are not generalizable to all clinics, police departments, and U.S. Attorney offices. In doing our work we also interviewed other officials from DOJ and ATF and representatives of national abortion rights and anti-abortion organizations. We identified lawsuits that pertained to FACE by reviewing legal databases and DOJ information."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["FACE was enacted on May 26, 1994. The act gave the federal government a new tool for investigating and prosecuting abortion-related violence and disruptions. It established federal criminal penalties and civil remedies for \u201ccertain violent, threatening, obstructive and destructive conduct that is intended to injure, intimidate or interfere with persons seeking to obtain or provide reproductive health services.\u201d FACE also prohibited the damage or destruction of property that belongs to a reproductive health care facility. Appendix I contains the text of FACE in its entirety.", "FACE not only sought to protect the rights of those seeking or providing abortion services, it also sought to protect the rights of anti-abortion protestors in expressing their views. The act states that it must not be construed to prohibit any expressive conduct, including peaceful picketing or other peaceful demonstration, protected by the First Amendment. Thus, circumstances dictate whether such actions as picketing violate the law. For example, peaceful, nonobstructive picketing on public property would not violate FACE; obstructive or threatening picketing on clinic property could be found to violate the act.", "Criminal and civil FACE cases can be initiated in different ways and result in different penalties. Criminal FACE prosecutions may be brought only by the Attorney General of the United States, and only if an alleged FACE violation has already occurred. The act sets out criminal penalties of fines, imprisonment, or both, depending on the nature of the violation and whether it is a first or subsequent offense. For example, in cases of nonviolent physical obstructions, first-time offenders can receive a maximum sentence of 6 months\u2019 imprisonment and a $10,000 fine. If bodily injury results from an offense, regardless of whether it is a first or subsequent offense, the maximum sentence is 10 years; and if death results, the maximum sentence is any term of years or life imprisonment. Civil actions may be brought by the Attorney General of the United States; the Attorney General of any state on behalf of anyone who is injured or may be injured by a violation of FACE; or any aggrieved person involved in providing, obtaining, or seeking to provide or obtain reproductive health services. Courts have the discretion to award appropriate relief, including injunctions, damages, attorneys\u2019 fees, and costs of suit.", "The Attorney General has vested in DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division the federal government\u2019s civil and criminal enforcement authority to bring cases in court under FACE and other federal statutes that can be applied to abortion clinic violence. According to a high level DOJ official, the Civil Rights Division has often investigated and brought cases in collaboration with U.S. Attorneys\u2019 offices in the field, and occasionally U.S. Attorneys\u2019 offices have brought cases on their own. However, all civil and criminal charging decisions must be approved by the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.", "In August 1994, shortly after two murders took place outside an abortion clinic in Florida, the Attorney General formed a federal task force to investigate the possible existence of a national conspiracy against reproductive health care providers and to coordinate federal enforcement activities. The task force consisted of representatives from DOJ\u2019s Criminal Division, Civil Rights Division, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and United States Marshals Service; and ATF. This task force played an important role in the early implementation of FACE, according to a high-level DOJ official. The task force prompted the first criminal prosecution under FACE and made federal prosecutors across the country more aware of the applicability of other preexisting federal criminal statutes to clinic violence. The Attorney General\u2019s task force went out of existence in early 1997 after its lead prosecutors concluded that it lacked sufficient evidence to prove the existence of a national conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt.", "In January 1995, following shootings at clinics in Massachusetts and Virginia, the President instructed DOJ to take certain steps to address clinic violence. He instructed DOJ to direct (1) each United States Attorney to immediately head an abortion violence task force of federal, state, and local law enforcement officials; and (2) each U.S. Marshal to consult with clinics regarding communications with law enforcement agencies. The task force was to formulate plans to address clinic security. The Attorney General followed the President\u2019s order with a memorandum outlining the task forces\u2019 responsibilities, including developing plans to address abortion clinic security, coordinating law enforcement efforts relating to abortion violence, assisting local law enforcement in responding to abortion clinic incidents, and ensuring that cases that could be tried under FACE are filed appropriately.", "The Attorney General\u2019s memo also lays out in general terms federal and local law enforcement responsibilities regarding abortion clinic violence. It states that \u201cviolence against abortion providers is, in the first instance, a violation of state and local law and the duty to prevent such crime and investigate and prosecute it when it occurs falls primarily to state and local officials, where they are able to deal effectively with it. However, the federal government has an important role in assisting state and local authorities and bringing to bear federal tools and resources . . . .\u201d The memo states that clinics in need of assistance should be advised to first contact their local police departments.", "In mid-1997, due to concerns that clinic violence had increased and federal coordination had declined, the Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights established an Abortion Violence Working Group. The group was formed to promote communication and coordination among federal law enforcement components and agencies involved in investigating and prosecuting abortion violence cases. Comprising senior representatives of DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division, Executive Office for United States Attorneys (EOUSA), the FBI, the Marshals Service, and senior representatives of ATF, the group reportedly meets every 5 to 6 weeks to share information, coordinate law enforcement and litigation strategies, and formulate plans to respond to perceived threats to providers of reproductive health services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Our report objectives were to provide information on (1) the occurrence of abortion clinic incidents before and after FACE, as reported to us by representatives of clinics that abortion rights groups identified as having experienced relatively high levels of incidents before the enactment of FACE; (2) views regarding FACE and its effectiveness from representatives of these clinics, selected police departments and U.S. Attorney offices, and other representatives from DOJ, ATF, three national abortion rights organizations, and two national anti-abortion organizations; (3) efforts by local and federal law enforcement agencies following the enactment of FACE and clinic, U.S. Attorney office, police department, abortions rights group, and anti-abortion rights group representatives\u2019 satisfaction with these agencies; and (4) any court cases pertaining to FACE and the courts\u2019 rulings in those cases.", "To obtain information from clinics on changes in the occurrence of clinic incidents, we conducted structured telephone interviews with a judgmental sample of representatives of 42 abortion clinics identified as having experienced relatively high levels of violence during the 2-year period prior to the passage of FACE. Three national abortion rights groups used data they had collected during the 1993 and 1994 time frame to identify these clinics for us. During the interviews with clinic representatives, we listed types of incidents that the clinics might have experienced, and we asked whether each type of incident had occurred at the clinic in either of the two time periods we were studying. We asked only whether each incident had occurred, not how many times it occurred. Furthermore, we did not ask respondents whether each type of incident they experienced was a violation of FACE, for this would have required a legal assessment. (See app. II for the questionnaire we used to interview clinic representatives and their aggregate responses to these and other questions.)", "To obtain the views of representatives from abortion clinics, police departments, U.S. Attorney offices, and others regarding the effectiveness of FACE and the efforts of federal and local law enforcement following the enactment of FACE, we conducted structured telephone interviews with representatives of 42 abortion clinics and 15 police departments selected from a stratified sample of the 40 departments that serve the locations of the clinics we contacted. In addition, we sent questionnaires to the 36 U.S. Attorneys who serve the federal judicial districts in which the clinics we contacted were located. We also interviewed other officials at DOJ, ATF, and representatives of three national abortion rights organizations and two anti-abortion organizations. We reviewed studies and documents related to FACE and abortion clinic violence. (See app. II through app. IV for copies of our survey instruments. See app. V for a listing of the organizations we contacted during our review.)", "Because we did not draw a representative sample of abortion clinics, police departments, and U.S. Attorney offices, the results of our structured surveys represent only the clinics, police departments, and U.S. Attorney offices we contacted. Nevertheless, these survey results are useful for better understanding the implications of FACE. In responding to open-ended survey questions, respondents provided narrative answers that sometimes involved more than one theme or topic. Consequently, when we categorize and discuss responses in this report, the number may appear to exceed the total number of respondents.

Many respondents also indicated that the frequency of incidents had decreased, as did severity, particularly the severity of picketing.", "Although clinics\u2019 experiences with anti-abortion incidents varied, representatives of almost all these clinics told us they experienced picketing and hate mail or harassing phone calls during both time periods. In addition, their responses indicated declines in the number of clinics experiencing blockades, vandalism, invasions, bomb threats, death threats, assaults, and stalking of clinic staff or family members. For example, 27 of the 42 respondents told us their clinics had experienced blockades during the 2 years prior to FACE; 6 said they had experienced blockades during the most recent 2 years. Thirty-six respondents told us of vandalism at their clinics during the first time period; 19 reported vandalism in the more recent period.

Of those explaining how picketing had become less severe, one respondent told us that picketers were very aggressive and verbally abusive prior to FACE, but that events are now quieter and take the form of \u201cprayer vigils.\u201d Another said that protestors are still picketing, but they do so in fewer numbers and they follow the rules.

Police department respondents expressed divergent views about FACE\u2019s effectiveness.

For example, one respondent said that violent demonstrators were given only a \u201cslap on the wrist\u201d before FACE, but FACE made them realize that consequences can be more severe. Another respondent whose clinic had been involved in a FACE prosecution credited FACE with ending what he described as a cycle in which some protestors endlessly engaged\u2014blockading, being arrested, spending a few days in jail, and then blockading again. Five clinic respondents credited FACE with increasing support or awareness of local law enforcement. For example, one respondent explained that as a result of FACE, local authorities more seriously enforced clinic-related violations of the law.", "Of the 36 U.S. Attorney office representatives surveyed, 21 believed that FACE had an effect on clinic violence or disruptions in their districts. In describing the effect of the act, 15 respondents said that FACE, or federal actions taken as a result of FACE, had reduced or deterred incidents. A representative from 1 U.S. Attorney office stated that his district\u2019s prosecutions of 12 individuals in 3 separate physical obstruction cases resulted in removing the violators from the streets and appeared to have deterred similar illegal conduct by others. In his view, FACE, in conjunction with state and local enforcement efforts, appeared to have reduced the number of illegal protestors to a core group of offenders who were unlikely to be easily deterred.", "Twenty-three of the 36 U.S. Attorney office respondents believed that FACE enhanced local law enforcement\u2019s ability to protect clinics from violence, and 27 believed it enhanced federal law enforcement\u2019s ability to do the same.", "Representatives of 27 U.S. Attorney offices cited strengths they saw in FACE. Eight respondents focused on the flexibility FACE provides or the additional federal tools it offers. These respondents cited federal restraining orders and injunctions and the law\u2019s flexibility that allows for bringing either civil or criminal causes of action. Seven respondents saw the act\u2019s strength in its establishment of federal authority. For example, one respondent explained that FACE allows for intervention in an area that was previously outside federal jurisdiction. To a lesser extent, respondents cited other strengths of FACE, including the additional attention it has brought to the issue of clinic incidents, its harsher penalties, and the communication it promotes among law enforcement agencies.", "DOJ officials we contacted said that FACE has been a significant tool that has allowed the federal government to undertake investigations, prosecutions, and civil actions in an area in which it previously had limited criminal authority and no authority to pursue civil remedies. FACE, in effect, gave the FBI jurisdiction to investigate abortion clinic violence and, in so doing, allows the use of FBI resources to augment ATF\u2019s continued role in investigating clinic arsons and bombings. Also, according to DOJ officials, the existence of FACE, as well as the prosecutions that result from it, deters such incidents as massive disruptions and blockades. They said that civil actions brought under FACE can result in civil remedies, including injunctive relief, damages, and penalties. An official in the Special Litigation Section of DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division stated that civil cases often lead to an injunction and offered the opinion that federal court injunctions have been effective in reducing incidents. Civil injunctions can provide relief, such as establishing a \u201cbuffer zone\u201d around a clinic entrance that demonstrators may not enter, or banning excessive noise during a clinic\u2019s hours of operation.", "ATF officials with whom we spoke indicated that FACE has made a difference by making a large dent in \u201cmore minor\u201d incidents, such as blockades. They believe FACE has deterred more minor crimes because it attacks violators in the pocketbook by imposing substantial federal penalties. For example, prior to FACE, it would not have been a federal offense to throw a \u201cstink bomb\u201d or acid into a clinic; FACE made this a federal violation with a potential fine of up to $10,000. ATF officials added, however, that if a clinic incident involves an arson or bombing with no injuries or fatalities, FACE penalties are weak compared to those provided under the federal statute governing arson and explosives. In such cases, prosecutors may choose not to prosecute under FACE.", "Representatives of two of the national abortion rights organizations we contacted viewed FACE as a major factor in deterring anti-abortion violence and saving lives, and a representative of a third abortion rights organization said that FACE had deterred blockades. The head of one group expressed the view that without FACE, violence would have continued to skyrocket. The head of another group stated that the penalties of FACE and the threat that federal law enforcement could show up at any time have deterred blockades. She noted that even though the number of blockades was falling before FACE was passed, it declined even further because of FACE. According to these organizations, blockades that occur now involve fewer people and fewer clinics.", "A representative from one of the two national anti-abortion groups we contacted said that FACE has had a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on the number of people willing to be involved in anti-abortion activities. He added that FACE has \u201craised the pricetag for participation\u201d because many are not willing to risk federal charges and prosecution despite their commitment to the anti-abortion cause. He attributed a decline in his group\u2019s anti-abortion actions to FACE. A representative from the other anti-abortion organization we contacted said that FACE had not affected his group\u2019s activities because the group does not organize protests, nor does it support activities that would violate FACE.

Among the 31 respondents who expressed this view, 11 cited other legal actions, such as local injunctions that were in place prior to the passage of FACE. Ten respondents thought that negative reactions to violence had caused a reduction in clinic incidents. As examples, they said that people with anti-abortion views do not want to be associated with the violent actions of extremists and that press coverage of the more heinous acts decreased public support for the anti-abortion position. Seven respondents credited their local law enforcement agencies with reducing clinic incidents, and four said that other state or federal laws decreased clinic violence.", "Alleged perpetrators of clinic incidents have been prosecuted under federal statutes other than FACE. Although DOJ officials believed FACE had reduced clinic incidents, they found it difficult to isolate the effects of FACE on convictions because FACE has been used in conjunction with other statutes.

On appeal, the defendant challenged the constitutionality of FACE; however, he did not contest his guilt under FACE. The court of appeals affirmed the district court\u2019s opinion. It held that FACE was a legitimate regulation of interstate activity having substantial effect on interstate commerce; that the defendant lacked standing to advance a claim that FACE was unconstitutional because it protected certain relationships, but failed to protect others; and that FACE was neither overbroad nor vague.

The district court held that FACE was not unconstitutional and that it was neither a content-based restriction of speech nor vague or overbroad. Although FACE itself was silent on the issue of whether a jury trial was required, the court determined that the defendants were not entitled to a jury trial because the maximum possible sentence constituted a \u201cpetty offense.\u201d The defendants were convicted of violating FACE.

The court issued a permanent injunction prohibiting the protestor from being within 500 feet of an entrance of any facility in the United States that provides reproductive health services except for the purposes of engaging in legitimate personal activity that could not be remotely construed to violate the statute.", "On appeal, the defendant argued that the \u201cmotive requirement,\u201d which limits application to those who obstruct, threaten, or use force \u201cbecause  is or has been, or in order to intimidate  from, obtaining or providing a reproductive health service,\u201d transformed FACE into a content-based statute, as it punished only abortion-related expressive conduct. The court ruled that this type of restriction was quite common and prevented random crimes committed in the vicinity of abortion clinics from being federalized. The court of appeals held that FACE was within the commerce power of Congress, was not inconsistent with the First Amendment, and not overbroad or vague. In ruling that FACE was not vague, the court articulated definitions for several terms in the statute. It said the following nonexhaustive and nonconclusive factors can be used to determine whether a statement constitutes a threat: the reaction of the recipient and other listeners to the statement; whether the statement was communicated directly to the victim; if similar statements had previously been made to the victim; and whether the victim had a reason to believe the speaker had a propensity to engage in violence. It also upheld the permanent injunction, with some modifications, ruling that portions of the injunction were inconsistent with the First Amendment, such as the prohibition of certain types of nonthreatening speech and other forms of expression.

The court of appeals held that (1) the provisions of a preliminary injunction enjoining the defendants from congregating, picketing, praying, loitering, patrolling, demonstrating, or communicating with others orally, by signs, or otherwise, within 25 feet of the clinic did not seem unreasonable and does not burden speech more than necessary to preserve the patients\u2019, doctors\u2019, and staff\u2019s right to enter the clinic; (2) a provision of a preliminary injunction enjoining the defendants from approaching, congregating, picketing, patrolling, demonstrating, or using bullhorns or other sound amplification equipment within 200 feet of the residences of the clinic\u2019s staff operated as a generalized restriction on protesting and thus was unconstitutional under the First Amendment; (3) a provision enjoining the defendants from blocking or attempting to block, barricade, or obstruct the entrances, exits, or driveways of the residences of the clinic staff; and inhibiting or impeding or attempting to impede the free ingress and egress of persons to any street providing the sole access to the residences of clinic staff did not burden speech more than was necessary to serve the state\u2019s significant interest in promoting the free flow of traffic on public streets; and (4) a provision enjoining the defendants from knowingly being within 20 feet of any person seeking to obtain or provide clinic services was unconstitutional because it burdened speech more than was necessary to serve the significant government interests. On the basis of these rulings, the case was remanded so that the district court would revise the preliminary injunction. 4. Milwaukee Women\u2019s Medical Center, Inc., and United States v. Brock et al., 1998 WL 228158 (E.D. Wis. April 30, 1998).", "This civil lawsuit arose out of the Milwaukee Clinic blockade for which the defendants were criminally prosecuted in United States v. Brock, 863 F. Supp. 851 (E.D. Wis. 1994), mandamus denied sub nom., Hatch v. Stadtmuller, 41 F.3d 1510 (7th Cir. 1994) (unpublished order), aff\u2019d sub nom., United States v. Soderna, 82 F.3d 1370 (7th Cir. 1996) cert. denied sub nom., Hatch v. United States, 117 S. Ct. 507 (1996). This was DOJ\u2019s only FACE lawsuit prosecuted both criminally and civilly.", "The clinic filed a civil action against the defendants seeking (1) a declaration that the defendants violated FACE, (2) injunctive relief, and (3) statutory damages. The parties agreed to stay the matter pending resolution of the criminal proceedings. On December 20, 1994, approximately 1 month after the criminal convictions were obtained, DOJ intervened in the civil FACE lawsuit. The suit sought a declaratory judgment, a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from blocking access to the clinic, and $5,000 in statutory damages against each defendant as well as separate awards for punitive damages. The presiding district court judge stayed this case for almost a year pending the outcome of appellate and Supreme Court review of his decision in United States v. Wilson, 880 F. Supp. 621 (E.D. Wis. 1995), a criminal FACE prosecution in which he had declared the statute unconstitutional. The Seventh Circuit ultimately reversed the district court\u2019s decision, and the Supreme Court denied a petition to review the court of appeals\u2019 decision. United States v. Wilson, 73 F.3d 675 (7th Cir. 1995); cert. denied Wilson v. United States, 47 S. Ct. 117 (1996).", "The court (1) granted summary judgment and issued a declaratory judgment in the clinic\u2019s and the government\u2019s favor against six of eight defendants stating that the defendants violated FACE; (2) awarded compensatory damages in the total amount of $5,000, for which the defendants were each jointly and severally liable; and (3) issued a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from rendering impassable the entry to and exit from the clinic or rendering passage to or from the clinic unreasonably difficult or hazardous. The court rejected the claim for punitive damages, holding that the peaceful obstruction of entrances did not warrant the imposition of punitive damages. At the time of our review, the case remained pending against the other two defendants. 5. Planned Parenthood of the Columbia/Wilmette, Inc. et al. v. American Coalition of Life Activists, et al., 945 F. Supp. 1355 (D. Oregon 1996).", "The plaintiffs filed suit against the defendants alleging violations of FACE and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act and a similar provision of Oregon law, the Oregon Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (ORICO). The individual plaintiffs were doctors who performed abortions; the two corporate plaintiffs operated clinics and provided health services, including abortions. The defendants included associations that oppose abortions and individuals from the associations. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants conspired to violate FACE by intending to injure, threaten, and intimidate the plaintiffs through the dissemination of posters that accused individual abortion providers of murder and provided their descriptions, addresses, and phone numbers. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants violated FACE by threatening, injuring, and intimidating them because they provided reproductive health services. The district court held that (1) the defendants were subject to personal jurisdiction in Oregon, (2) FACE was within Congress\u2019 power under the Commerce Clause, (3) FACE did not violate the First Amendment, and (4) the plaintiffs adequately stated RICO and ORICO claims against all but one of the defendants. 6. Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Walton, 949 F. Supp. 290 (E.D. Pa. 1996), 1997 WL 734012 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 14, 1997), 1998 WL 88373 (E.D. Pa. Feb. 12, 1998).", "The plaintiff, a reproductive counseling association, brought action under FACE against a number of anti-abortion activists for obstructing access to the plaintiff\u2019s Philadelphia, PA, clinic. The district court held FACE to be constitutional. It concluded that (1) FACE did not violate the First Amendment, (2) Eighth Amendment Cruel and Unusual Punishment claims were not ripe, and (3) enactment of FACE was within Congress\u2019 authority under the Fourteenth Amendment and the Commerce Clause. In a subsequent action, the defendants challenged the plaintiff\u2019s ability to bring suit under FACE, claiming that they lacked standing. The district court held that under the plain language of FACE, the plaintiff corporation qualified as a \u201cperson involved in providing or seeking to provide . . . services\u201d within the meaning of the statute and thus had standing to bring an action under FACE. On February 12, 1998, the court granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment, granted a permanent injunction, and awarded statutory damages. 7. Riely v. Reno, 860 F. Supp. 693 (D. Ariz. 1994).", "The plaintiffs filed suit to challenge the constitutionality of FACE. The defendants moved for dismissal on the grounds that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were not ripe for review and on the alternative grounds that their complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The district court found that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The court found (1) that Congress acted within its authority under the Commerce Clause when it enacted FACE, (2) that FACE did not impermissibly regulate protected expression or burden religion, (3) the plaintiffs failed to show that FACE was vague or overbroad, (4) the punishments imposed and statutory damages allowed by FACE did not violate the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment and excessive fines, and (5) finally, having found that FACE did not violate the First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, or Tenth Amendments, that the enforcement of FACE by state officials did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. 8. United States v. Lindgren, et al., 883 F. Supp. 1321 (D. N.D. 1995).", "The Attorney General brought a civil action against abortion protestors alleging that the defendants violated FACE during their anti-abortion efforts relating to a clinic in Fargo, ND. The district court found that the protestors blockaded the clinic using an immobilized car with people attached to it and made verbal threats to clinic staff members on several occasions. The court issued a preliminary injunction in light of the substantial probability of success on claims of FACE violations. The injunction prohibited, among other things, one defendant from coming within 100 feet of the clinic, its staff, and their homes, and the other defendants from blocking the clinic or entering onto the clinic\u2019s property. The preliminary injunction was made permanent by agreement of the parties. 9. United States v. Lynch and Moscinski, No. 95 Civ. 9223 (S.D. N.Y.

N.Y. 1996) (dismissing criminal contempt charges).", "The Attorney General filed a lawsuit alleging that the defendants violated FACE by blocking access to an abortion clinic in Dobbs Ferry, NY. The court issued a permanent injunction prohibiting the defendants and anyone acting in concert with them from impeding or obstructing access to the clinic. The defendants contended on appeal that the district court should have accepted a defense to the injunction based upon \u201cnatural law.\u201d Specifically, the defendants argued that the FACE statute protected the taking of innocent human life and was therefore contrary to natural law. The court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the district court, declining to invalidate FACE on the basis of natural law principles. The Supreme Court denied a petition to review the court of appeals\u2019 decision.", "DOJ subsequently secured a civil contempt finding and sought a criminal contempt finding, which was rejected by the district court. DOJ appealed the district court\u2019s decision on the criminal contempt motion. That appeal was pending before the Second Circuit. 10. United States v. McMillan, 946 F. Supp. 1254 (S.D. Miss. 1995).", "The Attorney General filed a civil action against the defendant, the founder and executive director of Christian Action Group, an anti-abortion organization, alleging three instances of threats and obstruction. The court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the lawsuit on the grounds that FACE was constitutionally infirm. It found that Congress validly enacted FACE pursuant to its powers under the Commerce Clause and Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court found that the defendant endorsed the use of force and violence as a means to protest against abortion. The court further found that the plaintiff had a substantial likelihood of showing that the defendant has committed three violations of FACE. The court granted a preliminary injunction prohibiting the defendant from, among other things, being within 25 feet of the Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization. The parties agreed to a permanent injunction incorporating the terms of the preliminary injunction and adding a 15-foot buffer zone at a second clinic. The Attorney General moved for civil contempt for a violation of the injunction at a second clinic. No decision had yet been issued on this matter. 11. United States v. Roach, et al., 947 F. Supp. 872 (E.D. Pa. 1996).", "The Attorney General filed a civil action against 35 defendants, alleging that they blocked clinic entrances at the Reproductive Health and Counseling Center in Upland, PA, in violation of FACE. The district court held that Congress enacted FACE pursuant to its authority under the Commerce Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment and that the statute did not chill First Amendment freedom of speech or religion as it was enacted by Congress or as applied in this case. The court granted a preliminary injunction prohibiting the defendants and anyone acting in concert with them from, among other things, entering or remaining on the private property of the clinic. On May 5, 1998, the court granted the motion for summary judgment and granted a permanent injunction. 12. United States v. Scott, 919 F. Supp. 76 (D. Conn. 1996), 958 F. Supp. 761 (D. Conn. 1997), 975 F. Supp. 428 (D. Conn. 1997).", "The Attorney General and the State of Connecticut filed a civil action alleging that the defendants repeatedly used force, threats of force, and physical obstruction against the staff, escorts, clients, and companions of clients at a reproductive health facility located in Bridgeport, CT. The defendants moved to dismiss on grounds that FACE was unconstitutional. The district court held that FACE was a constitutional exercise of Congress\u2019 authority under the Commerce Clause. The court subsequently ruled that FACE was constitutional under the First Amendment; that the United States and Connecticut did not violate the dual sovereignty doctrine by jointly filing action; that FACE was not overbroad or vague; that injunctive relief was constitutional; and that one of the defendants, Stanley G. Scott, had violated FACE. The court issued a permanent injunction prohibiting Scott from, among other things, approaching within 15 feet of the clinic\u2019s front entrance, coming within 5 feet of any person providing or receiving reproductive health services who indicated that he/she wished to be left alone, or coming within 5 feet of any vehicle containing such a person. The United States obtained one finding of civil contempt against Scott for which he was assessed $200. In subsequent rulings, the court ordered a modification of the injunction to expand the buffer zone around the clinic entrance in light of Scott\u2019s repeated violations of the injunction and issued a finding of contempt against Scott, assessing him a fine of $300. 13. United States v. White, et al., 893 F. Supp. 1423 (C.D. Cal. 1995).", "The Attorney General filed a motion for a preliminary injunction pursuant to FACE.

The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on constitutional grounds. The court held that Congress had the authority under the Commerce Clause to enact FACE, that the Fourteenth Amendment did not preclude Congress from legislating in the area of clinic violence, and that FACE did not violate the defendants\u2019 First Amendment rights. The court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction. The preliminary injunction, which became permanent by agreement of the parties, prohibited the defendants from, among other things, demonstrating, congregating, or picketing within 45 feet of the intersection near the doctor\u2019s home; coming closer than 15 feet of the doctor or his wife; or driving within 3 car lengths of their cars."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Unreported or Pending Civil Lawsuits Initiated by the Department of Justice", "paragraphs": ["We prepared the following summaries for United States v.
