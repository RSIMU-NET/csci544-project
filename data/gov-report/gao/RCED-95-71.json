Revenue losses on passenger services mounted, and in 1970, the final year in which these services were operated by private railroads, over $1.7 billion (in 1994 dollars) was lost on these services. Railroads had stopped investing in new passenger cars and facilities, and service declined, leading to the near demise of passenger rail service. To revitalize intercity passenger rail service, in 1970 the Congress created the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, commonly called Amtrak.

After World War II, however, ridership declined dramatically, and by 1970 only about 300 intercity passenger trains were operated daily, providing only about 0.5 percent of intercity travel. In response to declining revenues, most railroads did not invest in new passenger equipment and allowed the service to deteriorate. Trains frequently failed to run on time, speeds were slow because of poor track and roadbeds, and equipment was old and prone to breakdowns. Intercity train travel was rapidly becoming extinct in the United States.", "The nation\u2019s railroads, which focused primarily on freight service, had to obtain permission from federal or state regulators to abandon unprofitable passenger train services. Before passage of the Transportation Act of 1958, state regulatory commissions had the authority to discontinue passenger trains. Some state agencies allowed the railroads to discontinue unprofitable passenger operations, and between 1920 and 1958, service was discontinued for more than one-half of the railroads\u2019 passenger miles.Because of the large decline in the number of trains, state commissions became more reluctant to allow the railroads to discontinue more services. The 1958 act transferred effective control over decisions to discontinue passenger services to the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). The ICC was concerned that continuing losses from passenger train operations could threaten the financial health of the entire railroad industry. It therefore allowed railroads to eliminate passenger operations that generated serious deficits."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Congress Creates Amtrak", "paragraphs": ["a for-profit corporation to provide intercity and commuter rail passenger service, employing innovative operating and marketing concepts so as to fully develop the potential of modern rail service in meeting the Nation\u2019s intercity and commuter passenger transportation requirements.

Amtrak\u2019s actions to reduce operating expenses have not been sufficient to offset the shortfall in revenues. To cover the gap between the operating deficits and federal operating subsidy, Amtrak has drawn down its cash resources.

Nevertheless, while its financial condition was deteriorating, Amtrak reported that its revenue-to-expense ratio was improving.

For its 1993 grant request, for example, Amtrak estimated $1.092 billion in passenger revenues\u2014overestimating actual passenger revenues by $149 million. For 1990-94, Amtrak estimated that yield would increase with inflation. In fact, yield declined after adjusting for inflation. Management also contributed to overestimates of revenues by adjusting upward the results of a ridership forecasting model because of a belief that the nation\u2019s general economic improvement would lead to increased ridership. Finally, in adjusting the model results, Amtrak did not consider the extent to which events\u2014such as floods and accidents\u2014might occur in the upcoming year, depressing revenues. In fact, during 1993 and 1994, Amtrak was involved in several major accidents and sometimes had to cancel trains because of severe weather, which caused revenues to decline.

For example, in September 1993 the Sunset Limited derailed in Saraland, Alabama, and Amtrak incurred (1) additional costs to repair equipment and pay liability judgments and (2) a shortfall in revenues as a result of equipment shortages. In addition, whenever service is disrupted because of weather or accidents, Amtrak pays the costs its passengers incur to get to their destinations by another mode of transportation.

According to Amtrak, these cutbacks were expected to save about $77 million in fiscal years 1991-93. In 1993, Amtrak took steps to conserve cash by reducing inventory, requiring advance payment for work that Amtrak performed for others, and delaying payments made to others by 15 days.

As a result, about 20 percent of Amtrak\u2019s nationwide service (in train miles) is to be eliminated. Amtrak plans to negotiate with the affected states and could retain service where the states are willing to subsidize the losses on the routes. These reductions should allow Amtrak to eliminate about 5,000 jobs and remove most of its oldest cars from service.

Heritage cars that fail are out of service awaiting parts about three times longer on average than newer cars. Needed parts for Heritage cars must often be manufactured because they can no longer be purchased off the shelf. Moreover, because there are 27 different Heritage models, Amtrak cannot produce replacement parts in economical quantities. As a result, the cost per seat to perform a limited \u201cintermediate\u201d overhaul on a Heritage car can be 25 to 50 percent higher than the cost to undertake a complete heavy overhaul on a Superliner.

Now, however, Amtrak expects to retire all but a few \u201cspecialty\u201d Heritage cars (diners, cab cars) as it reduces service frequencies and eliminates routes in fiscal year 1995.

These overhauls can cost about $300,000 for each car. In comparison, a new car costs about $2 million. However, to cope with its deteriorating financial condition, Amtrak began deferring maintenance in the late 1980s. Amtrak also began using capital funds in 1992 to overhaul many older cars (Heritage and Amfleet I models) and locomotives. Even with the infusion of capital funds to overhaul these cars, overhauls were past due for nearly 40 percent of the fleet by September 1993. (See fig. 3.3.)", "As the backlog grew, Amtrak officials recognized that the railroad\u2019s preventive maintenance/overhaul program was not adequate. Cars looked shabby and were breaking down with increasing regularity. When the fiscal year 1994 budget provided no increase in funding, the Mechanical Department began to implement a new \u201cprogressive maintenance\u201d program in October 1993. Under this program, Amtrak performs heavy maintenance when a car breaks down and also a limited overhaul each year on every car. Every third year, the annual overhaul will be more comprehensive but still less extensive than the heavy overhaul performed before. Only Amtrak\u2019s newer passenger cars will be maintained under this program. The remaining Heritage cars and Turboliner coaches will continue to receive preventive maintenance and/or limited overhauls as before. The progressive program is intended to keep more cars in service\u2014thereby generating more revenues\u2014but is not expected to reduce overall maintenance costs. By the end of fiscal year 1994, all Amfleet, Horizon, Superliner, and Viewliner cars were eligible for inclusion in the progressive program. However, Amtrak is already falling short of reaching its goals under this program. While 1994 was a transition year, fewer cars than required received annual overhauls because of budget reductions. Also, maintenance officials have found that the program is not appropriate for all these cars. For example, increased customer complaints about the condition of Amfleet cars in the Northeast Corridor have prompted Amtrak to return these cars to a scheduled maintenance program in fiscal year 1995, although they will continue to receive overhauls under the progressive program. Furthermore, the progressive program was intended to use only operating funds, but Amtrak has already found it necessary to allocate 1995 capital funds for the heavier 3-year overhauls of the Amfleet I cars."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Program Brings Higher Workload at Some Facilities and Higher Overall Costs", "paragraphs": ["As Amtrak implements the progressive program, two of its three overhaul facilities\u2014located at Bear, Delaware, and Beech Grove, Indiana\u2014will need to handle significantly more cars than they did under the previous heavy overhaul program.

However, the current budget for Beech Grove will fund only about 63 percent of these overhauls. Furthermore, Amtrak\u2019s new Superliners and Viewliners will add to Beech Grove\u2019s workload as they become eligible for annual overhauls starting in 1996 and 1997, respectively.

Beech Grove is responsible for overhauls of and repairs to 61 percent of Amtrak\u2019s total fleet. The facility is nearly 100 years old and is in very poor condition. Much of the on-site track was installed in the early 1900s and has deteriorated, resulting in frequent derailments. The facility was not designed for production-line overhauls of cars. The buildings are run-down, and some cannot accommodate the work for which they are used. For example, Amtrak\u2019s newest diesel locomotives are too large to fit inside the locomotive shop building, and the shop\u2019s cranes are not large enough to lift the locomotives so that wheel sets can be removed.", "In 1990, Amtrak initiated a five-phase modernization plan to correct some of Beech Grove\u2019s problems. By September 1993, about $12 million of the total cost of $47 million had been spent on such projects as combining the truck and forge shops, improving a coach production line, constructing employee welfare facilities (lunchrooms, rest rooms, and locker rooms), replacing roofs, and replacing or rehabilitating overhead cranes. In August 1994, Amtrak committed an additional $1.9 million to repair Beech Grove\u2019s transfer table and repair or replace some of the track most critical to the facility\u2019s operation. These projects will help Beech Grove perform its required overhauls and reduce derailments at the facility.

The single service building for performing minor maintenance (called \u201crunning repairs\u201d) can accommodate only 8 cars at a time and is thus barely adequate for the 12 to 15 cars needing repair each day. The only locomotive repair building at Sunnyside was recently condemned because of chemical contamination; it will cost $550,000 to remove this building and the related contamination. In addition, because Sunnyside lacked auxiliary power hook-ups to allow car heaters to operate while the cars were being serviced in the yard, the plumbing systems on over 50 cars froze and broke during the winter of 1993-94. Repairs to these cars cost about $1.8 million.

Between 1991 and 1993, Amtrak purchased 245 Superliner and Viewliner cars and 72 locomotives for $743 million and $181 million, respectively. These cars should be cheaper to maintain than the Heritage cars they will replace because they have standardized parts and modular components to allow for easier repair. Amtrak estimates that it will save $341 annually in maintenance costs for every seat in a Heritage car replaced by a seat in a Superliner. Also, most of the cars are designed with many more seats per car than the cars they are replacing, potentially adding passenger revenues without adding more cars to the train. Amtrak believes that passengers will be more likely to travel by rail if they can ride in newer, more modern Amtrak cars. The new locomotives will provide greater power, will increase fuel efficiency, and should contribute to better on-time performance.", "However, in addition to the new equipment that is now being delivered, Amtrak has estimated it will need over 700 more new cars and locomotives in the future. Its current long-term equipment acquisition plan, approved in November 1992, includes estimates for replacing all remaining Heritage cars with Viewliners and replacing some of the nonpassenger cars and locomotives that are in poor condition or are nearing the end of their useful lives. Amtrak estimates that it will need to purchase 299 locomotives and 416 cars at a cost of about $1.5 billion from 1994 to 2002. While these needs will be reassessed following the service reductions in 1995, Amtrak officials believe that a large portion of the locomotive fleet will still need to be replaced within the next 5 years.", "According to Amtrak\u2019s President, it is very difficult to commit to long-term capital projects because of uncertainty about future funding. As a result, Amtrak tends to focus on short-term operations and is less able to invest in projects that would create long-term operating efficiencies. Capital grants are appropriated annually and often fluctuate from year to year. (See fig. 3.7.) As stated above, a significant amount of money is needed just to repay debt and pay for capital overhauls and equipment modifications.

Amtrak estimated that wages increased between $120 and $140 million from 1991 to 1995 as a result of the last round of collective bargaining. Similar increases may result from the upcoming negotiations. For example, if wages and benefits increase by 4 percent per year to keep pace with inflation, Amtrak\u2019s costs could increase by about $40 million per year, or about $200 million (in current-year dollars) over a 5-year period. The current contracts provide for most union employees to receive annual wage increases of about 4 percent between 1991 and 1995.", "Amtrak has reduced labor costs and increased productivity when possible. Its employees receive less compensation on average than freight railroad employees performing comparable jobs. For example, in 1992 Amtrak compensated train and engine crews about $42,900 per employee, while other Class I freight railroads compensated similar employees about $54,800 per employee. Also, since 1983 Amtrak has increased productivity by (1) adopting an 8-hour basis of pay for train and engine crews (before this change, crews earned a full day\u2019s pay on the basis of the number of miles traveled), (2) eliminating the requirement for a fireman on trips of less than 4 hours, and (3) establishing a 5-year graduated entry wage for certain newly hired employees. Amtrak estimates that these changes have saved about $50 million per year.", "Amtrak\u2019s costs in 1994 for salaries, wages, and benefits accounted for about 52 percent ($1.3 billion) of the railroad\u2019s total operating expenses. Federal laws unique to the rail industry keep Amtrak\u2019s labor costs higher than they would be otherwise. For example, in 1992 Amtrak paid about 26 percent of its payroll in retirement taxes to meet requirements of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937; this percentage is similar to the rate paid by other railroads. In comparison, other industries paid only about 6 percent of their payroll in retirement costs and retirement-related savings plans. Also, in 1992 Amtrak paid about $0.67 per employee-hour worked for accident and injury claims under the Federal Employers Liability Act. This amount compares with about $0.36 per hour worked paid by private industry under state workers compensation systems.", "Labor costs could also increase if Amtrak eliminates entire routes or reduces service below three round-trips per week. Amtrak and freight railroad employees are covered by the Rail Passenger Service Act, which requires adoption of a labor protection agreement for employees affected when intercity rail passenger service is discontinued. Under the agreement, known as Appendix C-2 and adopted in 1973, employees who are dismissed may be eligible for payment of their average monthly compensation for up to 6 years or, at their option, may receive a separation allowance of up to 12 months\u2019 pay. According to Amtrak, if the entire route system were shut down, the railroad would incur labor protection expenses of between $2.1 billion and $5.2 billion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Operating Agreements With Freight Railroads Could Increase Costs", "paragraphs": ["Freight railroads own about 97 percent of the track over which Amtrak operates and provide such essential services as dispatching trains, making emergency repairs to Amtrak trains, and maintaining stations. These services are provided under operating agreements that Amtrak maintains with 18 railroads. On April 30, 1996, most of Amtrak\u2019s initial 25-year operating agreements with freight railroads will expire, and new agreements must be negotiated. On the basis of our discussions with freight railroad officials, it is likely that Amtrak\u2019s costs under the new agreements will increase substantially. Amtrak currently pays about $90 million per year in both base payments and incentive payments to freight railroads. (Incentive payments are additional amounts that railroads can earn when Amtrak trains operate on time.) (See fig. 3.8.)", "Freight railroad officials told us that compensation will be a key issue in negotiations with Amtrak. They believe that their companies are not adequately compensated for the services they currently provide to Amtrak. They offered several reasons. First, the methodology used to determine reimbursements for the incremental costs of maintaining track\u2014that is, the extra costs of wear and tear on the track\u2014does not adequately measure the costs resulting from Amtrak\u2019s use of the track. Of the $90 million that Amtrak pays annually to freight railroads, about $20 million is for the incremental cost of maintaining the track, and Amtrak estimates that its costs for track maintenance could double if another methodology is used. Second, incentive payments do not consider delays caused by Amtrak\u2019s trains\u2014when an Amtrak locomotive fails, for example\u2014in calculating on-time performance. Rather, these delays are held against the freight railroads and consequently limit the amount of incentives that they earn.", "Freight railroads may also seek higher compensation for \u201clevel-of-utility\u201d requirements that expire with the operating agreements. Amtrak trains generally travel at higher speeds than freight trains. As a result, the track must be maintained to higher safety standards. This increased standard is referred to as a higher level of utility. In addition, according to freight railroad officials, Amtrak does not fully reimburse railroads for clearing freight traffic and interrupting maintenance-of-way work to allow Amtrak\u2019s trains to proceed on time.", "Freight railroad officials also said that liability arrangements would be a key issue in negotiations. They are concerned about their liability in settling high-cost claims that result from passenger-train accidents occurring on their track. This concern arose after a Conrail train collided with an Amtrak train near Chase, Maryland, in January 1987; 16 people died and more than 350 people filed injury claims. In this case, Conrail paid about $94 million in personal injury and death claims. Freight railroad officials fear that similar situations could develop on their property. Under current operating agreements, Amtrak and the freight railroads use a \u201cno-fault\u201d liability arrangement, in which each party is responsible for paying for its own equipment and personnel. In addition, Amtrak pays freight railroads between $0.0367 and $0.0734 per train mile for the liability coverage that they must maintain in connection with providing Amtrak service. In fiscal year 1993, Amtrak paid about $2.8 million for purchased insurance. Freight railroad officials told us that they would like to see this arrangement changed. They suggested that either Amtrak assume full responsibility for accidents in which it is involved, regardless of who is at fault, and/or liability claims be capped and handled through a pooled insurance fund. In either case, Amtrak\u2019s costs for liability protection could increase substantially."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Costs May Increase for Employee Benefits and Environmental Cleanup", "paragraphs": ["Although health care and postretirement benefits are currently a small part of Amtrak\u2019s budget, they could become more significant in the near future. In January 1995, the health care premiums that Amtrak pays for its union employees are projected to increase by about $61 per employee per month. Amtrak estimates that this increase could boost operating expenses by about $25 million per year. In addition, Amtrak provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to salaried employees. For fiscal years 1992 and 1993, Amtrak paid postretirement benefits of $1.4 and $1.5 million, respectively. Amtrak estimates that cash outlays for these benefits will grow from $3 million in fiscal year 1994 to around $20 million by the year 2010.", "Amtrak can also expect higher costs associated with environmental cleanup. Amtrak\u2019s current expenditures for environmental cleanup projects have ranged between $2 million and $8 million per year. However, according to Amtrak, this amount represents only a fraction of its known environmental problems. For example, Amtrak may have to spend between $17 and $69 million to bring the 69 fueling sites along its routes into compliance with the Clean Water Act, according to Amtrak officials. Amtrak also estimated that an additional $1 million per year over a 5-year period will be needed to eliminate asbestos at its stations and facilities. Other environmental projects are likely to increase costs further. Amtrak\u2019s policy is to limit spending for environmental cleanup to high-priority projects that pose immediate dangers to the environment.

Its past efforts to reduce costs, while necessary, have resulted in deterioration of equipment and some facilities.", "The need for improvements is becoming critical, and these improvements will not come cheaply. The new progressive maintenance/overhaul program, designed to keep more cars in service at a lower unit cost, will still cost over $30 million more to implement in fiscal year 1995 than was spent in 1994 and will eventually cost nearly $60 million more as new equipment enters the program. However, without this commitment, Amtrak risks growing backlogs of equipment in need of overhaul, depleting the number of cars available for service. The new cars and locomotives currently being delivered should ease the pressures, in both the short and long term, as older cars that are costly to maintain are replaced and more revenues per car are generated. By the turn of the century, however, this equipment will need to be overhauled each year, increasing the burden on Amtrak\u2019s aging overhaul facilities.", "We believe that capital investment is important and will lower operating expenses in the long term by increasing productivity and improving efficiency. The Beech Grove overhaul facility could be made much more economical by replacing, repairing, and modernizing the track and structures that now impede efficient work there. Such investments could enable Amtrak to increase efficiencies and provide comfortable, modern, on-time service to its passengers.

Still, because most Amtrak passengers travel only on a portion of a route, Amtrak cannot reserve all the seats for long-distance travelers and must optimally manage its seat inventory. Moreover, because of the number of stops a train makes and the number of passengers boarding and deboarding at each stop, programming a yield management system for passenger trains is much more complicated than computerizing a system for airlines. As of July 1994, 100 long-distance trains were included in the computerized system, and Amtrak plans eventually to have 220 of its reserved-seat trains in the system.

Elsewhere, Amtrak considers track maintenance costs as avoidable costs because they represent a contractual obligation between Amtrak and the freight railroads that own the track. Furthermore, the Northeast Corridor includes both conventional trains and high-speed Metroliner trains.

The requirement to pay up to 6 years\u2019 wages to employees who lose their position if a route is eliminated was a major factor in determining the cost under the alternative scenarios."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Privatization of Amtrak Is an Unlikely Option Under Present Circumstances", "paragraphs": ["If the Congress chooses to eliminate or greatly reduce federal subsidies for Amtrak, it could privatize the operation and make it subject to market forces. Amtrak\u2019s route network would be reconfigured so that only those parts of the system that had the potential to cover their costs would continue to operate. While some rail passenger services conceivably could be taken over by the private sector, significant federal investment would be needed before any part of the current system could be privatized, and nationwide service as it exists today could not be offered.", "Privatizing Amtrak might be complicated by a number of factors. First, it is not clear what would be privatized. Amtrak owns very little track outside the Northeast Corridor. Also, most of the stations Amtrak serves are owned either by other railroads or by local governments. Even many of Amtrak\u2019s passenger cars and locomotives are leased. Second, the term \u201cprivatize\u201d is sometimes used to mean \u201cdefederalize\u201d; that is, to shift the responsibility for subsidizing intercity train operations to state and local governments. Passenger train services might be inherently unprofitable. Therefore, private, for-profit firms are unlikely to be interested in such business without some government assistance. The private railroads in this country were unable to operate passenger service profitably, and throughout the world, intercity passenger trains are heavily subsidized. If the public benefits of intercity passenger train services are largely local or regional, these services might more appropriately be offered or supported by state or local governments. Third, even in the Northeast Corridor, where Amtrak controls significant assets, different degrees of privatization are possible. For example, programs to privatize freight rail service in the Netherlands envision privatizing the operations but not the infrastructure. The government will continue to provide capital to maintain and develop the track and other facilities.", "In addition, privatizing those parts of Amtrak that could potentially be profitable might still require substantial initial investment to create a saleable asset, similar to what occurred with Conrail. In that instance, many unprofitable routes were abandoned and, after substantial federal investment, a profitable core business was established. However, the analogy with Conrail may be limited because, on the basis of experience in the United States and throughout the world, we have found no evidence that intercity passenger rail operations can cover all costs and generate a return on investment. Therefore, even if privatized, Amtrak will continue to need federal or state funds to meet its capital needs. Even the Northeast Corridor would be difficult to sell to a private firm until the upgrade between New York and Boston is complete and significant repairs have been made to the segment between New York and Washington, D.C.", "Finally, privatizing Amtrak is not likely to result in successfully preserving a nationwide passenger rail system. Under this option, passenger rail service could be reduced to a few regional corridors because only a few well-traveled routes could ever generate sufficient revenues to cover the substantial operating costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Amtrak and the federal government face a difficult set of choices. We believe that continuing the present course\u2014the same funding level and basic route system, even with the proposed service cuts\u2014is neither feasible nor realistic because Amtrak will continue to deteriorate. The Congress is confronted with numerous budget decisions that make substantial increases in Amtrak\u2019s subsidy unlikely. If increases are not forthcoming from federal and state sources of funds, Amtrak\u2019s viability may depend on restructuring operations to reduce the route network. Even so, Amtrak will continue to require government subsidies, especially to meet its capital needs. Amtrak and the federal, state, and local governments need to make important decisions about the quality and extent of intercity passenger rail service to be provided and the long-term funding of such an operation. First, the Congress needs to decide on the nation\u2019s expectations for intercity passenger rail service and the scope of Amtrak\u2019s mission to provide that service. These decisions require defining a national route network, along with determining the extent to which the federal government would fund operating losses and capital investments and the way any remaining deficits will be covered. We believe that Amtrak or a temporary commission could provide the Congress with specific options that would define a national route network consistent with the available funding. Finally, once the Congress decides on a national route network, Amtrak could develop and provide to the Congress a long-term financing and operating plan (5 to 10 years). This plan should provide realistic expectations for repairing and maintaining Amtrak\u2019s fleet, replacing aging infrastructure, and meeting increases in expenses that can be reasonably anticipated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation to the Congress", "paragraphs": ["In light of Amtrak\u2019s financial and operating problems, we recommend that the Congress consider whether Amtrak\u2019s original mission of providing nationwide intercity passenger rail service at the present level is still appropriate. If the Congress decides to reassess the scope of Amtrak\u2019s mission, it could direct Amtrak or a temporary commission, similar to the one established to close military bases, to make recommendations and offer options defining and realigning Amtrak\u2019s basic route network so that efficient and quality service could be provided within the funding available from all sources. The Congress could then make the final decision on Amtrak\u2019s future route network."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations to the President of Amtrak", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that Amtrak accurately communicates its operating and financial conditions and its need for federal funds to the Congress, we recommend that the President of Amtrak \u2022 provide detailed information in federal grant requests on how revenues from intercity passenger service have been estimated; incorporate into federal grant requests dollar estimates of the costs of future accident and weather-related contingencies; \u2022 develop and present to the Congress a plan outlining the costs and benefits of participating in high-speed rail service outside the Northeast Corridor, including the impact on Amtrak\u2019s annual grant request; \u2022 undertake a comprehensive review and/or audit of the costs associated with its commuter rail and other ancillary activities, identifying the costs associated with these activities, the way these costs are allocated to individual commuter rail contracts, and the overall profit or loss of each activity as well as assessing the appropriateness of any formulas used to allocate costs; and \u2022 provide the Congress with proposed legislative changes that could improve Amtrak\u2019s long-term viability, along with estimates of the expected effect of each proposal on Amtrak\u2019s finances and a discussion of the other parties that will likely be affected and to what extent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["Amtrak said that our draft report accurately presented the railroad\u2019s financial and operating status and correctly portrayed the corporation\u2019s capital investment problems. However, Amtrak had four principal points.", "First, Amtrak stated that the draft report understated the impact of actions adopted by its Board of Directors in December 1994 and said the board had, in effect, implemented our recommendation to redefine and reduce the route system consistent with the funding available. We revised our report to specifically highlight Amtrak\u2019s proposed operating changes, including plans to reduce staffing, reduce the frequency of service on some routes, and eliminate service on others. In addition, Amtrak acknowledges that even with the planned service reductions, its operating deficits will exceed operating subsidies by $1.3 billion through the end of the century. While we believe that the new business plan is an important first step, it does not implement our recommendation, nor does it resolve Amtrak\u2019s financial, capital, and service quality problems.", "Unless sufficient funds are available to support Amtrak\u2019s current operations and provide the necessary capital, we recommend that the Congress reassess Amtrak\u2019s scope of operation and mission and direct either Amtrak or a temporary commission to provide the Congress with options for a route network that is consistent with the level of funding available. Not only do the service reductions announced in the board\u2019s plan still leave a large gap between the deficit and the subsidies from the federal and state governments after 1996, but about a quarter of the planned savings will require negotiations with organized labor and/or legislative changes. Also, Amtrak\u2019s plan does not resolve how the corporation will meet its capital needs, now totaling about $2.5 billion in the Northeast Corridor alone. Although the board set a goal that could ultimately eliminate the federal operating grant by 2002, this was made contingent on Amtrak\u2019s receiving (1) \u201csufficient capital funding to achieve a good-state-of-repair,\u201d (2) the current level of operating grants until 2002, and (3) increased funding from the states to cover operating deficits for service they receive. These are significant assumptions about funding that will require congressional endorsement as part of the process of defining options for Amtrak\u2019s future route network.", "Second, Amtrak expressed concern about the timing of our recommendation for a commission because the board\u2019s recent analysis showed that reducing service frequency was more economical than closing routes and because Amtrak is a commercially driven corporation, which should not act like the Department of Defense in making decisions about closures. Amtrak also states that little more can be done beyond the board\u2019s recommendation, short of closing down the national system. Amtrak\u2019s point on timing is well taken if the railroad\u2019s requirements for capital and operating funds for the national system, as presently constituted, are met. If they are not, cutbacks in service frequency and routes beyond those announced by the board will be required. In addition, much of the expected savings comes from reductions in frequency on long-distance routes. Amtrak believes that revenue losses will be minimal because most long-distance train riders are discretionary travelers who are not time-sensitive and, therefore, will adjust their travel plans to accommodate Amtrak\u2019s reduced service level. Unfortunately, Amtrak lacks experience on the effect on ridership of reducing the frequency of long-distance service. Amtrak\u2019s estimates of significant net savings assume that ridership and revenue losses will be minimal. This is an important assumption. With respect to Amtrak\u2019s view that the economics of intercity rail passenger service preclude cutbacks beyond those already planned unless the goal of providing a national system is abandoned, we believe that Amtrak must first define what it means by a national system. If it means a cross-country network of interconnected routes, then it may not be possible to support such a system with the available funds. However, there may be numerous routes, either densely traveled corridors or segments of existing long-distance routes, on which service could be continued with these funds. In addition, with appropriate congressional approval, Amtrak might enter into partnerships with individual states or groups of states to \u201creconnect\u201d the federally supported parts of the system.", "As for Amtrak\u2019s reservations about having a commission offer options to the Congress, we recognize that Amtrak could provide the Congress with options for realigning and closing routes, and we explicitly provide for that option in our recommendation. We recognize that Amtrak has superior knowledge of the economics of its operation, and Amtrak\u2019s recent analytical efforts could provide the starting point for considerations about restructuring the system. However, we also realize the difficulties inherent in deciding which states and locations should receive service. Because the commission would be independent, it could help eliminate some of the problems normally associated with reducing service in different areas of the nation. In addition, if the Congress chooses, such a commission could take into account factors beyond revenues and costs, such as highway and airport congestion relief, in deciding how to realign the route network.", "Third, Amtrak believed that the role of the states in intercity rail passenger service and the need for access to federal transportation funds deserved emphasis in our report. We revised the report to reflect the fact that unlike aviation, highways, and mass transit, intercity passenger rail has no trust fund and that the ability of the states to use the trust funds that exist for other modes for rail is extremely limited. In 1991, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act provided the states with some flexibility to use highway dollars for mass transit, but it did not authorize the direct use of such funds for intercity passenger rail service. Although the states\u2019 access to federal transportation trust funds is a key element of Amtrak\u2019s plan to have the states cover significantly more of the railroad\u2019s costs, it is a policy judgment for the Congress to make whether and to what extent such flexibility should be extended to intercity passenger rail. Amtrak also wanted assurance that we consider the federal funds for Amtrak\u2019s capital needs as an investment and not a subsidy. Our report clearly notes that capital expenditures are an investment.", "Finally, Amtrak believes that if it is freed from certain legislative restraints, it could operate more as a competitive commercial entity. Amtrak envisions changes to labor laws to give it greater latitude to negotiate on such matters as severance pay, contracting, and work processes. Amtrak also wants (1) an exemption from requirements to pay federal fuel taxes, (2) authority to issue tax-exempt debt, (3) inclusion in a federal transportation trust fund, (4) relief from requirements under the Railroad Retirement Act, and (5) limits on its liability for punitive damages after accidents. We added a recommendation to our report that Amtrak provide its proposals to the Congress, along with the estimated effect of each proposal on Amtrak\u2019s finances and on other affected parties. This information will provide a vehicle for congressional deliberation on the merits of each proposal and allow for consideration of opposing views.", "Amtrak also provided comments that clarified certain technical information or statements made in a draft of this report. We found Amtrak\u2019s suggestions useful and incorporated these changes in the report where appropriate. Amtrak\u2019s written comments and legislative proposals are presented in full in appendix IV."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
