Outlier generalists and other generalists saw similar numbers of Medicare patients and their respective patients averaged the same number of office visits. However, after taking health status and location into account, GAO found that Medicare patients who saw an outlier generalist--compared with those who saw other generalists--were more likely to have been hospitalized, more likely to have been hospitalized multiple times, and more likely to have used home health services. By contrast, they were less likely to have been admitted to a skilled nursing facility. Certain public and private health care purchasers routinely evaluate physicians in their networks using measures of efficiency and other factors. The 10 health care purchasers in our study profiled physicians--that is, compared physicians' performance to an efficiency standard to identify those who practiced inefficiently. To measure efficiency, the purchasers we spoke with generally compared actual spending for physicians' patients to the expected spending for those same patients, given their clinical and demographic characteristics. Most of the 10 purchasers also evaluated physicians on quality. To encourage efficiency, all 10 purchasers linked their physician evaluation results to a range of incentives--from steering patients toward the most efficient providers to excluding physicians from the purchaser's provider network because of inefficient practice patterns. CMS has tools available to evaluate physicians' practices for efficiency but would likely need additional authorities to use results in ways similar to other purchasers. CMS has a comprehensive repository of Medicare claims data to compute reliable efficiency measures for most physicians serving Medicare patients and has substantial experience using methods that adjust for differences in patients' health status. However, CMS may not currently have the flexibility that other purchasers have to link physician profiling results to a range of incentives encouraging efficiency. Implementation of other strategies to encourage efficiency would likely require legislation. CMS said that our recommendation was timely and that our focus on the need for risk adjustment in measuring physician resource use was particularly helpful. However, CMS only discussed using profiling results for educating physicians. GAO believes that the optimal profiling effort would include financial or other incentives to encourage efficiency and would measure the effort's impact on Medicare. GAO concurs with CMS that this effort would require adequate funding."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, we and others have reported that the Medicare program is  unsustainable in its present form. Because of rising health care costs and  the aging of baby boomers into eligibility for Medicare, future program  spending is projected to encumber an escalating share of the government\u2019s  resources. In their 2006 annual report, the Medicare Trustees found that  Part B assets now are substantially below appropriate levels and that  Medicare\u2019s Hospital Insurance Trust Fund\u2014which funds the Medicare   Part A program\u2014will be exhausted in 2018. They concluded that  Medicare\u2019s financial challenges call for timely and effective action, and  that reforms must be prompt to allow time for health care providers,  beneficiaries, and taxpayers to adjust their expectations. Similarly, in 2006  testimony, the Comptroller General noted that dramatic health care reform  would require a long transition period, arguing for acting sooner rather  than later.", "Experts agree that physicians play a central role in the generation of  health care expenditures in total. Their services are estimated to account  for 20 percent of total health care expenditures, whereas their influence is  estimated to account for up to 90 percent of this spending. For example,  physicians refer patients to other physicians; they admit patients to  hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and hospices; and they order services  delivered by other health care providers, such as imaging studies,  laboratory tests, and home health services.", "Based on the centrality of the physician\u2019s role with respect to the  consumption of health care services, some public and private health care  purchasers have initiated programs to identify \u201cefficient\u201d physicians and  encourage patients to obtain care from these physicians. (For the  purposes of this report, efficiency means providing and ordering a level of  services that is sufficient to meet a patient\u2019s health care needs but not  excessive, given the patient\u2019s health status.) These purchasers identify  efficient physicians by examining data obtained from medical claims to  measure an individual\u2019s performance relative to a benchmark, a method  known as profiling. Physician profiling activities occur in Medicare today,  but they focus largely on improper billing practices rather than on efficient  care delivery. Some policymakers have suggested using a profiling  approach in Medicare to pay physicians based on their meeting quality and  efficiency performance standards. As a practical matter, such an approach  would be carried out by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS), the agency responsible for administering the Medicare program.", "The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of  2003 (MMA) required us to study aspects of physician compensation,  pertaining only to physicians serving beneficiaries in traditional fee-for- service (FFS) Medicare. As discussed with the committees of  jurisdiction, this report explores key concepts involved in linking  assessments of individual physicians\u2019 performance\u2014particularly measures  of efficiency\u2014to their compensation. Specifically, this report (1) estimates  the prevalence in Medicare of physicians who are likely to practice  medicine inefficiently, (2) examines physician-focused strategies used by  public and private sector health care purchasers to encourage efficient  medical care, and (3) examines the potential for CMS to profile physicians  in traditional FFS Medicare for efficiency and use the results in ways that  are similar to other purchasers that encourage efficiency.", "To estimate the prevalence in Medicare of physicians likely to practice  medicine inefficiently, we developed a profiling methodology using claims  data for beneficiaries in the traditional FFS program. We considered the  experience of other purchasers that conduct such analyses and used an  approach that was feasible and practical for our purposes. We focused our  analysis on generalists\u2014physicians who described their specialty as  general practice, internal medicine, or family practice\u2014in 12 metropolitan  areas. We selected areas that were diverse geographically and in terms of  Medicare spending per beneficiary. Using 2003 Medicare claims data, we  examined the degree to which a generalist physician treated a large  proportion of Medicare patients for whom Medicare spending was  unusually high, given their health status. To identify such patients, we  assigned health status scores to all beneficiaries in the 12 areas, using a  risk adjustment method similar to the one CMS uses to adjust payments  for Medicare enrollees in managed care plans. We grouped these patients  into 31 cohorts by health status to remove differences in spending  associated with differences in health status. We then identified within each  cohort the top 20 percent of beneficiaries ranked by spending for all  Medicare services and referred to these beneficiaries as \u201coverly expensive\u201d  compared with others of similar health status. We linked these overly  expensive patients to the physicians they saw and computed the  percentage they represented of each physician\u2019s Medicare practice. We  determined whether a generalist physician had a Medicare practice that,  relative to the physician\u2019s peers in the same metropolitan area, included a  percentage of overly expensive patients that was higher than would occur  by chance if these patients were randomly distributed across the area\u2019s  generalist physicians. We identified these physicians as \u201coutliers\u201d relative  to the practice patterns prevailing in their area and concluded that they  were likely to practice medicine inefficiently. Our results are not  statistically generalizable beyond the 12 areas we studied.", "We ensured the reliability of the claims data used in this report by  performing appropriate electronic data checks and by interviewing agency  officials who were knowledgeable about the data. The encounter and cost  information in the claims data we used are generally considered to be  reliable, as they are used by the Medicare program as a record of payments  to health care providers and are closely monitored by both CMS and  Medicare\u2019s fiscal intermediaries and carriers\u2014contractors that process,  review, and pay claims for Medicare-covered services. In addition, we  examined the claims data files for obvious errors, missing values, and  values outside of expected ranges. We also interviewed experts at CMS  who regularly use the claims data for evaluation and analysis. We found  the claims data were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of our analyses.", "To examine physician-focused strategies used by public and private health  care purchasers to encourage efficient medical care, we interviewed  representatives of 10 health care purchasers, including 5 commercial  health plans, 1 provider network, 1 trust fund jointly managed by  employers and a union, and 3 government agencies\u20142 in U.S. states and 1  in a Canadian province. On the basis of discussions with industry experts,  we selected these plans because their physician profiling programs  explicitly assess efficiency\u2014unlike many such programs that assess  quality only. To examine the potential for profiling in Medicare and using  the results to encourage efficiency, we reviewed CMS program guidelines  and memoranda, interviewed CMS officials, and analyzed how certain  components of physician-focused payment strategies would fit with  structural features of the Medicare program.", "We conducted our work from September 2005 through April 2007 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Since 1992, physicians in Medicare have been paid under a national fee  schedule in conjunction with a system of spending targets. Under the  design of the fee schedule and target system, annual adjustments  (updates) to physician fees depend, in part, on whether actual spending  has fallen below or exceeded the target. Fees are permitted to increase at  least as fast as the costs of providing physician services as long as the  growth in volume and intensity of physician services remains below a  specified rate\u2014currently, a little more than 2 percent a year. If spending  associated with volume and intensity grows faster than the specified rate,  the target system reduces fee increases or causes fees to fall. The target  system in place today, called the sustainable growth rate (SGR) system,  was implemented in 1998. This system acts as a blunt instrument in that all  physicians are subject to the consequences of excess spending\u2014that is,  downward fee adjustments\u2014that may stem from the excessive use of  resources by some physicians relative to their peers.", "Medicare spending on Part B physician services has grown rapidly in  recent years. From 2000 through 2005, program spending for Part B FFS  physician services grew at an average annual rate of 9.8 percent, outpacing  average annual Medicare aggregate spending growth of 8.7 percent for this  period. Since 2002, actual Medicare spending on physician services has  exceeded SGR targets, and the SGR system has called for fee cuts to offset  the excess spending. However, the cuts were overridden by administrative  action or the Congress five times during this period. In a 2004 report on  the SGR system, we found that possible options to modify or eliminate  the system would increase the growth in cumulative spending over a   10-year period, usually by double-digit percentages. The difficulty of  stabilizing physician fees in the face of the need to maintain fiscal  discipline has spurred congressional interest in other ways to restrain  spending growth.", "As concern about the long-term fiscal sustainability of Medicare has  grown, so has the recognition that some of the spending for services  provided and ordered by physicians may not be warranted. For example,  the wide geographic variation in Medicare spending for physician  services\u2014unrelated to beneficiary health status or outcomes\u2014provides  evidence that health needs alone do not determine spending. Furthermore,  several studies have shown that in some instances growth in the number  of services provided may lead to medical harm. Payments under the  Medicare program, however, generally do not foster individual physician  responsibility for quality, medical efficacy, or efficiency. In recognition of  this, the Institute of Medicine has recently recommended that Medicare  payment policies should be reformed to include a system for paying health  care providers differentially based on how well they meet performance  standards for quality or efficiency or both. In April 2005, CMS initiated a  demonstration mandated by the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits  Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA) to test this approach.  Under the Physician Group Practice demonstration, 10 large physician  group practices, each comprising at least 200 physicians, are eligible for  bonus payments if they meet quality targets and succeed in keeping the  total expenditures of their Medicare population below annual targets.", "Several studies have found that Medicare and other purchasers could  realize substantial savings if a portion of patients switched from less  efficient to more efficient physicians. The estimates vary according to  assumptions about the proportion of beneficiaries who would change  physicians. In 2003, the Consumer-Purchaser Disclosure Project, a  partnership of consumer, labor, and purchaser organizations, asked  actuaries and health researchers to estimate the potential savings to  Medicare if a small proportion of beneficiaries started using more efficient  physicians. The Project reported that Medicare could save between 2 and  4 percent of total costs if 1 out of 10 beneficiaries moved to more efficient  physicians. This conclusion is based on information received from one  actuarial firm and two academic researchers. One researcher concluded,  based on his simulations, that if 5 to 10 percent of Medicare enrollees  switched to the most efficient physicians, savings would be 1 to 3 percent  of program costs\u2014which would amount to about $5 billion to $14 billion  in 2007.", "The Congress has also recently expressed interest in approaches to  constrain the growth of physician spending. The Deficit Reduction Act of  2005 required the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) to  study options for controlling the volume of physicians\u2019 services under  Medicare. One approach for applying volume controls that the Congress  directed MedPAC to consider is a payment system that takes into account  physician outliers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Physicians Who Treated a Disproportionate Share of Overly Expensive Patients Were Found in Each of 12 Areas Studied", "paragraphs": ["In each of the 12 metropolitan areas studied, we found physicians who  treated a disproportionate share of overly expensive patients.

The  programs generally computed efficiency measures as the ratio of actual to  expected spending for patients of similar health status. Ratios greater than  1.0 (indicating that actual equals expected spending) suggest relative  inefficiency while ratios below 1.0 suggest efficiency, although purchasers  were free to set their own threshold. For example, one purchaser  scrutinized physicians with scores above 1.2 for inefficient delivery of  care. Some purchasers also took account of additional information before  making a final judgment. For example, two purchasers told us that they  reexamined the results for physicians who exceeded the threshold for  inefficiency to see if there were factors, such as erroneous data, that made  an otherwise efficient provider appear inefficient.", "While our focus was on purchasers who profile for efficiency, purchasers  in our study included quality measures as part of their profiling programs.

The  following were commonly reported incentives:    Physician education: Some health care purchasers told us that they  shared their profiling results with physicians to encourage more efficient  care delivery or to foster acceptance of the purchaser\u2019s physician  evaluation methods. For example, one purchaser\u2019s profiling report  compared a physician\u2019s utilization patterns to a benchmark measure  derived from the practice patterns of the physician\u2019s peer group, such as  cardiologists compared with other cardiologists in the network or primary  care physicians compared with other primary care physicians in the  network. No purchaser employed education as the sole method of  motivating physicians to change their practice patterns.", "Publicly designating physicians based on efficiency or quality: Some  purchasers encouraged enrollees to get their care from certain physicians  by designating in their physician directories those physicians who met  quality or quality and efficiency standards. Other purchasers offered  financial incentives to their enrollees to encourage them to patronize such  physicians. The incentives may generate higher patient volume for the  designated physicians, thereby achieving savings for the purchaser or their  clients.", "Using tiered arrangements to promote efficiency: Several purchasers  used profiling results to group physicians in tiers\u2014essentially groups of  physicians ranked by their level of efficiency.

Currently, Medicare Web sites  posting comparative information exist for hospitals, nursing homes, home  health care agencies, dialysis facilities, and managed care plans. In its  March 2005 report to the Congress, MedPAC noted that CMS could share  results of physician performance measurement with beneficiaries once the  agency gained sufficient experience with its physician measurement tools.", "Several structural features of the Medicare program would appear to pose  challenges to the use of other strategies designed to encourage efficiency.  These features include a beneficiary\u2019s freedom to choose any licensed  physician permitted to be paid by Medicare; the lack of authority to  exclude physicians from participating in Medicare unless they engage in  unlawful, abusive, or unprofessional practices; and a physician payment  system that does not take into account the efficiency of the care provided.  Under these provisions, CMS would not likely be able\u2014in the absence of  additional legislative authority\u2014to designate preferred providers, assign  physicians to tiers associated with varying beneficiary copayments, tie fee  updates of individual physicians to meeting performance standards, or  exclude physicians who do not meet practice efficiency and quality  criteria.", "Regardless of the use made of physician profiling results, the involvement  of, and acceptance by, the physician community and other stakeholders of  any actions taken is critical. Several purchasers described how they had  worked to get physician buy-in. They explained their methods to  physicians and shared data with them to increase physicians\u2019 familiarity  with and confidence in the purchasers\u2019 profiling. CMS has several avenues  for obtaining the input of the physician community. Among them is the  federal rule-making process, which generally provides a comment period  for all parties affected by prospective policy changes. In addition, CMS  forms federal advisory committees\u2014including ones composed of  physicians and other health care practitioners\u2014that regularly provide it  with advice and recommendations concerning regulatory and other policy  decisions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The health care spending levels predicted to overwhelm the Medicare  program call for action to be taken promptly. To address this looming  problem, no single action or reform is likely to suffice, and policymakers  are seeking solutions among an array of reform proposals. Our findings  suggest that physician profiling is one promising, targeted approach  toward curbing excessive spending both for physician services and for the  services that physicians order.", "Our profiling of generalist physicians in 12 metropolitan areas found  indications of inefficient physician practices occurring in areas with low  spending per beneficiary as well as in areas with high spending. To ensure  that our estimates were fair, we adjusted them to account for the fact that  some physicians have sicker patients than others; in addition, our  efficiency standards were based on actual practices by local physicians  rather than on a single measure applied to all physicians, regardless of  geographic area. Notably, two areas\u2014Miami and Baton Rouge\u2014had  particularly large proportions of outlier physicians compared with the  other areas.", "Some health care purchasers seek to curb inefficient practices through  physician education and other measures directed at physicians\u2019 income\u2014 such as discouraging patients from obtaining care from physicians whom  the purchaser, through profiling, ranks as inefficient. If similar approaches  were adopted in Medicare\u2014that is, profiling physicians for efficiency and  strategically applying the results\u2014the experience of other purchasers  suggests that reductions in spending growth could be achieved. The  adoption of a profiling system could require the modification of certain  basic Medicare principles. For example, if CMS had the authority to rank- order physicians based on efficiency and tier beneficiary copayments  accordingly, beneficiaries could retain the freedom to choose among  providers but would be steered, through financial incentives, toward those  identified as most efficient. CMS would likely find it desirable to base the  tiers on both quality and efficiency. It would also be important to develop  an evaluation component to measure the profiling system\u2019s impact on  program spending and physician behavior.", "In addition, a physician profiling system in Medicare could work in ways  that would be complementary to the SGR system. That is, if Medicare  instituted a physician profiling system that resulted in gains in efficiency,  over time the rate of growth in volume and intensity of physician services  could decline and the SGR targets would be less likely to be exceeded. At  the same time, under a profiling system that focused on total program  expenditures, Medicare could experience a drop in unnecessary utilization  of other services, such as hospitalizations and home health care. Although  savings from physician profiling alone would clearly not be sufficient to  correct Medicare\u2019s long-term fiscal imbalance, it could be an important  part of a package of reforms aimed at future program sustainability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["Given the contribution of physicians to Medicare spending in total, we  recommend that the Administrator of CMS develop a profiling system that  identifies individual physicians with inefficient practice patterns and,  seeking legislative changes as necessary, use the results to improve the  efficiency of care financed by Medicare.

We do not disagree,  but we also believe that approaches involving the measurement of total  patient expenditures are equally promising.", "CMS said that the agency would incur significant recurring costs to  develop reports on physician resource use, disseminate them to physicians  nationwide, and evaluate the impact of the program. While our report  notes that CMS is familiar with key methodological tools needed to  conduct such an effort, we agree that any such undertaking would need to  be adequately funded.

AMA said including incentives that promote the provision  of high-quality care might increase costs initially but could reduce costs in  the long term. Although we agree that quality is an important measure of  physician performance, given growing concern about Medicare\u2019s fiscal  sustainability, we believe that a focus on the efficient delivery of care is  essential.", "With regard to the use of risk adjustment methods in assessing physician  efficiency, both AMA and ACP said that this technique has significant  shortcomings. For example, AMA said that diagnostic information  included in the claims data used in risk adjustment may not adequately  capture differences in patient health status. AMA also said that these data  lack information on other factors that affect health status and spending,  such as differences in patient compliance with medical advice. ACP  echoed this concern. We believe that these claims data limitations are not  of sufficient importance to preclude their use for profiling physicians  treating Medicare patients. As our report notes, risk adjustment methods  using claims information are now used by many private payers in  measuring physician resource use. Moreover, Medicare currently uses one  such risk adjustment method to set payment rates for managed care plans.", "Finally, both AMA and ACP expressed reservations about linking the  results of profiling to physician reimbursement. The AMA stated that it  was acceptable to use profiling results for the purpose of physician  education, but an exclusive focus on costs was not. Although all of the  purchasers we interviewed included physician education in their profiling  programs, none of them relied on it as the sole means for encouraging  physicians to practice efficiently. Similarly, we believe that, to restrain the  growth in Medicare expenditures, a physician profiling system would need  financial or other incentives to motivate physicians to practice medicine  efficiently.", "We are sending a copy of this report to the Administrator of CMS.

Decedents typically have annualized costs that are much  higher than survivors but usually have less than 12 months of Medicare  enrollment in their last year of life. We included survivors in our analysis if  they had (1) 12 months of Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) enrollment in  2003 and (2) were not covered by other health insurance for which  Medicare was determined to be a secondary payer.

Within each risk  category, we ranked survivors by their total costs. Survivors who ranked  in the top 20 percent of their assigned risk category were designated as  overly expensive.

Before ranking decedents by their total costs, we further divided them  within each risk category by the number of months they were enrolled in  Medicare FFS during 2003. This was necessary because decedents varied  in the number of months they incurred health care costs. For example,  decedents who died in October had up to 10 months to incur costs while  those who died in January had 1 month or less to incur costs.", "The proportion of overly expensive beneficiaries varied across the areas  we examined.
