Doing so, however, requires certain trade-offs and complex budget, cost, and schedule interactions. GAO was asked to assess the progress of selected unmanned aircraft acquisition programs, examine the extent to which the services are collaborating and identifying commonality among those programs, and identify key factors impacting the effectiveness their collaboration.

The cumulative development costs for the 10 programs GAO reviewed increased by over $3.3 billion (37 percent in 2009 dollars) from initial estimates--with nearly $2.7 billion attributed to the Air Force's Global Hawk program. While 3 of the 10 programs had little or no development cost growth and 1 had a cost reduction, 6 programs experienced significant growth ranging from 60 percent to 264 percent. These outcomes are largely the result of changes in program requirements and system designs. Procurement funding requirements have also increased for most programs, primarily because of increases in the number of aircraft being procured, changes in system requirements, and upgrades and retrofits to equip fielded systems with capabilities that had been deferred. Overall, procurement unit costs increased by 12 percent, with unit cost increases of 25 percent or more for 3 aircraft programs. Finally, several programs have experienced significant delays in achieving initial operating capability, ranging from 1 to nearly 4 years. Several of the tactical and theater-level unmanned aircraft acquisition programs GAO reviewed have identified areas of commonality to leverage resources and gain efficiencies. For example, the Marine Corps chose to procure the Army's Shadow system after it determined Shadow could meet its requirements, and was able to avoid the cost of initial system development and quickly deliver capability to the warfighter. Also, the Navy's Broad Area Maritime Surveillance system will use a modified Global Hawk airframe. However, other programs have missed opportunities to achieve commonality and efficiencies. The Army's Sky Warrior--which is a variant of the Air Force's Predator, is being developed by the same contractor, and will provide similar capabilities--was initiated as a separate development program in 2005. Sky Warrior development is now estimated to cost nearly $570 million. DOD officials continue to press for more commonality in the two programs, but the aircraft still have little in common. Although several unmanned aircraft programs have achieved airframe commonality, service-driven acquisition processes and ineffective collaboration are key factors that have inhibited commonality among subsystems, payloads, and ground control stations. For example, the Army chose to develop a new sensor payload for its Sky Warrior, despite the fact that the sensor currently used on the Air Force's Predator is comparable and manufactured by the same contractor. To support their respective requirements, the services also make resource allocation decisions independently. DOD officials have not quantified the potential costs or benefits of pursuing various alternatives, including common systems. To maximize acquisition resources and meet increased demand, Congress and DOD have increasingly pushed for more commonality among unmanned aircraft systems."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["From 2002 through 2008, the number of unmanned aircraft in the  Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) inventory increased from 167 to more  than 6,000 in an effort to meet growing warfighter demand for these  capabilities in Iraq and Afghanistan. DOD has noted that meeting this  demand has been difficult because of the highly dynamic nature of  supporting ongoing combat operations while developing new and  emerging capabilities. The department plans to invest more than   $16 billion from 2008 through 2013 to develop and procure additional  unmanned aircraft systems. However, the growing number of national  priorities competing for federal dollars will continue to challenge DOD\u2019s  efforts to meet escalating demands for unmanned systems.", "DOD recognizes that to more effectively leverage its acquisition resources,  it must achieve greater commonality and efficiency among the military  services\u2019 various unmanned system acquisition programs. Achieving  commonality, however, can be difficult. We have reported in the past that  programs that involve more than one service require complex budget,  cost, and schedule interactions and are likely to require the services to  make more trade-offs than a single service development would. We have  also found that joint development efforts have often been hampered by an  inability to obtain and sustain commitments and support from the military  services and other stakeholders. However, given your interest in how  DOD is establishing requirements for new intelligence, surveillance, and  reconnaissance capabilities\u2014including unmanned aircraft systems\u2014and  considering opportunities to leverage existing capabilities or achieve  commonality, you asked us to assess DOD\u2019s tactical and theater-level  unmanned aircraft acquisition programs. Specifically, we (1) assessed the  cost, schedule, and performance progress of selected tactical and theater- level unmanned aircraft acquisition programs; (2) examined the extent to  which the military services are collaborating and identifying commonality  among those programs; and (3) identified the key factors influencing the  effectiveness of their collaboration.", "To conduct our work, we collected and analyzed cost, schedule, and  performance data for 10 acquisition programs: eight unmanned aircraft  systems\u2014Global Hawk, Reaper, Shadow, Predator, Sky Warrior, Fire  Scout, Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS), and Unmanned Combat  Aircraft System Demonstration (UCAS-D)\u2014and two payload development  programs\u2014Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP- RTIP) and Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP). Collectively, the  eight aircraft programs account for more than 80 percent of DOD\u2019s total  planned investment in unmanned aircraft systems from fiscal year 2008  through fiscal year 2013. To determine the extent to which the military  services are collaborating and identifying commonality and the factors  affecting that collaboration, we reviewed and analyzed key program  documents and prior GAO work and conducted numerous interviews with  and received briefings from relevant DOD and contractor officials. For  additional details on how we performed our review, see appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2008 to July 2009 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and strike capabilities  provided by unmanned aircraft systems have proven to be a key asset in  accomplishing combat missions in the Middle East. DOD is planning to  expand unmanned aircraft capabilities to include persistent ground attack,  electronic warfare, suppression of enemy air defenses, cargo airlift, and  other missions. Unmanned aircraft systems generally consist of   (1) multiple aircraft, which can be expendable or recoverable and can  carry lethal or nonlethal payloads; (2) a flight control station;   (3) information and retrieval or processing stations; and (4) in some cases,  wheeled land vehicles that carry launch and recovery platforms.  Unmanned aircraft fall into one of three classes: small, tactical, and  theater (see table 1). From 2002 through 2008, the total number of  unmanned aircraft in DOD\u2019s inventory increased from 167 to over 6,000.  Most of the increase has been in small aircraft, with the more complex and  expensive tactical and theater-level aircraft increasing from 127 to 521.", "Four major systems\u2014Global Hawk, Predator, Reaper, and Shadow\u2014have  been deployed and used successfully in combat. Given this success,  warfighters have demanded more systems and in many cases enhanced  capabilities. However, we recently reported that some unmanned aircraft  were not designed to meet joint service requirements or interoperability  communications standards and, as a result, cannot easily exchange data,  even within the same military service. Additionally, certain  electromagnetic spectrum frequencies that are required for wireless  communications are congested because a large number of unmanned  aircraft and other weapons or communications systems use them  simultaneously. Furthermore, DOD has been unable to fully optimize the  use of its unmanned aircraft in combat operations because it lacks an  approach to allocating and tasking them that considers the availability of  all assets in determining how best to meet warfighter needs.", "To manage the increased demand for unmanned aircraft systems and  encourage collaboration among the military services, the department has  created the Office of Unmanned Warfare, the Unmanned Aircraft Systems  Task Force, and other entities. In addition, DOD has published the  Unmanned Systems Roadmap (Roadmap) that provides a framework for  the future development of unmanned systems and related technologies.  The Roadmap states that there is the potential for an unprecedented level  of collaboration to meet capability needs and reduce acquisition costs by  requiring greater commonality among the military services\u2019 unmanned  systems. We have reported that taking an open systems approach and  designing systems with common subsystems and components can reduce  both production and life cycle costs as well as improve interoperability  among systems. For maximum benefit, commonality should be  incorporated into the design of a system when requirements are being  established. Unmanned aircraft systems can potentially achieve  commonality in design and development, ranging from a complete system  to a subsystem or component, as well as commonality in production  facilities, tooling, and personnel."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Unmanned Aircraft Acquisitions Have Experienced Cost Growth, Schedule Delays, and Performance Problems", "paragraphs": ["Despite the proven success of unmanned aircraft on the battlefield and the  growing demand for them, these acquisitions continue to incur cost and  schedule growth (see fig. 1). The cumulative development cost for the 10  programs we reviewed increased by over $3 billion, or 37 percent, from  initial estimates. While 3 of the 10 programs had little or no development  cost growth and 1 had a cost reduction, 6 experienced substantial growth  ranging from 60 percent to 264 percent. In large part, this cost growth was  the result of changes in program requirements and system designs after  initiating development. Total procurement funding requirements have  grown in the past because of increased quantities; however, many of the  programs have also experienced growth in procurement unit costs.  Finally, a number of these programs have experienced problems in testing  and in performance that required additional development that contributed  to cost growth and schedule delays (see app. II for more detailed  information about each program).", "In most cases, development cost growth was the result of beginning  system development with unclear or poorly defined requirements,  immature technologies, and unstable designs\u2014problems we have  frequently found in other major acquisition programs. The Global Hawk  program is a good example. In 2001, the Air Force began the Global Hawk  program based on knowledge gained from a demonstration program and  planned to incrementally integrate more advanced technologies over time.  However, within a year, the Air Force fundamentally restructured and  accelerated the program to pursue a larger and unproven airframe with  multimission capability relying on immature technologies. The final design  of the new airframe required more substantial changes than expected.  Ultimately, frequent and substantive engineering changes drove  development costs up nearly threefold. While BAMS has reported no cost  growth, the program is just 1 year into its 7-year development, and the  Navy plans to spend over $3 billion in development to modify the  airframe\u2014which is the existing Global Hawk airframe\u2014and integrate  payloads and other key equipment, modify ground stations, and purchase  two developmental and three low rate production aircraft. BAMS program  officials told us that they anticipate that the bulk of the development cost  will result from modifying the size and shape of the existing radar payload  to fit the Global Hawk airframe. Historically, similar weapons  development efforts have had difficulty managing risk. Estimated  development costs for MP-RTIP decreased 23 percent in large part  because of a significant reduction in requirements caused by the  termination of another aircraft program for which the radar was being  developed.", "Procurement costs also increased for six of the seven systems that  reported procurement cost data, a large portion of which is due to the  planned procurement of additional aircraft (see table 2). For example, the  Air Force planed to procure an additional 272 Predators, and the Army  planed to procure an additional 84 Sky Warriors. As a result, unit costs for  the Predator and Sky Warrior decreased by 41 percent and 9 percent,  respectively. However, Reaper and Shadow had unit cost growth despite  increased quantities. Reaper\u2019s unit costs increased in part because  requirements for missiles and a digital electronic engine control were  added\u2014which resulted in design changes and increased production costs.  Unit cost increases in the Shadow program were largely the result of  upgrades to the airframe that were needed to accommodate the size,  weight, and power requirements for integrating a congressionally  mandated data link onto the aircraft. The Army is also retrofitting fielded  systems with capabilities that it had initially deferred, such as a heavy fuel  engine. The procurement unit cost for Global Hawk increased the most, in  large part because the Air Force not only increased the program\u2019s  requirements but also reduced the number of aircraft it intended to  purchase.", "Four programs have also experienced delays in achieving initial  operational capability by 1 to almost 4 years (see table 3). In some cases,  program delays have been the result of expediting limited capability to the  warfighter. For example, the production decision for the Sky Warrior was  delayed by 2 years, and the Army now expects to deliver initial operational  capability to the warfighter almost 4 years later than originally planned.  Similarly, initial operational testing to prove the larger Global Hawk  airframe works as intended has been delayed by nearly 3 years. Delays for  these two programs and BAMS and Fire Scout average more than 27  months\u20146 months longer than the average delays we found in our recent  assessment of other major weapons acquisitions. In contrast, the Reaper  program expects to achieve initial operational capability 4 months earlier  than originally planned\u2014in large part because the Air Force expedited  aircraft production to meet wartime demands.", "While Global Hawk, Predator, Reaper, and Shadow have been deployed  with notable successes in theater\u2014as well as identified lessons learned\u2014 rushing to field these capabilities resulted in a number of performance  shortfalls and in some cases ultimately delayed meeting requirements. For  example, Predator\u2014the oldest program in our sample\u2014directly  transitioned from a successful technology demonstration program into  production, skipping the development process entirely. Because little  emphasis was placed on testing, performance requirements, and  producibility, Predator experienced numerous problems when it was  initially produced and deployed, such as unreliable communications and  poor targeting accuracy.", "Given the importance of supporting combat operations, Global Hawk  demonstrators and early production aircraft were also quickly placed into  operational service. Program officials noted that as a result, the availability  of test resources and time for testing were limited, which delayed the  operational assessment of the original aircraft model by 3 years. Similarly,  in February 2009, the Air Force reported that initial operational testing for  the larger more capable Global Hawk aircraft and the program\u2019s  production readiness review had schedule breaches. Air Force officials  cite the high level of concurrency between development, production, and  testing; poor contractor performance; developmental and technical  problems; system failures; and bad weather as key reasons for the most  recent schedule breach. In a recent letter to the Global Hawk contractor,  the Air Force\u2019s Chief Acquisition Executive noted that unless the  program\u2019s problems are resolved quickly, the Air Force may have to  consider deferring authorization of future production lots, terminating  future modernization efforts, and canceling development and production  of the aircraft that are planned to carry the MP-RTIP radar.

The Marine Corps also found that it could use the Army\u2019s ground control  station to pilot the Shadow aircraft as well as other Marine Corps  unmanned aircraft. A memorandum of agreement was established in July  2007 to articulate how the Marine Corps and the Army would coordinate  to acquire Shadow systems. The agreement details the management  structure, lines of accountability, and funding arrangements between the  two services, and establishes that the Marine Corps will procure systems  directly off the Army contract.

Those costs were borne by the Army and totaled  over $180 million. The Marine Corps plans to spend almost $9 million from  fiscal years 2009 through 2015 to support development of additional  capabilities for the Shadow, to include a backup takeoff mechanism for  the automatic takeoff and landing system. Additionally, the Marine Corps  and Army are likely to realize some benefits in supporting and maintaining  the systems because the components are interchangeable. According to an  official at the Navy, the Marine Corps has been able to realize savings or  cost avoidance in other areas such as administration, contracting, and  testing, although quantitative data on these savings were not available. The  Army\u2019s Shadow program office agreed that commonality has allowed the  two services to realize economies of scale while meeting each service\u2019s  needs.", "Maintaining a high level of commonality in the Shadow program will  require continued commitment from the services and careful management.  Specifically, as the Army and Marine Corps explore ways to add additional  capabilities to Shadow, the services will need to continue to collaborate to  maximize efficiencies. For example, in order to maintain commonality  with the Army, the Marine Corps is spending money to add capabilities  that meet Shadow requirements established by the Army. Likewise, the  Army is interested in adopting capabilities that the Marine Corps  developed for Shadow. Army officials told us that the Marine Corps is  exploring ways to retrofit the Shadow so that it can carry a weapons  payload.

However, the  payload and subsystem requirements differ; and while some BAMS ground  station requirements are common with those of the Global Hawk, the  BAMS contractor noted that the Navy also has some unique requirements.  To meet its requirement for persistent maritime intelligence, surveillance,  and reconnaissance capability, the Navy awarded the development  contract to the Global Hawk contractor, which had proposed a variant of  the Global Hawk airframe. Given the commonality between the two  airframes, the Navy expects to avoid some development costs and gain  efficiencies in production. Since the development contract award, the  Navy and Air Force have worked together to identify commonalities to  gain additional efficiencies where possible. According to a Navy official,  one of the goals of this partnership is for the BAMS program to benefit  from lessons learned by the Global Hawk program and thereby avoid the  types of problems Global Hawk experienced during development.  Officials from the Defense Contract Management Agency emphasized the  importance of using these lessons.", "The BAMS payload and subsystem requirements differ from those of  Global Hawk. However, the Navy has identified opportunities to achieve  commonality with other aircraft programs rather than developing a  service-unique solution. For example, the Navy plans to equip BAMS with  the same electro-optical and infrared sensor used on the Air Force\u2019s  Reaper unmanned aircraft. In addition, the Navy plans to equip BAMS with  a maritime search radar based on radars used on the Air Force\u2019s F-16 and  F-22 aircraft. BAMS will also rely on communications equipment that has  been fielded on multiple weapon systems. Furthermore, BAMS will use an  open systems approach in developing its payloads. A BAMS program  official told us that the Navy expects to gain efficiencies in development,  operations, training, and manpower.", "Even with these areas of commonality, the Navy anticipates spending  more than $3 billion on development, a substantial portion of which will  be used to modify the airframe and ground stations and to integrate  payloads, including the radar, to meet Navy-specific needs. According to a  program official, the radar technology is mature because it has proven to  be functional on fighter aircraft. However, the radar will require  modifications to both size and shape before it can be integrated onto the  airframe; these modifications are expected to constitute a large portion of  the BAMS development cost. Although OSD certified that all BAMS critical  technologies were mature at the start of development, OSD officials  recently told us that they have some concerns about the radar\u2019s level of  maturity. The Navy also plans to upgrade existing Global Hawk ground  stations, in large part to allow analysts to view and assess information  more quickly. This ground station upgrade will require both hardware and  software development.", "Greater efficiencies may also be possible in production. While production  of the first two BAMS aircraft will occur at the same California facility  where Global Hawk is currently produced, the remaining BAMS aircraft  are expected to be produced at another facility in Florida. We believe that  this approach has the potential to create duplication in production by  having two facilities staffed and equipped to conduct essentially the same  work. However, contractor officials point out that while the California  facility has the capacity to accommodate BAMS production, having two  separate facilities would minimize the impact of potential work surges.  They also note that using the California facility for initial BAMS  production will give them time to gain knowledge that could help get the  Florida facility up and running. Yet neither contractor nor Navy officials  provided an analysis to justify using the Florida facility. According to an  official with the BAMS program office, the Navy considers this a  contractor business decision, and according to contractor officials, the  official analysis will not be done for several years.

In 2001 the Army began defining requirements for a  replacement to the aging Hunter unmanned aircraft system. According to  the Army, the limited number of unmanned aircraft in DOD\u2019s inventory  and its lack of direct control over these assets drove its decision to pursue  the development of Sky Warrior. The aircraft was originally intended to  satisfy the Army\u2019s requirement for wide-area, near real-time  reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition capability. However,  both the Air Force and the Joint Staff responsible for reviewing Sky  Warrior\u2019s requirements and acquisition documentation raised concerns  about duplicating existing capability\u2014specifically, capability provided by  Predator. Nevertheless, the program received approval to forgo an analysis  of alternatives that could have determined if existing capabilities would  meet its requirements. The Army noted that such an analysis was not  needed and not worth the cost and effort. Instead, it conducted a source  selection competition and began the Sky Warrior development program,  citing battlefield commanders\u2019 urgent need for this capability.", "In 2005, the Army awarded the Sky Warrior development contract to the  same contractor working with the Air Force to develop and produce  Predators and Reapers. As a variant of Predator, Sky Warrior is now being  assembled in the same facility. In 2006, the Army and Air Force signed a  memorandum of understanding to work together to identify  complementary requirements for the Sky Warrior and Predator programs.  Despite this memorandum, limited progress was made, and in 2007, the  Deputy Secretary of Defense directed the two services to combine their  respective programs into a single acquisition program.

However, as we reported in 2008, requirements  continue to be driven primarily by the individual services with little  involvement from the combatant commands, which are largely  responsible for planning and carrying out military operations. In reviewing  JCIDS documentation related to new capability proposals, we found that  most\u2014nearly 70 percent\u2014were sponsored by the military services with  little involvement from the joint community. By continuing to rely on  capability needs defined primarily by the services individually, DOD may  be losing opportunities to improve joint warfighting capabilities and to  reduce duplication of capabilities. In a separate report issued that same  year, we also noted that DOD did not have key management tools needed  to ensure that its intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance  investments reflected enterprisewide priorities and strategic goals. We  further noted that DOD lacked assurance that its investments in  intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities\u2014including  those in unmanned aircraft\u2014were providing solutions that best minimize  inefficiency and redundancy.", "For the unmanned aircraft systems we reviewed, the services established  requirements that were often so specific that they demanded service- unique solutions\u2014thereby precluding opportunities for commonality. Yet  none of the programs were able to provide us quantitative analyses to  justify pursuing their unique solutions or to show why common solutions  would not work.", "In some cases, service-unique requirements appear to be necessary. For  example, the Navy requires BAMS for maritime missions, which are  distinct from the land missions of its counterpart, Global Hawk.  Specifically, radar functionality depends on the operational environment\u2014 that is, water, a moving surface, compared to land, a relatively static  surface. Distinct radar capabilities are required to create images of  sufficient quality to recognize a target in these unique environments. The  Navy is also modifying the Global Hawk design to accommodate BAMS\u2019s  altitude agility requirements. Unlike Global Hawk, which is designed to fly  continuously at high altitudes, BAMS is intended to fly at low, medium,  and high altitudes during a mission. Consequently, the wings on the  airframe need to be structurally reinforced to handle the loads and wind  gusts associated with frequent changes in altitude. Altitude changes also  make BAMS more susceptible to icing conditions, and therefore require a  de-icing capability for the wing, tail, and engine. Such differences in  requirements have limited commonality in BAMS and Global Hawk beyond  the basic airframe.", "While some of the differences between Global Hawk and BAMS  requirements appear to be necessary, an OSD official we spoke with noted  that there is concern that other distinctions in requirements that the  services cited for other systems could lead to duplication and  inefficiencies. For example, an Army official cited the need to develop an  electro-optical and infrared sensor for the Army\u2019s Sky Warrior that had  unique capabilities from the sensor the Air Force uses on the Predator.  The Army noted that it does not need specific sensor capabilities that the  Air Force is pursuing, such as high-definition video, which could require  costly upgrades to existing Army systems. Currently, however, Predator\u2019s  sensor does not use high-definition video and thus could be employed by  the Sky Warrior system. Concerned that the government is paying a  premium to build two separate sensors with essentially the same  capability\u2014the two systems are 80 percent common\u2014OSD directed the  services to evaluate the feasibility of and potential savings associated with  purchasing a common sensor. An Army official, however, pointed out that  the Army had negotiated a unit cost for its version of the sensor that is  nearly $450,000 cheaper than unit cost of the Air Force sensor. Similarly,  Army and Air Force officials cited the need for unique flight control  requirements for Sky Warrior and Predator\u2014\u201cpoint and click\u201d versus  \u201cstick and rudder\u201d\u2014because the Army uses enlisted operators to fly the  aircraft, whereas the Air Force uses actual trained pilots. These different  approaches require the services to develop and acquire unique ground  control stations as well as other capabilities, such as automatic takeoff  and landing capability, that have not been used before, resulting in  additional cost and schedule risk.", "In some cases, the services collaborated to identify common  configuration, performance, and support requirements, but ultimately did  not maximize efficiencies. For example, the Army and Navy have different  data link requirements for their respective variants of Fire Scout, primarily  because of the Army\u2019s requirement for its Fire Scout to operate within the  Future Combat Systems network.
