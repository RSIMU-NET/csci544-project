Specifically, the protocol describes the regular internal meetings and  interactions that OCC staff had from September 2018 to December 2018.

Unlike the three-page summary protocol,  the draft procedure explicitly states its applicability to future review  periods as well as the current State Plan review period, and therefore  would have provided guidance for staff on a continuous basis had a  finalized version been shared with staff and established as OCC\u2019s written  policies. However, because of the volume of work and differences in  caseloads among regional offices, OCC officials stated that they did not  share a finalized procedure with staff and that staff were neither expected  nor required to use the draft procedure when conducting their review of  State Plans for the fiscal years 2019\u20132021 review period.

Specifically, there are  staffing changes in both the central and regional offices for each State  Plan review period, and having flexibility within the framework provided by  the three-page summary protocol allows them to accommodate those  changes. OCC officials noted that some of the processes are unique to  each of the 10 regional offices because of differences in their structure,  staffing, and caseloads. Likewise, OCC officials stated that the regional  offices need flexibility to continuously adjust processes and timelines so  that they can accommodate varying responsiveness from states, and  evaluate the State Plans without undermining the flexibility afforded to  states through the block grant. However, it is possible for OCC to  establish written policies to guide processes that are common from one  review period to the next, and across all regions, while still maintaining  the necessary flexibility to accommodate staffing changes and regional  differences, as it had already begun to do by developing its August 2018  draft procedure.", "In this regard, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  states that management should implement control activities through  policies.

Internal control is not one event, but a  series of actions that occur throughout an entity\u2019s operations.

Accordingly, without  providing additional guidance to its reviewers, OCC will lack assurance  that states\u2019 proposed corrective actions are aimed at root causes and  effectively implemented.", "OCC officials also stated that the majority of the seven states subject to  CAPs reduced their error rates over time, specifically to below 10 percent.  OCC officials explained that this determination is based on the  submission of the State Improper Payment Report for the next required  reporting cycle or on states\u2019 voluntarily conducting a review of a sample of  cases and submitting the results to OCC to demonstrate they had  reduced their error rate to below 10 percent. We did not independently  corroborate OCC\u2019s determination because assessing the reliability of the  self-attested internal error-rate reviews conducted by certain states and  reviewing this information was outside the scope of our work. However,  as part of our review of the 14 CAPs that have been submitted to OCC in  response to OCC\u2019s improper-payment reviews since 2013, we found that  one state was required to submit CAPs for 3 consecutive years and  consistently proposed the same error-rate reduction targets, with different  dates. This observation underscores the need to ensure the corrective  actions a state proposes are specifically aimed at root causes of improper  payments and are effectively implemented. OCC does not have guidance  in place for its reviewers to determine whether the ongoing corrective  actions a state proposes to reduce improper payments will be specifically  aimed at root causes of improper payments and effectively implemented.  This could leave the CCDF program at continued risk of improper  payments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OCC Plans to Document Its CAP Follow-up Process", "paragraphs": ["OCC does not have written policies for its CAP follow-up process or  documentation that follow-up has been completed for past CAPs.

According to OCC officials, OCC uses two tools as  part of its Monitoring System\u2014a Compliance Demonstration Packet and  Data Collection Tool. States complete the Compliance Demonstration  Packet to outline how they propose to demonstrate compliance with  regulatory requirements and implementation of the approved State Plans  throughout the Monitoring System\u2019s phases. For example, to show  effective internal controls are in place to ensure integrity and  accountability, states may provide OCC with state or local policies and  manuals (previsit phase), and may submit to interviews or provide system  demonstrations (on-site visit phase). OCC staff use the Data Collection  Tool to record comments about the evidence observed, and to note  whether additional follow-up is needed. Both of these tools contain  language indicating that the effectiveness of states\u2019 program-integrity and  fraud-fighting activities are evaluated by OCC staff.", "For purposes of the Monitoring System, OCC officials said that states  have broad flexibility to propose, in the Compliance Demonstration  Packet, what documents and evidence to provide. In addition, states have  the flexibility to propose how the state will demonstrate compliance with  regulatory requirements. This includes the requirement to describe in its  State Plan effective program-integrity control activities, which includes  fraud-fighting activities. OCC officials further told us that OCC does not  collect the same set of information or evidence across the country.  Rather, OCC collects state-specific information based on what each  individual state proposes. For example, the Compliance Demonstration  Packet allows states to propose an approach for demonstrating their  compliance with the requirement to describe in their State Plans effective  internal controls that are in place to ensure integrity and accountability.", "OCC officials said the primary purpose of the Monitoring System is to  ensure that states are in compliance with CCDF regulations and  implementing the State Plans as approved, rather than to make an  assessment of the efficacy of the State Plans. When we asked OCC  officials how they determine whether a state has provided appropriate  and adequate documentation for the purposes of the Monitoring System,  these officials told us that staff develop specific questions for each state  and look for evidence showing that states are implementing the State  Plans as approved. For example, OCC officials might look for evidence of  a state\u2019s implementation of certain program-integrity activities described  in its approved State Plan to verify that the activities described are in  place. OCC officials also stated that staff decide what is acceptable  through consensus and attempt to build consistency through internal  discussions regarding the appropriateness of the material that states  provide. However, there are no specific criteria to guide OCC staff\u2019s  assessment of the effectiveness of states\u2019 program-integrity activities  during these discussions. For example, there are no specific criteria to  help OCC staff assess whether states\u2019 implemented control activities are  effective at identifying areas of risk. OCC officials stated that the CCDF  regulations and the approved State Plans are the most-detailed criteria  that they use to assess data collected for the Monitoring System.  However, neither the CCDF regulations nor the State Plans include  specific criteria for assessing whether the control activities are effective.", "OCC is responsible for monitoring states\u2019 compliance with the CCDF  regulations, and these regulations explicitly require that states describe in  their State Plans \u201ceffective internal controls that are in place to ensure  integrity and accountability.\u201d According to Standards for Internal Control  in the Federal Government, an effective internal control system has a  monitoring component that is effectively designed, implemented, and  operating. Additionally, a leading practice of the Fraud Risk Framework is  to examine the suitability of existing fraud controls. Managers who  effectively implement an antifraud strategy monitor and evaluate the  effectiveness of preventive activities in this strategy and take steps to  help ensure external parties with responsibility over fraud control activities  effectively implement those activities. Without developing and using  criteria to assess whether states\u2019 program-integrity control activities are  effective, OCC cannot ensure that states\u2019 internal controls for program  integrity are effective. Likewise, without examining the suitability of, and  monitoring the effectiveness of, the states\u2019 fraud control activities, OCC  will be challenged in effectively implementing an antifraud strategy to  minimize the risk of fraud in the CCDF program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OCC Has Developed Technical Assistance to Improve Program Integrity and Has Further Opportunities to Use These Tools to Monitor States\u2019 Program-Integrity Activities", "paragraphs": ["OCC developed the Grantee Internal Controls Self-Assessment  Instrument (Self-Assessment Instrument) in 2010 and makes the  technical-assistance tool available to the states through its website.

The Self-Assessment  Instrument contains five sections: (1) Eligibility Determination and  Review; (2) Improper Payment Case Review Process; (3) Fraud and  Overpayment Prevention, Detection, and Recovery; (4) Federal  Reporting; and (5) Audits and Monitoring. According to OCC officials, as  of August 2019, 19 states have completed the Self-Assessment  Instrument since its inception.", "OCC officials stated that use of the Self-Assessment Instrument is based  entirely on states\u2019 self-identified risks, and states are free to choose  which, if any, of the sections to complete. OCC officials have noted  benefits as a result of states completing the Self-Assessment Instrument.  Specifically, OCC officials said that states have improved their  implementation processes and policies, and improper-payment error rates  have decreased. In addition to making the tool available to states, OCC  officials told us that OCC also provides technical assistance in completing  the Self-Assessment Instrument, which may include an on-site facilitated  discussion. The facilitated discussion may cover areas including control  activities to identify and prevent fraud, and strategies to investigate and  collect improper payments. Following the on-site facilitated discussion, an  OCC contractor compiles a report summarizing state-identified issues to  address in states\u2019 policies and procedures, according to one OCC official.", "However, OCC officials told us that states are not required to act on this  report.", "In addition to the Self-Assessment Instrument, OCC has recently  coordinated on the development of the Fraud Toolkit, which is a series of  electronic spreadsheets that states can use to respond to questions about  their fraud risk management activities\u2014such as staff training, procedures  for addressing suspected fraud, and program administration. The tools  assign risk levels to these areas based on the state\u2019s responses, and will  also include recommended next steps for each of those areas and  generate a report to summarize overall risk. For example, data from these  tools would indicate whether states\u2019 CCDF program staff are trained to  identify forms, such as wage stubs or employer letters that may have  been forged or altered. The data would also indicate whether the state  has a fraud referral process in place to expedite investigations. OCC  makes the Fraud Toolkit available for states to use upon request.

OCC officials also  told us that, to formally collect information from states\u2019 use of such tools,  they would need to seek approval from OMB. OCC officials stated that  OCC\u2019s goal is to develop technical assistance that best meets the needs  of the states, and not to impose additional reporting requirements on the  states. Officials also noted a concern that states could cease to  participate in or accept technical assistance if such assistance is seen as  increasing reporting requirements. However, according to OCC officials,  OCC has not conducted a cost-benefit analysis of collecting such  information.", "Leading practices in the Fraud Risk Framework are to monitor and  evaluate the effectiveness of preventive activities; collect and analyze  data; and adapt activities to improve fraud risk management. Further,  although external parties\u2014in this case, the state lead agencies\u2014may be  responsible for specific fraud control activities, Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government states that management should  establish and operate monitoring activities to monitor the internal control  system and evaluate the results. As part of these standards, management  retains responsibility for monitoring the effectiveness of internal control  over the assigned processes performed by external parties. Management  is responsible for meeting internal control objectives, and may decide how  the entity evaluates the costs versus benefits of various approaches to  implementing an effective internal control system. However, cost alone is  not an acceptable reason to avoid implementing internal controls, and  cost-benefit considerations support management\u2019s ability to effectively  design, implement, and operate an internal control system that balances  the allocation of resources and other factors relevant to achieving the  entity\u2019s objectives. By not evaluating the feasibility of collecting  information from the Self-Assessment Instrument or the Fraud Toolkit\u2014 such as evaluating the feasibility of doing so during its Monitoring System  process\u2014OCC may be missing an opportunity to monitor the  effectiveness of the internal control system to help states adapt control  activities to improve fraud risk management."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "OCC\u2019s Program- Integrity and State- Oversight Activities Are Not Informed by a Fraud Risk Assessment", "paragraphs": ["As described above, OCC has developed several program-integrity  activities that could help assess and manage fraud risk if they were part  of an antifraud strategy.

Furthermore, Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government states that management should  consider the potential for fraud when identifying, analyzing, and  responding to risks. Leading practices for planning fraud risk  assessments include tailoring the fraud risk assessment to the program  and planning to conduct the assessment at regular intervals and when  there are changes to the program or operating environment. The leading  practices also include identifying the tools, methods, and sources for  gathering information about fraud risks and involving relevant  stakeholders in the assessment process. The Fraud Risk Framework also  identifies leading practices for conducting fraud risk assessments and  documenting the program\u2019s fraud risk profile, as illustrated in figure 8.

Specifically, ACF is in the process of developing a Fraud Risk  Assessment template, which will include a program fraud risk profile. The  CCDF will be part of the pilot program for this effort. The Fraud Risk  Assessment template will consider the Fraud Risk Framework as well as  guidance contained in OMB Circular A-123, Management\u2019s Responsibility  for Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control, according to OCC  officials. These officials also stated that ACF will leverage its previously  developed and implemented risk assessments, including the Program  Risk Assessment that was completed for the CCDF between fiscal years  2011 and 2016 as part of the HHS Program Integrity Initiative.", "However, according to ACF, the development of a Fraud Risk  Assessment template is currently on hold due to competing priorities. The  ACF stated the agency expects to resume the process by December  2019, and OCC expects that the draft template will be completed by the  end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.
