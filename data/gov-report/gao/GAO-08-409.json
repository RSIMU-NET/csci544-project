The Army contracted with the Boeing Company as a lead systems integrator (LSI) to define, develop and integrate FCS, including software development. GAO must by law report annually on FCS. This is one of two reports to meet this requirement. It addresses risks facing the development of network and software, the practices being used to manage software, and the timing of key network demonstrations. In conducting our work, GAO has contacted numerous DOD, Army, and contractor offices; reviewed technical documents on software and network development and plans; attended meetings; and spoken to Army and other officials on various aspects of FCS network and software development. GAO also performed detailed work at five FCS software developers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Almost 5 years into the program, it is not yet clear if or when the information network that is at the heart of the FCS concept can be developed, built, and demonstrated by the Army and LSI. Significant management and technical challenges have placed development of the network and software at risk. These risks include, among others, network performance and scalability, immature network architecture, and synchronization of FCS with Joint Tactical Radio System and Warfighter Information Network Tactical programs that have significant technical challenges of their own. Software being developed for the network and platforms is projected to total 95.1 million lines of computer code, almost triple the size since the program began in 2003. FCS's software is about four times larger than the next two largest software-intensive defense programs. Although several disciplined practices are being used to develop FCS's network and software, the program's immaturity and aggressive pace during development have delayed requirements development at the software developer level. For example, software developers for 5 major software packages that GAO reviewed report that high-level requirements provided to them were poorly defined, late, or omitted in the development process. This caused the software developers to do rework or defer functionality out to future builds. In turn, these poor or late requirements had a cascading effect that caused other software development efforts to be delayed. It is unclear when or how it can be demonstrated that the FCS network will work as needed, especially at key program junctures. For example, in 2009, network requirements, including software, may not be adequately defined nor designs completed at the preliminary design review; and at the FCS milestone review later that year, network demonstration is expected to be very limited. The first major FCS network demonstration--the limited user test in 2012--will take place at least a year after the critical design review and only a year before the start of FCS production. That test will seek to identify the impact of the contributions and limitations of the network on the ability to conduct missions. This test will be conducted after the designs have been set for the FCS ground vehicles, which poses risks because the designs depend on the network's performance. A full demonstration of the network with all of its software components will not be demonstrated until at least 2013 when the fully automated battle command system is expected to be ready."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Army\u2019s transformation to a lighter, more agile, better equipped, and  more lethal and survivable combat force\u2014the Future Combat System  (FCS) program, which comprises 14 integrated weapon systems\u2014depends  on successfully developing an advanced information network that links  people, platforms, weapons, and sensors together. The FCS program is  considered by the Army to be the greatest technology and integration  challenge that they have ever undertaken and the network may be the  most important element of FCS.

If the FCS network works  as intended, all commanders in the BCT and throughout areas of  operations will have a common set of data that will allow for the  synchronization of many BCT activities including the integration of fire  and maneuver, intelligence collection, fusion, and dissemination, and  sustainment of the force.

The survival  and combat effectiveness of FCS BCTs are critically dependent on the  ability to see first, understand first, act first, and finish decisively. Through  an advanced information network, the concept is to replace mass with  superior information that will allow soldiers to see and hit the enemy first  rather than to rely on heavy armor to withstand a hit. This new way of  fighting solely depends on developing an information network that can  successfully link the people, platforms, weapons, and sensors seamlessly  together in a system of systems. This new way of fighting can be achieved  only if the data can be made available in near real-time at sensor  processors, at the battle command nodes, and at lethal systems. For  example, FCS\u2019s survivability depends on the brigade-wide availability of  the network-based situational awareness plus the inherent survivability of  the FCS platforms."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FCS Network Elements", "paragraphs": ["Elements of the FCS information network will include the software and  technology (applications, computers, and radios) that will link the people,  platforms, weapons, and sensors together. These elements are expected to  provide delivery of voice, data, video, still images, and network control  services wirelessly over a mobile ad hoc network. In contrast to  traditional wireless systems such as cellular phones that connect to a fixed  station or permanent access point, FCS\u2019s ad hoc network will not have  access to such an infrastructure. Thus, the quality of service\u2014the  capability to transport information across the network while satisfying  communication performance requirements such as low delay, low loss, or  high throughput\u2014becomes critically important and challenging due to  limited available bandwidth.

These elements include:  Sensors. Sensors are the hardware and software that will provide FCS  with the ability to \u201csee first\u201d and achieve situational awareness and  understanding of the battlefield. These sensors will include such  functions as search and detection of enemy fire, personnel, munitions,  minefields, and terrain. The intelligence, surveillance and  reconnaissance sensors will be integrated onto all manned and  unmanned ground vehicles and aerial platforms, and will be capable of  accomplishing a variety of missions that include, among others,  surveillance over wide areas and target detection, enabling survivability.  The unmanned aerial vehicles will be able to maneuver to an area of  attack and the on-board sensors will provide surveillance of targets and  terrain, among other functions. There are two types of unattended  ground sensor systems that FCS will use\u2014the tactical unattended  ground sensors will provide intelligence, surveillance, and  reconnaissance awareness to the BCTs, while urban unattended ground  sensors will support clearing operations in confined spaces or urban  chokepoints. According to the Army, complex data processing, filtering,  aided target recognition, and fusion will be supported by software to  provide warfighters with vital information. For example, the sensor data  management software will organize the sensor data and track the  information received from sensors. Figure 1 shows some types of FCS  sensors.", "Software. Software is expected to control about 95 percent of FCS\u2019s  functionality and will be included in all FCS platforms.

It includes:  (1) system software such as operating systems, which interface with  hardware to provide the necessary services for application software; (2)  middleware, which controls and coordinates distributed systems; and (3)  application software such as word processors, which perform  productive tasks for users. Overall development of FCS software is being  managed by the LSI in cooperation with the Army\u2019s FCS Program Office.  There are over 100 software vendors involved in the development of  software programs for FCS, including the LSI, 14 first-tier contractors,  and other sub-contractors.", "Over 75 percent of software being developed for FCS is to operate the  network. Network software is expected to integrate the collection of  individual systems into a system of systems. This software will include  the System of Systems Common Operating Environment (SOSCOE),  Network Management System, Battle Command and Mission Execution,  Sensor Data Management, Warfighter Machine Interface, and others.  These will be included on all the FCS platforms and will perform a  variety of functions. For example, software on platforms is to control the  individual systems, such as radios and air and ground vehicle  communications. SOSCOE is the operating environment that serves as  the middleware between the operating systems and the software  applications, integrating all other FCS software. The Battle Command  software is to provide functions such as mission planning and  preparation, situational understanding, and battle management and  mission execution. Warfighter Machine Interface software is expected to  provide the visual interface of the network to the warfighter. According  to the Army, Warfighter Machine Interface is \u201cthe face of the FCS  network,\u201d which includes the display of services, touch screens, and  buttons. It will provide a visual picture of the battlespace and allows the  ability to collaborate across the forces.

These and other  critical software-intensive technologies are being developed outside of  FCS control\u2014termed complementary programs\u2014and are expected to  interoperate with existing systems and provide additional  communications capability. The JTRS family of software-based radios is  to provide the high-capacity, high-speed information link to vehicles,  weapons, aircraft, sensors, and soldiers, while WIN-T is to provide high  bandwidth connectivity to Army units on the move with higher levels of  command to other forces, and provide the Army\u2019s tactical extension to  the Global Information Grid. Such capabilities include access to maps  and other visual data, communication via voice and video with other  units and levels of command, and the acquisition of information directly  from battlefield sensors. The JTRS family of programs includes the  Ground Mobile Radios that are being developed for vehicles. Smaller  JTRS Handheld, Manpack, and Small Form Factors radios are being  developed that will be carried by soldiers and embedded in several FCS  core systems. Software will be used to control how JTRS radios will  work. For example, JTRS radios will use two software waveforms called  the Wideband Networking Waveform and Soldier Radio Waveform. The  function of the Wideband Networking Waveform software is to provide  communications signals, routing, transport, network management,  quality of service, information assurance, transport, and mobility. The  Soldier Radio Waveform is being developed for JTRS radios\u2014ground  mobile radio, and handheld manpack and small form factors radios\u2014and  will primarily be used for tactical networking by soldiers, unattended  systems, and embedded radios in munitions.

However, in addition to challenges and risks that need to  be addressed, much learning and work remains before the Army and LSI  can mature the network. For example, the Army and LSI are still  determining what network management means in terms of: (1) what is  needed to support each specific mission (radios, routers, satellites,  computers, information assurance devices, and policies); (2) how to  allocate network resources to the mission spectrum; and (3) how to fuse,  process, and present extensive FCS sensor data to appropriate users. They  are also learning how to maintain the network, such as monitoring the  status and performance of the network (hardware faults, network quality  of service, and overall performance); managing the spectrum to ensure  connectivity; avoiding interference; and reconfiguring the network in real- time based on changing network conditions and mission critical traffic.", "To provide managed communication services between the soldiers,  platforms, and sensors to complete military missions successfully, the  Army must decide what information the individual users will need and its  priority, where that information may reside, and how and when to get it to  the user.

For example, the mobile ad hoc network will operate with  lower network capacity and have fewer options for increasing capacity  due to limitations on the amount of radio frequency that is available.  Performance of the ad hoc network is expected to decrease as more radios  or nodes are added and eventually can reach an unacceptable level. That  is, the size of the network may reach a maximum when all fixed capacity is  consumed for routing traffic from other radios or nodes and no capacity is  available for local consumption. In a network of limited capacity,  decisions need to be made on how to control admission to the network,  account for network resources, ensure end-to-end services basis, and do  so in a mobile ad hoc network environment with varying routes and link  capacities. As a result, the Army and LSI are working on how best to  allocate functions throughout the FCS system of systems.", "Further, unlike common wireless systems that have access to the  Internet\u2014such as cellular and wireless networking protocols where every  node is connected directly to the network by a single local wireless link\u2014 the FCS information network will change dynamically as the mobile nodes  are expected to be able to communicate with each other, while on the  move. In the FCS information network, most network nodes will not have  local access to the network. Thus, each radio must also be a router,  meaning that it is responsible for passing traffic (voice, data, and video)  from other radios as well as traffic local to the radio.

There is a high  likelihood that the FCS network performance will be affected because  ad hoc networks have limited scalability, and performance decreases  as more radios are added.", "End-to-end quality of service on mobile ad hoc networks. The  probability is high that the FCS network will not be able to ensure that  the information with the highest value is delivered on time to the  intended recipients.

For example, SLOC estimates increased by 31.3  million lines of computer code, or about 50 percent, while ESLOC  estimates increased by 2.5 million lines of computer code, or about 15  percent. Army officials attributed this surge to operating system software  that was greatly underestimated in 2003 when the program began. These  latest estimates now include operating system software that will be used  on the integrated computer system.", "While the Army and LSI have completed the first software build\u2014and  were close to completing the second of five total software builds at the  time of our review\u2014each build required more \u201cactual\u201d software coding  than was originally estimated, further indicating that efforts on what it will  take to develop and integrate software may be more than planned. For  example, the ESLOCs for Build \u201c0\u201d increased 6 percent from an estimated  0.96 million to 1.02 million actual source lines of computer code.

However, experiences of other organizations that  develop software-intensive systems suggest otherwise, according to  leading experts who conducted extensive research of over 20,000 software  development projects spanning 18 years. For example, poor size  estimation is one of the main reasons that major software-intensive  acquisition programs ultimately fail. In fact, the defense industry, private  sector, and academia note that software size is a critical factor in  determining cost, schedule, and effort, and failure to accurately predict  software size results in cost overruns and late deliveries. According to  guidance made available by the Software Technology Support Center at  Hill Air Force Base for defense organizations that develop software,  deviations in software size data indicate problems with  faulty software productivity estimates;  requirements stability, design, coding, and process;    unrealistic interpretation of original requirements and resource  estimates; and  rationale used to develop the estimates.", "A contributing factor for the Army and LSI\u2019s inaccurate software sizing  estimates is that system-level requirements have not been fully defined,  which makes it difficult to determine what will be needed in terms of  software.

Despite not fully  understanding those high-level requirements, the Army proceeded with  efforts to develop software for FCS. To date, estimating accuracy  continues to be hampered by evolving requirements, immature  architecture, and insufficient time to thoroughly analyze software  subsystems sizing. The difficulties associated with accurate software  estimating is an indication that complexity increases as the design is better  understood and this serves to increase the level of effort.

Life  cycle architecture anchor point reviews (or preliminary design reviews)  demonstrate the feasibility of implementing the planned functionality for  the software item(s) for a given build within the planned architecture,  requirements, cost, and schedule. Successful completion of a formal test  readiness review will mean that the developer is ready to start software  item formal qualification testing for the applicable software items for a  given build.", "The Army and LSI also use the evolutionary development process, in  which software builds are begun with the understanding that the user need  is not fully understood and all requirements cannot be defined up front. In  this strategy, user needs and system requirements are partially defined up  front and then refined in each succeeding build. The way in which all 52  software packages are being developed at the same time has been called  concurrent engineering, which has pros and cons. A pro is that the  concurrent development aims to keep the program as a whole on  schedule. But software developers reported that when requirements are  late or ambiguous, the concurrent engineering approach has a negative  cascading effect as all of the software efforts are interrelated.", "The Army and LSI are also using modeling and simulation, which takes  place in System Integration Labs, and in Huntington Beach, California, at  the System of Systems Integration Lab (SoSIL). Since integration and  interoperability will be the major challenge in building the FCS, the SoSIL  is intended to provide a distributed capability to develop and integrate not  only the software but also early hardware and system prototypes to assess  and ultimately verify the integration and interoperability of the FCS system  of systems and also give program management critical feedback from the  user."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Stable Requirements Has Disrupted Implementation of Good Software Practices", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of the LSI\u2019s software practices and the effect they are having  on five subcontracted software developers revealed key problem areas  that may be indicators of broader software development problems. We  focused mainly on the following areas: Agreement Management,  Acquisition Requirements Development, Project Monitoring and Control,  Project Planning, and Requirements Management. Of these areas,  Requirements Management was found to be the cause of most problems,  indicating that a key practice for managing and developing requirements  has not been effectively implemented for the five software packages  reviewed. In practice, phases within a build are becoming concurrent, and  the completion of one build is overlapping the start of the next build.", "Software developers stated that additional time, cost, and deferred  functionality were the most common results of poorly defined, late, or  unstable requirements.", "The continuing evolution of FCS system-level requirements, including that  caused by Army decisions on what it can afford to develop, and the  aggressive pace of the program, are causing disruptions at the software  developer level. In an effort to control overall FCS development costs, the  Army is reviewing many areas of FCS development, including software, to  potentially eliminate areas that are not absolutely essential or critical.  Whereas it is a good practice to eliminate these non-essential areas, the  drawback is that this causes change in requirements, thereby directly  impacting the design and writing of software code. According to LSI  officials, changes at the Operational Requirements Document level are not  major or frequent, and requirements at that level have actually decreased.  Even so, requirements growth and changes are occurring at the system  level, which has a cascading effect on the detailed requirements all the  way down to the software developer level. The growth results in  requirements provided to software developers that are poorly defined,  late, or unstable.", "For example, developers at iRobot told us they received poorly defined  requirements which specified that the small unmanned ground vehicle  have a fire extinguisher onboard and be able to withstand direct lightning  strikes. Since the small unmanned ground vehicle is a small man-packable  robot, these requirements were not practical, but the Army and LSI failed  to realize the fundamental differences between this small robot and its  other unmanned ground vehicles such as the Multifunction  Utility/Logistics Equipment vehicle, which is a 2-1/2 ton vehicle, compared  to the small unmanned ground vehicle, which weighs less than 30 pounds.  The developer of Battle Command and Mission Execution told us that  additional requirements were received after the life cycle architecture  review, which is considered late in development. The SOSCOE developers  also told us they received late requirements for build 1.8, which caused  problems for many other software developers since the late requirements  caused them to deliver build 1.8 late and with missing functionality that  many developers had expected and were counting on for their own work  packages. SOSCOE developers stated that this happened because of  misaligned schedules from the top down, and indicated that they too had  experienced problems with requirements. Unstable requirements have also  been a problem for developers of the Network Management Systems who  reported requirements that changed have caused rework in many cases.", "Table 2 summarizes problems experienced by the software developers we  visited.", "As shown in table 2, four of the five software developers (and SOSCOE)  that we met with report that the problems with requirements have resulted  in functionality being deferred to future builds, or waived altogether, for  the sake of keeping to the existing schedule. Deferring work into the  future means that the associated software code writing and testing will  take place later than planned, meaning that more code will be written later  and the associated functionality will not be testable until later. These  events help partially explain the growth of software estimates already  recorded for the early builds. Furthermore, this indicates that less  functionality than planned has been delivered and that software estimates  will only grow larger in future builds. Overall, software developers told us  that these problems could have been avoided if they had been allowed  sufficient time to understand and analyze the requirements. This is why  the aggressive pace of the program presents such a problem for the  development effort. The current FCS practice is to overlap builds more  than the traditional spiral model does, as is seen in figure 6.", "Before the testing phase is complete on one build, the requirements phase  of the next build will start. Program officials told us that the purpose of  this is to set requirements so that the next build is ready for design by the  time the former build has completed testing. In practice, however, this has  been an issue because software developers report that evolving  requirements have caused them to interpret and implement changes in  requirements well into the design and code phases, compromising the  amount of time allotted for testing. This is not to say that the requirements  should have been defined more quickly; the state of requirements  accurately reflects the maturity of the FCS program. Rather, it is the  relative immaturity of the program, coupled with its aggressive pace, that  amplify requirements instability, the pronounced overlap of the FCS builds  and the cascading effect on software developers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Uncertainty about Network Development and Demonstration Present Challenges for Decisionmakers at Key Program Events", "paragraphs": ["It is unclear if network requirements, including software to be developed,  will be adequately defined and designs completed at the preliminary  design review scheduled for February 2009.

While modeling and simulation is a cost  effective approach for proving out technological advances incrementally,  this approach has limitations in predicting the performance of first-of-kind  systems. For example, commercial firms in the past have learned that  modeling and simulation is very reliable for predicting the performance of  products that are evolutionary advances over existing products, for which  there is a large base of experience to draw from. However, it is generally  understood that without sufficient data on past behavior and a better  understanding of assumptions, the results of modeling and simulation may  not entirely reflect the workings of the new or advanced systems. A  number of limited demonstrations have been scheduled within the FCS  system development and demonstration phase to help move the Army  toward a network-centric environment. To date, only basic network  concepts, such as connecting and exchanging information among limited  network nodes have been demonstrated (Experiment 1.1). The Army plans  to demonstrate some network functions, such as linkage with remote  sensors, during the spinout demonstration in 2008. Other demonstrations  are scheduled in 2010 and 2012.

For example, the Army plans  to demonstrate, among other basic things, sensor control, terrain analysis,  and unmanned platform planning and operations in 2008. As mentioned  earlier, network design and maturity are in the early stages as the Army  and LSI are still determining what network management means in terms of  what is needed to support each specific mission, how to allocate network  resources to the mission spectrum, how to fuse, process, and present  extensive FCS sensor data to appropriate users, and how to maintain the  network. The Army is still in the midst of stabilizing the network and  software requirements, and hardware and software designs are still  maturing.

By then,  billions will have been spent and it may be too late to fix any network  problems revealed in this significant test before production begins. At  critical design review in 2011, the Army expects that the FCS network  capabilities will be completed on the manned platform planning and  operations. In section 211 of the recently enacted National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, Congress directed that a network  demonstration be conducted prior to obligation of funds for low-rate  initial production (Milestone C) or full-rate production of FCS manned  ground vehicles. One of the key objectives of that test will be to use FCS  prototypes to identify the contributions and limitations of the network on  the ability of the FCS brigade combat team to conduct missions across the  full spectrum of operations.

There are a number of FCS systems  or platforms, such as manned ground vehicles, that are scheduled to have  their critical design reviews in fiscal years 2009-2010, about 2 years before  the first major demonstration of the network in fiscal year 2012. For  manned ground vehicles, most developmental prototypes will be in testing  and the Army will have begun preparation for low-rate initial production  for these platforms before the network is demonstrated. This is a  significant risk as the software, which supports the information network,  is critical to the design and performance of the platforms and is expected  to control about 95 percent of FCS\u2019s functionality.

The Army and the LSI  have focused a great amount of attention on the network and software,  evidenced by the sound development practices they have attempted to put  in place. However, network and software requirements are not yet stable  at the system level and below, which has caused rework and deferred  functionality. Such instability may be expected given the relative  immaturity of FCS, but the program is halfway through development and  the remaining schedule is very ambitious; program decisions have been  and will continue to be made in advance of acquisition knowledge.  Demonstrations to date have been small and not sufficient\u2014nor  intended\u2014to prove the network\u2019s performance. Large-scale  demonstrations of the network\u2019s ability to deliver the quality of service  essential to the FCS fighting concept will not come until 2012, the year  before the low-rate initial production decision, assuming the remainder of  development goes as planned. Even if this date is met, it will trail the  critical design reviews of the individual FCS systems by 2 years. This is  disquieting because the designs of the systems\u2014including the manned  ground vehicles\u2014depend on the quality of service delivered by the  network. Finally, the overall magnitude of the FCS software effort has  nearly tripled to 95 million lines of code. This growth gives credence to the  higher cost estimates put forth by the Cost Analysis Improvement Group  and the Institute for Defense Analysis\u2014both of which concluded that the  FCS software effort would be more extensive than the Army envisioned.", "For these reasons, it is essential that the software and network efforts be  held to meeting clear performance criteria at key junctures that are linked  to the network\u2019s needed quality of service. These junctures include the  2009 milestone review, the 2009-2010 vehicle critical design reviews, the  2011 FCS critical design review, and the 2012 network demonstration.  Allowing demonstrations or network functions to be deferred past these  junctures on the basis that modeling and simulation results are promising  will not suffice. Given the difficulty of predicting performance in full-scale  operations, testing must be the primary basis for judging the sufficiency of  progress. Because the performance of the network and the success of the  software effort are not assured, decision makers should allow for the  possibility that full success will not be achieved.
