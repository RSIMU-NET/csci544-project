In 2009, the Acting Director of NIH testified that each extramural grant awarded with Recovery Act funding had the potential of supporting employment--full- or part-time scientific jobs--in addition to other impacts, such as contributing to advances in improving public health. GAO was asked to examine the use of Recovery Act funds by NIH grantees. Specifically, GAO addresses the information available from NIH and its grantees about the extent to which NIH Recovery Act funding (1) supported jobs, and (2) had other impacts. To obtain information on job impacts, GAO reviewed a database containing information NIH Recovery Act grantees reported to the national data collection system and interviewed NIH officials. To obtain more specific jobs information about individual grants, GAO administered a Web-based data collection instrument to 50 selected principal investigators who direct research at grantee institutions--10 principal investigators at each of five selected grantee institutions. The selected principal investigators had generally received awards of $500,000 or more. To obtain information on other Recovery Act impacts, GAO used information from the data collection instrument and interviewed NIH officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Data reported by all of NIH's Recovery Act grantee institutions to the national data collection system at www.federalreporting.gov and available to NIH indicate that the number of full-time equivalent (FTEs) jobs supported by NIH Recovery Act funds increased from December 2009 through September 2010, and then remained steady from December 2010 through June 2011--the most recent quarter for which data are available. The number of FTEs supported by NIH Recovery Act funds increased from about 12,000 in the reporting quarter ending December 2009 to about 21,000 in the quarter ending in June 2011. The 50 selected principal investigators who direct research at the grantee institutions in GAO's review provided additional information explaining how the Recovery Act funding supported FTEs. Nearly one-third of the selected principal investigators reported that the NIH Recovery Act funding they received supported new positions, and about half of the principal investigators reported that the funding they received allowed them to avoid reductions in jobs or avoid a reduction in the number of hours worked by current employees. The selected principal investigators also reported that the Recovery Act funding they received primarily supported scientists and other faculty. NIH officials we interviewed reported that they receive some information from principal investigators about the other impacts of NIH-funded research, such as preliminary research results included in annual progress reports. NIH is also participating in the Star Metrics program--a multiagency venture to monitor the scientific, social, and economic impacts of federally funded science--which NIH officials expect could provide more information about these impacts. While Star Metrics is currently developing an approach to capture information about the other impacts of NIH grant funding, there is no expected completion date for reporting this information. In response to GAO's data collection instrument, selected principal investigators who direct research at the grantee institutions in GAO's review reported that the use of Recovery Act funds resulted in purchases of research supplies, equipment, laboratory testing services, and scientific training of health care professionals. The majority of the 50 selected principal investigators in GAO's review also reported preliminary results from their Recovery Act-funded research that could contribute to future scientific developments in prevention and early detection of disease, improvements in medical therapies, and improved research capabilities. The principal investigators in GAO's review and NIH officials GAO interviewed reported that they track the scientific impact of NIH research--including the impact of research funded through the Recovery Act--primarily through peer-reviewed publications, but also through other metrics such as the filing and approval of patent applications. According to NIH officials, when a sufficiently large body of research results has accumulated, NIH plans to prepare reports--similar to its existing publicly available Investment Reports--that will highlight the impact of its Recovery Act-funded research. The Department of Health and Human Services provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act)  was enacted to, among other things, support job creation and  preservation, infrastructure investment, energy efficiency, and scientific  research. The act included $8.2 billion in funding for the National  Institutes of Health (NIH) to be used to support additional scientific  research, including extramural grants at universities, medical schools,  and other research institutions. The act required that Recovery Act funds  be obligated by NIH in fiscal years 2009 and 2010.", "In March 2009, the Acting Director of NIH testified on the potential  employment, economic, as well as scientific benefits of the Recovery Act  funding NIH received. Specifically the Acting Director testified that each  research grant awarded with Recovery Act funding has the potential of  supporting several full- or part-time scientific jobs. During testimony, the  Acting Director also pointed out that the extramural grants made with  Recovery Act funding could have other impacts, such as contributing to  advances in improving public health.", "Universities or other research institutions that receive grant funding from  NIH could directly support employment in a number of ways, including  increasing the number of hours worked by existing part-time employees  or hiring new full- or part-time employees who may work on research  projects supported by one or more NIH grant awards. Recovery Act  funding\u2014including NIH Recovery Act funding\u2014could also indirectly  support jobs, such as if vendors that supply research equipment and  services increased their employees due to increased business from  research institutions. Any direct or indirect support of jobs could also lead  to induced effects on other jobs, such as when employees make  purchases at local businesses. However, past GAO reports have found  that it is difficult to measure the indirect and induced impacts of Recovery  Act funding, in part because the information needed to measure these  impacts is often not available. Recipients of Recovery Act funding are  only required to report on jobs directly supported by Recovery Act funds.  These reports do not include the employment impact on materials  suppliers (indirect jobs) or on the local community (induced jobs).", "To measure direct support of jobs, the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) requires recipients of Recovery Act funds\u2014including NIH  Recovery Act grantees\u2014to report on the number of jobs supported using  these funds to a nationwide data collection system at  www.federalreporting.gov. Guidance provided by OMB provides more  detail on this requirement, including that recipients report on the number  of full-time-equivalent (FTE) jobs that were directly funded by the  Recovery Act during each quarter. OMB\u2019s guidance also directs  recipients of Recovery Act funding to report on the results of funded  projects as well as provide narrative descriptions of the types of jobs  funded by the Recovery Act, which provide information that the number of  FTEs does not capture. Federal agencies, such as NIH, and recipients,  such as NIH Recovery Act grantees, may also have additional information  on the other impacts of Recovery Act funding\u2014that may include scientific  impacts, impacts in the local community, and impacts on NIH Recovery  Act grantees.

In  addition, the calculation of FTEs may reflect full-time and/or multiple part- time jobs, therefore FTEs cannot be used to determine the total number  of individual jobs.

We asked the grantee institution and principal investigators to  identify other impacts such as scientific impacts, impacts in the local  community, and impacts on the grantee institution and principal  investigators. We also asked NIH and principal investigators to identify  the metrics they use to measure and track these other impacts. We  contacted the State Recovery Act representative in two of the states in  which our selected universities are located (North Carolina and  Pennsylvania) to identify information on the other impacts of NIH  Recovery Act funding in their jurisdictions. Finally, we reviewed relevant  NIH Recovery Act grant guidance as well as OMB\u2019s Recovery Act  guidance to identify Recovery Act grantee requirements for reporting  information on FTEs and on the impacts of the Recovery Act grants to  NIH and the nationwide data collection system at  www.federalreporting.gov."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Analysis of Information Reported by Selected Principal Investigators on Jobs Supported by Recovery Act Funding", "paragraphs": ["We disseminated a Web-based data collection instrument (DCI) to a total  of 50 selected principal investigators (10 principal investigators at each of  five selected grantee institutions).
