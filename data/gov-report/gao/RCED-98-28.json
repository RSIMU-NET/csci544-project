Although emissions controls for visibility impairment were not required when the coal-fired power plant became fully operational in 1976, subsequent amendments to the Clean Air Act require such controls if a source is found to be causing or contributing to visibility impairment in certain national parks and wilderness areas, including the Grand Canyon National Park. Accordingly, in February 1991, EPA initially proposed a rule requiring the Navajo Generating Station to reduce its sulfur dioxide emissions by approximately 70 percent. Subsequently, in October 1991, partially on the basis of a negotiated agreement between the plant\u2019s owners and environmental groups, EPA issued a final rule that required an emissions reduction of approximately 90 percent. A project to install emission control equipment is under way, and, according to the plant operators, the project is on schedule. The first of three emission control units has been placed in service. On October 10, 1997, the plant operators notified EPA that the first emission control unit was operational and would comply with the approximately 90 percent emissions reduction beginning November 19, 1997, as required by the final rule. The overall project is scheduled to be completed by 1999.", "Concerned about the benefits and costs of installing sulfur dioxide controls at the power plant, you asked us to review EPA\u2019s decision to limit emissions.

Contingent valuation is a methodology that relies on surveys to elicit information from consumers to estimate how much they would be willing to pay for something, including non-use values.

In addition to the four options, EPA also solicited comments on any other appropriate alternative to limit sulfur dioxide emissions, such as controls used only on a seasonal basis. EPA\u2019s proposed 70-percent emissions limit was the same as the standard the agency used at the time for new facilities. EPA estimated that a 70-percent emissions reduction would eliminate about 50,000 tons of sulfur from the power plant\u2019s emissions annually and that the cost would range from $91.9 million to $128.3 million."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Negotiated Agreement Could Lead to Higher Emissions Reductions at Less Cost", "paragraphs": ["Following EPA\u2019s initial proposal, representatives of the plant owners and environmental groups (Grand Canyon Trust and Environmental Defense Fund) met, at the recommendation of EPA, to discuss the most cost-effective control option. This led EPA, in early 1991, to facilitate discussions between these representatives to find a mutually acceptable control option. According to EPA, its participation included assisting in drafting documents to support a potential agreement between the parties and providing technical assistance. These parties met repeatedly during a 3-month period to discuss control options and their related costs in an attempt to clarify all options and their costs. As a result of these discussions, the parties reached a negotiated agreement to, among other things, reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from the power plant by 90 percent. According to EPA, its final decision, issued in October 1991, substantially adopted the terms of this agreement.", "The agreement specified the time frames in which the emission control technology should become operational and also the manner in which it is to be operated. The agreement specified that the three primary pieces of equipment (\u201cscrubber\u201d modules) should become operational over a 3-year period\u2014the first unit by November 1997, the second by November 1998, and the third by August 1999. The emissions from all three units will be subject to a 90-percent emissions reduction that will be averaged on a 365-day plant operation basis to determine compliance. The agreement also specified that the maintenance schedule for the plant would shift so that some planned maintenance would occur in the winter, thereby shutting down some of the plant\u2019s equipment and further reducing wintertime sulfur dioxide emissions.", "According to Salt River Project officials, two factors account for the lower expected project costs. First, the agreement allows the power plant to determine its compliance with EPA\u2019s emissions limit on an annual rather than a monthly rolling average basis as was initially proposed. Determining compliance on an annual basis is a less stringent requirement (than determining compliance on a monthly basis) because it gives the plant more days over which it can average the short-term increases in emissions that would occur when one of the scrubbers is malfunctioning or being repaired. As such, the plant operators can still comply with EPA\u2019s emissions limit without installing the expensive backup equipment they would have to otherwise operate on days when the primary equipment is not operating. According to a project engineer for the Salt River Project, with its compliance determined on an annual basis, the plant can operate its emission control equipment most days at a rate greater than that needed to cut emissions by 90 percent to make up for those days on which emissions are not controlled because the equipment is not operating.", "Second, the agreement delays the initial installation of emission control equipment by almost 3 years, from January 1995 to November 1997, which allows the plant operators to complete the project in a more cost-effective manner. According to the plant operators, the additional time allows them to, among other things, better plan the engineering. That is, the operators have had more time to study emission control technologies and select what they consider to be the best technology at the lowest cost. Salt River Project officials also told us that staging construction over a longer period would allow them to reduce labor costs as compared to those with an accelerated construction schedule.", "Despite this almost 3-year delay, EPA concluded that the terms of the final rule would result in greater visibility improvement than the proposed rule.

EPA initially estimated an approximately 14 percent improvement primarily on the basis of a study by the National Park Service, although the agency revised its estimate to approximately 7 percent to reflect the results of other analyses and studies. EPA noted that its revised estimate may be understated because it does not take into account other visibility improvements (1) below the rim of the Grand Canyon, (2) in seasons other than winter at the Grand Canyon, and (3) year round at other nearby national parks. Appendix II provides additional details on studies of visibility impairment in and around the Grand Canyon."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Visibility Improvement Estimates Were Based on Several Studies", "paragraphs": ["EPA\u2019s initial estimate of an approximately 14 percent visibility improvement relied primarily on data from a Park Service study\u2014the National Park Service Report on the Winter Haze Intensive Tracer Experiment (WHITEX)\u2014of visibility impairment in the vicinity of the Grand Canyon. The study was designed to evaluate a variety of modeling approaches to attribute visibility impairment from a single source\u2014NGS. Specifically, various models were to be evaluated for their ability to link NGS\u2019 emissions to winter visibility impairment at the Grand Canyon and other nearby national parks. In conducting this study, researchers released a traceable chemical from NGS\u2019 smokestack and tracked its movement to monitoring stations in the region, including at the Grand Canyon. The study concluded that NGS contributes approximately 40 percent on average to wintertime visibility impairment in the canyon and approximately 60 to 70 percent during the winter weather conditions when NGS has the most severe effect.", "After considering information received following its proposed rule, EPA revised its estimate of the winter seasonal average visibility improvement to approximately 7 percent. This estimate translates into an increase in the average visual range from about 124 miles to about 133 miles. In revising its estimate, EPA relied on the WHITEX study, air monitoring information, and a visibility study conducted by the plant owners.", "EPA estimated that the largest improvements from reducing emissions from NGS would occur during certain winter weather conditions. These conditions are, according to EPA officials, (1) high relative humidity, which facilitates the conversion of the plant\u2019s gaseous sulfur dioxide emissions to visibility-impairing sulfate particles, and (2) wind patterns that transport the emissions to the Grand Canyon. EPA estimated that these conditions occur between 10 and 15 times per winter, lasting from 3 to 5 days each occurrence.", "However, a Park Service official who was a principal investigator on the WHITEX study told us that the effect of emissions from NGS on impaired visibility at the Grand Canyon during these episodes can be mitigated by local weather patterns. The official explained that, due in part to local weather conditions, the most severe effects occur approximately two to three times per winter, lasting from 5 to 7 days each time. This official explained that visibility can be impaired during these winter weather conditions because of both naturally occurring impairment\u2014mist, fog, clouds\u2014and man-made sources, primarily NGS. However, the official noted that photographic and air monitoring data show that the impairment from man-made sources can continue for several days after the naturally occurring conditions have dissipated. In addition, the evidence also indicates that impairment from man-made sources is perceptible even on some days that include natural impairment.", "In addition to improvements during certain winter weather conditions, EPA also estimated visibility improvements on other winter days. These estimated improvements were measured in terms of \u201cchanges in contrast,\u201d which, like visual range, is another method of measuring visibility improvements. EPA defined \u201ccontrast\u201d as the percentage difference between the brightness of a scenic element and its background. Using this method, EPA estimated that reducing NGS\u2019 sulfur dioxide emissions by 90 percent could result in at least a \u201cperceptible\u201d change in visibility conditions (defined as a 4-percent change in contrast) on approximately 100 days during the winter. EPA later dropped these estimates due to an error in the calculations. The plant owners attempted to correct this error and estimated 54 days of at least a perceptible change. Later, using the results of their own visibility study, the owners reduced this estimate to 6 days.", "EPA also relied on other studies and analyses in calculating the degree of visibility improvement that could result from reducing NGS\u2019 sulfur dioxide emissions. These studies included a review of the WHITEX study by a committee established by the National Academy of Sciences\u2019 National Research Council and a separate visibility study conducted by the plant owners. After reviewing the techniques and data used in the WHITEX study, the committee concluded that, on some days during the study period, NGS contributes significantly to visibility impairment in the Grand Canyon. However, the committee also concluded that the WHITEX study was not sufficient to make a quantitative determination of the exact fraction of visibility impairment at the Grand Canyon that is attributable to NGS. The power plant owners\u2019 study found a lesser impact on visibility in the canyon. The study estimated that the average wintertime visual range would improve by no more than 2 percent as a result of reducing NGS sulfur dioxide emissions by 90 percent. In reviewing this information, EPA concluded that there was reasonable agreement between the plant owners\u2019 study and the WHITEX study. EPA noted that the major difference is that the WHITEX study led to the conclusion that peak impairment conditions occur more frequently and that nonpeak impairment conditions are greater than zero more often than found during the plant owners\u2019 study."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA Believes Visibility Benefits May Be More Than the 7 Percent Estimated", "paragraphs": ["EPA identified additional benefits from reducing sulfur dioxide emissions by 90 percent that suggest there may be more than a 7-percent improvement in the winter seasonal average visibility. These benefits include a greater visibility improvement that would occur below the rim of the Grand Canyon and improvements during seasons other than winter at the Grand Canyon and year round at other nearby national parks. First, EPA\u2019s estimated 7-percent improvement in the winter seasonal average visibility did not reflect the more pronounced improvement expected below the rim of the canyon because the air below the rim may be more affected by NGS\u2019 emissions. The National Research Council committee\u2019s review of the WHITEX study noted that meteorological evidence, still photographs, and time-lapse video suggested that sulfur concentrations (indicative of plant emissions) in the canyon might have been considerably greater than those that were observed at the monitoring station used during the WHITEX study\u2014a monitoring station located at the rim of the canyon. The Park Service subsequently established an air monitoring station within the canyon, and, from its results, EPA found that visibility impairment was worse in the canyon than was measured at the rim of the canyon. EPA said that it did not quantify the additional visibility improvement expected below the rim of the canyon due to the limited amount of data available and a limited understanding of the air movements below the rim.", "Second, EPA\u2019s estimated 7-percent improvement in the winter seasonal average visibility did not reflect benefits in seasons other than winter at the Grand Canyon and throughout the year at other nearby national parks. EPA explained that, on the basis of information received during its public comment period, emissions from NGS may significantly impair visibility year round at the Grand Canyon as well as at other national parks in the region. For example, a study prepared by the Grand Canyon Trust, which modeled emissions from NGS over a 5-year period, indicated visibility impairment at the Grand Canyon in seasons other than winter. Furthermore, the study suggested that the emissions could impair visibility in surrounding national parks between 60 and 80 percent of the time year round. EPA said that the emissions controls, required by the final rule, would significantly reduce if not eliminate NGS\u2019 contribution to visibility impairment in nearby national parks."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "EPA and the Owners Used Contingent Valuation to Estimate the Monetary Value of Visibility Benefits", "paragraphs": ["Both EPA and the plant owners estimated, using contingent valuation, the monetary value of visibility improvements from reducing sulfur dioxide emissions from NGS. EPA estimated annual nationwide values ranging from $90 million to $200 million. The plant owners estimated a nationwide value of $2.3 million. Although relying on the same methodology, the studies were technically different. EPA\u2019s estimate was extracted from existing research because EPA was under a court-ordered deadline to complete the rulemaking. Therefore, it did not have time to conduct original research to estimate the monetary value of visibility improvements at the Grand Canyon National Park. Unlike EPA in its reliance on existing research, the owners specifically designed contingent valuation research to estimate the visibility improvements they expected from emissions controls at the plant. Nonetheless, the owners did not complete their study for several reasons, including time constraints. Instead, they used the pilot study results to estimate an annual nationwide value of the visibility improvements they expected to occur. Neither studies\u2019 results were used as a basis for EPA\u2019s final rule that established an emissions limit because, as a result of the negotiated agreement, project costs dropped below the $100 million threshold requiring such an estimate."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "EPA Estimated the Monetary Value of Visibility Benefits but Did Not Use the Estimates", "paragraphs": ["EPA set out to estimate the monetary value of visibility improvements to comply with the terms of Executive Order 12291. This order provided that, to the extent permitted by law, agencies should not take regulatory action unless the potential benefits to society outweighed the potential costs to society. The order required agencies, including EPA, to prepare a regulatory impact analysis that included a cost-benefit analysis. Agencies were to do this for proposed rules that, among other things, were likely to result in an annual effect on the economy of at least $100 million. In such cases, an agency\u2019s analysis was required to describe the benefits\u2014expressed in monetary terms, if possible\u2014as well as potential costs. If the analysis did not show that benefits exceeded costs, the agency was to explain any legal reasons why the regulation should still be promulgated.", "When EPA first proposed the rule requiring emissions controls at NGS, it believed that the cost-benefit analysis was required, as the annual cost was thought likely to exceed $100 million (estimates ranged from $91.9 million to $128.3 million). By the time EPA issued its final rule, however, the estimated annual cost\u2014as a result of the negotiated agreement\u2014had decreased to $89.6 million. Accordingly, the Office of Management and Budget exempted EPA from the requirements for a regulatory impact analysis, including a cost-benefit analysis.", "When EPA began the cost-benefit analysis, it was faced with court-ordered deadlines to complete this rulemaking effort. As a result of the deadlines, EPA effectively had less than 6 months to complete its analysis and did not have time to conduct original research to estimate the monetary value of limiting the plant\u2019s emissions. Instead, EPA estimated the value of limiting these emissions by extrapolating from the results of earlier contingent valuation research that sought to value the benefit of reducing air pollution at national parks across the country, including those in the Southwest. EPA in its proposed rule, estimated that the monetary value of visibility improvements would range from $1.30 to $2.50 annually per U.S. household. Later, to reflect the revised estimate of visibility improvement from approximately 14 percent to approximately 7 percent, EPA decreased its annual household value to $0.75 to $1.75. EPA estimated the monetary value, nationwide, would range from $90 million to $200 million in the year 2000.", "The owners also used contingent valuation to estimate the monetary value of visibility improvements in response to EPA\u2019s use of the existing study and monetary value estimate. Unlike EPA in its reliance on existing related research, the owners specifically designed their study to value visibility improvements they expected from emissions controls at the plant. Nonetheless, the owners did not complete their research because they did not see value in doing so and because of time and resource constraints. Therefore, the owners\u2019 estimated value of expected visibility improvements was based on the results of a pilot test of a proposed survey instrument. The owners\u2019 study estimated the national value of visibility benefits to be $2.3 million. This equates to about $0.023 per U.S. household.

However, economists have generally been skeptical of this approach and have historically viewed market-based methods, or so-called \u201crevealed preference\u201d methods in which actual spending decisions can be observed, as inherently superior to \u201cstated preference\u201d methods. Nevertheless, there are many instances in which no behavioral patterns exist through which consumers reveal the values they hold.

That is, the approach attempts to create a market-based choice context for goods without (complete) markets, such as public or quasi-public goods, so that through their choices people will reveal their preferences much as they do when making actual spending decisions.", "Contingent valuation practice developed using theory and practice from different disciplines, especially economics and survey research. A prominent resource economist, Ciriacy-Wantrup, is generally credited with the suggestion of asking people directly for the values they placed on natural resource programs with public good aspects. The first practitioner of what is now known as contingent valuation was Robert K. Davis who used questionnaires as one way to estimate values people placed on recreational experiences in Maine.", "The theory and practice of contingent valuation continued to develop in the 1960s and 1970s, and most of the first applications were to resource and environmental issues. During this period, many contingent valuation studies also examined underlying research issues. Some of this research worked toward grounding contingent valuation within the economic theory of consumer behavior. For example, economic theory includes many well understood theoretical relationships involving a consumer\u2019s utility, income, expenditures, and the conditions under which the concept of willingness to pay is an appropriate measure of underlying value. Also, advances in cognitive psychology contributed to understanding the possible biases in a respondent\u2019s answers that may result from such things as the choice of wording or order of questions. Furthermore, researchers gained practical experience in designing, implementing, and analyzing contingent valuation studies. By the 1990s, researchers had performed hundreds of such studies.", "The federal government sponsored many of these studies, as various federal agencies performed and funded contingent valuation studies and general research on contingent valuation. These included the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Department of the Interior, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). EPA in particular was interested in the analytical potential of contingent valuation in a variety of environmental regulatory contexts in light of Executive Order 12291 (and its successor), which required executive branch agencies to more systematically examine the costs and benefits of certain of their proposed regulations. In EPA\u2019s case, this involved the use of contingent valuation to estimate the benefits associated with various pollution control regulations.", "Although contingent valuation is a methodology that can be used for different purposes, it has become inextricably linked with the measurement of non-use values. Interest in non-use values has been heightened in part because of the possibility that they may be considered in resource damage assessment contexts. The federal government in its role as trustee may include non-use values when calculating damages to be recovered through litigation. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), or Superfund, provided government officials the right to sue on behalf of the public for resource damages resulting from release of hazardous materials. The Congress directed the President, who delegated the responsibility to the Department of the Interior, to develop regulations applicable to resource damage assessment. After a number of groups challenged the regulations, a federal appeals court upheld Interior\u2019s adoption of contingent valuation methodology for assessing damages to natural resources and directed Interior to revise its rule to avoid limiting the role of non-use values or \u201cnon-consumptive\u201d values in the calculation of damages. The grounding of the Exxon Valdez led to the passage of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which required the Department of Commerce, acting through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), to develop regulations governing damage assessment. The Exxon Company USA could be subject to liability under the provisions of the Oil Pollution Act and sponsored research concerning contingent valuation, much of which is critical of the ability of contingent valuation to measure non-use values accurately."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Characteristics of Contingent Valuation Studies", "paragraphs": ["In an overview of contingent valuation practice, a leading resource economist stated that while there is no \u201cstandard approach,\u201d contingent valuation studies typically include three general features. First, a contingent valuation study contains descriptions of the policy or program at issue and the likely environmental effects so that respondents can understand the good they are valuing. Second, a contingent valuation study contains a framework or mechanism for eliciting willingness to pay. Several mechanisms have been used in contingent valuation studies, such as open-ended questions (How much would you be willing to pay?), payment cards (Select an amount from a list of options.), and referendum formats (Would you vote for the described proposal if your taxes increase by $10?). Third, a contingent valuation study may gather information on socioeconomic variables and attitudes about the environment. This information can be used to estimate willingness-to-pay functions using econometric techniques.", "Researchers have developed many methods to implement contingent valuation studies within this broad framework. Additionally, within the context of the method\u2019s development, there have been analytical debates over the merits of particular aspects of contingent valuation practice. The Exxon-sponsored research represented a change in the discussion of contingent valuation issues in that much of this research was carried out by economists and others who were not primarily specialists in natural resource and environmental issues. These researchers raised some new issues and provided new emphasis on other issues on which there had been ongoing analytical debate.", "As part of the process by which it developed its regulations related to oil spill damages, NOAA convened a blue-ribbon advisory panel to address a variety of issues, including the fundamental question of whether the contingent valuation method was capable of providing reliable estimates of non-use values for use in resource damage assessments. The panel\u2019s report stated that contingent valuation \u201ccan produce estimates reliable enough to be the starting point of a judicial process of damage assessment, including lost passive-use (non-use) values.\u201d Although NOAA was concerned with the use of contingent valuation in the damage assessment context, the NOAA guidelines have applicability to the contingent valuation method more generally. We refer to them because we believe that the NOAA panel\u2019s deliberations represent valuable critical and impartial thinking related to improving the use of contingent valuation. The panel listed some guidelines for producing credible studies and noted some strong concerns about the results of some contingent valuation studies that it reviewed. Although its conclusion gave credence to the views of those who favor the use of the contingent valuation method, adherence to the panel\u2019s suggestions would likely require changes in contingent valuation practice in that none of the studies the panel reviewed had been carried out to its suggested standards.", "The panel\u2019s report listed a number of suggestions for producing high-quality contingent valuation studies. Some of these suggestions pertained to the importance of the underlying survey research in contingent valuation studies, in which the survey instruments often have to provide a substantial amount of background material in a manner that is accessible to the respondents. The panel suggested (1) using probability sampling and appropriate statistical sampling procedures, (2) subjecting the survey instruments to pretesting, and (3) taking steps to reduce nonresponse rates. Additionally, the panel suggested that contingent valuation studies disclose information on the sample selection process and provide information on survey instruments and responses. The panel stated a strong preference for the use of in-person surveys as superior to telephone or mail surveys. The panel\u2019s report stated that it is \u201cunlikely that reliable estimates of values could be elicited with mail surveys.\u201d The panel also suggested that it was desirable to pretest any photographs that would be used to convey information to respondents.", "In terms of the elicitation format, the panel suggested that the referendum format, as opposed to open-ended elicitation, was desirable. In its basic form, a referendum format contingent valuation study describes a proposal to provide a specific improvement in an environmental good, and the survey respondents are asked if they would support this proposal as if it were a referendum item to be voted on. As part of the proposal, a \u201cpayment vehicle\u201d is described, such as a tax increase or a utility bill increase, and each respondent is given a specific per person (or per household) dollar amount that this proposal will cost. The voting question is a dichotomous choice (\u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d), and, in conjunction with other information gathered in the survey, such as environmental attitudes, income level, etc., econometric techniques appropriate to dichotomous choice situations can be used to determine a measure of willingness to pay for the described proposal on the basis of the observed pattern of yes or no votes. Supporters of the referendum model argue that it creates a contingent market mechanism with which consumers are familiar. First, consumers are familiar with \u201cposted price\u201d market choice contexts.Second, the referendum format itself is familiar to people as a method of expressing political preferences.", "The panel was concerned that steps be taken so that results of contingent valuation studies conform to common notions of economic rationality. The NOAA panel endorsed the use of follow-up questions asking respondents the reasons that they voted the way they did as well as questions designed to test how well the respondent understood the program or policy at hand. The panel also suggested that survey respondents be provided with a reminder that paying for the non-use good at issue would result in a smaller budget to spend on other goods and services and that they be told of any available substitutes.", "One aspect of rationality is that, generally speaking, people are willing to pay more for greater amounts of a good. In its deliberations, the panel had concerns about evidence presented in one contingent valuation study that estimated willingness to pay \u201cfor the cleanup of all lakes in Ontario was only slightly more than willingness to pay for cleaning up lakes in just one region\u201d and in another study that estimated \u201cwillingness to pay to take measures to prevent 2,000 migratory birds (not endangered species) from dying in oil-filled ponds was as great as that for preventing 20,000 or 200,000 birds from dying.\u201d The panel suggested that a contingent valuation study demonstrate its sensitivity to these so-called \u201cscope effects.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Criticisms of Contingent Valuation Method Have Been Raised", "paragraphs": ["Some economists and other analysts have voiced criticisms of contingent valuation methods. An overarching concern among some observers is that contingent valuation does not adequately capture true estimates of willingness to pay. One component of this criticism is that respondents make choices but that these choices do not require real economic commitments. Also, particularly with respect to non-use values, critics argue that it can be difficult for respondents to comprehend a particular environmental or resource valuation issue, or to distinguish what researchers envision as a well-defined specific issue from a more general \u201cwarm glow\u201d effect. Furthermore, some critics argue that the statistical estimation process by which willingness-to-pay estimates are produced from survey responses can be imprecise. At the same time, proponents of contingent valuation have made arguments that respond to many of these criticisms.", "One criticism of the contingent valuation method is that contingent markets do not create choice contexts with binding budget constraints and the financial consequences associated with \u201creal\u201d choice contexts. In general, the issue is that by actually spending a certain amount of money, an individual or household can no longer spend that money on something else. Thus, the goods and services that are purchased presumably represent the true preferences of the individual or household. In contrast, responding yes to a contingent valuation question does not financially bind the respondent in the same way. Proponents of the contingent valuation method have been also concerned with this issue and suggest that appropriate steps in survey design serve to reduce the problem. Others maintain that the existence of opportunities for strategic misrepresentation, among other problems, reduces the usefulness of the contingent valuation method. \u201c. . . wired differently than the economic model of fully formed, stable, rational preferences requires. While the consumer\u2019s wiring may produce patterns of market behavior that will often be approximated well by the economist\u2019s model, when we approach the consumer from a different angle, asking direct and unusual questions about values, we find alarming variations from the standard economist\u2019s story. All these consumers, so normal and rational on the outside, are revealed to be shells filled with vast rule-books of heuristics written by natural selection. Throw these people a curve ball, in the form of a valuation question that fails to fit a standard heuristic for market response, and the essential mindlessness of the organism is revealed.\u201d", "Critics have also argued that estimates produced by contingent valuation studies may not be limited to values of the specific environmental amenity under consideration but may also incorporate a variety of broader values. The NOAA panel recognized the concern that contingent valuation estimates may contain a \u201cwarm glow\u201d component associated with supporting worthy causes.", "One additional criticism is that resulting estimates of willingness to pay can be particularly sensitive to the statistical methods used. One analyst examined a variety of statistical issues in contingent valuation estimation and concluded that the estimates were sensitive to context effects, including anchoring effects, as well as the choice as to how statistical outliers were handled.", "Proponents of contingent valuation have responded to many of the arguments developed by critics. In particular, a prominent contingent valuation researcher has written an overview article that provides many general arguments in favor of contingent valuation, as well as a point-by-point discussion of several specific issues raised by critics of contingent valuation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Further Considerations", "paragraphs": ["Many observers believe that the use of contingent valuation seems likely to continue to grow. Some aspects of the contingent valuation method that are not entirely analytical may also influence the future path of its use in regulatory and damage assessment proceedings. One aspect concerns potential problems with incorporating evolving scientific understanding of the specific environmental issues crucial to a given policy evaluation into survey instruments that take time to develop, implement, and analyze. Another aspect involves consideration of the geographic extent of the affected population. A further issue concerns the \u201ccalibration\u201d of willingness-to-pay estimates for use in regulatory or damage assessment proceedings. Additionally, some practitioners of contingent valuation are concerned that some of the specific recommendations of the NOAA panel may inappropriately preclude other analytical alternatives that may prove to be superior or more cost-effective.", "Federal regulatory actions often trigger specific requirements and may involve deadlines. For instance, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 requires federal agencies to prepare an environmental impact statement if a proposed federal action is likely to significantly affect environmental quality. Although neither NEPA nor its implementing regulations require non-use values to be considered, non-use values have been considered in NEPA proceedings. A contingent valuation study requires an accurate description of the likely change in environmental amenity, which in turn requires careful consideration of the underlying environmental impacts, perhaps including anthropological, atmospheric, biological, and physical components. In some contexts, much of the underlying scientific information may have to be developed during the environmental impact statement process. Because there are many steps required to develop, implement, and analyze survey instruments, there is a chance that the willingness-to-pay estimates will be produced on the basis of descriptions of expected environmental impacts that do not accurately reflect later scientific understanding, or that regulatory decisionmaking time frames are lengthened as that information is incorporated. In other regulatory contexts, such as the one involving the Navajo Generating Station (NGS), court-imposed deadlines may influence not only a decision to undertake a contingent valuation study, but decisions as to how underlying scientific understanding is incorporated into the survey research process. If a particular policy action is controversial or disputed, the accuracy of the underlying description of environmental impacts is likely to be challenged as leading to inaccurate calculations of willingness to pay for those improvements.", "Much of the analytical discussion focuses on estimates of per person or per household willingness to pay, and how sensitive or robust such estimates may be to particular choices in underlying description or analytical technique. However, for use in benefit-cost analysis or in estimating damage assessments, the issue of how many people are affected\u2014for instance, how many people are assumed to have non-use values\u2014is important in calculating gross benefit numbers. For contingent valuation estimates of recreation values, samples of recreationists offer a fairly straightforward way of defining the relevant population. For non-use values, the choice of the relevant population may not be so clear. For resources of national significance, researchers may reasonably consider that the national population is the relevant population and may design a study on the basis of that premise. In other cases, the answer is less clear. In any event, it is possible to generate a large benefit number when even fairly small estimates of willingness to pay are multiplied by 100 million, approximately the number of households in the country.", "Some observers have argued that contingent valuation estimates of willingness to pay need to be adjusted, or calibrated, because of the inherent limitations. In its deliberations, the NOAA panel reported that it was \u201cpersuaded that hypothetical markets tend to overstate willingness to pay for private as well as public goods\u201d and that the same bias would be likely to occur in contingent valuation studies. In its proposed rule, the Department of Commerce (NOAA) recommended a 50-percent calibration factor to adjust for biases of unknown magnitude but of an upward direction. Although a comparison of contingent valuation estimates with other estimates is not possible for non-use values, some researchers have more recently compared contingent valuation estimates with \u201crevealed preference\u201d estimates in a number of studies for which both kinds of estimates were produced. The researchers examined a variety of recreation studies and also cases in which amenities might be capitalized into an asset price, such as a price premium a house with a beautiful view might command over a similar house without the view. The authors located 83 studies that provided 616 comparisons of contingent valuation to revealed preference estimates. The authors reported that contingent valuation estimates were \u201csmaller, but not grossly smaller, than their  counterparts.\u201d Although some contingent valuation estimates were larger than their counterparts, the authors concluded that suggestions for a routine downward adjustment of contingent valuation estimates appear unwarranted.", "Some advocates for the use of the contingent valuation method have voiced concern over some of the NOAA panel\u2019s suggestions. In particular, the panel\u2019s strong preference for in-person surveys over mail surveys has been criticized by proponents of mail surveys, as has the panel\u2019s preference for the referendum format. The panel\u2019s preference for in-person surveys had much to do with the fact that sampling frames available for mailing provide incomplete coverage for the national population. The panel also was concerned that targeted respondents can review the subject of the questionnaire before deciding to respond, so those most interested in the subject may choose to respond. Proponents of mail surveys counter that other survey methods, such as in-person interviews, also have their drawbacks, such as problems caused by the presence of an interviewer, which may bias responses, or pressures on respondents to answer quickly while the interviewer is present. They also add that mail surveys of large samples offer significant cost savings over in-person interviews.", "The panel\u2019s preference for the referendum format was based on a number of factors, including the fact that people are \u201crarely asked or required in the course of their everyday lives to place a dollar value on a particular public good.\u201d Even though open-ended elicitation is not familiar, some researchers point to results from experimental economics indicating that posted price choice contexts perform poorly relative to open-ended contexts in \u201cearly rounds\u201d of bidding situations in which respondents are not experienced. Given that respondents are not likely to be well informed in many contingent valuation contexts (at least for non-use goods), these researchers argue that the experimental results that people overpay in early rounds suggests that a \u201cone-round\u201d referendum may lead to an overstated willingness to pay. Other research suggests that the specific price that a referendum survey respondent is confronted with\u2014the bid price\u2014may lead to anchoring effects, so the resulting willingness-to-pay estimates may be too high. In contrast to the typical practice in which bid prices are distributed randomly to respondents, this research suggests that some initial investigation incorporating open-ended valuations could be useful in avoiding the assignment of high bid prices to respondents with low values (and vice versa)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Studies of Visibility Impairment Causes in and Around Grand Canyon National Park", "paragraphs": ["The largest benefit EPA expected to occur at the Grand Canyon National Park as a result of reducing emissions from NGS was an improvement in visibility during certain winter weather conditions.

These estimated improvements were based in part on a study of visibility impairment in the vicinity of the Grand Canyon by the National Park Service (NPS).

In determining an emissions limit, EPA is required to take into consideration, among other things, the costs of reducing emissions and the degree of improvement in visibility that may reasonably be anticipated to result from the use of such technology. In September 1989, EPA proposed to attribute visibility impairment in the Grand Canyon to emissions from NGS and, as a result, was required to carry out a technology assessment of NGS.", "EPA\u2019s determination of an emissions limit relied on data from an NPS study (the National Park Service Report on the Winter Haze Intensive Tracer Experiment [WHITEX]) of visibility impairment in the vicinity of the Grand Canyon. WHITEX was designed to evaluate the ability of using a variety of modeling approaches to attribute visibility impairment from a single source, NGS. Specifically, various models were to be evaluated in their ability to link NGS\u2019 emissions to visibility impairment at the Grand Canyon and other nearby national parks. According to WHITEX, wintertime meteorological conditions in the area are characterized by several periods of stagnation in which air pollutants can be trapped by a persistent thermal inversion, resulting in a distinct visible surface haze layer. Although several earlier investigations have been conducted to determine the origins of the haze, WHITEX was a more comprehensive effort to address persistent questions about the nature and sources of the winter haze conditions.", "According to EPA and NPS officials, the emissions from NGS can have the largest effect during certain weather conditions that include (1) high relative humidity, which facilitates the conversion of the plant\u2019s gaseous sulfur dioxide emissions to visibility-impairing sulfate particles, and (2) wind patterns that transport the emissions to the Grand Canyon. EPA estimated that these conditions occur between 10 and 15 times per winter, lasting from 3 to 5 days each occurrence. However, NPS officials explained that the effect of emissions from NGS on visibility impairment at the Grand Canyon during these conditions can be mitigated by local weather patterns. According to these officials, due in part to local weather conditions, the most severe effects occur approximately two to three times per winter, lasting from 5 to 7 days each time. These officials explained that visibility can be impaired during these winter weather conditions because of naturally occurring impairment\u2014mist, fog, clouds\u2014and because of man-made sources, primarily NGS. However, the officials noted that photographic and air monitoring data show that visibility impairment from man-made sources can continue for several days after the naturally occurring conditions have dissipated. In addition, the evidence also indicates that impairment from man-made sources is perceptible even on some days that include natural impairment.", "WHITEX, carried out during January and February of 1987, relied on injecting a unique chemical into NGS\u2019 smokestack and tracking this chemical to air monitoring stations that were placed around the region, including at the Grand Canyon. The study concluded that NGS was the single largest contributor to visibility impairment in the Grand Canyon during the days for which air monitoring data were available. WHITEX\u2019s results indicated that, for days on which air monitoring data were available, NGS contributed approximately 40 percent on the average to wintertime visibility impairment and approximately 60 percent to 70 percent during the worst visibility impairment conditions.", "EPA\u2019s estimates of the degree of visibility improvement used WHITEX data to establish the relationship between NGS\u2019 emissions and visibility impairment in the canyon. EPA explained that, because of the complex terrain in and around the Grand Canyon, the WHITEX data provided a more reliable estimate than the models often used to estimate improvements in visibility. Specifically, EPA used the ratio of sulfur dioxide emissions at NGS to sulfate particles in the Grand Canyon attributable to NGS. Using this ratio, EPA applied a \u201clinear rollback\u201d model, which used regression analysis techniques to estimate the level of visibility impairment that would result from a given level of NGS\u2019 sulfur dioxide emissions. The model\u2019s formula contained terms that attempted to account for, among other things, the percentage of sulfate that contributes to overall visibility impairment, the percentage of NGS\u2019 contribution to total sulfates, and the removal rate of the control technology.", "EPA\u2019s analysis of NGS\u2019 emissions reductions and the resulting visibility improvements was complicated in several ways. For example, EPA had to determine whether to account for the possibility that a linear relationship may not exist between NGS\u2019 sulfur dioxide emissions and the resulting visibility impairment in the Grand Canyon. In other words, would a reduction in NGS\u2019 sulfur dioxide emissions result in a proportional or less-than-proportional reduction in visibility impairment in the canyon attributable to NGS? EPA explained that WHITEX showed that the conversion of sulfur dioxide to visibility-impairing sulfate particles is greater in a moisture-rich environment (e.g., clouds or fog) and the lack of such an environment tends to limit such conversion. However, EPA also explained that other studies showed that moisture-rich environments may also inhibit the conversion of sulfur dioxide to visibility-impairing sulfate particles because the compounds with which the sulfur dioxide might react (typically hydrogen peroxide and ozone) may combine first with other compounds and lessen the conversion of sulfur dioxide to the visibility-impairing sulfate particles. EPA determined that this issue was insignificant because adequate quantities of compounds, such as hydrogen peroxide, would likely exist during the winter and other studies of trends in various parts of the country did not indicate any significant nonlinearity. However, EPA did modify its model to address another complication. This complication stemmed from the possibility that reducing sulfur dioxide emissions could increase the amount of other visibility-impairing compounds to be formed. EPA was concerned that, if sulfur dioxide was reduced, ammonia that would have combined with sulfur dioxide to form visibility-impairing sulfate would instead combine with nitrogen oxides, forming ammonium nitrate. EPA modified its model to account for this potential \u201cnonlinear\u201d complication.", "EPA assessed a variety of different scenarios to determine the potential visibility improvements. First, the model assessed the potential visibility improvements (in terms of visual range\u2014expressed in kilometers) under average conditions found during the WHITEX study period that could result from emission control rates of 70, 80, and 90 percent at NGS. Second, the model assessed the potential visibility improvements under the worst-case conditions found during the WHITEX study period that could result from removal rates of 70, 80, and 90 percent. EPA assessed scenarios that assumed a linear relationship between sulfur dioxide emissions and visibility impairment and other scenarios that assumed a nonlinear relationship.", "Model results showed a dramatic increase in estimated visibility improvements during the worst-case conditions compared to improvements during the average conditions. For example, the results showed visibility improvements under average conditions that ranged from approximately 11 percent for a 70-percent level of emissions reduction to approximately 14 percent for a 90-percent level of emissions reduction. These figures compare to the model\u2019s estimates of visibility improvements under worst-case conditions that ranged from approximately 60 percent for a 70-percent level of emissions reduction to approximately 94 percent for a 90-percent level of emissions reduction.", "Because modeling average conditions does not necessarily represent actual conditions on a given day, EPA also examined potential visibility improvements using actual data collected during the WHITEX study. In cases where total visibility impairment data were not available (because of weather conditions during the study period\u2014i.e., during periods of cloud cover), EPA reconstructed data that were measured during the study period. This analysis found visibility improvements that ranged, on average, from approximately 23 percent to 43 percent, depending on the level of emissions reduction. This level of visibility improvement was approximately 2 to 3 times higher than the estimated improvement found using average visibility conditions and approximately half the values found under the average worst-case conditions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA Estimated Improvements on Other Winter Days", "paragraphs": ["In addition to improvements during certain winter weather conditions, EPA also estimated visibility improvements on other winter days.

With this method, EPA estimated that, using information developed in the WHITEX study and extrapolating it to the winter period (and applying a nonlinearity factor), reducing the emissions from NGS by 90 percent would have the following effects on visibility: (1) at least a \u201cperceptible\u201d change in visibility conditions (defined by EPA as a 4-percent change in contrast) approximately 100 days of the total winter days, (2) a \u201cquite noticeable\u201d change in visibility conditions (10-percent change in contrast) approximately 58 days of the total winter days, and (3) a \u201cvery apparent\u201d change in visibility conditions (20-percent change in contrast) approximately 21 days of the total winter days.", "Although these estimates illustrate the varying effect of NGS on visibility during the winter, EPA eventually dropped the estimates.

The plant owners\u2019 estimates showed that 54 days, rather than EPA\u2019s estimate of 100 days, would have at least a perceptible change. Using the results of their own visibility study, the plant owners argued that reducing the emissions by 90 percent would result in (1) approximately 4 days during the winter of a perceptible improvement in visibility, (2) approximately 2 days during the winter of a quite noticeable improvement in visibility, and (3) 0 days during the winter of a very apparent improvement in visibility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "National Academy of Sciences Reviewed WHITEX Study", "paragraphs": ["The National Academy of Sciences\u2019 National Research Council established a committee to evaluate the WHITEX study.

However, EPA also noted that other visibility improvements will occur, including improvements below the rim of the canyon, during seasons other than winter at the canyon, and at other national parks in the area. Therefore, EPA noted that its estimate of approximately 7 percent is likely an underestimate.", "EPA explained several factors that tend to make the estimate an understatement. First, EPA\u2019s estimate did not include the more pronounced improvement that would be realized in the canyon, below the rim. EPA noted that, a comparative analysis, prepared by Air Resource Specialists, Inc., of 3 years (1988 to 1991) of sulfate levels from above-rim and in-canyon air monitoring stations, showed in-canyon visibility impairment up to 10 times greater than that measured on the rim and concluded that high sulfate conditions below the rim typically last from 3 to 5 days longer than do those observed at the rim. In addition, the study concluded that there is a high degree of confidence that NGS is responsible for at least 90 percent of the visibility impairment at the Grand Canyon during these periods.", "Second, EPA noted that the principal improvement will likely be during certain wintertime weather conditions. EPA\u2019s approximately 7 percent estimate reflects an average over the 5-month period from November through March. Since the winter weather conditions during which NGS can have its largest effect occur intermittently throughout the 5-month period, EPA expects that the visibility improvement during these winter weather conditions is substantially greater than 7 percent.", "Third, EPA did not estimate the expected visibility benefits to be realized during nonwinter seasons at the Grand Canyon or at other surrounding national parks. NGS is located near several national parks located on the Colorado Plateau\u2014which in addition to the Grand Canyon include Arches, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, Mesa Verde, and Zion. Two studies were submitted to EPA that estimated NGS\u2019 year-round impacts on these other parks. One study, by the Air Resource Specialists on in-canyon visibility impairment, estimated the year-round effects of NGS. The study estimated the visibility effects of NGS\u2019 emissions for every hour from December 1985 to November 1990 and concluded that NGS\u2019 emissions were present at the Grand Canyon (1) an average of 35 percent of the time in the winter and (2) near or above an average of 20 percent of the time 8 months of the year. The study concluded that when NGS\u2019 emissions are not in the Grand Canyon, they are most likely affecting another national park in the area. The study estimated that NGS\u2019 emissions are present in these other parks on average at least 50 percent of each month throughout the year. The other study, prepared by Latimer and Associates, analyzed the impact of NGS\u2019 emissions on impairment during all seasons in these national parks (including the Grand Canyon) for the same 5-year period. The study concluded that haze impacts generally are highest in the Grand Canyon in the winter and calculated that perceptible sulfate haze impacts due to NGS\u2019 emissions occured in all other parks and in each season during the 5-year period modeled. The study concluded that since NGS is surrounded by national parks, the likelihood is high that at least one park is impacted at any given time."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Contingent Valuation Studies Used to Value Visibility Improvements at the Grand Canyon National Park", "paragraphs": ["This appendix discusses two contingent valuation studies related to EPA\u2019s 1991 regulatory action that established an emissions limit for NGS.

Agencies were to do this for proposed rules that, among other things, were likely to result in an annual effect on the economy of at least $100 million. In such cases, an agency\u2019s analysis was required to describe the benefits\u2014expressed in monetary terms, if possible\u2014as well as the potential costs. If the analysis did not show that benefits exceeded costs, the agency was to explain any legal reason why the regulation should still be promulgated.", "Cost-benefit analyses were expected to conform to guidelines developed by the Office of Management and Budget and EPA. The guidelines allowed EPA considerable flexibility in estimating its benefits. They stated, among other things, that the scope and precision of analysis should depend on the specific requirements of authorizing legislation, the quality of underlying data, the scientific understanding of the problems to be addressed through the regulation, and resource constraints at EPA.", "EPA, according to officials, was faced with such resource constraints. It had, in effect, a court-ordered deadline for completing its estimate of the monetary value of visibility improvements expected from limiting the plant\u2019s emissions. On the basis of a 1982 lawsuit filed by environmental groups and a subsequent settlement agreement and revisions to the settlement agreement between EPA and these groups, EPA was under court order at this time to determine whether a specific pollution source caused or contributed to the visibility impairment at the Grand Canyon and, if so, issue a finding to that effect by August 31, 1989. In addition, following any finding, EPA was to conduct a best available retrofit technology (BART) analysis on the identified source. And, if the analysis indicated emissions controls would improve visibility at the Grand Canyon National Park, EPA was to propose regulations requiring their installation and use in order to achieve the emissions limit representing BART. Under the court order, EPA was to complete its technology analysis by February 1, 1990. This was less than 6 months from August 31, 1989, when EPA was required to issue its finding as to whether NGS was a source of impairment.", "EPA concluded that it did not have time to complete original research to estimate a monetary value of the specific visibility improvements expected from emissions controls at the plant.

On the other hand, these statements could be exactly what the respondents needed in order to understand what they were to value.", "Another example of contextual information is from the study EPA used. In that case, prior to asking respondents to value visibility changes, the researchers first introduced respondents to several nonvisibility effects of air pollution at national parks. Before asking the respondents to value visibility changes, the researchers first asked them to prioritize nonvisibility effects that were happening or could happen in national parks due to people\u2019s activities outside park boundaries, for example, injury to vegetation and historic structures from air pollution. Then, later in the questionnaire, following the valuation questions, respondents were asked to separate, from their willingness-to-pay values, any amount they had included for nonvisibility improvements.", "A possible effect of introducing these additional results of air pollution before the valuation questions, in our view, might have been that respondents assigned higher willingness-to-pay values than they might otherwise have.

The weaknesses of the method include higher costs because interviewers not only must be trained, but they must also travel to and from interviews\u2014some of which may not be successful.
