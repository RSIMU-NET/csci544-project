You further stated that recent media accounts have focused on the need for consumers to approach death care transactions with considerable caution, especially because these purchases can be some of the most costly and emotionally difficult financial transactions a consumer can make.", "As agreed with your offices, our objectives were to (1) describe the availability of information on the nature and extent of consumer complaints about death care industries, (2) describe and assess the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s (FTC) efforts to ensure compliance with its Funeral Rule, and (3) provide information on selected state governments\u2019 roles in protecting consumers in their death care transactions. The selected states were California, Florida, Maryland, New York, and Texas (see our scope and methodology section for a discussion of our selection criteria). We focused on transactions concerning funeral homes; cemeteries; and preplanned and prepaid funeral arrangements, commonly known as preneed arrangements."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Each year, American consumers arrange more than 2 million funerals at a total cost of billions of dollars. During 1997, according to Conning & Company, an insurance industry publications and research firm, almost 27,000 funeral service providers, such as funeral homes and crematories, had sales revenue of about $10 billion. The National Funeral Directors Association (NFDA) reported that in 1997, the average adult funeral cost about $5,500, including casket and vault. Table 1 shows NFDA data on the average cost for the most commonly selected funeral items as of January 1997.", "NFDA also maintains some data on the cost of final disposition, such as burial and cremation. For example, in 1997, according to NFDA, the cost of an individual grave space ranged from about $150 to over $1,900, and the cost of opening and closing the grave ranged from $125 to $750 for nonovertime work. In addition, according to NFDA, the cost of cremation ranged from $75 to $395; a bronze urn to hold cremated remains cost from $230 to $1,800; and in-ground placement of an urn ranged from $450 to $1,250. Although the variety of choices and the range of costs make it difficult to precisely estimate the cost of a typical funeral and burial, AARP estimated the cost in 1998 to be about $8,000 and as much as $10,000 in some markets. Furthermore, AARP reported that the cost of funeral and burial arrangements is increasing. In fact, according to data collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), funeral expenses have grown faster than the rate of inflation.  Figure 1 shows the extent to which funeral expenses have exceeded the rate of inflation, as indicated by the consumer price index (CPI), since 1990.", "FTC has a major role in protecting consumers during death care transactions. The FTC Act declares unfair or deceptive acts or practices to be unlawful when they affect commerce. Under its authority to promulgate rules, FTC has issued a trade rule entitled Funeral Industry Practices\u2014more commonly called the Funeral Rule. The Funeral Rule was designed to (1) ensure that consumers receive the information necessary to make informed purchasing decisions and (2) lower existing barriers to price competition in the market for funeral goods and services.", "The Funeral Rule, which became fully effective in April 1984, declares it an unfair or deceptive act or practice for funeral providers to (1) fail to furnish accurate price information to funeral consumers, (2) require consumers to purchase items they do not want to buy, and (3) embalm deceased human remains for a fee without authorization. The Rule further declares it a deceptive practice for funeral providers to make certain misrepresentations, such as that embalming is required by law when it is not, that caskets must be used for cremation, or that funeral goods and services have certain preservation and protection capabilities. To prevent those practices, providers of funeral goods and services are to, among other things, (1) give detailed printed information about prices, including certain legal disclosures, to consumers who inquire about funeral arrangements; (2) allow consumers to select only those goods and services they desire (rather than offering goods and services only in predetermined packages); and (3) seek express approval before embalming the deceased for a fee. Since the Funeral Rule\u2019s inception, it was amended once in 1994. In April 1999, FTC announced that it was beginning to review the Funeral Rule to determine if it should be further amended, maintained as is, or repealed. Appendix I contains a copy of the Funeral Rule that was in effect as of July 1999.", "State and local governments also have a role in regulating and overseeing funeral homes and cemeteries.  Commercial cemeteries are regulated primarily at the state or local level. According to a 1998 book on making funeral arrangements,  funeral homes and cemeteries are regulated by state boards as well as other agencies, including offices of attorneys general and departments of health and insurance.  In addition, the book points out that licensing and minimum education requirements for funeral directors and embalmers differ from state to state. State laws also are the primary source of regulation over preneed funeral contracts. According to a 1996 law journal article, although every state, with the exception of Alabama and the District of Columbia, has enacted some sort of regulatory action to oversee preneed contracts, the laws vary from state to state.Examples of areas of differences in state statutes include the funding options available to consumers, limitations on where proceeds from preneed funeral contracts may be invested, and the percentage of preneed sales proceeds required to be placed in trust.", "One of the major changes in the nature of death care industries is the increase in preneed contracts. Conning & Company estimated that the preneed funeral market, including preneed trust deposits and preneed insurance contracts, amounted to over $21 billion in 1996. Another change, according to FTC, is that cemeteries and casket retailers are now competing with traditional funeral providers, such as funeral homes, in the sales of caskets and other funeral goods and services. At the same time, an NFDA official said that there has been a movement away from independent family-owned funeral homes and a movement toward corporate or publicly owned homes. And according to reports in the media, there is a growing incidence of funeral homes and cemeteries being owned by the same few organizations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To meet our objectives, we did our work primarily at FTC in Washington, D.C., and Dallas, TX; and at state funeral and cemetery regulatory offices in five states\u2014California, Florida, Maryland, New York, and Texas. As agreed with your offices, we focused our efforts on five states because of time and staffing constraints. We selected California, Florida, New York, and Texas because these states had the highest number of deaths of all 50 states in 1998. We selected Maryland because it recently had established a state regulatory agency with oversight responsibility for all but certain religious nonprofit cemeteries and because of Maryland\u2019s close proximity to our headquarters. In addition, we interviewed selected national representatives of industry trade and regulatory associations and consumer advocacy groups that deal with death care issues (see app. II for the organizations of the representatives and officials we spoke with). From each of these organizations we collected and reviewed available documents on such matters as issues affecting death care industries and consumers, sales and revenues of death care providers and average costs of death care goods and services, and federal and state regulatory issues. We also did a literature and Internet search for information on issues affecting death care industries and consumers and reviewed pertinent books, magazines, trade publications, and periodicals regarding consumer concerns with related death care industries. We did our work between July 1998 and July 1999, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Appendix II discusses our objectives, scope, and methodology in more detail.", "We requested comments on a draft of this report from FTC\u2019s Chairman. FTC\u2019s comments are discussed near the end of this letter and are reprinted as appendix VI.

One reason is that consumers can complain to a variety of organizations about death care issues and can complain to more than one organization about the same incident. Another reason is that no single organization or combination of organizations collects and compiles all complaints into one database.  Also, each organization can have its own way of compiling and maintaining complaint information, which would confound efforts to compile and analyze aggregate complaint data. Although the organizations we contacted were able to provide some data, the number of complaints about death care was generally low compared to complaints about other categories of consumer issues. Among the reasons these organizations gave for the relatively low number of complaints was the personal or emotional component of the death care situation."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Consumers Can Complain to a Number of Organizations", "paragraphs": ["Consumers can complain to a number of organizations about death care issues\u2014from FTC at the federal level, to funeral licensing boards at the state level, to local consumer groups. Thus, it is difficult to determine the universe of organizations accepting complaints. In addition, consumers can lodge the same complaint to more than one of these organizations. For example, although consumers can lodge a complaint with FTC, intervening in individual disputes is not something FTC does. Instead, FTC refers consumers to other organizations for complaint resolution. Thus, FTC officials said that a single complaint could be contained in the files of multiple organizations. At the state level, consumers may complain to a variety of organizations. For example, in Texas, a consumer may complain to the state\u2019s office of the Attorney General and also to regulators responsible for any particular aspect of the death care industry, such as the Texas Department of Banking, which is responsible for regulating cemeteries and preneed funeral arrangements; or the Texas Funeral Service Commission, which is responsible for regulating funeral providers.", "Consumers also can register complaints with nongovernmental organizations, both those that handle consumer complaints in general and those that specialize in death care matters. One of the best-known general consumer complaint organizations is the Better Business Bureau (BBB), which accepts complaints and can intervene on behalf of consumers through its local bureaus. One specialized organization that accepts complaints only about death care is the Funeral Service Consumer Assistance Program (FSCAP), which provides consumer information, problem-solving resources, and recommendations for action concerning funeral services. According to FSCAP, it attempts to work with consumers to resolve their concerns, but if it cannot, FSCAP officials refer them to the appropriate state or local government agency. Another specialized organization, the Cemetery Consumer Service Council (CCSC), assists consumers in matters involving private cemeteries and memorial parks. According to CCSC, consumer complaints it receives at its national office are forwarded to the appropriate state CCSC representative for investigation and action. CCSC reports that its state representatives resolve many complaints by telephone and then notify the consumer.

This is because the various organizations and agencies that accept complaints have their own approaches for compiling and maintaining complaint information, often in dissimilar formats that do not lend themselves to systematic compilation or analysis.", "For example, in the selected states we visited, we found that most of the states (California, Maryland, New York, and Texas) used a manual process, rather than an automated one, for recording and filing death care complaints. This manual process made it difficult to retrieve aggregate data. For example, before 1998, in Maryland, complaints for cemeteries were filed with complaints about other licensed businesses, such as beauty shops. For the one state, Florida, that used an automated system for complaints, detailed information about the nature of complaints was not recorded.", "In addition, not all organizations that accept complaints record information on the nature of complaints, only whether a complaint was lodged. For example, BBB headquarters, which compiles all BBB data on consumer complaints, does not have information in its database on the nature of those complaints, only information on the number of complaints by industry category. The reason for this, according to a BBB official, is that local bureaus of the BBB give headquarters statistics only on the aggregate number of complaints.

Although the range of complaints was broad, we did not find large numbers of complaints at FTC, nongovernmental organizations, and selected state agencies. Generally across all of the types of organizations we contacted, most officials and representatives said that they received few complaints about death care.

FTC staff assessed these complaints and determined that 58 involved potential violations of the Funeral Rule; the remaining 94 concerned other issues, such as rude service, contractual disputes, and cemetery and preneed complaints. Our analysis of CIS data for specific complaints consumers made to FTC in fiscal year 1998 includes the following as examples of the broad range of complaints received:", "A California consumer used the Internet to complain that a preneed trust for the entire cost of a funeral was purchased in 1977, yet additional fees of $1,026 were added when the trust was executed in 1998.", "A Michigan consumer complained by mail that a funeral home\u2019s fees were combined rather than being displayed as separate line items as required by FTC\u2019s Funeral Rule.", "A New Jersey woman complained by telephone that she was a victim of deceptive practices. The complainant reported that her mother was embalmed without permission and that the funeral home claimed that communicable disease laws prevented the use of a rental casket; her inquiry to the state mortuary board revealed that there were no such laws.", "A California consumer complained by telephone that a funeral home was going to charge an additional $470 for the use of a casket not purchased directly from the home.", "An Iowa consumer complained by mail that the casket delivered by a funeral home was not the model specified in the preneed agreement and that this funeral home regularly attempted to get customers to pay more for caskets.

Table 2 shows the area of death care goods and services about which consumers complained and the number of complaints BBB received.", "When comparing 1997 BBB inquiry and complaint data for death care to such data for other types of businesses, there were about one-third fewer total complaints for death care than there were for barber and beauty shops (654). The data indicate that BBB received far fewer complaints about death care than about automotive repair (15,551). Data were not available that would permit adjustment of these comparisons to a per- transaction basis. That is, although there were far fewer consumer transactions concerning death care industries than concerning barber and beauty shops or automotive repair shops, we cannot make a proportional assessment of the complaints.", "In the selected states, consumer complaint data from each state were not available for us to review.

However, officials from both organizations said the complaint data were not available to confirm those numbers. In general, if they collected complaints, state-level organizations were either (1) only able to provide statistics about them and not detailed information on the nature or extent of complaints or (2) did not want to furnish such information because of confidentiality concerns.

However, there are also factors that might inhibit complaints. Officials from organizations at all levels told us that consumers often did not report problems because of the emotional component of death care or because they did not want to dwell on negative occurrences about the death of a loved one. One FTC official said that although he was not aware of any study to support it, anecdotally, consumers tended not to complain because of embarrassment or ignorance. In addition, a representative of a consumer group in Texas said that consumers are sometimes reluctant to complain because they know they have overpaid for death care services and do not want to reveal their mistakes to others. A BBB representative said that consumers might believe that death care is a personal matter rather than a consumer matter. Therefore, consumers may not think to complain the same way they would about a defective washing machine or automobile. Similarly, AARP officials said that AARP members are generally not inclined to report personal problems they have experienced with death care and that for this reason complaints are not considered to be a good measure of customer satisfaction. Further, users of preneed arrangements may leave no one in a position to complain.", "Also, consumers may not be aware of the FTC Funeral Rule and states\u2019 laws relating to death care industries. Without knowing about the Funeral Rule and the laws, consumers may not know they have the right to complain. FTC officials said that they believe that consumers are not comparison-shopping when they enter into funeral transactions and that the lack of comparison-shopping could be related to the lack of consumer information about FTC and its Funeral Rule. Thus, if consumers do not get price lists from funeral homes or cemeteries when they are supposed to, they probably do not know that they are entitled to such lists. \u201cthe emotional trauma of bereavement, the lack of information, and time pressures place the consumer at an enormous disadvantage in making funeral arrangements.

FTC took these steps because it was concerned about what it perceived as a relatively low level of compliance. For the late 1980s, FTC reported that only about one-third (36 percent) of funeral providers complied with two key requirements of the Funeral Rule\u2014giving consumers a general price list (GPL) and an itemized final statement of goods and services selected. FTC based this compliance rate on a study it did in 1987 during a review of the Funeral Rule. To conduct its study, FTC questioned selected consumers who had arranged funerals in the past 18 months about their experiences with the funeral homes and what was done by the homes to comply with the Rule.", "During the early years after the Funeral Rule became effective, FTC\u2019s enforcement of the Rule was complaint-based. FTC filed 41 civil penalty cases from 1984 through 1994 that were based on investigations of complaints received about individual funeral providers. Because of the perceived low compliance rate based on the 1987 study results it reported and the small number of funeral providers FTC was able to investigate in 10 years, FTC adopted a new approach to try to ensure funeral provider compliance.", "According to FTC, it mailed more than 18,000 compliance guides to \u201cvirtually every member\u201d of the funeral home industry throughout the nation in June 1994. Beginning in October 1994, FTC initiated a test- shopping Rule enforcement approach, called \u201csweeps,\u201d targeting funeral homes in a particular region, state, or city. Under this approach, FTC sent FTC staff, state investigators (such as those from offices of state attorneys general), or other volunteers (such as members of AARP) posing as consumers to test-shop a funeral home--by simulating a funeral transaction--and determine whether the funeral home was complying with the Rule. An FTC official said that FTC did not investigate individual complaints about a funeral home unless a complaint was made about a home in an area that FTC had already targeted for test-shopping.", "According to FTC, the sweeps methodology was initially designed to quickly raise the overall compliance level with the Funeral Rule\u2019s core requirement: giving consumers an itemized GPL early in their meetings with funeral home staff. FTC officials said they believed the sweeps methodology was a more effective law enforcement tool than conducting traditional investigations because FTC could leverage its resources to make a bigger impact by test-shopping more funeral homes. Thus, according to FTC officials, there was a greater likelihood that noncompliance with the Rule would be detected.", "In September 1995, NFDA proposed sponsoring a nonlitigation alternative to civil penalty actions for Rule violations when test-shopping revealed that funeral homes failed to provide the GPL and other price lists required by the Rule (i.e., for caskets and outer burial containers). This proposal, which was approved in modified form and implemented by FTC in 1996, was called the Funeral Rule Offenders Program (FROP). Among other things, violators of the Funeral Rule could have been offered the FROP option. Those who chose to enroll in FROP would agree to make voluntary payments to the U.S. Treasury equal to 0.8 percent of average annual gross sales and participate in training organized by NFDA that was designed to teach them how to comply with the Rule. According to FTC, the sweeps and FROP were expected to deter funeral homes from violating the Rule because (1) Rule violations were more likely to be detected and (2) violations required payments that were substantial enough to be treated as more than the mere cost of doing business as well as 5 years of compliance training and monitoring.", "Although sweeps focused solely on whether a funeral home provided a GPL, by fiscal year 1997, the sweeps methodology had evolved so that additional violations were considered when FTC was making the decision about whether to offer FROP to a funeral home. In addition by fiscal year 1997, the official in each FTC region coordinating the test-shopping was to review the GPL to ensure that it contained the disclosures and other requirements. From October 1994 to September 1998, FTC test-shopped 958 funeral homes, or 4.3 percent of the 22,300 funeral homes in the United States (see app. III for information on the number of sweeps and funeral homes shopped by state and city).", "In addition, FTC has taken steps to educate consumers and funeral industry providers about the Funeral Rule.

FTC\u2019s efforts to measure compliance have been limited to narrowly scoped test-shopping sweeps in selected areas. These sweeps were not representative of the universe of funeral providers and have not covered all elements of the Funeral Rule. We analyzed the available records of funeral homes FTC test-shopped in fiscal years 1997 and 1998.

FTC press releases and documents that FTC provided during our review indicate that test-shopping has demonstrated that compliance with the Funeral Rule was as high as 90 percent during fiscal years 1997 and 1998. However, although FTC has reported a substantial improvement in Funeral Rule compliance, FTC\u2019s approach for measuring changes in the levels of compliance is somewhat problematic. This is because (1) FTC\u2019s current approach is not comparable to the approach used to derive its baseline level of compliance, (2) compliance is not measured in a systematic way using a statistically valid sample of the universe of funeral providers, and (3) FTC\u2019s reported compliance figures deal solely with what FTC considered the core requirement and does not measure compliance with other elements of the Rule.", "Our review of available documents and our discussions with FTC officials showed that FTC could not substantiate whether compliance has increased since the inception of the Rule. The methodology of FTC\u2019s 1987 study, which FTC used to report a compliance rate of 36 percent, differs from that of the post-1994 test-shopping, which it used to report a compliance rate of 90 percent for fiscal year 1997. The two methodologies are not comparable, and the elements of the Funeral Rule tested were not the same. The methodology of the 1987 study involved interviewers querying consumers who had arranged a funeral during the 18 months preceding the inquiry about whether they were shown a GPL and provided an itemized final statement of goods and services. It seems likely that at least some respondents who may have been grieving and in emotional distress would not remember whether or not they had been shown a GPL or provided an itemized statement of goods and services selected.  The Funeral Rule requires that consumers be given a GPL rather than shown one. The more recent sweeps methodology assesses whether consumers were given a GPL. Thus, the behavior being measured by FTC\u2019s baseline study and the more recent sweeps methodology is different. Further, the more recent sweeps methodology does not assess whether consumers received an itemized statement of goods and services.", "Because of the differences in methodologies and measures used to reach the reported compliance rates, any increase reported by FTC cannot be substantiated.

According to FTC, the goal of Funeral Rule sweeps is to increase funeral homes\u2019 compliance with the Funeral Rule and to deter noncompliance. We could not assess whether these goals were being met, nor could FTC, given the test-shopping samples and the scope of the sweeps. To undertake its sweeps, FTC did not select a representative sample of funeral homes to test-shop. For example, FTC did not test-shop funeral homes in New England in either fiscal year 1997 or fiscal year 1998, the period for which we reviewed FTC data. In addition, in fiscal year 1998, although FTC test-shopped funeral homes in the West, Midwest, and Southwest, Florida was the only state in which homes were test-shopped on the East Coast. According to FTC, the factors it considers in selecting sites for conducting sweeps include whether resources are available in FTC regional offices and whether resources are available at the respective offices of state attorneys general or AARP for partnering with FTC to carry out sweeps.", "Although the Funeral Rule applies to all providers of funeral goods and services, including certain cemeteries, FTC has test-shopped only funeral homes. According to FTC officials, they have not identified the number of cemeteries that are covered by the Funeral Rule or performed any sweeps at cemeteries to date.

Table 4 shows the results of our review of FTC\u2019s records concerning representations about embalming and items consumers were required to buy for fiscal years 1997 and 1998.", "We also examined FTC records to test whether funeral homes provided identifying information and disclosures on the GPL as required by the Funeral Rule. We reviewed the GPLs that FTC made available to us to determine whether funeral homes included (1) the requisite identifying information, such as the address and telephone number of the funeral home and the effective date of the GPL; and (2) selected disclosures required by the Rule. We selected three of the six disclosures that the Funeral Rule requires a funeral home to put on its GPL and other price lists to focus on. These disclosures were a consumer\u2019s right to purchase only goods and services desired; proper representation about whether embalming is required by the state or municipality; and, if the funeral home offers cremation, a consumer\u2019s right to an alternative container to a casket for cremation. Our analysis showed that most funeral homes included identifying information and the selected disclosures.

We found that FTC did not always (1) take action when potential violations occurred or (2) document the reasons for its actions.", "Once FTC staff have noted that a Funeral Rule violation has occurred, they can determine the appropriate response or action according to the severity of the violation. One possible enforcement action is a letter that notifies the funeral home that it is not in compliance with the Rule, including a warning that future noncompliance could result in a monetary penalty; another is a written offer for the funeral home to enter FROP as an alternative to a law enforcement proceeding; and a third is a full law enforcement proceeding based on the determination that the funeral home has committed gross violations. Our analysis showed that in some cases FTC did not use any of these options when test-shopping disclosed potential violations.  Specifically, according to its records, in fiscal years 1997 and 1998, FTC did not take action in more than half the instances in which funeral homes had one or more potential Funeral Rule violations.", "Table 6 shows the extent to which FTC did or did not take enforcement action on such homes as noted during our review of FTC records on sweeps carried out in fiscal years 1997 and 1998.", "Because other factors could influence FTC's decision to pursue a case, an indication in its records of a potential violation does not necessarily mean that FTC would be expected to take an enforcement action. However, available records did not always allow us to identify the specific reasons FTC did not act on potential violations of the Funeral Rule. When records indicated that FTC took action on a potential Rule violation, we were not always able to determine why. In addition, FTC\u2019s letters to the funeral homes in violation did not always provide the reason FTC took action, a practice that is suggested in FTC guidance on responding to a violation.", "FTC headquarters officials told us that they were uncertain as to the exact reasons why regional staff did not act on individual potential violations. However, FTC\u2019s Funeral Rule Coordinator and the Assistant Director for Marketing Practices told us that there are numerous reasons FTC would not take action against a funeral home, even though the documentation on the home may indicate that a violation occurred. For instance, the Funeral Rule Coordinator said that the FTC official reviewing the test-shopping record may have asked further questions of the test-shopper and determined that the Rule had not really been violated. She and the Assistant Director stated that they were uncertain why that information was not documented.", "FTC officials also told us that another reason an action may not have been taken is that FTC staff have discretion as to whether they should pursue a potential violation on the basis of the likelihood that FTC staff can make a solid case. In comments on a draft of this report, FTC\u2019s Chairman also stated that FTC can exercise prosecutorial discretion when deciding to take action on any individual case.  During our review, FTC officials pointed out that FTC policy is to pursue full enforcement actions only if there is sufficient evidence to file the matter in federal court. These officials also told us that they did not believe that some types of violations, particularly those for missing identifying information, warranted any type of action because, in isolation, they were not considered substantive. Nonetheless, the officials acknowledged that such violations as those involving missing disclosures would probably warrant a compliance letter, and they could not explain why such a letter had not been sent in certain cases. They acknowledged that a more consistent procedure for use of compliance letters was needed.", "FTC headquarters officials also told us that FTC staff may not have taken action or documented the reasons because the sweeps program is still evolving. They said that during the early sweeps, such as those conducted during 1995, FTC sweeps focused on the key requirement of the Rule\u2014 having a GPL and giving it at the right time. By fiscal year 1996, FTC staff also started to examine whether two other lists\u2014the outer burial container list and the casket price list\u2014were provided to test-shoppers. And by fiscal year 1997, test-shoppers were instructed to also gather information on misrepresentations about embalming and required purchases during the funeral consultation. Also in that year, FTC regional offices were instructed to review GPLs to ensure that the required disclosures were included. However, given the sweeps methodology, FTC cannot determine whether funeral homes were complying with certain elements of the Funeral Rule, such as accuracy of prices and the provision of a statement of goods and services selected.", "In fact, FTC\u2019s guidance for conducting sweeps instructs FTC regional staff to consult with the Funeral Rule Coordinator in the Division of Marketing Practices at FTC headquarters in making determinations about such things as a GPL being in compliance with the Rule or the timing of the presentation of the GPL. According to the guidance, FTC\u2019s Funeral Rule Coordinator is to maintain records regarding these determinations so that they may be instructive in subsequent sweeps and cases. The guidance also points out that advising the Funeral Rule Coordinator about actions, such as sending a compliance letter, \u201cwill allow the development of a consistent response to these violations.\u201d", "FTC headquarters officials acknowledged that they had not done an analysis of the documentation on sweeps as we had. They said that when regions are doing sweeps, staff from the Division of Marketing Practices hold conference calls with regional staff to discuss issues that arise during the sweeps. FTC also provided documentation that indicated such communication between headquarters and regions occurred. However, FTC headquarters officials said that headquarters staff viewed Funeral Rule sweeps as primarily a regional program and assumed that regional offices would be consistent in their implementation of the program based on the training provided. FTC was unable to provide evidence of historical, systematic documentation of sweeps decisionmaking and results. The lack of such documentation could indicate weak internal controls over the Funeral Rule program.

FTC has taken steps, including distributing compliance guides to funeral homes and working with the funeral home industry, intended to ensure compliance with the Funeral Rule. However, FTC cannot, with any reasonable assurance, report that there is high nationwide compliance with the Rule or a substantial increase in compliance compared to a decade ago, because FTC does not have a systematic or structured process for measuring funeral homes\u2019 compliance so that overall conclusions can be drawn about their actual compliance with the Rule and the effectiveness of FTC\u2019s enforcement strategies. FTC\u2019s efforts to measure compliance have been limited to narrowly scoped test-shopping sweeps in selected areas\u2014that is, they are not representative of the universe of funeral providers and do not cover all elements of the Rule. We did not do an analysis on the resources needed for FTC to establish a nationwide compliance rate. However, a more strategic selection of sites and a more systematic approach to conducting sweeps and analyzing results could provide more convincing evidence of the overall level of compliance with the Funeral Rule.", "Although our work indicated that indeed compliance was high among funeral homes that FTC test-shopped in fiscal years 1997 and 1998 for the three elements of the Funeral Rule we reviewed, it appears that FTC did not always take enforcement action against funeral homes that potentially violated the Rule and did not always document the reasons. When records indicated that FTC took action on a potential Rule violation, we were not always able to determine why. In addition, FTC\u2019s letters to the funeral homes in violation did not always provide the reason FTC took action, a practice that is suggested in FTC guidance on responding to a violation.", "Just as any agency\u2019s management is responsible for ensuring its agency\u2019s compliance with laws and regulations, it also is responsible for establishing effective internal controls. In the case of the Funeral Rule, FTC promulgated the Rule and is responsible for establishing effective internal controls for ensuring consistency in its (1) determinations of whether violations of the Rule\u2019s requirements occurred and (2) documentation on the specific reasons FTC did or did not act on such violations.

According to the Chairman's letter, the Commission voted 3 to 1 to issue this response.  The dissenting statement reflected the views of the one commissioner who voted against submitting the response.", "FTC did not specifically comment on our recommendations.  However, the letter signed by the Chairman discussed three points under separate headings: (1) \"Test Methodology\" for measuring funeral providers' compliance with FTC's Funeral Rule, (2) enforcement practices, and (3) other comments. Under the first heading of test methodology, the Chairman\u2019s letter stated that the report \"incorrectly suggests that the FTC cannot document a nationwide increase in compliance with the core requirement of the Funeral Rule and that  tested compliance in 'narrowly scoped test-shopping sweeps.'\" As we have stated in the report, we believe that because of the differences among the methodologies and the elements FTC used in the 1980s and in the 1990s to measure compliance with the Funeral Rule, the assessed methodologies do not yield results that are comparable. Therefore, any increase in compliance reported by FTC cannot be substantiated. Also, although FTC has test- shopped 958 funeral homes in its 32 sweeps of 22 states and the District of Columbia over a 4-year period, FTC selected these sites and the homes to be shopped on the basis of the availability of resources from FTC regional offices and offices of partnering organizations, not as an appropriate sample from which to assess compliance. Indeed, FTC has not identified the universe of providers of funeral goods and services that are to comply with the Rule.  Thus, we do not believe that FTC is positioned to draw overall conclusions about actual compliance with the Rule. As we recommended, FTC would benefit from an approach that used a more convincing sample of funeral providers for conducting sweeps and a broader analysis of Funeral Rule requirements.", "Under the second heading of enforcement practices, the Chairman\u2019s letter stated that the report correctly notes that FTC has \"not pursued every potential violation of each provision of the Rule.\"  The Chairman\u2019s letter continues to state that \"merely focusing on quantity of prosecutions does not present an accurate picture of the impact of the Commission's activities.\"  We do not find fault with the statement in the Chairman\u2019s letter that \"the decision to take action in any individual case is the result of the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, which is no different from the sort of decisionmaking and resource allocation in which all law enforcement agencies must engage.\" However, in FTC's case, it did not take action on more than half of all funeral homes identified in sweeps for fiscal years 1997 and 1998 as having potential Funeral Rule violations. As the one dissenting Commissioner pointed out in his statement, the proportion of all the potential violations for which FTC did not act is worthy of review to \u201cconfirm that they are not likely to cause substantial consumer injury.\u201d Because available records did not always allow us to identify the specific reasons FTC did or did not act on potential violations of the Funeral Rule, we could not determine the impact of such inaction on consumers.", "Finally under the third heading of other comments, the Chairman\u2019s letter stated that \"we believe that GAO fairly points out that some improvements are needed in the Funeral Rule program's record keeping.\"  According to the Chairman\u2019s letter, FTC officials have said that a review of FTC staff\u2019s procedures has begun.  We applaud FTC\u2019s efforts to review its procedures and believe that FTC\u2019s acknowledgement of needed improvements to the program\u2019s recordkeeping is an appropriate first step in establishing effective internal controls over the Funeral Rule program. By taking this step and training staff as we recommended, FTC should be better positioned to ensure consistency in its (1) determinations of whether violations of the Rule\u2019s requirements occurred and (2) documentation of the specific reasons it did or did not act on such violations.   Furthermore, we believe that these efforts may better position FTC to more effectively manage the Funeral Rule program and systematically analyze the extent to which certain Rule violations have the potential for substantial consumer injury.", "In his dissenting statement, the one Commissioner who voted against submitting the response agreed with many of the points made by his colleagues, including that the decision to not take action on individual cases appears to have resulted from the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. However, he stated he did not believe the response appropriately addressed the concerns raised in our draft report. Among other things, he said that (1) FTC should take great care to avoid stating or implying that it is in a position to conclude that a statistically valid nationwide projection of compliance can be made, and (2) a careful analysis of the concerns raised in the draft would have better served the public interest to confirm his suspicions that FTC does not have any substantial enforcement problems.", "As arranged with your offices, unless you publicly announce its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from the date of this letter.

We did our work primarily at FTC in Washington, D.C., and Dallas, TX; and at state funeral and cemetery regulatory offices in five states\u2014California, Florida, Maryland, New York, and Texas. We selected California, Florida, New York, and Texas because these states had the highest number of deaths of all 50 states in 1998. We selected Maryland because it had recently established a state regulatory agency with oversight responsibility for all but certain religious nonprofit cemeteries and because of Maryland\u2019s close proximity to our headquarters office.

At FTC, we reviewed data from FTC\u2019s Consumer Information System (CIS), which became fully operational in the fall of 1997 and is FTC\u2019s database of consumer complaints, inquiries, and requests for information. The CIS database contained a total of about 200 categories within which consumer complaints were included. The categories in CIS covered a wide range of topics, such as (1) creditor debt collection; (2) home repair; (3) investments; (4) health; and (5) leases for various products and services, such as automobiles and furniture. We identified one of those categories\u2014funeral services\u2014as the one that could most likely provide us information on consumers\u2019 complaints about death care issues. FTC provided data from CIS showing 834 records for fiscal year 1998.

In addition, at the other organizations we contacted, we discussed with officials the extent to which they may have collected and maintained readily available data on consumers\u2019 problems concerning death care issues and the types and extent of complaints they received. We also discussed with them the various reasons why such information was not readily available.", "To describe and assess FTC\u2019s efforts to ensure compliance with its Funeral Rule, we met with FTC officials to discuss regulatory practices, enforcement, and oversight of death care industries. We also obtained and reviewed pertinent laws, regulations, and FTC documents pertaining to the history of FTC\u2019s efforts to promulgate the Rule and enforce compliance. In addition, we reviewed FTC\u2019s manual for initiating, implementing, and concluding Funeral Rule test-shopping, sometimes called Funeral Rule sweeps; and we analyzed FTC records on funeral provider compliance with the Funeral Rule for fiscal years 1997 and 1998. Specifically, for these fiscal years, we requested the universe of records (596) that documented the results of FTC\u2019s Funeral Rule test-shopping efforts at funeral homes in various locations across the country. FTC could not provide 36 files because the regional office performing the sweep did not retain those records when a test-shopper did not find a problem.", "For each of the 560 available files, we used a standardized data collection instrument (DCI) that was designed to capture such information as whether the shopper received a general price list (GPL) or whether specific misrepresentations were made about matters like embalming. We also used the DCI to compile data from the available GPLs provided by funeral homes during the test-shopping. FTC could provide price lists for only 469 test-shops. FTC officials could not fully explain why the GPLs were missing from the records but stated several possible reasons. According to FTC officials, in one regional office, an FTC official used the GPLs from previous test-shopping experiences to train future test- shoppers. Also, an FTC official speculated that perhaps other price lists were missing because the GPL was not received from the test-shopper, or FTC lost the GPL from the records. We reviewed the available GPLs to determine whether identifying information and disclosures contained on them was required by the Funeral Rule. The identifying information we looked for was the name, address, and telephone number of the funeral home; the caption \u201cGeneral Price List\u201d; and the effective date of the GPL. We also reviewed the GPL for three required disclosure statements: \u201cThe goods and services shown below are those we can provide to our customers. You may choose only the items you desire. However, any funeral arrangements you select will include a charge for our basic services and overhead. If legal or other requirements mean you must buy any items you did not specifically ask for, we will explain the reason in writing on the statement we provide describing the funeral goods and services you selected.\u201d \u201cExcept in certain special cases, embalming is not required by law.", "Embalming may be necessary, however, if you select certain funeral arrangements, such as a funeral with viewing. If you do not want embalming, you usually have the right to choose an arrangement that does not require you to pay for it such as direct cremation or immediate burial.\u201d \u201cIf you want to arrange a direct cremation, you can use an alternative container. Alternative containers encase the body and can be made of materials like fiberboard or composition materials (with or without an outside covering). The containers we provide are (specify containers).\u201d", "The Funeral Rule also requires that the GPL contain other disclosures, such as a casket price list statement; and requires itemization of prices for certain goods and services, such as immediate burial. We did not review individual GPLs for compliance with these other items because of time and staffing constraints.", "In addition, we used the DCI to record what action FTC took, if any, in regard to potential Funeral Rule violations. We then analyzed these data to determine the number and type of potential Funeral Rule violations that may have occurred and whether FTC acted on them. We considered FTC to have taken action if it had sent a letter (1) to the funeral home advising the home of noncompliance and warning that additional action could occur if the home did not comply in the future, (2) offering the funeral provider the opportunity to enter NFDA\u2019s Funeral Rule Offender\u2019s Program (FROP) rather than be subject to civil penalty actions, or (3) notifying the funeral home that it was beginning full law enforcement proceedings on the basis of gross violations of the Funeral Rule.
