For this reason, it is critical that nuclear plant employees feel free to raise health and safety concerns without fear of retribution.", "Federal laws prohibit retaliation by power plant operators (licensees) or their contractors against employees who \u201cblow the whistle\u201d by surfacing health and safety issues. Protection is provided as follows: If discrimination occurs, employees are to receive restitution and sanctions may be imposed against employers. If employees believe the system established by these laws adequately protects them, they will be more willing to report hazards. Similarly, if licensees believe they will receive burdensome sanctions or other negative consequences when they discriminate against these employees, they will be unlikely to retaliate and the atmosphere at their plants will be one in which employees feel free to raise these concerns.", "You expressed concern that these laws, as they have been implemented by NRC and the Department of Labor, may not adequately protect nuclear power industry workers who raise health and safety issues. Your concern was based, in part, on problems surfaced in several recent studies that recommended improvements to the system.

We discussed the processes for protecting these employees with (1) cognizant NRC and Labor officials in both headquarters and field offices, (2) employees who had alleged discrimination and filed complaints with NRC and Labor, (3) managers at three licensees who had been involved in resolving numerous discrimination allegations, (4) attorneys who had represented both employees and licensees in these proceedings, and (5) advocates for both employees and licensees.

Its five commissioners are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, and its chairman is appointed by the president from among the commissioners.

NRC\u2019s mission includes ensuring that civilian use of nuclear materials in the United States\u2014in the operation of nuclear power plants and in medical, industrial, and research applications\u2014is done with adequate protection of public health and safety. NRC carries out its mission through licensing and regulatory oversight of nuclear reactor operations and other activities involving the possession and use of nuclear materials and wastes.", "Because it is impossible for NRC\u2019s inspections to detect all potential hazards, NRC must also rely on nuclear licensee employees to help identify such problems. Actions taken to respond to employee concerns raised in the past have significantly contributed to improving safety in the nuclear industry. Although most employee concerns are raised directly to licensee managers and are resolved internally by licensees, employees may choose to bring allegations directly to NRC. An employee generally raises a concern with NRC if he or she is not satisfied with the licensee\u2019s resolution of the concern or is not comfortable raising the concern internally. Employees may be discouraged from raising these issues internally if they believe their employer discriminates against those who do so. This phenomenon in the working environment is termed the \u201cchilling effect.\u201d", "Some observers believe that certain developments in the nuclear power industry increase the vulnerability of power plants to hazards, which would increase the importance of employee vigilance in noting and reporting hazards. For example, the electrical power industry may soon face deregulation, which would allow customers to choose a supplier and create competition in the industry that did not exist before. This has led to increased concern by NRC about safety because of the potential pressure on utilities to minimize operating costs. Preparation for deregulation has already resulted in downsizing at some nuclear plants and the closing of others because of their comparatively high operating costs. Furthermore, the nation\u2019s over 100 nuclear power plants are aging (most were built before 1980), which puts them increasingly at risk for certain kinds of hazards.", "Labor administers a variety of laws affecting conditions in the nation\u2019s work places, including laws to protect employees who report work place hazards. OSHA\u2019s responsibilities include investigating employee discrimination complaints under these laws, including the ERA.Investigations of employee discrimination cases are performed by a cadre of about 60 investigators. ERA cases make up a small percentage of the investigators\u2019 workload.", "In response to complaints by employees who raised health and safety concerns that they were not being protected from discrimination, NRC has studied and reported on the employee protection system. In 1992, NRC\u2019s OIG initiated a review to examine and better understand the nature of the complaints and the magnitude of this problem. In a July 1993 report, the OIG noted that employees who had raised concerns believed NRC did little to protect them from retaliation or to investigate in a timely manner their allegations of retaliation. In response to hearings before what was then the Subcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear Regulation of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, the NRC OIG issued a report in December 1993 that found NRC was primarily reactive to harassment and intimidation allegations and did not have a program to assess the work environment at licensees\u2019 facilities except when serious problems occurred. On July 6, 1993, NRC\u2019s Executive Director for Operations formed a review team to reassess NRC\u2019s process for protecting against retaliation those employees who raise health and safety concerns. The review team solicited input from employees who had alleged discrimination, licensees, and the public and, in a January 1994 report, concluded that the existing NRC and Labor processes, as then implemented, did not provide sufficient protection to these employees.", "In addition, in a May 1993 report, the Labor OIG referred to the office responsible for preparing the Secretary of Labor\u2019s final decisions as a \u201cburial ground\u201d for cases on which the Secretary and other Labor officials did not issue a final decision. The oldest 26 cases had been pending at this final stage for an average of 7.5 years, and there was a backlog of 178 cases\u2014129 of them involving complaints under the several laws Labor enforces pertaining to discrimination of workers who raise health and safety concerns\u2014that had been in that office for an average of 2.5 years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "System for Protecting Employees Involves Multiple Steps in Two Agencies", "paragraphs": ["NRC has the overall responsibility for ensuring that the nuclear plants it licenses are operated safely.

Under the Atomic Energy Act, as amended, NRC may take action against the employers it licenses when they are found to have discriminated against individual employees for raising health and safety concerns. Accordingly, NRC has established a process for investigating discrimination complaints and, if appropriate, taking enforcement action against licensees. The ERA, as amended, authorizes the Secretary of Labor to order employers to make restitution to the victims of such discrimination, and Labor has instituted a process for investigating and adjudicating discrimination complaints.

According to Labor, restitution can include reinstatement of the complainant to his or her former position with back pay, if warranted; award of compensatory damages; payment of attorney fees; and purging personnel files of any adverse references to the complaint. The Secretary is required to complete an initial investigation within 30 days and issue a final order within 90 days of the filing of the complaint.

Settlements between the parties may occur at any point in this process and are often made to minimize the expense and time involved for both the employee and the licensee in continuing a case. (The actual times for these steps are discussed in the next section under timeliness standards.)", "OSHA: To receive restitution for being discriminated against by a licensee, an employee must file a complaint with OSHA within 180 days of the alleged discriminatory act. OSHA must complete the initial investigation within 30 days, under the law. However, under Labor procedures, when necessary and preferably with the agreement of both parties, the 30-day limit may be exceeded. If either party does not agree with the OSHA decision, it may be appealed to Labor\u2019s Office of Administrative Law Judges (OALJ) within 5 calendar days.", "OALJ: Within 7 days of the appeal, the ALJ assigned to the case is to schedule a hearing. All parties must be given at least 5 days notice of the scheduled hearing. Federal regulations state that requests for postponement of the ALJ hearing may be granted for compelling reasons. The ALJ is required to submit a recommended decision within 20 days of the hearing.", "Office of the Secretary: The ALJ\u2019s recommended decision is automatically reviewed by the ARB within the Secretary of Labor\u2019s office.

Pursuant to the ERA, a final decision is not subject to judicial review in any criminal or other civil proceeding.", "For discrimination allegations filed directly with NRC or Labor, an NRC review panel, located in each regional office and headquarters, decides whether to request an investigation by NRC\u2019s Office of Investigations. The Investigations staff, in coordination with the regional administrator, decides the case\u2019s priority and whether they will do a full investigation. If Investigations determines that a violation occurred, or if a final determination of discrimination is received from Labor, NRC assesses the violation in accordance with its enforcement policy, which defines the level of severity and the appropriate sanction. Severity levels range from severity level I for the most significant violations to severity level IV for those of lesser concern. Minor violations are not subject to formal enforcement actions. One factor that determines the severity of a discrimination violation is the organizational level of the offender. For example, discrimination violations by senior corporate management would be severity level I, whereas violations by plant management above the first-line supervisor and by the first-line supervisor would be severity levels II and III, respectively. Another factor that might determine severity level is whether a hostile work environment existed.", "There are three primary enforcement actions available to NRC: Notice of Violation, civil penalty, and order.

These recommendations addressed concerns expressed by many of the allegers we interviewed.", "Regarding case monitoring, NRC has designated a full-time, senior official to centrally coordinate allegation information from NRC and Labor, and oversee the management of and periodically audit the allegation process at NRC. NRC established the position of Agency Allegation Advisor in February 1995, and since then, two rounds of audits of the allegation process have been completed. In September 1996, the Agency Allegation Advisor issued the first annual report on the status of the allegation system, which addressed issues previously identified through audits and data gathered on allegations. These actions give NRC a focal point for gathering and publishing information on how its allegation process is working and enable it to recognize problems.", "Some recommendations implemented by NRC should improve communication. One of these recommended improving feedback to employees on the status of their cases. As of May 1996, new procedures established time frames for NRC to periodically report case status to employees. The procedures required NRC to inform the alleger in writing of the status of his or her case within 30 days of NRC\u2019s receipt of the allegation, every 6 months thereafter, and again within 30 days of completing the investigation. NRC has also established a hotline through which employees can report problems and issued a policy statement emphasizing the importance of licensees maintaining an environment in which employees are comfortable raising health and safety concerns. These new procedures address issues allegers raised with us about not being informed on the status of their cases. However, some allegers told us that because the policy statement is directed only at the licensees\u2019 responsibilities for maintaining a good work environment and does not include specific responsibilities for NRC, it is not adequate.", "To increase NRC\u2019s involvement in the allegation process, the January 1994 study recommended that NRC revise the criteria for selecting complaints to be investigated in order to expand the number of investigations. Before October 1993, NRC had investigated few discrimination complaints and usually waited for the Labor Secretary\u2019s final decision, which generally took longer than an NRC investigation, before taking enforcement action. In October 1993, NRC Investigations\u2019 policy was changed to require that field offices open a case and conduct an evaluation of all matters involving discrimination complaints, regardless of Labor\u2019s involvement. In April 1996, NRC issued a policy statement directing its Office of Investigations to investigate all high-priority allegations of discrimination, whether the Labor Secretary\u2019s final decision has been made or not, and to devote the resources necessary to complete these investigations. As a result, the number of high-priority investigations NRC opened has increased significantly. By applying the new criteria, the percentage of cases opened that were high priority increased from 37 percent in May 1996 to 81 percent in July 1996. These actions should address the dissatisfaction employees expressed to both NRC\u2019s OIG and us about NRC\u2019s lack of involvement in the investigation of cases. However, NRC has identified a need for more resources at the Office of Investigations to handle the greater number of investigations, and as of December 1996, this need had not been addressed. Therefore, it is unclear whether the investigations can be completed as quickly as hoped.", "Labor has also improved its timeliness in processing cases, as recommended in the Labor OIG\u2019s May 1993 report. Labor has eliminated a backlog of cases awaiting decision in the Office of the Secretary and has developed and implemented a management information system to monitor case activity. Since these changes were implemented, the average time for the Secretary\u2019s office to decide cases has been reduced from about 3 years in fiscal year 1994 to about 1.3 years in fiscal year 1996. A Labor official told us that as of December 1996, the average case took only about 4 months to clear the Office of the Secretary, due partially to the elimination of the backlog.", "In addition, to better use program expertise, Labor has transferred responsibility for investigation of allegation cases from the Wage and Hour Division to OSHA, which has a staff with experience investigating allegations of discrimination against employees who raise health and safety concerns. The Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employee Standards commented that the primary purpose of reassigning initial investigations from Wage and Hour to OSHA was part of an exchange of responsibilities. Prior to the reassignment, OSHA had responsibility for the employee protection, or \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d provisions of certain laws and the staff devoted to the enforcement of these provisions. The Wage and Hour Division was responsible for certain employee protections affecting farm workers and would be able to make field sanitation inspections as part of its regular investigations. These responsibilities were exchanged in order to better use program expertise and promote effective and efficient use of resources.

Lengthy cases increase attorney fees, prolong the time an employee may be out of work, and have a chilling effect on other employees. Under past policies, which provided for few NRC investigations, long cases delayed NRC\u2019s ability to impose enforcement actions as they waited for Labor decisions. Some cases that allegers have filed have continued for over 5 years, and during that time the employee may be out of work, paying attorney fees, and exhausting his or her financial resources. Furthermore, the January 1994 NRC report noted that delays in processing cases at the Office of the Secretary of Labor had, in some cases, prevented NRC from taking enforcement action against licensees because the time limits under the statute of limitations had run out.", "The Labor OIG report recommended that Labor establish a timeliness standard for the issuance of Secretary of Labor decisions and conduct an analysis to determine operational changes and resources necessary to meet the new standard. Establishing a standard was intended to provide a means to objectively measure Labor\u2019s performance during the final step of its process and help meet legal requirements and customer service expectations. In September 1995, in its closing comments on this review, the OIG stated that Labor would need time to develop data on which to base a realistic timeliness standard and that the standard would be developed in the future when the data are available. A Labor official told us the standard is now being developed and that Labor expects to have a standard soon, although no date for implementation has been established. According to the Chairman of the ARB, the ARB is continuing to work on putting procedures in place to collect data that could be used to establish a standard.", "In addition, the NRC review team report recommended that Labor develop legislation to amend the law to establish a realistic timeliness standard for the entire Labor process. As of December 1996, NRC was drafting legislation for Labor\u2019s approval that would establish a new timeliness standard of 480 days to complete the Labor process. This would allow 120 days for the administrative investigation, 30 days to appeal the decision to the OALJ, 240 days for the OALJ to recommend a decision, and 90 days for a final decision from the Secretary. According to NRC, the intent in proposing more realistic timeliness standards is that there is more incentive to try to meet standards that are achievable than those that normally cannot be met. These proposals were based on comparisons with baseline data from investigations done under other related statutes and proposed legislation considered in the 101st Congress. For example, the review team reported that OSHA investigations under other employee protection statutes took, on average, 120 days. Labor officials have indicated that they would support this legislation.", "Our review of processing times in each of Labor\u2019s three offices showed that meeting the new standards would require a significant change in how these cases are processed. For cases processed in fiscal year 1994 through the first 9 months of fiscal year 1996, the proposed time frames were not met for all cases in any of the three offices. For 164 cases investigated by the Wage and Hour Division during this period, only 16 percent of the investigations were completed within the 30 days currently mandated by law and an additional 46 percent would have met the proposed time frame of 120 days. (See fig. 2.) These investigations took an average of 128 days, with a range of 1 day to over 2 years, to complete. OSHA officials said that during the pilot study for transferring the initial investigative responsibility to their office from Wage and Hour, they found it very difficult to meet the 30-day mandate and had to ask for extensions in several cases.", "During this same period, 56 percent of OALJ\u2019s recommended decisions and orders would have met the proposed time frame of 240 days. OALJ took an average of 271 days (9 months) to issue 118 recommended decisions and orders. The time for these decisions ranged from less than 30 days to over 3 years. Currently, there is no time frame specifically for the OALJ step of the process. Even though the act provides for a 90-day time frame for moving from initial investigation to a final decision, extensions were requested by the parties in virtually all cases we reviewed. One reason for this is that the OALJ hearing is de novo\u2014it essentially starts the process over again because it does not consider the results of the Wage and Hour investigation. In addition, Labor officials told us that these extensions were necessary to allow additional time for discovery and review of evidence by legal counsels of both parties in preparation for the hearing. In commenting on a draft of this report, Labor\u2019s Chief Administrative Law Judge stated that 240 days is an achievable goal if the following factors are addressed: establishment of a mechanism to extend the time frame in appropriate recognition that existing case law conflicts with a strict time limit on discovery and hearing, and availability of adequate staff.", "For the final step in the process, our data showed significant improvement in the time it took to obtain decisions from the Secretary of Labor, but even in the most recent year we analyzed, only 37 percent would have met the proposed 90-day time frame. (See fig. 4.) The average time to decide 217 cases in the Secretary\u2019s office decreased from about 3.3 years in fiscal year 1994 to about 1.3 years (16 months) in fiscal year 1996. In commenting on a draft of this report, the Chairman of the ARB noted that the current policy gives the parties 75 days to file all the briefs. In most cases, an extension is requested by at least one of the parties. Therefore, in his opinion, a 90-day timeliness standard is unrealistic unless ARB severely restricts the parties\u2019 ability to properly brief the issues pressed.", "Both monitoring of individual cases and monitoring trends in allegations are important oversight activities. Monitoring the individual cases as they progress is a way to determine whether cases are being resolved in a timely way. Monitoring trends in allegations would help NRC\u2019s Agency Allegation Advisor in overseeing the system\u2019s effectiveness.", "The NRC report recommended that NRC improve its Allegation Management System to be able to both monitor allegations from receipt to the completion of agency action, and to analyze trends. It could also help improve agency responsiveness, such as when monitoring reveals sudden increases in the time for cases to be resolved, and helps identify licensees who may warrant closer scrutiny, such as a licensee that shows a sharp increase in the number of cases against it or settled by it. NRC agrees with the recommendation and has implemented a new system in its regional offices and in the two headquarters offices with direct regulatory oversight, which officials say will have the capability to track cases through each step of the process. However, at the time of our review, the system did not yet include data from the Offices of Investigations and Enforcement, nor did it include on-line Labor investigation data.", "Our findings highlight the need for the data tracking system to include the period of time that a case is at Labor. For example, Labor has separate databases and case identifiers at Wage and Hour and OALJ, and the cases cannot easily be matched. As a result, neither Labor nor we can describe the total time it takes cases to be resolved at Labor. In addition, of the 217 cases for which the Secretary of Labor had made a final determination, 22 had no such decision recorded in NRC files. While only one of these cases resulted in a decision of discrimination, this is significant because NRC\u2019s policy is to hold open its enforcement action on complaints until notified that the Secretary has made a final determination. However, without an NRC investigation or an ALJ finding of discrimination, the 5-year limit on civil penalties could be exceeded. NRC officials told us that they have contacted Labor and requested copies of the 22 decisions to update their files.", "The number of settlements found in our analysis also underscores the significance of the NRC review team report\u2019s recommendation that NRC should track trends in cases closed with a settlement without a finding of discrimination. NRC currently has no systematic way of knowing the extent to which settlements are made by individual licensees or when in the process they occur. Yet, our data showed that numerous settlements occurred at all steps in the process: Wage and Hour settled 22 of its 164 cases; the OALJ recommended settlement approval for 49 of the 118 cases on which it issued recommended decisions; and the Secretary of Labor approved settlements in 74 of the 217 allegations on which final decisions were issued. Labor\u2019s policy is to attempt to conciliate allegations in every case; only if conciliation fails does it proceed with a fact-finding investigation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NRC Knowledge of Work Environment", "paragraphs": ["NRC acknowledges that employee identification of problems is an important part of its system to ensure nuclear power plant safety. NRC also recognizes that the perception of discrimination may be even more important than actual findings in terms of affecting employees\u2019 willingness to report health and safety concerns. Therefore, NRC needs not only factual findings of discrimination but also a way to measure employee perception of discrimination.", "NRC\u2019s December 1994 OIG report, however, noted that although NRC\u2019s management of discrimination issues focuses on encouraging licensees to foster a retaliation-free work environment, NRC has no program to assess licensees\u2019 work environments except when a serious problem such as a discrimination suit has already occurred. At about the same time, NRC\u2019s review team also concluded that NRC did not have a quantitative understanding of the number of employees who were hesitant to raise these kinds of concerns. Consequently, the review team commissioned Battelle Human Affairs Research Center to study methods for credibly assessing employee feelings about raising health and safety concerns. The Battelle study recommended a three-part strategy for development, implementation, and follow-up validation of the results of a mail-out workforce survey of a sample of nuclear power plants. This approach was then reflected in the NRC review team report\u2019s recommendation that NRC develop a survey to assess a licensee\u2019s work environment.", "The review team report\u2019s recommendation was prompted, in part, by its recognition of the limitations of some of the assessments NRC had done in the past, such as one-on-one interviews of licensee employees conducted by NRC inspectors. The problem with having NRC inspectors conduct such interviews was illustrated by a September 1996 NRC-chartered study of how employee concerns and allegations are handled at the Millstone power plant. This study concluded that NRC inspectors, in general, understated the extent of the chilling effect at plants and therefore are not qualified to independently detect or assess the work environment at licensee facilities. The Millstone report concluded that NRC\u2019s efforts to gain information on the work environment had not been effective and furthermore cited NRC\u2019s failure to develop a credible survey instrument as one example of the lack of progress toward this end that has lowered public confidence in NRC\u2019s commitment to improve its performance in addressing employee concerns.", "Nevertheless, NRC\u2019s September 1996 annual report on the status of the allegation system stated that NRC had decided not to implement the recommendation to develop a survey instrument. The report cited a staff recommendation made in November 1994 to not develop a survey because of the cost to develop and process it and the expectation that other actions implemented as a result of the review team report would yield the needed information on work environment.", "Because employees\u2019 feelings about how NRC handles its allegations process would also affect their willingness to raise health or safety concerns, the review team report recommended that NRC develop a standard form and include it with alleger close-out correspondence to solicit feedback from employees on the way NRC handled their allegations. NRC developed the form and conducted a pilot in December 1995 in which it sent the form to 145 employees; it received feedback from 44. It analyzed comments and acted to address concerns raised. An NRC official said the agency plans to again send the form in 1997 to another sample of employees. After analyzing the 1997 responses, NRC will decide whether to routinely include the form in all close-out correspondence and thereby fully implement the recommendation.", "In addition, when a finding of discrimination results from an administrative investigation at Labor, NRC issues a \u201cchilling effect\u201d letter asking the licensee to describe actions it has taken or plans to take to remove any chilling effect that may have occurred. The review team and OIG reports both noted that NRC does little follow-up on the actions reported by licensees in response to these letters. This follow-up is necessary not only to verify a licensee\u2019s actions but also to enable NRC to learn the effect of the discrimination finding on the plant\u2019s work environment. Both reports also noted that guidance is needed on when additional NRC action may be necessary if a licensee receives more than one chilling effect letter over a relatively short period of time because this may indicate a serious problem at the plant. NRC has issued guidance that each chilling effect letter should carry an enforcement number so that it can be tracked, but systematic tracking is not currently done. NRC has not developed guidance on how it will follow up on licensee actions or on what actions it should take when a licensee receives multiple chilling effect letters. NRC officials told us they intend to fully implement the recommendation to establish follow-up procedures for chilling effect letters, but they have no schedule for doing so."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Relief of Financial Burden", "paragraphs": ["Allegers and agency officials expressed strong concern about the financial burden on employees in the current protection process. They attributed this burden to the extensive time it took to obtain a final decision, during which the alleger must pay attorney fees and, in some cases, go without pay.", "One NRC review team report recommendation would provide relief through a statutory change to provide that Labor defend its findings of discrimination from the initial investigation at the ALJ hearing if Labor\u2019s decision is appealed by the employer. The review team noted that this would avoid the perception that the government is leaving the employees to defend themselves after being retaliated against for raising health and safety concerns. After soliciting comments on this proposal in the Federal Register in March 1994 to do by regulation what the recommendation proposed be done by statute, Labor again stated in a March 26, 1996, letter to NRC that it supports having this authority. But Labor also stated that because of the resources needed to meet this added responsibility, if it is granted, Labor expects to exercise this authority selectively and cautiously.", "The NRC review team report also recommended that the law be amended to allow employees to be reinstated to their previous positions after the initial investigation finds discrimination, even if the case is appealed to the OALJ. Currently, section 211 provides that Labor may order reinstatement following a public hearing. As of January 1997, NRC was drafting legislation that would implement this recommendation.", "In addition, the review team report recommended that, in certain cases, NRC should ask the licensee to provide the employee with a holding period that would maintain or restore pay and benefits until a finding is issued. A holding period would basically maintain current pay and benefits for the period between the filing of a discrimination complaint and an initial administrative finding by Labor. NRC ultimately decided not to require licensees to establish holding periods. However, a May 1, 1996, policy statement on licensees\u2019 responsibilities for maintaining a safety-conscious work environment stated that if a licensee does provide a holding period, NRC would consider such action as a mitigating factor in any enforcement decisions if discrimination is found to have occurred. Allegers we interviewed generally had mixed responses to the holding period recommendation. Although they generally supported the financial relief that would be provided, some expressed concern that licensees could misuse the holding period to remove an employee from operational duties when this is not warranted. Both the report and allegers believed safeguards should be established for the proper implementation of this recommendation. Licensees also again had reservations about being required to retain an employee who could later be found to be justifiably dismissed. While NRC officials told us the agency is considering requesting the holding period under some conditions, the original position not to implement the recommendation has not changed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increased Penalties", "paragraphs": ["The NRC review team report recommended that NRC seek an amendment to the Atomic Energy Act to increase the civil penalty from $100,000 to $500,000 a day for each discrimination violation. The maximum penalty in effect at the time of the report was $100,000, established in 1980. This recommendation was meant to make the civil penalty a more effective deterrent to licensee discrimination. In May 1994, NRC ordered a review of the agency\u2019s enforcement process, part of which focused on civil penalty increases in the context of enforcement. This review concluded that increasing incentives for strong self-monitoring and corrective action programs would be better accomplished by revising the overall civil penalty assessment process than by raising the penalty amounts and that therefore no increase was needed. Recommendations made by the review team report to revise the assessment process were accepted and implemented through agency directives. NRC agreed with the report\u2019s conclusion and decided not to seek an increase in civil penalties.", "Allegers and some others we interviewed agreed with the review team report that a $100,000 penalty was not an effective deterrent. They had mixed opinions, however, as to whether even an increase to $500,000 would be a sufficient deterrent. Some said the only sanction that really had an impact on licensees was shutting down a plant. Others said that negative publicity had a stronger impact than a civil penalty.", "The review team report also recommended that NRC make the penalty for all willful violations equal to the penalty currently reserved for the most severe violations. For example, under current procedures, discriminatory actions by a first-line supervisor are considered lesser violations, and receive lesser penalties, than violations that involve a higher level manager, even if they are found to be willful violations. For the same reasons cited for not requesting an increase in civil penalties, NRC decided not to implement this recommendation."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The joint NRC and Labor process for resolving allegations of discrimination by nuclear licensees against employees who raise health and safety concerns is intended to discourage discrimination, thereby fostering an atmosphere in which employees feel free to report hazards. But it is unrealistic to expect employees to raise such issues if they believe they may be retaliated against for doing so, the process for seeking restitution will be expensive and lengthy, and they will receive minimal attention and support from the federal government. In response to these concerns, both NRC and Labor have acted on OIG and agency recommendations to enhance their management of nuclear employee discrimination cases. The resulting changes should improve monitoring of the process, increase NRC involvement, and augment licensees\u2019 responsiveness to employee concerns. However, recommendations that would establish standards for timely decisions, permit monitoring of individual cases from start to finish and assessment of overall trends, and enable NRC to measure the work environment at nuclear plants for raising concerns have not been implemented.", "Improvements in the timeliness of decisions would not only help ensure that employees feel more comfortable in reporting hazards and expedite information to NRC for enforcement actions, but also decrease the financial burden on allegers. At this point, it is unclear whether the time standard recommended by NRC would decrease that burden sufficiently or whether other recommendations for decreasing the financial burden would also need to be implemented to address allegers\u2019 concerns. Nevertheless, establishing and meeting some standard that prevents cases from languishing for many years would greatly improve the present system.", "Many changes made by NRC were intended to increase its involvement in the protection system and to make the agency proactive in its role. In order to do this, NRC needs more knowledge of the process than it has had in the past. For example, the Agency Allegation Advisor needs a revised tracking system that will monitor trends so that the agency can address problems suggested by those trends. Although this revised tracking system was recommended over 3 years ago and NRC has begun its implementation, the system still does not incorporate vital elements. These elements include current data on cases in the Labor process, data on all settled cases, and information on NRC headquarters inspection and enforcement. It is crucial that NRC management follow through to full implementation of this system so that it can develop trend data for better monitoring and make better-informed decisions on investigations and enforcement actions. Including the Labor data, however, will also require commitment from Labor as well as NRC, and effective coordination between the two agencies.", "Because information from employees on health and safety problems is critical for NRC to ensure public safety, NRC must know whether employees at nuclear plants are comfortable raising such concerns. Determining the existence of a perception is not an easy task and may require the use of more than one method of gathering information to obtain such knowledge. Several methods, including surveying, developing indicators to flag possible problems, tracking cases and settlements in individual plants, using feedback forms to find out how employees believe their allegations have been handled, and following up on chilling effect letters have been recommended to NRC, but none of these methods have been implemented to date."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To improve the timeliness of Labor\u2019s allegations processing, we recommend that the Secretary of Labor establish and meet realistic timeliness standards for all three steps in its process for investigating discrimination complaints by employees in the nuclear power industry.", "To improve NRC\u2019s ability to monitor the allegation process, we recommend that the Chairman, NRC, complete implementation of the NRC review team\u2019s recommendation to establish and operate the revised Allegation Management System in all organizational components within NRC.
