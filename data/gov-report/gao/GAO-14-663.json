Participating agencies were the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, Transportation (DOT), and the Treasury. According to several working group participants, the working group included relevant subject-matter experts and the agencies likely to use the estimates in future rulemakings. According to OMB staff, there is no single approach for convening informal interagency working groups and no requirement that this type of working group should document its activities or proceedings. However, OMB and EPA participants stated that the working group documented all major issues discussed in the Technical Support Document, which is consistent with federal standards for internal control. According to the Technical Support Document and participants GAO interviewed, the working group's processes and methods reflected the following three principles:", "Used consensus-based decision making. The working group used a consensus-based approach for making key decisions in developing the 2010 and 2013 estimates. Participants generally stated that they were satisfied that the Technical Support Document addressed individual comments on draft versions and reflected the overall consensus of the working group.", "Relied on existing academic literature and models. The working group relied largely on existing academic literature and models to develop its estimates. Specifically, the working group used three prevalent academic models that integrate climate and economic data to estimate future economic effects from climate change. The group agreed on three modeling inputs reflecting the wide uncertainty in the academic literature, including discount rates. Once the group reached agreement, EPA officials\u2014sometimes with the assistance of the model developers\u2014calculated the estimates. All other model assumptions and features were unchanged by the working group, which weighted each model equally to calculate estimates. After the academic models were updated to reflect new scientific information, such as in sea level rise and associated damages, the working group used the updated models to revise its estimates in 2013, resulting in higher estimates.", "Took steps to disclose limitations and incorporate new information. The Technical Support Document discloses several limitations of the estimates and areas that the working group identified as being in need of additional research. It also sets a goal of revisiting the estimates when substantially updated models become available. Since 2008, agencies have published dozens of regulatory actions for public comment that use various social cost of carbon estimates in regulatory analyses and, according to working group participants, agencies received many comments on the estimates throughout this process. Several participants told GAO that the working group decided to revise the estimates in 2013 after a number of public comments encouraged revisions because the models used to develop the 2010 estimates had been updated and used in peer-reviewed academic literature."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["To encourage a regulatory system that protects and improves health,  safety, the environment, and the economy, without imposing  unreasonable costs on society, federal agencies are required to assess  the economic effects of proposed significant regulatory actions. Agencies  can use regulatory impact analysis to assess whether a proposed  regulation\u2019s benefits justify the costs. For example, regulations aimed at  benefiting society by decreasing health risks associated with air pollution  may require regulated entities, such as power plants, to incur costs for  installing pollution control technologies. According to Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) officials, beginning in 2008, some agencies\u2019  regulatory impact analyses incorporated estimates of the social cost of  carbon, which agencies use to value the net effects of reducing or  increasing carbon dioxide emissions. In 2009, in part because agencies  used varying estimates of the social cost of carbon, the Executive Office  of the President\u2019s (EOP) Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and  Council of Economic Advisers convened an interagency working group to  develop social cost of carbon estimates for federal agencies to use in  their regulatory impact analyses. The working group finalized its  estimates in 2010 and included them in a document\u2014called the Technical  Support Document\u2014that also provides guidance for agencies on using  the estimates. In May 2013, the working group issued an update to the  Technical Support Document that included revised estimates of the social  cost of carbon.

Under the executive order, for regulatory actions expected to meet this  threshold, or economically significant regulatory actions, agencies must  also assess costs and benefits of reasonably feasible alternatives and  explain why the planned regulatory action is preferable to the identified  alternatives. For each significant regulatory action, the agency is to  develop the proposed regulation and associated regulatory impact  analysis and submit them to OMB for formal review. After OMB concludes  its review, the agency is to publish the proposed rule in the Federal  Register for public comment. The agency is to issue a document  summarizing its consideration of the public comments and, if appropriate,  modify the proposed rule in response to the comments. This phase of  regulatory development may also include further internal and external  review. For significant regulatory actions, the agency is to submit the final  regulatory impact analysis and regulation to OMB for review before it  publishes the final rule.", "In 2003, OMB issued Circular A-4 to provide guidance to federal agencies  on the development of regulatory analysis as directed by Executive Order  12866. Circular A-4 states that it is designed to assist agencies by  defining good regulatory analysis and standardizing the way benefits and  costs of federal regulatory actions are measured and reported. In  particular, the guidance provides for systematic evaluation of qualitative  and quantitative benefits and costs, including their monetization. Circular  A-4 also provides guidance on the selection of discount rates to adjust the  estimated benefits and costs for differences in timing. According to  Circular A-4, a regulatory impact analysis should include an evaluation of  the benefits and costs of the proposed action and any reasonable  alternatives, as well as a description of assumptions and uncertainty. It  acknowledges that agencies cannot analyze all regulations according to a  formula, and that different regulations may call for different emphases in  the analysis. Executive Order 13563, which reaffirmed and supplemented  Executive Order 12866 in 2011, generally directs federal agencies to  conduct regulatory actions based on the best available science. It also  directs agencies to use the best available techniques to quantify benefits  and costs accurately.", "Federal agencies began including estimates of the social cost of carbon  in regulatory impact analyses following a decision by the U.S. Court of  Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Specifically, in 2006, the Department of  Transportation\u2019s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)  issued a final rule on fuel economy standards for certain vehicles which,  like other regulations at the time, did not include estimates of the social  cost of carbon. The final rule stated that the agency had identified a  benefit from a significant reduction in carbon dioxide emissions but stated  that the dollar value of the benefit could not be determined because of the  wide variation in published estimates of the social cost of carbon. In 2008,  in response to a challenge from 11 states and several other  organizations, the Ninth Circuit held that NHTSA had acted arbitrarily and  capriciously by failing to monetize the value of carbon emissions  reduction and directed NHTSA to include such a monetized value in an  updated regulatory impact analysis for the regulation. The court stated  that, \u201chile the record shows that there is a range of values, the value of  carbon emissions reduction is certainly not zero.\u201d Following the court\u2019s  decision, the Department of Energy, the Department of Transportation,  and EPA incorporated a variety of individually developed estimates of the  social cost of carbon into their regulatory analyses. These estimates were  derived from academic literature and ranged, in general, from $0 to $159  (in 2006, 2007, or 2008 dollars) per metric ton of carbon dioxide emitted  in 2007. They also varied in whether they reflected domestic or global  measures of the social cost of carbon.", "In early 2009, in part to improve consistency in agencies\u2019 use of social  cost of carbon estimates for regulatory impact analysis, OMB\u2019s Office of  Information and Regulatory Affairs and the Council of Economic Advisers  convened the Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Carbon. The  working group developed interim governmentwide social cost of carbon  estimates based on an average of selected estimates published in  academic literature. The interim estimates first appeared\u2014and, thus,  were first available for public review\u2014in August 2009 in the Department  of Energy\u2019s final rule on energy standards for vending machines.  Agencies subsequently incorporated the interim estimates into several  published regulatory actions that sought public comments to inform the  development of final estimates for future use. The middle or \u201ccentral\u201d  value for the range of interim estimates was $19 (in 2006 dollars) per  metric ton of carbon dioxide emitted in 2007.", "In October 2009, after developing the interim estimates, the working  group reassembled to begin developing the final social cost of carbon  estimates issued in the Technical Support Document. While the Technical  Support Document is dated February 2010, it was first released publicly in  March 2010 as an appendix to the Department of Energy\u2019s final rule on  energy standards for small electric motors. Subsequently, dozens of  published regulatory actions incorporated the estimates. The Technical  Support Document states that the working group agreed to regularly  update the social cost of carbon estimates as the research underlying the  estimates evolves. In June 2013, after using the 2010 estimates in an  earlier proposal of the rule, the Department of Energy\u2019s final rule on  energy standards for microwaves was the first regulatory action to  incorporate the revised estimates developed by the working group in the  2013 update to the Technical Support Document.

The former Deputy Assistant Secretary  for Environment and Energy at the Department of the Treasury stated that  he was invited to participate in the working group because of his prior  experience researching ways to discount costs and benefits across  generations. In addition, the former Administrator of the Energy  Information Administration told us that he was asked to participate, in  part, based on his previous experience evaluating climate models while  conducting research with the National Academy of Sciences. According to  an OMB staff member, the six participating federal agencies were also  responsible for ensuring that they provided adequate technical expertise  to the working group. Agency representatives included environmental  economists and climate scientists, among other key professionals.

These OMB staff members said that, instead of  being organized under a written agreement or other requirements, the  working group was an informal interagency working group with no charter  or other convening document. According to OMB staff, there was no  requirement that the informal working group should document its activities  or proceedings, including the meetings held or specific discussions that  occurred at each. However, OMB staff and EPA officials stated that all  major issues discussed during working group meetings are documented  in the Technical Support Document and its 2013 update, which is  consistent with the control activities standard in the federal standards for  internal control.

Specifically, they told us that,  following the meetings, officials from the Council of Economic Advisers  summarized the group discussions to include in the latest draft of the  Technical Support Document and circulated draft sections of the  Technical Support Document for the working group to review. For  example, a participant told us that he raised concerns about whether the  Technical Support Document provided adequate information on domestic  measures of the social cost of carbon. The participant said that, in  response to this feedback, the working group decided to include a  separate discussion in the Technical Support Document on estimating  domestic benefits and costs. The Technical Support Document states that  reported domestic effects should be calculated using a range of values  from 7 to 23 percent of the global measure of the social cost of carbon,  although it cautions that these values are approximate, provisional, and  highly speculative due to limited evidence. None of the participants we  spoke with expressed concerns about how their contributions were  incorporated into the final Technical Support Document.

Many participants confirmed that the working group  relied largely on existing academic literature and models to develop its  estimates. According to the Technical Support Document and many  participants we spoke with, the working group calculated its estimates  using three models that integrate climate and economic data into a single  modeling framework for estimating future economic effects resulting from  climate change. In general, each model translates carbon dioxide  emissions scenarios into changes in greenhouse gas concentrations in  the atmosphere, greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere into  temperature changes, and temperature changes into net economic  effects (i.e., damages and benefits). However, each model uses its own  methods to estimate these effects. The Technical Support Document  states that the three models are frequently cited in peer-reviewed  literature. They have also been used in climate assessments by the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2014an organization within the  United Nations that assesses scientific, technical, and economic  information on the effects of climate change. In addition, the National  Research Council of the National Academies recognized these three  models as three of the most widely used models of their kind.", "Many participants told us that the working group spent most of its meeting  time reviewing and discussing academic literature to help decide on  values for three key modeling inputs to run in each model. The key  modeling inputs the working group selected were based on data from  prevalent research organizations, such as the Stanford Energy Modeling  Forum, and reflected the wide uncertainty in the academic literature,  according to the Technical Support Document. These inputs were as  follows:  scenarios for future population and economic growth (i.e., gross  domestic product) and carbon dioxide emissions, a measure of the climate\u2019s responsiveness to increased  concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere\u2014known as  equilibrium climate sensitivity, and discount rates.", "Several participants told us that different meetings focused on different  modeling inputs and included technical presentations by participants with  expertise in each technical area. For example, due to their previous  experience working with the models, EPA officials made presentations on  how each model works. OMB staff stated that the technical presentations  focused on the academic materials cited in the Technical Support  Document, including dozens of peer-reviewed journal articles. They also  said that all technical decisions discussed in the Technical Support  Document were arrived at by consensus through this process. Several  participants said that a significant amount of the group\u2019s discussions  focused on selecting discount rates that best reflect the most current  academic literature, while also comporting with OMB\u2019s guidance in  Circular A-4. The Technical Support Document cites guidance from  Circular A-4 in its discussion of many technical topics, including its  selection of discount rates. It states that the discount rate (i.e., 3 percent)  used to calculate the central value of the social cost of carbon estimates  is consistent with Circular A-4 guidance. Some working group participants  told us that they recognized the importance of using OMB guidance,  including Circular A-4, in developing the Technical Support Document.  The Technical Support Document states that the working group decided  to calculate estimates for several discount rates (2.5, 3, and 5 percent)  because the academic literature shows that the social cost of carbon is  highly sensitive to the discount rate chosen, and because no consensus  exists on the appropriate rate. It further states that, in light of such  uncertainties, the working group determined that these three discount  rates reflect reasonable judgments about the appropriate rate to use.  Several participants stated that the working group chose this approach to  capture varied concerns and interests, including participants\u2019 respective  knowledge of the academic literature, on selecting the discount rate.", "Once the working group agreed on these modeling inputs, EPA officials  supervised their use in running the models to calculate the social cost of  carbon estimates. All other model assumptions and features were  unchanged by the working group, which weighted each model equally to  calculate the final estimates. Several participants stated that an important  principle for the leaders of the working group was that the working group  reach consensus on the modeling inputs before running the models and  agree, in advance, to accept the results based on the inputs selected,  whatever the outcome. Through this approach, the working group  developed a set of four social cost of carbon estimates for use in  regulatory impact analyses. The first three values are based on the  average of the estimates produced by all three models and selected  modeling inputs at the three discount rates chosen. The fourth value was  included to represent higher-than-expected economic impacts from  climate change, and it is based on an average of certain values produced  by each model at a 3 percent discount rate. To capture uncertainties  involved in regulatory impact analysis, the Technical Support Document  emphasizes the importance of agencies considering all four estimates  when conducting analyses.", "According to EPA documentation and several participants, groups from  outside the federal government did not participate in the working group,  but the working group used some outside resources, specifically technical  assistance. As noted in the Technical Support Document, the working  group explored technical literature in relevant fields for developing the  social cost of carbon estimates. Members of the working group  sometimes contacted researchers or developers of key data in an effort to  ensure that the working group had a clear understanding of the  information and how to use it. For example, according to several  participants, members of the working group consulted with lead authors of  a chapter on climate sensitivity that appears in the Fourth Assessment  Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. According to  the Technical Support Document, after consulting with the chapter  authors, the working group was able to make some decisions to assist  with statistical analyses needed to develop the social cost of carbon  estimates. Many participants stated that the working group also consulted  with the developers of the models used by the group to develop the  estimates. For example, EPA officials told us that, while they conducted  runs for one model that was readily available to the public, they spent a  few days training with the developer of a second model before using it to  conduct runs. They also contracted with the developer of a third model to  run the model according to the decisions reached by the working group.  They stated that they ran all of the 2013 estimates themselves, but that  they continued to consult with the model developers to do so.", "According to many participants and the 2013 update to the Technical  Support Document, the only changes made to the models used for the  2013 revisions were those that the model developers incorporated into  the latest versions of the models and that were subsequently used in  peer-reviewed academic literature. Specifically, the developers updated  the academic models to reflect new scientific information, such as in sea  level rise and associated damages, resulting in higher estimates. The  working group did not make changes in the modeling inputs that it used  for the 2010 estimates. Several participants said that, while the original  working group included frequent, hours-long meetings over several  months, the working group assembled to discuss the 2013 revisions only  met a few times. According to the 2010 Technical Support Document, the  working group is committed to updating its estimates as the science and  economic understanding of climate change and its impacts on society  improve over time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Took Steps to Disclose Limitations and Incorporate New Information", "paragraphs": ["According to several participants and the Technical Support Document,  the working group\u2019s processes and methods took steps to disclose  limitations and incorporate new information by considering public  comments and revising the estimates as updated economic and scientific  research became available. The Technical Support Document discusses  several limitations of its estimates and areas that the working group  identified as being in particular need of additional exploration and  research. For example, it points out that none of the three models  accounts for damages from wildlife loss or ocean acidification caused by  carbon dioxide emissions. Also, the models cannot completely predict  how technology may adapt to warmer temperatures. In addition,  according to the Technical Support Document, the models may not fully  consider the effects of damages due to potential catastrophic events,  such as the melting of Antarctic ice sheets. As a result of such limitations,  the models may underestimate damages from increased carbon  emissions, according to the Technical Support Document. The Technical  Support Document states that, as a result of these limitations, the social  cost of carbon estimates should continue to evolve as knowledge is  gained, and available models improve. Some of the participating agencies  have incorporated discussions of these limitations into regulatory impact  analyses using social cost of carbon estimates. For example, in a 2012  rule setting pollution standards for certain power plants, EPA noted that  the social cost of carbon estimates are subject to limitations and  uncertainties.", "Over the years, there have been opportunities for public comment on the  various individually developed and working group estimates of the social  cost of carbon for regulatory impact analysis, and several participants  stated that these estimates were developed with input from the public.  Since 2008, agencies have published over three dozen regulatory actions  for public comment in the Federal Register that use various social cost of  carbon estimates in regulatory impact analyses. While some of them  specifically sought comments on the development of the social cost of  carbon estimates used, and others did not, these regulatory actions were  open to public comment, in general, for approximately 60 days and,  according to OMB staff and other participants, agencies received many  comments on the estimates through this process. Several participants  stated that, while they discussed such public comments during working  group meetings, individual agencies typically do not coordinate formally  with other agencies on their reviews of comments received. According to  the Technical Support Document, the working group convened, in part, to  consider public comments on issues related to the social cost of carbon.  After considering public comments on the interim values that agencies  used in several rules, the working group developed the Technical Support  Document, according to these participants and to the Technical Support  Document. Several participants told us that the working group decided to  revise the estimates for the first time in 2013 after agencies received a  number of public comments encouraging revisions because the models  used to develop the 2010 estimates had been subsequently updated and  used in peer-reviewed academic literature. OMB staff stated that this  theme was reflected in several public comments on regulations using the  2010 estimates.", "In November 2013, OMB published a request in the Federal Register for  public comments on all aspects of the Technical Support Document and  its use of the models to develop estimates of the social cost of carbon.  The notice stated that OMB is particularly interested in comments on the  selection of the models for use in developing the estimates, how the  distribution of estimates should be represented in regulatory impact  analyses, and the strengths and limitations of the overall approach. OMB  staff told us that they decided to issue the request in response to calls for  additional transparency, and that they received over 100 unique  comments and thousands of identical form-letter comments in response  to the request. They said that, since they were still reviewing the  comments received, they had not yet decided on steps for responding to  them, but that they expect to review them with the working group to  determine whether they could inform future updates to the Technical  Support Document. OMB staff stated that they have already made most  of the comments publicly available online at http://www.regulations.gov/  and that all of the comments would be made available soon.", "The Technical Support Document states that the working group would  regularly revisit the social cost of carbon estimates as new information  becomes available due to improved scientific and economic research.  The Technical Support Document set a goal of revisiting the estimates  within 2 years, or when substantially updated models become available.  Many participants told us that, to revise the estimates in 2013, the  working group met only a few times and mostly for participants from EPA  to present information about updates made to the models since the group  last met in 2010. The updates touched on a variety of issues, including  how some models represent damages from sea level rise. The 2013  update to the Technical Support Document states that it acknowledges  the continued limitations described in the original Technical Support  Document, and that it updates the estimates based on new versions of  the underlying models without revisiting the working group\u2019s decisions on  modeling inputs. Several participants stated that they reviewed drafts of  the 2013 update to the Technical Support Document, but that there was  little new information to review because only the models had been  updated. In addition to stating that the working group would regularly  revisit its estimates, the Technical Support Document states that the  working group will continue to support research to improve the estimates  and hopes to develop methods to value other greenhouse gases as part  of its ongoing work."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report for review and comment to the  Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, Transportation, and the  Treasury; EPA; and OMB.
