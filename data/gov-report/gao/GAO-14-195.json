The offerors who filed the bid protests cited various issues, most frequently TMA's evaluation of proposals. For example, four bid protests challenged TMA's evaluation of offerors' proposed network provider discounts, which are discounts of provider payment rates negotiated by offerors to reduce overall health care costs to the government.", "TRICARE acquisition officials said that sustained bid protests and TMA's implementation of corrective actions prompted them to identify lessons learned where changes could be made to improve the acquisition process for subsequent TRICARE MCSCs. Lessons learned included (1) improvements in communication and documentation to increase transparency during the evaluation of proposals and (2) increases to the length of the acquisition process to allow for more time to evaluate proposals and for the transition from one MCSC to another.

The report  raised concerns regarding the growth in DOD\u2019s health care costs and  identified health care contracts with private sector companies under its  TRICARE Program as an area for potential savings and efficiencies. GAO  was directed to review DOD\u2019s process for awarding TRICARE contracts,  including the MCSCs, and the degree to which this process is  transparent. GAO was also asked to assess DOD\u2019s planning activities for  TRICARE\u2019s fourth generation MCSCs and make recommendations for  any improvements that could be incorporated in the acquisition process.  However, as of December 2013, the acquisition process for TRICARE\u2019s  fourth generation MCSCs had just been initiated, according to a  TRICARE program official.

In 2001, GAO testified about the acquisition process for  TRICARE\u2019s first generation of MCSCs, reporting that TMA\u2019s approach to  the acquisition process for these contracts resulted in administrative  challenges and contributed to funding shortfalls. In 2002, TMA made  changes to its second generation of TRICARE MCSCs, consolidating the  number of regions from 11 to 3, and reducing the number of MCSCs from  seven to three. TMA also changed the management and oversight of  TRICARE\u2019s purchased care and direct care systems through the  development of a governance plan. The plan established a new, regional  governance structure, including the creation of TRICARE regional offices  to manage the three newly established U.S. regions: North, South, and  West.", "TMA retained the three regions for the third generation of TRICARE  MCSCs. In 2008, TMA issued a request for proposals (RFP) and six  offerors submitted seven proposals\u2014two proposals in the North region,  three in the South region, and two in the West region. One offeror  submitted a proposal in both the South and West regions. The RFP  provided that an offeror could not receive an award for more than one of  the three U.S. regions. Therefore, TMA awarded one regional contract to  three different offerors. TMA initially awarded a contract to Aetna  Government Health Plan (Aetna) in the North region, UnitedHealth  Military & Veterans Services (UnitedHealth) in the South region, and  TriWest Healthcare Alliance Corporation (TriWest) in the West region.  Each award decision was protested; protests were filed with GAO in the  North and South regions, and an agency-level protest was filed in the  West region. As a result of sustained decisions in all three regions, TMA  implemented corrective actions to address the recommendations in the  post-award bid protest decisions and announced different awards in all  three regions. Specifically, Health Net Federal Services (Health Net), the  incumbent contractor, was awarded the North region MCSC; Humana  Military Healthcare Services (Humana), also an incumbent contractor,  received the South region MCSC; and UnitedHealth, a non-incumbent  contractor, received the West region MCSC.

The  document also specified activities, such as market research, TMA would  undertake prior to issuing an RFP. Market research was accomplished  by publishing requests for information, which led to meetings between  TMA and companies in the health care industry to collect information and  feedback about the acquisition. TMA conducted further market research  by sharing the draft RFP with companies in the industry to solicit  feedback on the RFP, which included the proposed contract  requirements. TMA also developed a source selection plan, which defined  the evaluation factors and subfactors, and how much weight or  importance should be assigned to each factor and subfactor when making  a source selection. In addition, the plan identified the source selection  team\u2014key individuals participating in the evaluation and source selection  process, as well as the procedures to be followed.", "Request for proposals.

These evaluation factors were developed to target critical  aspects of the program for review and evaluation. The Evaluation Board  evaluated each proposal against these factors. Ratings were assigned to  each of the offerors\u2019 proposals under the technical and past performance  evaluation factors, and each offeror\u2019s total proposal price was determined  during the price/cost evaluation.

The final source selection decisions  represented the Selection Authority\u2019s independent judgment, which in  some instances deviated from the judgments made during the underlying  evaluations. For example, in the 2009 award decision in the South region,  the Selection Authority disagreed with the judgment of the Evaluation  Board that the proposal of one offeror was more advantageous than the  awardee\u2019s proposal under one of the technical subfactors, finding instead  that the two proposals were equally advantageous under that subfactor.

Of the three evaluation  factors, offerors that filed bid protests most frequently challenged TMA\u2019s  evaluation of proposals under the technical approach factor and, in  particular, the subfactor under which TMA evaluated network provider  discounts.

For  example, the start of the performance period for TRICARE\u2019s third  generation MCSC in the West region was delayed because a decision on  the bid protest in that region could not be made until TMA made a new  source selection decision in the South region following a sustained bid  protest. In particular, the agency held UnitedHealth\u2019s July 2009 West  region protest in abeyance while TMA took corrective action following a  sustained bid protest in the South region, where UnitedHealth was also  an offeror. Because the same offeror could not win contract awards in  more than one region, UnitedHealth\u2019s West region protest would have  become moot if it received the South region award following TMA\u2019s  evaluation of the revised proposals. After TMA awarded the South region  contract to Humana in February 2011, UnitedHealth\u2019s agency-level  protest in the West region was revived.", "A senior TRICARE acquisition official also told us that transition delays  may affect the beneficiaries who rely upon the services provided by the  MCSC contractor.
