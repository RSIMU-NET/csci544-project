We previously reported that, as part of its fiscal year 2013 budget  process, NOAA was considering removing selected elements of the  program in order to reduce total program costs from $14.6 billion to $12.9  billion. By October 2012, NOAA had reduced the program\u2019s scope by,  among other things, reducing the previously planned network of fifteen  ground-based receptor stations to two receptor sites at the north pole and  two sites at the south pole and increasing the time it takes to obtain  satellite data and deliver it to the end user on JPSS-2 from 30 minutes to  80 minutes. More recently, as proposed by the administration, NOAA  began implementing additional changes in the program\u2019s scope and  objectives in order to meet the agency\u2019s highest-priority needs for  weather forecasting and reduce program costs from $12.9 billion to $11.3  billion. In this latest round of revisions, NOAA revised the program\u2019s  scope by, among other things, transferring requirements for certain  climate sensors to NASA, creating a new Polar Free Flyer program within  NOAA that would be responsible for missions supporting continued solar  measurements and user service systems, and reducing the JPSS  program\u2019s mission life cycle by 3 years\u2014from 2028 to 2025. The changes  NOAA implemented over the last 2 years will have an impact on those  who rely on polar satellite data.

Since the reliability of an integrated schedule  depends in part on the reliability of its subordinate schedules, schedule  quality weaknesses in these schedules will transfer to an integrated  master schedule derived from them.

However, the program office\u2019s level of confidence in the  JPSS-1 schedule may be overly optimistic for two key reasons. First, the  model that the program office used was based on flight project activities  rather than an integrated schedule consisting of flight, ground, program  office, and other activities relevant to the development and launch of  JPSS-1. As a result, the JPSS program office\u2019s confidence level  projections do not factor in the ongoing scheduling issues that are  impacting the ground project. Second, there are concerns regarding the  spacecraft schedule\u2019s quality as identified above.

Government and industry  best practices call for the development of contingency plans to maintain  an organization\u2019s essential functions in the case of an adverse event.", "These practices include key elements such as identifying and selecting  strategies to address failure scenarios, developing procedures to  implement selected strategies, and involving affected stakeholders.", "NOAA has established contingency plans for the loss of its GOES  satellites and ground systems that are generally in accordance with best  practices. Specifically, NOAA identified failure scenarios, recovery  priorities, and minimum levels of acceptable performance. NOAA  provided a final version of its satellite plan in December 2012 that  included scenarios for three, two, and one operational satellites. It also  established contingency plans that identify solutions and high-level  activities and triggers to implement the solutions.", "However, these plans are missing key elements. For example, NOAA has  not demonstrated that the contingency strategies for both its satellite and  ground systems are based on an assessment of costs, benefits, and  impact on users. Furthermore, NOAA did not work with the user  community to address potential reductions in capabilities under  contingency scenarios or identify alternative solutions for preventing a  delay in the GOES-R launch date. In addition, while NOAA\u2019s failure  scenarios for its satellite system are based on the number of available  satellites\u2014and the loss of a backup satellite caused by a delayed GOES- R launch would fit into these scenarios\u2014the agency did not identify  alternative solutions or time lines for preventing a GOES-R launch delay.  Until NOAA addresses the shortfalls in its contingency plans and  procedures, the plans may not work as intended in an emergency and  satellite data users may not obtain the information they need to perform  their missions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Implementation of Recommendations Should Help Mitigate Program Risks", "paragraphs": ["Both the JPSS and GOES-R programs continue to carry risks of future  launch delays and potential gaps in satellite coverage; implementing the  recommendations in our accompanying reports should help mitigate  those risks. In the JPSS report being released today, we recommend,  among other things, that NOAA establish a complete JPSS program integrated master schedule that  includes a logically linked sequence of activities; address the shortfalls in the ground system and spacecraft  component schedules outlined in our report; after completing the integrated master schedule and addressing  shortfalls in component schedules, update the joint cost and schedule  confidence level for JPSS-1, if warranted and justified; and establish a comprehensive contingency plan for potential satellite data  gaps in the polar orbit that is consistent with contingency planning  best practices identified in our report. The plan should include, for  example, specific contingency actions with defined roles and  responsibilities, timelines, and triggers; analysis of the impact of lost  data from the morning orbits; and identification of opportunities to  accelerate the calibration and validation phase of JPSS-1.", "In the GOES-R report being released today, we recommend, among  other things, that NOAA given the likely gap in availability of an on-orbit GOES backup satellite  in 2015 and 2016, address the weaknesses identified in our report on  the core ground system and the spacecraft schedules. These  weaknesses include, but are not limited to, sequencing all activities,  ensuring there are adequate resources for the activities, and  conducting a schedule risk analysis and  revise the satellite and ground system contingency plans to address  weaknesses identified in our report, including providing more  information on the potential impact of a satellite failure, identifying  alternative solutions for preventing a delay in GOES-R launch as well  as time lines for implementing those solutions, and coordinating with  key external stakeholders on contingency strategies.", "On both reports, NOAA agreed with our recommendations and identified  steps it is taking to implement them.", "In summary, NOAA has made progress on both the JPSS and GOES-R  programs, but key challenges remain to ensure that potential gaps in  satellite data are minimized or mitigated. On the JPSS program, NOAA  has made noteworthy progress in using S-NPP data in weather forecasts  and developing the JPSS-1 satellite. However, NOAA does not expect to  validate key S-NPP products until nearly 3 years after the satellite\u2019s  launch, and there are remaining issues with the JPSS schedule that  decrease the confidence that JPSS-1 will launch by March 2017 as  planned. On the GOES-R program, progress in completing the system\u2019s  design has been accompanied by continuing milestone delays, including  delays in the launch dates for both the GOES-R and GOES-S satellites.  The potential for further milestone delays also exists due to remaining  weaknesses in developing and maintaining key program schedules.  Faced with an anticipated gap in the polar satellite program and a  potential gap in the geostationary satellite program, NOAA has taken  steps to study alternatives and establish mitigation plans. However, the  agency does not yet have comprehensive contingency plans that identify  specific actions with defined timelines, and triggers. Until NOAA  establishes comprehensive contingency plans that addresses these  shortfalls, its plans for mitigating potential gaps may not be effective in  avoiding significant impacts to its weather mission.", "Chairman Broun, Chairman Stewart, Ranking Member Maffei, Ranking  Member Bonamici, and Members of the Subcommittees, this completes  my prepared statement.
