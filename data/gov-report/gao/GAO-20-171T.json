In recent years, some high-profile incidents have occurred on federal lands, such as the armed occupation of a FWS wildlife refuge in 2016. Federal land management agencies manage nearly 700 million acres of federal lands and have law enforcement divisions that protect their employees and secure their facilities.", "This testimony summarizes GAO's September 2019 report on how land management agencies protect their employees and secure their facilities (GAO-19-643). In that report, GAO examined, among other things, for the four federal land management agencies, (1) what is known about the number of threats and assaults against their employees and (2) the extent to which agencies met federal facility security assessment requirements. For the report, GAO analyzed available government data on threats and assaults; examined agencies' policies, procedures, and documentation on facility security assessments; compared the agencies' methodologies against ISC requirements; and interviewed land management agency, ISC, and FBI officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Data from the four federal land management agencies\u2014the Forest Service within the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Fish and Wildlife (FWS), and National Park Service (Park Service) within the Department of the Interior\u2014showed a range of threats and assaults against agency employees in fiscal years 2013 through 2017. For example, incidents ranged from telephone threats to attempted murder against federal land management employees. However, the number of actual threats and assaults is unclear and may be higher than what is captured in available data for various reasons. For example, employees may not always report threats because they consider them a part of the job. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) data for fiscal years 2013 through 2017 also showed that the FBI initiated under 100 domestic terrorism investigations into potential threats against federal land management agencies. The majority of these FBI investigations involved BLM, and the majority involved individuals motivated by anti-government ideologies.", "The four federal land management agencies have not completed all of the facility security assessments on their occupied federal facilities as required by the Interagency Security Committee (ISC). Officials at the four agencies said that either they do not have the resources, expertise, or training to conduct assessments agency-wide. FWS has a plan to complete its assessments, but BLM, the Forest Service, and the Park Service do not. Such a plan could help these agencies address the factors that have affected their ability to complete assessments. The ISC also requires that agencies conduct assessments using a methodology that meets, among other things, two key requirements: (1) consider all of the undesirable events (e.g., arson and vandalism) identified as possible risks to facilities, and (2) assess the threat, vulnerability, and consequence for each of these events. The Forest Service's methodology meets these two requirements and the Park Service's methodology partially meets the requirements, but BLM and FWS have not yet established methodologies for conducting facility security assessments. Without developing a plan for conducting all of the remaining facility security assessments and using a methodology that complies with ISC requirements, agencies may not identify the risks their facilities face or identify the countermeasures\u2014such as security cameras or security gates\u2014they could implement to mitigate those risks."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In its September 2019 report, GAO made six recommendations: that BLM, the Forest Service, and the Park Service develop a plan for completing facility security assessments; and that BLM, FWS, and the Park Service ensure their facility security assessment methodologies comply with ISC requirements. The agencies generally concurred with the recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss our recent review of how four  federal land management agencies\u2014the Forest Service in the U.S.  Department of Agriculture and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM),  Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and National Park Service (Park  Service) in the Department of the Interior\u2014protect their employees and  secure their facilities. In 2014, a report by the Department of Homeland  Security predicted that the rate of violent domestic extremist incidents  motivated by anti-government ideology would increase in the coming  years, with a focus on government facilities and personnel, among other  targets. Recently, there have been several high-profile incidents on  federal lands involving individuals motivated by anti-government  ideologies, according to agency officials, including an armed occupation  of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in rural Oregon in 2016. The  refuge was occupied for nearly 6 weeks by armed individuals and  damages to the land and facilities at the refuge, plus the local, state, and  FWS law enforcement responses, cost over $9 million, according to local  and federal officials.", "The four federal land management agencies have law enforcement  divisions that protect their employees and secure their facilities across  nearly 700 million acres of federal lands. To do so, agencies employ  uniformed law enforcement officers who patrol federal lands, respond to  illegal activities, conduct routine investigations, and record information  about incidents in their agency\u2019s law enforcement data system.", "Depending on the agency, its law enforcement officers may also provide  expert advice in assessing the security of their agency\u2019s facilities.  Specifically, the four agencies are required to follow federal facility  security standards developed by the Interagency Security Committee  (ISC). One such standard\u2014the ISC Standard\u2014defines the criteria and  processes executive agencies and departments are to follow when  assessing risks to their facilities through facility security assessments and  provides key requirements that the assessment methodologies must  include. Based on the results of the assessments, the ISC Standard  further guides agencies and departments in determining which protective  measures (referred to as countermeasures)\u2014such as identification  badges, blast-resistant windows, and security gates\u2014to implement. In  previous work, we found that some federal agencies had not fully followed  the ISC Standard, leaving agencies\u2019 facilities and employees exposed to  risk.", "My statement today summarizes the findings of our September 2019  report on federal land management agencies\u2019 efforts to protect their  employees and secure their facilities. Specifically, for the four federal  land management agencies, I will discuss (1) what is known about the  number of threats and assaults against their employees, (2) the  approaches the agencies used to protect their employees from threats  and assaults and factors affecting their ability to do so, and (3) the extent to which the agencies met federal facility security assessment  requirements.", "To develop the findings we outlined in the report on which this testimony  statement is based, we analyzed data on the number of incidents of  threats and assaults against land management agency employees from  the four agencies\u2019 law enforcement databases for fiscal years 2013  through 2017\u2014the most recent data available at the time of our review.  We also obtained data for this time period from the FBI on investigations  into potential domestic terror threats to land management agencies.", "Additionally, we conducted semi-structured interviews with officials during  site visits to a nongeneralizable sample of 11 of the 35 regional or state  offices and 14 field units across the four federal land management  agencies. Finally, we assessed whether the agencies had conducted  required facility security assessments on their occupied facilities and  examined the extent to which their facility security risk assessment  methodologies complied with two key requirements in the ISC Standard.  Additional information on our scope and methodology is available in our  September 2019 report. The work upon which this testimony statement  is based was conducted in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Available Data Show a Range of Threats and Assaults against Land Management Agency Employees, but Not All Incidents are Captured in the Data", "paragraphs": ["Available federal law enforcement data show a range of threats and  assaults against the four federal land management agencies\u2019 employees  in fiscal years 2013 through 2017. The severity of these incidents  ranged from threats conveyed over the telephone to attempted murder  and included an incident in which an employee was stabbed outside a  federal building. The number of incidents of threats and assaults varied  by agency. For example, for fiscal years 2013 through 2017", "BLM data included 88 incidents of threats and assaults against BLM", "FWS data included 66 incidents of threats and assaults against FWS", "Forest Service data included 177 incidents of threats and assaults  against Forest Service employees; and", "Park Service data included 29 incidents of threats and assaults  against Park Service employees.", "Further, FBI data for fiscal years 2013 through 2017 show that the FBI  initiated under 100 domestic terrorism investigations into potential threats  to federal land management agencies. Our analysis of the FBI data  showed that the majority of the domestic terrorism investigations involved  BLM. Additionally, the majority involved individuals motivated by anti- government ideologies. For example, the FBI investigated one case in  which a BLM law enforcement officer received more than 500 harassing  phone calls and several death threats after a subject posted personal  information about the officer on the social media platform Twitter.", "However, the number of actual threats and assaults against federal land  management employees is unclear and may be higher than what is  represented in available data, because not all incidents of threats and  assaults against land management agency employees are captured in the  agencies\u2019 databases. There are several reasons why this may be the  case. Specifically, some incidents of threats and assaults are investigated  by local or state law enforcement and may be recorded in their data  systems rather than in the land management agencies\u2019 systems.  Additionally, officials from two agencies we interviewed said that when a  single incident involved multiple offenses, the less serious offenses are  unlikely to be recorded in the data system and, therefore, the entirety of  what occurred may not be captured.", "Further, land management agency employees do not always report all  incidents of threats. For example, some field unit employees said that in  certain circumstances, they consider receiving threats as a normal part of  their job. Some officials also described being threatened while off duty,  such as being harassed in local stores or being monitored at their home,  and they said that in some cases they did not report the incident because  it was a common occurrence. However, even in more high-profile  incidents, agency officials told us that employees may not always report  threats to agency law enforcement. For example, agency officials we  interviewed cited specific incidents around the time of the 2016 armed  occupation of FWS\u2019s Malheur National Wildlife Refuge that they did not  necessarily report to their agency\u2019s law enforcement. These incidents  included individuals holding anti-government beliefs who followed a  teenage girl wearing a BLM shirt around the local grocery store and  threatened to burn her house down, and agency employees who had  shots fired over their heads while working in the field. According to  officials at two agencies, many employees were traumatized by the  Malheur occupation and some did not return to work, including some who  transferred to other agency field units."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Land Management Agencies Use Various Approaches to Protect Employees, but Several Factors May Affect Their Ability to Do So", "paragraphs": ["Federal land management agencies use various approaches to protect  their employees from threats and assaults, including deploying agency  law enforcement officers to protect employees and resources and building  relationships with external law enforcement entities and the public.  Specifically, when necessary, agencies deploy additional law  enforcement officers to assist their local officers. For example, during the  armed occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, FWS officials  reported deploying FWS law enforcement officers from around the  country to field units in western states to provide additional security for  FWS employees.", "Agency officials we interviewed also told us that they build relationships  with local, state, and other federal agency law enforcement entities to  help protect employees and resources in the field and to assist with  coordinating law enforcement responses. Such relationships are  important because not all field units have a law enforcement officer, and  those that do often rely on local law enforcement for assistance in  responding to incidents of threats or assaults against agency employees.  For example, officials we interviewed at a field unit in Nevada stated that  during a high-profile court case involving the agency, the Las Vegas  Metropolitan Police Department kept a patrol car outside the field unit for  several days to help ensure field unit employees\u2019 safety. Finally, officials  at several field units we visited stated that their law enforcement officers  are focused on educating, rather than policing, visitors.", "Agency officials we interviewed cited several factors that can affect their  ability to protect employees. Specifically, agency officials noted that  employees are required to interact with the public as part of their official  duties and may wear uniforms, which makes them easily recognizable  and can put them at risk of being threatened or assaulted. (See figure 1.)  Additionally, agency officials stated that it can be difficult to protect  employees because, as part of their field work, employees may be  dispersed across hundreds of miles of federal lands and may be located  hours or days away from the nearest agency law enforcement officer. For  example, as of fiscal year 2018, BLM had 194 field law enforcement  officers to cover the 245 million acres of land managed by BLM.", "Further, the number of agency field law enforcement officers at all four  land management agencies declined from fiscal year 2013 through fiscal  year 2018. For example, BLM experienced a decrease of 9 percent, while  the Forest Service experienced a decrease of 22 percent, the largest  decrease among the four agencies. Finally, agency officials we  interviewed said that the risk to employee safety posed by individuals  holding anti-government sentiments can be unpredictable and that  incidents of threats and assaults against employees by such individuals  are generally sporadic."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Land Management Agencies Have Not Met Certain Facility Security Assessment Requirements", "paragraphs": ["The four federal land management agencies have completed some but  not all of the facility security assessments on their occupied federal  facilities as required by the ISC Standard. Agency officials cited various  reasons for not doing so, including lack of resources, training, and  expertise. Not complying with the ISC Standard\u2019s requirement to  complete facility security assessments on all occupied facilities could  leave federal agencies exposed to risks in protecting their employees and  facilities. While FWS has a plan to complete its assessments, BLM, the  Forest Service, and the Park Service do not. Specifically:", "FWS. FWS has conducted five facility security assessments on its  approximately 465 occupied facilities. According to FWS headquarters  officials, FWS employees have limited physical security expertise to  conduct facility security assessments; therefore, the agency has  developed a plan to meet the ISC Standard\u2019s requirement using  contractors.", "BLM.

The Forest Service has conducted at least 135  facility security assessments on its approximately 1,135 occupied  facilities, but officials do not know when they will complete the  remaining assessments and do not have a plan for doing so.", "Park Service. The Park Service has conducted at least 148 facility  security assessments on its approximately 1,505 occupied facilities,  but officials do not know when they will complete the remaining  assessments and do not have a plan to do so.", "The ISC Standard requires that agencies conduct assessments using a  methodology that meets, among other things, two key requirements: (1)  consider all of the undesirable events (e.g., arson and vandalism)  identified in the ISC Standard as possible risks to facilities, and (2) assess  the threat, vulnerability, and consequence for each of these events. The  Forest Service\u2019s methodology meets these two requirements and utilizes  an ISC-compliant facility security assessment methodology developed by  the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Park Service\u2019s methodology  partially meets the requirements because it does not include a step to  assess the consequences of specific undesirable events, as required by  the ISC Standard. BLM and FWS have not yet established methodologies  for conducting facility security assessments, although officials we  interviewed from each agency stated that they intend to develop an ISC- compliant methodology. Specifically, BLM officials told us that they plan to  hire a security manager who will develop an assessment methodology but  did not know when the manager would be hired. FWS officials we  interviewed provided a high-level description of what they expected to be  included in their new methodology. However, FWS\u2019s description did not  indicate that the agency would evaluate the consequences of specific  undesirable events, as required by the ISC Standard.
