Between 1996 and 2000, the agency experienced a decline in administrative spending of around $2 million, or 5.8 percent. Personnel costs were the largest single expense, consistently accounting for more than 80 percent of administrative spending; thus, a 15 percent staff reduction also provided the greatest overall savings.

The act also authorizes FCA to assess the institutions it regulates to provide funds for its annual operating costs and to maintain a reserve amount for contingencies, as applicable.FCA regulations allow several methods for FCA to assess and apportion its administrative expenses among the various types of institutions it oversees. These institutions include primary market institutions (banks and associations) and related entities that collectively comprise the System, in addition to Farmer Mac (a secondary market entity). As of September 30, 2000, the System (excluding Farmer Mac) included 172 institutions holding assets of about $91 billion; Farmer Mac\u2019s assets were about $3 billion. The System is designed to provide a dependable and affordable source of credit and related services to the agriculture industry.", "FCA regulates and examines Farmer Mac, the secondary agricultural credit market entity, through the Office of Secondary Market Oversight (OSMO), which is an independent office with a staff of two within FCA.Figure 1 depicts the regulatory relationships among FCA, OSMO, the System, and Farmer Mac. Farmer Mac was created to provide a secondary market to improve the availability of agricultural and rural housing mortgage credit to lenders and borrowers. Both the System and Farmer Mac are government-sponsored enterprises (GSE).", "Although FCA does not receive any funds from the U.S. Treasury for its operating budget, its annual budget is subject to the annual congressional appropriations process, which limits the dollar amount that the agency can spend on administrative expenses. For 2000, that amount was $35.8 million. FCA raises operating funds from several sources, but most of these funds are from assessments on the institutions that it regulates. Assessments accounted for about 94 percent (including 2 percent for Farmer Mac) of the funding for the FCA\u2019s 2000 operating budget, with the balance coming from reimbursable services, investment income, and miscellaneous income (see fig. 2). FCA officials define administrative expenses as generally comprising personnel compensation, official travel and transportation, relocation expenses, and other operating expenses necessary for the proper administration of the act. FCA also has reimbursable expenses, which include the expenses it incurs in providing services and products to another entity.", "The five other federal financial regulators discussed in this report have oversight responsibility for various types of institutions. Table 1 shows these regulators, along with the types of institutions that they regulate.", "For purposes of comparison, we group the regulators into two categories according to the types of market primarily or exclusively served by the institutions they regulate, primary and secondary market entities. Of the five regulators, four\u2014FHFB, NCUA, OCC, and OTS\u2014regulate primary market institutions. OFHEO regulates secondary market entities. FHFB regulates the 12 Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks) that lend on a secured basis to their member retail financial institutions. Under certain approved programs and subject to regulatory requirements, the FHLBanks also are authorized to acquire mortgages from their members.", "By law, federal financial regulators are required to examine their regulated institutions on a periodic basis (e.g., annually). The primary purpose of these supervisory examinations is to assess the safety and soundness of the regulated institution\u2019s practices and operations. The examination process rates six critical areas of operations\u2014capital adequacy (C), asset quality (A), management (M), earnings (E), liquidity (L), and sensitivity to market risk (S), or CAMELS. The rating system uses a 5-point scale (with 1 as the best rating and 5 as the worst rating) to determine the CAMELS rating that describes the financial and management condition of the institution. Examiners issue a rating for each CAMELS element and an overall composite rating. The results of an examination, among other things, determine the extent of ongoing supervisory oversight.", "To varying degrees, the regulators also have responsibility for ensuring their institutions\u2019 compliance with consumer protection laws. Moreover, two GSE regulators (FCA and FHFB) have responsibilities for ensuring compliance with their respective GSEs\u2019 statutory missions. Mission and safety and soundness oversight for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are divided. The Department of Housing and Urban Development has general regulatory authority over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to ensure compliance with their missions, while OFHEO has the authority for safety and soundness regulation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To meet the first objective, we examined agency budget reports and financial documents and interviewed FCA and Farmer Mac officials.

We selected these five agencies because they use funding mechanisms that are similar to FCA\u2019s to support their operating budgets. We did not independently verify the accuracy of the data that the regulators provided or review any agency\u2019s accounting records.", "We obtained comments on a draft of this report from FCA and the five other federal financial regulatory agencies. FCA\u2019s comments are summarized at the end of this report.

Staff reductions\u2014due, in part, to consolidation within the System\u2014have accounted for most of the decline in administrative expenditures.

Despite increases in purchases of other contractual services and equipment, administrative costs remained below the 1996 level throughout the second half of the 1990s and into 2000 (see table 2). The decline was not spread evenly over the 5-year period (see fig. 3). Most of the decline occurred in 1996-98, and administrative spending has increased each year since then. For 2001, administrative expenditures are expected to rise by $852,000, or 2.6 percent, over their 2000 level, primarily because of rising costs for personnel, travel, and transportation.", "Our analysis of FCA data shows that personnel costs accounted for over 80 percent of the FCA administrative expenses during the 5-year study period. But these costs (staff salaries and benefits) also decreased the most in dollar and percentage terms during the period, falling by about $4.1 million (13 percent), and the share of personnel costs in administrative expenditures fell from 88.7 percent to 81.7 percent. Reductions in benefits were largely responsible for this decline; the amount spent on staff benefits dropped 36.3 percent, falling from $7.3 million in 1996 to $4.6 million in 2000. Decreases in the relocation allowances, severance pay, and buyouts necessitated by the consolidation of the System accounted for most of the decline. FCA officials told us that the number of employees fell almost 15 percent\u2014from 331 in 1996 to 282 in 2000\u2014in part, because of the industry consolidation. The number of institutions in the System dropped by 28 percent, declining from 239 in 1996 to 172 in 2000. For 2001, however, FCA projects personnel costs to increase by 5.3 percent to about $28.8 million. As a result, our analysis shows that these costs will continue to account for a substantial percentage of administrative costs. FCA officials attribute the increase to the rising cost of employee salaries and performance bonuses.", "Equipment purchases and other contractual services accounted for the largest increases in administrative expenditures in 1996 through 2000. Equipment purchases experienced the largest growth but fell behind contractual services in actual dollar increases. Equipment purchases rose about $1.1 million (from $395,000 in 1996 to $1.5 million in 2000), which was about a 268-percent increase over 1996. According to an FCA official, computer replacements and upgrades, which the agency undertakes every 3 years, accounted mostly for the increase. FCA officials expect equipment purchases to decline $202,000, or about 14 percent, in 2001.", "Other contractual services represented a growing percentage of FCA administrative costs, increasing from 2.8 percent in 1996 to 6.8 percent of the 2000 total. These expenses consisted mostly of consulting services for a new financial management system purchased from another government agency. They accounted for the largest dollar increase (about $1.3 million) and the second-largest percentage increase (about 130 percent) in administrative expenditures, climbing from $992,000 in 1996 to $2.3 million in 2000. For 2001, however, FCA expects this cost component to decline by $209,000, or 9.2 percent.", "Travel and transportation expenses declined (by about 10 percent) between 1996 and 2000. FCA officials told us the decrease was largely the result of a decline in the number of employee relocations. For 2001, FCA projects these costs to decrease by $231,000, or about 15 percent.", "All other expenses, a category that includes rent, communications, and utilities; printing and reproduction; supplies and materials; and insurance claims and indemnities, decreased by $79,000, or 8.3 percent, over the period, primarily because of decreases in supplies and materials.

In general, the regulators assess institutions using either complex asset- based formulas or less complex formulas that are based on other factors, depending on the type of institution. The different funding methodologies are designed to ensure that each institution pays an equitable share of agency expenses.", "FCA uses two different methods of calculating assessments on the institutions it regulates\u2014one for all primary market entities and the other for its secondary market entity, Farmer Mac. The methodology used for primary market entities, which is complex, is based on the institutions\u2019 asset holdings and economies of scale as well as on the supervisory rating each institution received during FCA\u2019s last periodic examination.  The methodology used for Farmer Mac is less complex. FCA calculates the assessment on the basis of its own direct and indirect expenses, rather than on asset holdings. Direct expenses include the costs of examining and supervising Farmer Mac, while indirect expenses are the overhead costs \u201creasonably\u201d related to FCA\u2019s services. In general, the other federal financial regulators that regulate institutions similar to FCA\u2019s use comparable methodologies to calculate assessments."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The FCA Formula for Assessing Primary Market Entities Considers Assets, Marginal Costs, and Financial Performance as Well as FCA\u2019s Funding Needs", "paragraphs": ["The law requires that the assessments be apportioned \u201con a basis that is determined to be equitable by the Farm Credit Administration.\u201d FCA\u2019s current assessment regulations for banks, associations, and \u201cdesignated other System entities\u201d were developed in 1993 through the negotiated rulemaking process. Banks, associations, and the Farm Credit Leasing Services Corporation (Leasing Corporation) are assessed on the same basis (i.e., assets). According to an FCA official, the agency periodically reviews these rules but currently has no plans to modify them. FCA officials said that these rules are designed to equitably apportion the annual costs of supervising, examining, and regulating the institutions. For this reason, the methodology relies on asset \u201cbrackets\u201d that are much like tax brackets and reflect economies of scale, since the costs of supervision rise as a regulated institution becomes larger; however, these costs do not increase as fast as asset growth. FCA \u201cbills\u201d the institutions annually, and the institutions pay their assessments on a quarterly basis.", "To calculate the assessments for banks, associations, and the Leasing Corporation, FCA first determines its annual operating budget, which could include a reserve for contingencies for the next fiscal year, then deducts the estimated assessments for Farmer Mac, other System entities, and any reimbursable expenses. What is left\u2014the net operating budget\u2014is the total amount that will be assessed. This amount is apportioned among the banks, associations, and the Leasing Corporation using a two-part formula. The net operating budget is divided into two components of 30 and 70 percent. (According to an FCA official, the 30/70 split was devised during the negotiated rulemaking process and represents the most equitable way to assess System institutions.) The first part of the assessment, covering 30 percent of the budget, is spread across institutions on the basis of each institution\u2019s share of System risk-adjusted assets. For example, an institution whose assets equal 1 percent of System assets will have its assessment equal to 1 percent of this 30 percent of the FCA budget. The second part of an institution\u2019s assessment is charged according to a schedule that imposes different assessment rates on assets over specified levels, with these marginal rates decreasing for higher levels of assets. For example, the assessment rate that an institution pays for its assets from over $100 million to $500 million is 60 percent of the assessment rate that it pays on its first $25 million in assets. Adding the 30-percent amount and the 70-percent amount together equals the general assessment amount. Table 4 shows the assessment rates for the eight-asset \u201cbrackets.\u201d The assessment rates percentages are prescribed by FCA regulation.", "The general assessment may be subject to these adjustments: a minimum assessment fee, a supervisory surcharge, or both. The minimum fee of $20,000 applies only to institutions whose assessments are calculated at less than $20,000; these assessments are scaled upward, and no further charges are assessed. For institutions with assessments of more than $20,000, FCA may add a supervisory surcharge that reflects the institution\u2019s financial and management conditions. The surcharge is based on the institution\u2019s last supervisory examination rating. These ratings range from a high of 1 to a low of 5; a rating of 3, 4, or 5 can result in a surcharge ranging from 20 to 40 percent of the general assessment amount. The top-rated institutions (those rated 1 or 2) pay nothing over the general assessment.", "The variables in the formula allow FCA some flexibility in adjusting assessments to reflect its oversight costs. The formula not only reflects economies of scale but, by linking assessments with the financial and managerial soundness of the institutions, also seeks to ensure that the institutions that cost the most to supervise are paying their share. This approach relieves other entities within the System of bearing the cost of this additional oversight. FCA may adjust its assessments to reflect changes in its actual annual expenses and, if applicable, give institutions a credit against their next assessment or require them to pay additional assessments. Any credits are prorated on the basis of assessments paid by an institution. These credit adjustments are usually done at the end of the fiscal year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FCA Assesses Farmer Mac Using a Less Complex Formula That Is Based on Direct and Indirect Costs", "paragraphs": ["As required by law, FCA assesses Farmer Mac separately and differently from its primary market institutions. The law specifies that FCA\u2019s assessment of Farmer Mac is intended to cover the costs of any regulatory activities and specifically notes a requirement to pay the cost of supervising and examining Farmer Mac. We could not identify any legislative history that addressed these provisions. FCA officials told us that they believed the difference between the statutory provisions for assessing banks, associations, and the Leasing Corporation and Farmer Mac is due to the difference in their assets\u2014that is, unlike those institutions, Farmer Mac does not make loans. FCA developed the current assessment methodology for Farmer Mac in 1993.", "Farmer Mac\u2019s assessment covers the estimated costs of regulation, supervision, and examination, but Farmer Mac is not assessed a charge for FCA\u2019s reserve. The assessment includes FCA\u2019s estimated direct expenses for these activities, plus an allocated amount for indirect or overhead expenses. In general, FCA uses the same estimated direct expenses and indirect expense calculations for Farmer Mac as for the \u201cother System entities,\u201d such as the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation (Funding Corporation). Estimated direct expenses take into account the costs incurred in the most recent examination of Farmer Mac and any expected changes in these costs for the next fiscal year. We asked FCA officials if and how the assessment formula they use for Farmer Mac enables them to compensate for risks in Farmer Mac\u2019s business activities. They explained that the amount assessed for direct expenses increases if additional examination time is needed. FCA officials also noted that, as their data show, direct costs can rise due to other factors. For example, from 1999 to 2001, FCA officials noted that they invested considerable resources in developing a risk-based capital rule for Farmer Mac. During this time, FCA incurred unique costs that increased Farmer Mac\u2019s assessment for those years.", "A proportional amount of FCA\u2019s indirect expenses\u2014that is, those expenses that are not attributable to the performance of examinations\u2014is allocated to Farmer Mac. This amount is calculated as a relationship between the budget for a certain FCA office and FCA\u2019s overall expense budget for the fiscal year covered by the assessment. (The proportion for 2000 was 28.9 percent.) Multiplying the percentage by the estimated direct expenses attributable to Farmer Mac equals the amount of indirect expenses. The addition of the estimated direct expenses and indirect expenses equals the estimated amount to be assessed Farmer Mac for the fiscal year. Indirect expenses would include, for example, the cost of providing personnel services and processing travel vouchers for OSMO.

These institutions are assessed for the estimated direct expenses involved in examinations, a portion of indirect expenses, and any amount necessary to maintain a reserve. FCA estimates direct expenses for each entity on the basis of anticipated examination time and travel costs for the next fiscal year. Allocations for indirect expenses are calculated as a percentage of FCA\u2019s total budgeted direct expenses (excluding those for Farmer Mac) for the fiscal year of the assessment.

Most of the regulators use complex formulas that take into account a variety of factors, including the regulator\u2019s budget, the institution\u2019s asset size and examination rating, and economies of scale (see fig. 5). Like FCA\u2019s, these assessments generally include a fixed component that is based on an institution\u2019s asset holdings, plus a variable component derived by multiplying asset amounts in excess of certain thresholds by a series of declining marginal rates. The assessment amount may then be adjusted on the basis of various factors\u2014for example, the institution\u2019s financial condition. Again like the FCA\u2019s methodology, these formulas attempt to allocate regulatory costs in a way that reflects the agency\u2019s actual cost of supervision. Institutions with a low examination rating pay an additional fee because they are likely to require more supervision than the top-rated institutions. NCUA and FHFB are the only regulators of primary market institutions that do not add a supervisory surcharge on the basis of an examination rating. However, NCUA does use a complex formula to determine an institution\u2019s assessment amount, whereas FHFB uses a less complex formula.
