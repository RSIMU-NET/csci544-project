In response to a request, GAO identified whether BOP had policies and procedures and how it assessed the management of those policies and procedures for (1) employee-requested lateral transfers of BOP employees between correctional facilities and (2) day-to-day changes in correctional services or temporary assignments of BOP employees within a correctional facility. GAO reviewed available documentation on BOP's policies and procedures on lateral transfers and temporary assignments. GAO also interviewed officials from BOP's central and regional offices and seven facilities selected on the basis of the number of staff; at least one facility was selected from within each of BOP's six regions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["BOP does not have written policies and procedures on lateral transfers of staff. Each correctional facility evaluates requests for lateral transfers on a case-by-case basis. Typically, when an employee requests a lateral transfer to another facility, the warden at the employee's current facility determines whether to forward the request to the desired facility's warden. The processes for requesting a lateral transfer and the criteria for forwarding, granting, or denying such requests varied across the facilities GAO reviewed, and generally no documentation on decisions reached or actions taken was maintained. Further, BOP does not systematically review decisions concerning these requests at any level. As a result, BOP cannot determine the number of requests for lateral transfers, the outcome of these requests, or whether requests were handled consistently within or among facilities. GAO has previously reported that agencywide policies and procedures help ensure consistent treatment of staff when agencies have geographically dispersed locations. Other Department of Justice law-enforcement components have written policies, procedures, and a review process concerning requests for lateral transfers. Unlike lateral transfers, BOP has written policies and procedures on how facilities are to temporarily assign staff to fill in for absences or to meet other needs that arise in a facility. However, BOP has not systematically assessed how facilities are managing temporary assignments. As part of a costreduction strategy affecting temporary assignments, in 2005, BOP designated mission critical posts, that is, assignments that were deemed essential for the safe and secure operations of its facilities and that would be vacated only in rare circumstances. The mission critical post initiative was intended to reduce facilities' reliance on overtime and non-correctional services staff, who had typically been used for temporary assignments. A memorandum from the Assistant Director of Correctional Programs described how each facility was to gather information for 6 months on overtime and staffing under the mission critical post initiative and how BOP would evaluate the effectiveness of the initiative. However, BOP conducted no such evaluation. BOP officials also generally do not review temporary assignments at any level, including the effect of leaving mission critical posts unassigned. According to the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, federal agencies are to employ internal control activities, such as top-level review, to help ensure that management's directives are carried out and to determine if agencies are effectively and efficiently using resources. Without assessing its mission critical post initiative and data on temporary assignments, BOP does not know whether it is efficiently and effectively using staff for temporary assignments or achieving the desired cost savings. Also, without reviewing the effect of leaving mission critical posts unassigned, BOP cannot assess the effect, if any, of unassigned posts on the safety and security of its facilities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Justice\u2019s Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is  The Department of Justice\u2019s Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is  responsible for the custody and care of more than 202,000 federal  responsible for the custody and care of more than 202,000 federal  offenders, up from fewer than 25,000 in 1980.

The system does not produce summary data on temporary assignments  and does not produce reliable historical data on non-correctional services  positions. While the system contains data on temporary assignments for  individual days, it currently does not produce summary data that would  make it easier for BOP officials to assess BOP\u2019s use of temporary  assignments. For example, when a facility leaves a mission critical post  unassigned, it is designated on the correctional services daily roster, but  BOP\u2019s computerized system does not produce summary data on the  number of mission critical posts left unassigned. To obtain summary data,  a facility would have to count the occurrences of unassigned posts from  each daily roster for a given period. In addition, although the system can  produce limited data on overtime and non-correctional services staff by  individual days, it does not produce summary data over time on the use  of overtime or non-correctional services staff or the purposes for which  overtime was paid or non-correctional services staff were used. In March  2008, one region began manually reviewing individual daily rosters  submitted by its facilities. Officials in that region said that two staff  members currently spend about an hour a day reviewing the rosters and  that one staff member is spending about an hour and a half reviewing the  rosters on a weekly basis. Also according to BOP officials responsible for  the design and implementation of the system, although it distinguishes  between correctional services and non-correctional services staff, if an  employee moves from a correctional services position to a non- correctional services position or vice versa, the employee\u2019s department  status would change for all rosters that are stored on the system before  the move. As a result, any historical data on the use of non-correctional  services staff is not reliable, and only hard copy versions of daily rosters  maintained at a facility are an accurate record. Without summary data on  the use of overtime and non-correctional services staff and the purposes  for which overtime was paid or non-correctional services staff were used,  BOP cannot assess whether the policy changes it made involving  temporary assignments enabled BOP to achieve its goals of reducing its  reliance on overtime and non-correctional services staff. Also without  summary data on unassigned mission critical posts, BOP cannot assess the  effect, if any, of such posts on the safety and security of its facilities.

Regarding our  first recommendation, the Director disagreed with the recommended  action that BOP develop and implement specific policies and procedures  for administering employee requests for lateral transfers because BOP  would have to devote time and personnel to developing policies and  procedures and maintaining such a program. In addition, the Director  stated that implementation of our recommendation would elevate this  process to a central office function rather than retain it at the local level  where staffing decisions are made. While developing, implementing, and  overseeing policies and procedures that we recommend would require  some resources, these actions would not necessarily require centralizing  either decisions on requests for lateral transfers or the data collection on  such requests and their outcomes. For example, decisions on transfer  requests could primarily remain at the facility level; facilities would collect  and retain data on all requests and their disposition and facilities would  then report these data on lateral transfers to BOP. This would allow BOP  to conduct appropriate oversight to ensure that requests for lateral  transfers are handled consistently across facilities. The Director stated  that instead of implementing our recommendation, BOP plans to  \u201cencourage a practice to have locations post a vacancy announcement on  USAJobs before filling local vacancies.\u201d Such a plan would fall short of the  intent of our recommendation of having specific policies and procedures  for facilities across BOP to administer employee requests for lateral  transfers, including the collection of data on such requests and their  outcomes and the development of a system of oversight to ensure  consistent treatment of staff. We continue to believe that without such  written policies and procedures covering lateral transfers, BOP cannot  readily monitor how such transfers are being managed across BOP or  ensure that staff are being consistently treated when requesting such  transfers.", "Regarding our second recommendation, the Director stated that BOP will  conduct a systematic assessment of the use of correctional services  mission critical posts at its field locations from January 1 through  December 31, 2009.

After the initial assessment, BOP\u2019s Correctional Services  Program Review Guidelines will be modified as appropriate based on  BOP\u2019s findings, and BOP plans to conduct regularly scheduled reviews of  institutions to determine whether it is meeting its mission critical post  initiative and effectively and efficiently using resources.", "We will send copies of this report to the Attorney General and other  interested parties.

We analyzed hard-copy correctional services daily rosters from  facilities in our review because BOP\u2019s computerized roster management  system does not produce historically accurate data on the department  status of correctional services and non-correctional services staff that are  sufficiently reliable for purposes of this report. According to BOP officials  responsible for the design and implementation of BOP\u2019s computerized  system, although the system distinguishes between correctional services  and non-correctional services staff, if an employee moves from a  correctional services position to a non-correctional services position or  vice versa, the employee\u2019s department status would change for all rosters  that are stored in the system before the move.", "To determine the reliability of the hard-copy daily rosters, we reviewed  training and other technical documentation associated with the  computerized roster management system used at BOP facilities and BOP\u2019s  policies and procedures for ensuring the accuracy of the data.

We did not look at daily rosters completed  before the implementation of the mission critical initiative and therefore  do not know the impact of the initiative. For FCC Coleman, which uses  separate daily rosters to assign staff at each of its four facilities, we  reviewed the separate rosters from each facility for the 60 days. For FCC  Terre Haute, which uses a consolidated roster to assign staff throughout  the complex, we reviewed the consolidated daily roster for the 60 days. In  total, we reviewed 600 daily rosters. With this stratified random sample,  each roster in the universe had a chance of being selected. Each selected  roster was subsequently weighted in the analysis to account statistically  for all the members of the universe, including those who were not  selected.", "For each day selected in the sample, on the daily roster we manually  counted for both mission critical posts and special assignments  occurrences of (1) unassigned posts, (2) non-correctional services staff  paid regular time, (3) correctional services staff paid overtime, (4) non- correctional services staff paid overtime, and (5) compensatory time. In  addition, we counted the total number of special assignments assigned per  day at each facility in our review. Based on these results, we estimated the  average daily number and percentage of mission critical posts and special  assignments that were unassigned, filled with non-correctional services  staff, or filled with overtime using either correctional services staff or non- correctional services staff. These results are limited to the facilities in our  review for calendar year 2007 and are not intended to be applied to  facilities across BOP.", "For the overtime results, we based the average daily count on the number  of overtime occurrences rather than number of overtime hours. The total  number of overtime occurrences per day was determined by adding the  daily count of occurrences of correctional services staff paid overtime and  non-correctional services staff paid overtime.", "Because of resource constraints, we did not count the total number of  mission critical posts listed on each of the 600 daily rosters. This would  have provided the actual total number of mission critical posts for each  day. Instead, we calculated daily percentages based on the maximum  number of posts possible per day in the facility, which ranged from 70  mission critical posts at low-security FCI Coleman to 232 mission critical  posts at FCC Terre Haute. BOP facilities determine the number of days  needed for each post, and posts are designated as consisting of between 1  to 7 day shifts per week. For example, a visiting-room post was identified  as a 2-day shift per week at one facility in our review. We assumed for  each day in our sample that each mission critical post would be listed on  the daily roster\u2014that is, the visiting room would be staffed on each day of  our sample. Because it is likely that not every post would be included on  the daily roster on each of the days in our sample and that the actual  number of posts listed on the roster would be less than the maximum  number of posts possible in a day at that facility, our methodology  potentially underestimates the results.", "Because we followed a procedure based on random selection, each of our  samples is only one of a large number of samples that we might have  drawn.

This is the interval  that would contain the actual value for 95 percent of the samples we could  have drawn from the universe. For mission critical posts, each estimate  from these samples has a margin of error at the 95 percent confidence  level, of plus or minus 2 percent or less for average daily percentage  estimates or plus or minus 4 posts or less for average daily post estimates.  For special assignments, each estimate from these samples has a margin of  error, at the 95 percent confidence level, of plus or minus 6 percent or less  for average daily percentage estimates or plus or minus 3 special  assignments or less for average daily special assignments estimates.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2007 to January 2009 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

In staffing temporary assignments,  lieutenants are to consider the number of staff needed and the specialized  experience, training, or certification required for some posts and special  assignments and the qualifications of available staff.

To escort an inmate to an outside  medical facility, the staff assigned must have completed basic prisoner  transport training and be recertified annually.
