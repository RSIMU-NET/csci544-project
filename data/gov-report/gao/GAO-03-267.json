In 1997, to help reduce banking costs and improve funds availability, the Postal Service implemented consolidated banking\u2014a Service-wide process whereby the daily remittances from the Service\u2019s retail postal facilities are consolidated and transferred by armed bank couriers to a relatively few commercial banks for deposit.", "The Postal Inspection Service, one of the nation\u2019s oldest law enforcement agencies, is the Postal Service\u2019s law enforcement arm. With a force of about 1,400 uniformed Postal Police Officers (PPOs), over 1,900 postal inspectors, and five forensic crime laboratories, the Postal Inspection Service is responsible for ensuring the safety and security of postal employees, facilities, and assets. PPOs provide security at postal facilities where the Postal Inspection Service has determined that risk and vulnerability demonstrate a need for this level of security. Postal inspectors help enforce and investigate infractions of over 200 federal laws applicable to crimes that adversely affect or involve fraudulent use of the U.S. mail. Matters investigated include criminal incidents, such as mail theft, robberies, burglaries, and embezzlement; and the criminal use of the mail for money laundering, fraud, child exploitation, and the movement of illegal drugs.", "The Postal Inspection Service periodically performs reviews of remittance- processing procedures at selected individual postal facilities or at a cross section of facilities within a postal district.

We also obtained and reviewed applicable training manuals, orders, directives, and handbooks. Also, for each of our objectives, we discussed the applicable policies, procedures, and practices with appropriate Service officials, including headquarters officials in Postal Operations, Corporate Accounting, Corporate Treasury, Human Resources, Network Operations Management, and the Postal Inspection Service. Further, we had similar discussions with postal facility managers, supervisors, employees who process remittances, and Postal Inspection Service inspectors in the various field locations we visited.", "We did not review all aspects of the Service\u2019s internal controls or its systems for accounting for remittances.

He stated that since 1997, the Postal Inspection Service has frequently brought proper procedures and policy to the attention of postal management through its investigations and other reviews, and the intention of management to adopt the recommendations of the Postal Inspection Service appears genuine. He stated, however, that the implementation of proper procedures and ongoing security of remittances continue to erode and that causes could include the following:   Postal Service management has been unable or unwilling to comply with procedures that will properly secure remittances. Some postal district managers have refused to comply with certain procedures to protect remittances. (In our discussions with the Postal Inspection Service, we were told that some postal district managers balked at implementing certain remittance handling procedures because they believed that the procedures would result in additional costs that would have to be absorbed by each Service district.)", "Other postal areas have not implemented Postal Inspection Service recommendations to improve the security of remittances. For example, in 2000 a report was issued to the manager of the Phoenix facility that detailed security issues that, had they been corrected, the Postal Inspection Service believes could have deterred or prevented the June 2001 loss of over $3 million.", "Historically, employees have not been held accountable for mishandling and subsequently losing remittances. For example, in the Postal Inspection Service\u2019s Mid-Atlantic Division, an employee left remittances in a 24-hour lobby after the post office had closed. The remittances were stolen, but no disciplinary action was initiated against the employee.", "Employees may not be trained properly in processing remittances. For example, in a Washington, D.C., postal facility, a training course for clerks was discontinued in 1986. Although a reliable Service-wide sample has not been taken, the Postal Inspection Service sees this lack of training as a common inadequacy throughout the Postal Service. Certain reference material has not been updated since 1982.", "During a postal reorganization, a key supervisor position was abolished, leaving employees without direct supervision.", "The security of remittances or prevention of losses was never an established goal for postal management, unlike overnight and 2- to 3-day mail delivery scores.

He said that this was not an issue of incidental oversight, but rather a condition in which \u201cbasic work processes were either not in place, or were being routinely compromised.\u201d He concluded by pointing out that postmasters and postal employees are personally responsible for depredation or loss of remittances due to negligence or disregard of instructions and asking the addressees to ensure that appropriate controls are in place throughout their respective operations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Background Checks Not Updated Before Employees Process Remittances", "paragraphs": ["The Service performs background checks for all prospective employees as part of a suitability test to identify applicants who possess the necessary skills, abilities, and qualifications to perform specific jobs in the Postal Service.

We agree that these types of issues would need to be considered in any reassessment the Service would do in connection with requiring updated background checks for employees processing remittances. However, we believe that such a reassessment is warranted given the higher risk levels associated with responsibilities that involve processing remittances.
