Most notably, the agencies have adopted various national strategy documents addressing the need to reduce wildland fire risks, established a priority to protect communities in the wildland-urban interface, and increased efforts and amounts of funding committed to addressing wildland fire problems, including preparedness, suppression, and fuel reduction on federal lands. In addition, the agencies have begun improving their data and research on wildland fire problems, made progress in developing long-needed fire management plans that identify actions for effectively addressing wildland fire threats at the local level, and improved federal interagency coordination and collaboration with nonfederal partners. The agencies also have strengthened overall accountability for their investments in wildland fire activities by establishing improved performance measures and a framework for monitoring results. Despite producing numerous planning and strategy documents, the agencies have yet to develop a cohesive strategy that explicitly identifies the long-term options and related funding needed to reduce the excess vegetation that fuels fires in national forests and rangelands. Reducing these fuels lowers risks to communities and ecosystems and helps contain suppression costs. As GAO noted in 1999, such a strategy would help the agencies and the Congress to determine the most effective and affordable long-term approach for addressing wildland fire problems. Completing this strategy will require finishing several efforts now under way, each with its own challenges. The agencies will need to finish planned improvements in a key data and modeling system--LANDFIRE--to more precisely identify the extent and location of wildland fire threats and to better target fuel reduction efforts. In implementing LANDFIRE, the agencies will need more consistent approaches to assessing wildland fire risks, more integrated information systems, and better understanding of the role of climate in wildland fire. In addition, local fire management plans will need to be updated with data from LANDFIRE and from emerging agency research on more cost-effective approaches to reducing fuels. Completing a new system designed to identify the most cost-effective means for allocating fire management budget resources--Fire Program Analysis--may help to better identify long-term options and related funding needs. Without completing these tasks, the agencies will have difficulty determining the extent and location of wildland fire threats, targeting and coordinating their efforts and resources, and resolving wildland fire problems in the most timely and cost-effective manner over the long term."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the status of the federal  government\u2019s efforts to address our nation\u2019s wildland fire problems.  Wildland fire is a natural process that plays an important role in the health  of many fire-adapted ecosystems, but it also can cause catastrophic  damage to communities and ecosystems. The trend of increasing wildland  fire threats to communities and ecosystems that we reported on 5 years  ago has continued. The average acreage of lands burned by wildland fires  annually from 2000 through 2004 was about 62 percent greater than the  average amount burned annually during the 1990s. Experts have noted that  catastrophic damage from wildland fires probably will continue to  increase until an adequate long-term federal response is implemented.  They stated that efforts to resolve the growing threats of catastrophic  wildland fires are in a race against time and the window of opportunity is  rapidly closing.", "My testimony today summarizes the findings of our January 2005 report,  which discusses the progress the federal government has made over the  last 5 years and key challenges it faces in developing and implementing a  long-term response to wildland fire problems.  This report is based  primarily on over 25 reviews we conducted in recent years of federal  wildland fire management that focused largely on the activities of the  Forest Service in the Department of Agriculture and the land management  agencies in the Department of the Interior, which together manage about  95 percent of all federal lands."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Wildland fire triggered by lightning is a normal, inevitable, and necessary  ecological process that nature uses to periodically remove excess  undergrowth, small trees, and vegetation to renew ecosystem productivity.  However, various human land use and management practices, including  several decades of fire suppression activities, have reduced the normal  frequency of wildland fires in many forest and rangeland ecosystems and  have resulted in abnormally dense and continuous accumulations of  vegetation that can fuel uncharacteristically large and intense wildland  fires. Such large intense fires increasingly threaten catastrophic ecosystem  damage and also increasingly threaten human lives, health, property, and  infrastructure in the wildland-urban interface. Federal researchers  estimate that vegetative conditions that can fuel such fires exist on  approximately 190 million acres\u2013\u2013or more than 40 percent\u2013\u2013of federal  lands in the contiguous United States but could vary from 90 million to 200  million acres, and that these conditions also exist on many nonfederal  lands.", "Our reviews over the last 5 years identified several weaknesses in the  federal government\u2019s management response to wildland fire issues. These  weaknesses included the lack of a national strategy that addressed the  likely high costs of needed fuel reduction efforts and the need to prioritize  these efforts. Our reviews also found shortcomings in federal  implementation at the local level, where over half of all federal land  management units\u2019 fire management plans did not meet agency  requirements designed to restore fire\u2019s natural role in ecosystems  consistent with human health and safety. These plans are intended to  provide program direction for fuel reduction, preparedness, suppression,  and rehabilitation actions. The agencies also lacked basic data, such as the  amount and location of lands needing fuel reduction, and research on the  effectiveness of different fuel reduction methods on which to base their  fire management plans and specific project decisions. Furthermore,  coordination among federal agencies and collaboration between these  agencies and nonfederal entities were ineffective. This kind of cooperation  is needed because wildland fire is a shared problem that transcends land  ownership and administrative boundaries. Finally, we found that better  accountability for federal expenditures and performance in wildland fire  management was needed. Agencies were unable to assess the extent to  which they were reducing wildland fire risks or to establish meaningful  fuel reduction performance measures, as well as to determine the cost- effectiveness of these efforts, because they lacked both monitoring data  and sufficient data on the location of lands at high risk of catastrophic  fires to know the effects of their actions. As a result, their performance  measures created incentives to reduce fuels on all acres, as opposed to  focusing on high-risk acres.", "Because of these weaknesses, and because experts said that wildland fire  problems could take decades to resolve, we said that a cohesive, long- term, federal wildland fire management strategy was needed. We said that  this cohesive strategy needed to focus on identifying options for reducing  fuels over the long term in order to decrease future wildland fire risks and  related costs. We also said that the strategy should identify the costs  associated with those different fuel reduction options over time, so that  the Congress could make cost-effective, strategic funding decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Important Progress Has Been Made in Addressing Federal Wildland Fire Management Problems over the Last 5 Years", "paragraphs": ["The federal government has made important progress over the last 5 years  in improving its management of wildland fire.

Similarly, the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003  directs that at least 50 percent of funding for fuel reduction projects  authorized under the act be allocated to wildland-urban interface areas.  While we have raised concerns about the way the agencies have defined  these areas and the specificity of their prioritization guidance, we believe  that the act\u2019s clarification of the community protection priority provides a  good starting point for identifying and prioritizing funding needs. Similarly,  in contrast to fiscal year 1999, when we reported that the Forest Service  had not requested increased funding to meet the growing fuel reduction  needs it had identified, fuel reduction funding for both the Forest Service  and Interior more than quadrupled by fiscal year 2005. The Congress, in  the Healthy Forests Restoration Act, also authorized $760 million per year  to be appropriated for hazardous fuels reduction activities, including  projects for reducing fuels on up to 20 million acres of land.

The  agencies also adopted a common interagency template for preparing plans  to ensure greater consistency in their contents.", "Coordination among federal agencies and their collaboration with  nonfederal partners, critical to effective implementation at the local level,  also has been improved. In 2001, as a result of congressional direction, the  agencies jointly formulated a 10-Year Comprehensive Strategy with the  Western Governors\u2019 Association to involve the states as full partners in  their efforts. An implementation plan adopted by the agencies in 2002  details goals, time lines, and responsibilities of the different parties for a  wide range of activities, including collaboration at the local level to  identify fuel reduction priorities in different areas.

Additionally, in 2004, to have a better baseline for measuring  progress, the Wildland Fire Leadership Council approved a nationwide  framework for monitoring the effects of wildland fire. While an  implementation plan is still needed for this framework, it nonetheless  represents a critical step toward enhancing wildland fire management  accountability."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agencies Face Several Challenges to Completing a Long- Needed Cohesive Strategy for Reducing Fuels and Responding to Wildland Fire Problems", "paragraphs": ["While the federal government has made important progress over the past 5  years in addressing wildland fire, a number of challenges still must be met  to complete development of a cohesive strategy that explicitly identifies  available long-term options and funding needed to reduce fuels on the  nation\u2019s forests and rangelands. Without such a strategy, the Congress will  not have an informed understanding of when, how, and at what cost  wildland fire problems can be brought under control. None of the strategic  documents adopted by the agencies to date have identified these options  and related funding needs, and the agencies have yet to delineate a plan or  schedule for doing so.

These challenges include using LANDFIRE to better reconcile the effects  of fuel reduction activities with the agencies\u2019 other stewardship  responsibilities for protecting ecosystem resources, such as air, water,  soils, and species habitat, which fuel reduction efforts can adversely  affect. The agencies also need LANDFIRE to help them better measure and  assess their performance. For example, the data produced by LANDFIRE  will help them devise a separate performance measure for maintaining  conditions on low-hazard lands to ensure that their conditions do not  deteriorate to more hazardous conditions while funding is being focused  on lands with high-hazard conditions.", "In implementing LANDFIRE, however, the agencies will have to overcome  the challenges presented by the current lack of a consistent approach to  assessing the risks of wildland fires to ecosystem resources as well as the  lack of an integrated, strategic, and unified approach to managing and  using information systems and data, including those such as LANDFIRE, in  wildland fire decision making. Currently, software, data standards,  equipment, and training vary among the agencies and field units in ways  that hamper needed sharing and consistent application of the data. Also,  LANDFIRE data and models may need to be revised to take into account  recent research findings that suggest part of the increase in wildland fire in  recent years has been caused by a shift in climate patterns. This research  also suggests that these new climate patterns may continue for decades,  resulting in further increases in the amount of wildland fire. Thus, the  nature, extent, and geographical distribution of hazards initially identified  in LANDFIRE, as well as the costs for addressing them, may have to be  reassessed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fire Management Plans Will Need to Be Updated with Latest Data and Research on Wildland Fire", "paragraphs": ["The agencies will need to update their local fire management plans when  more detailed, nationally consistent LANDFIRE data become available.

For example, a 2002 interagency analysis found that protecting wildland- urban interface communities more effectively\u2014as well as more cost- effectively\u2014might require locating a higher proportion of fuel reduction  projects outside of the wildland-urban interface than currently envisioned,  so that fires originating in the wildlands do not become too large to  suppress by the time they arrive at the interface. Moreover, other agency  research suggests that placing fuel reduction treatments in specific  geometric patterns may, for the same cost, provide protection for up to  three times as many community and ecosystem resources as do other  approaches, such as placing fuel breaks around communities and  ecosystems resources. Timely updating of fire management plans with the  latest research findings on optimal design and location of treatments also  will be critical to the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these plans.

However, to identify optimal and affordable  choices among these options, the agencies will have to complete certain  cost-effectiveness analysis efforts they currently have under way. These  efforts include an initial 2002 interagency analysis of options and costs for  reducing fuels, congressionally-directed improvements to their budget  allocation systems, and a new strategic analysis framework that considers  affordability.", "The Interagency Analysis of Options and Costs: In 2002, a team of Forest  Service and Interior experts produced an estimate of the funds needed to  implement eight different fuel reduction options for protecting  communities and ecosystems across the nation over the next century.  Their analysis also considered the impacts of fuels reduction activities on  future costs for other principal wildland fire management activities, such  as preparedness, suppression, and rehabilitation, if fuels were not  reduced. The team concluded that the option that would result in reducing  the risks to communities and ecosystems across the nation could require  an approximate tripling of current fuel reduction funding to about $1.4  billion for an initial period of a few years. These initially higher costs  would decline after fuels had been reduced enough to use less expensive  controlled burning methods in many areas and more fires could be  suppressed at lower cost, with total wildland fire management costs, as  well as risks, being reduced after 15 years. Alternatively, the team said that  not making a substantial short-term investment using a landscape focus  could increase both costs and risks to communities and ecosystems in the  long term. More recently, however, Interior has said that the costs and  time required to reverse current increasing risks may be less when other  vegetation management activities\u2014such as timber harvesting and habitat  improvements\u2014are considered that were not included in the interagency  team\u2019s original assessment but also can influence wildland fire.", "The cost of the 2002 interagency team\u2019s option that reduced risks to  communities and ecosystems over the long term is consistent with a June  2002 National Association of State Foresters\u2019 projection of the funding  needed to implement the 10-Year Comprehensive Strategy developed by  the agencies and the Western Governors\u2019 Association the previous year.  The state foresters projected a need for steady increases in fuel reduction  funding up to a level of about $1.1 billion by fiscal year 2011. This is  somewhat less than that of the interagency team\u2019s estimate, but still about  2-1/2 times current levels.", "The interagency team of experts who prepared the 2002 analysis of  options and associated costs said their estimates of long-term costs could  only be considered an approximation because the data used for their  national-level analysis were not sufficiently detailed. They said a more  accurate estimate of the long-term federal costs and consequences of  different options nationwide would require applying this national analysis  framework in smaller geographic areas using more detailed data, such as  that produced by LANDFIRE, and then aggregating these smaller-scale  results.", "The New Budget Allocation System: Agency officials told us that a tool for  applying this interagency analysis at a smaller geographic scale for  aggregation nationally may be another management system under  development\u2014the Fire Program Analysis system. This system, being  developed in response to congressional committee direction to improve  budget allocation tools, is designed to identify the most cost-effective  allocations of annual preparedness funding for implementing agency field  units\u2019 local fire management plans. Eventually, the Fire Program Analysis  system, being initially implemented in 2005, will use LANDFIRE data and  provide a smaller geographical scale for analyses of fuel reduction options  and thus, like LANDFIRE, will be critical for updating fire management  plans. Officials said that this preparedness budget allocation  system\uf8e7when integrated with an additional component now being  considered for allocating annual fuel reduction funding\u2014could be  instrumental in identifying the most cost-effective long-term levels, mixes,  and scheduling of these two wildland fire management activities.  Completely developing the Fire Program Analysis system, including the  fuel reduction funding component, is expected to cost about $40 million  and take until at least 2007 and perhaps until 2009.", "The New Strategic Analysis Effort: In May 2004, Agriculture and Interior  began the initial phase of a wildland fire strategic planning effort that also  might contribute to identifying long-term options and needed funding for  reducing fuels and responding to the nation\u2019s wildland fire problems. This  effort\uf8e7the Quadrennial Fire and Fuels Review\uf8e7is intended to result in an  overall federal interagency strategic planning document for wildland fire  management and risk reduction and to provide a blueprint for developing  affordable and integrated fire preparedness, fuels reduction, and fire  suppression programs. Because of this effort\u2019s consideration of  affordability, it may provide a useful framework for developing a cohesive  strategy that includes identifying long-term options and related funding  needs. The preliminary planning, analysis, and internal review phases of  this effort have been completed and an initial report is expected in July  2005.", "The improvements in data, modeling, and fire behavior research that the  agencies have under way, together with the new cost-effectiveness focus  of the Fire Program Analysis system to support local fire management  plans, represent important tools that the agencies can begin to use now to  provide the Congress with initial and successively more accurate  assessments of long-term fuel reduction options and related funding  needs. Moreover, a more transparent process of interagency analysis in  framing these options and their costs will permit better identification and  resolution of differing assumptions, approaches, and values.

The Congress needs to  understand these options and trade-offs in order to make informed policy  and appropriations decisions on this 21st century challenge.", "This is the same message we provided in 1999 when we first called for  development of a cohesive strategy identifying options and funding needs.  But it has not been completed. While the agencies are now in a better  position to do so, they must build on the progress made to date by  completing data and modeling efforts underway, updating their fire  management plans with the results of these data efforts and ongoing  research, and following through on recent cost-effectiveness and  affordability initiatives.

We look forward to the agencies  completing this important step. However, as noted at the outset of this  testimony, the window of opportunity for effectively addressing wildland  fire is rapidly closing. Thus, developing a cohesive strategy should not wait  until 2009, when LANDFIRE and the Fire Program Analysis are fully  developed.
