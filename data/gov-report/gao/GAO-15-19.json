Moreover, DDS offices generally assign claims randomly, so staff said it would only be by chance that they would review evidence from the same physician.", "SSA and, in turn, DDS performance measures that focus on prompt processing can create a disincentive for front-line staff to report potential fraud because of the time it requires to develop a fraud referral. Four of the five DDS offices GAO visited count time that staff spend on documenting potential fraud and developing fraud referrals against their processing time. Some staff at these DDS offices said this creates a reluctance to report potential fraud.", "The extent of anti-fraud training for staff varied among the five offices GAO visited and was often limited.

For instance, SSA is developing computer models that can draw from recent fraud cases to anticipate potentially fraudulent claims going forward. This effort has the potential to address vulnerabilities with existing fraud detection practices by, for example, helping to identify suspicious patterns of medical evidence. However, SSA has not yet articulated a plan for implementation, assigned responsibility for this initiative within the agency, or identified how the agency will obtain key pieces of data to identify physicians who are currently not tracked in existing claims' management systems. Furthermore, SSA is developing other initiatives, such as a centralized fraud prevention unit and analysis to detect patterns in disability appeals cases that could indicate fraud.

In the same time period,  however, at least 37 sanctioned physicians in these states provided  medical evidence to the agency on behalf of claimants and 22 of these  physicians provided such evidence after they had been sanctioned,  potentially affecting the validity of those claims (see table 2). Our results  demonstrate that, in some instances, SSA is accepting medical evidence  from potentially questionable and unreliable physicians. We identified  sanctioned physicians who were convicted of health care fraud or other  program-related crimes who submitted medical evidence on behalf of  claimants. For example, one physician, who was placed on the  sanctioned list in 2011 for smuggling over $1 million in foreign  misbranded and unapproved drugs into the United States and  administering them to his patients, submitted evidence for at least 33  disability claimants in the past 2 years. Such information could be useful  to front-line workers in that they would be able to better determine  whether more scrutiny of the medical evidence may be warranted,  potentially resulting in a reduced risk of fraud.

According to SSA officials, the agency has explored whether it would be  beneficial to consider physicians\u2019 licensing status when making a  disability determination. The agency identified several logistical barriers to  checking licensure status for all physicians who submit medical evidence,  and also cited complex policy implications that they believe could result in  increased appeals and potentially disadvantage claimants, among other  challenges. For example, SSA would have to determine when and what  evidence from a physician to exclude and the type of sanctions to  consider, among other things.

Further, the SSA  OIG also reported that because the sanctioned list generally contains the  names of individual physicians, a sanctioned physician who provides  medical evidence on behalf of a claimant may not be detected by the  DDS if they work for a hospital or clinic. We found similar limitations with  the data that DDSs currently collect. For instance, SSA does not require  DDSs to routinely and uniformly record the names and addresses of  physicians who submit medical evidence on behalf of claimants. As a  result, DDSs collect inconsistent and incomplete data on medical  providers, which limits SSA\u2019s ability to identify sanctioned physicians.

A system such as this would give SSA  the ability to systematically check large numbers of claims for potential  fraud in addition to using front-line staff to spot suspicious patterns in  claims. Staff from SSA\u2019s Office of Information Security began this  analytics effort in February 2014 and piloted these capabilities in two  stages. In the first stage, SSA developed its initial computer model and  identified existing sources of data within the agency. SSA tested and  refined its model by using recent cases of alleged fraud in Puerto Rico,  New York, and West Virginia to determine whether it would have detected  characteristics of potential fraud in those cases. SSA reported that it  completed this stage in May 2014 and that its efforts were successful. In  the second stage, SSA will explore purchasing a tool from a vendor and  using analytics to spot suspicious claims in other locations.

Without the ability to consistently  identify individual physicians, SSA\u2019s ability to detect potential physician- assisted fraud may be hampered.

For  example, the agency is in the process of transitioning DDSs from five  different legacy case management systems to a unified Disability Case  Processing System that will be used by all DDSs. SSA officials stated  that the National Vendor File that will be linked to this system has the  ability to capture individual physician license numbers. This vendor file  currently only collects the same information as the DDS\u2019s existing legacy  systems, which may or may not include this information because SSA  does not require DDSs to collect unique identifiers for physicians.

Officials we spoke with at the Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\u2014who implemented their own fraud  analytics program in 2011\u2014and several private disability insurers told us  that analytics are helpful for determining which claims are at risk for  potential fraud and where to focus investigative resources. However, they  noted that organizations cannot rely on analytics alone to determine  whether fraud is occurring and that considerable staff resources are often  needed to develop leads that result from the initial analysis. For instance,  officials at one private disability insurer said that analysts may spend half  a day examining a claim before deciding whether additional investigation  is warranted.

We also recommended  that SSA develop a long-term plan to address service delivery challenges,  including those related to human capital and information technology  initiatives. The agency has noted the benefit of using data analytics to  prevent fraud and has mentioned data analytics in its Strategic Plan, 2015  budget request, and Information Resource Management Strategic Plan.  However, these agency documents do not provide concrete steps or  identify the needed resources to make this undertaking successful.  Additionally, staff working on the analytics pilot told us that SSA has yet to  determine which component of SSA will ultimately have responsibility for  following up on leads.

They are also expected to make timely and  accurate disability determinations. In some instances, the agency\u2019s focus  on making determinations quickly has been a disincentive to reporting  suspicious physicians or potential fraud. Unless SSA and the DDSs work  to remedy performance measures that primarily focus on and reward  timeliness, possibly at the expense of delving into potentially problematic  claims, the agency will remain vulnerable to potential fraud. Further,  absent enhanced and consistent training, front-line staff may lack the  expertise to identify and report potential fraud.", "SSA has some controls in place to help ensure that sanctioned  physicians do not perform exams on behalf of the agency. However, the  agency could be exposing itself to risk by using medical evidence from  physicians who are sanctioned by either federal or state governments.  While there are numerous reasons a physician can be sanctioned,  without knowing whether such physicians have provided medical  evidence and why they were sanctioned, SSA could be missing  information needed to identify and flag for additional scrutiny potentially  falsified medical evidence.", "Lastly, as the agency begins to shift its focus to better detection and  prevention of potential fraud through analytics, it will be important to  balance these new efforts with the existing workload demands on front- line staff.

To address potential disincentives for staff to detect and prevent  physician-assisted fraud, SSA should review the standards used to  assess DDS performance; and develop and distribute promising  practices to incentivize staff to better balance the goal of processing  claims promptly with the equally important goal of identifying and  reporting evidence of potential fraud.  2.  To ensure that the agency captures complete information on  suspicious claims, SSA should issue guidance to remind DDSs of its  existing policy to report all claims with potentially fraudulent medical  evidence to the SSA OIG, even if sufficient evidence exists to deny a  claim.  3.  To help front-line staff identify potentially fraudulent activity, SSA  should enhance its training efforts by ensuring it provides fraud- related refresher training to all DDS employees on a regular basis.  Such training should include the identification of suspicious medical  evidence and providers, as well as the processes and procedures for  reporting such information. To facilitate its efforts, the agency could  coordinate with the SSA OIG and draw on the type of training  provided by CDI units.  4.  To address the potential risks associated with medical evidence  submitted by sanctioned physicians, SSA should evaluate the threat  posed by this information and, if warranted, consider changes to its  policies and procedures.  5.  To help ensure new initiatives that use analytics to identify potential  fraud schemes are successful, SSA should develop an  implementation plan that identifies both short- and long-term actions,  including: data requirements, e.g., the collection of unique medical provider  timeframes for implementation;  resources and staffing needs; how technology improvement will be integrated into existing  technology improvements such as the Disability Case Processing  System and National Vendor File; and how different initiatives will interact and support each other."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this product to the Social Security Administration  for comment.

SSA did not specify why it did  not agree fully, but did outline the critical role that field and DDS office  staff play in identifying and detecting potential fraud. In our report, we  acknowledge that these employees are the first line of defense against  fraud. We also noted that based on our interviews, and review of agency  and DDS performance standards, that there is a potential disincentive to  report suspicious claims. If properly designed and managed, performance  standards that include identifying and reporting suspicious claims could  provide incentives to encourage staff to devote more time to program  integrity issues while maintaining their ability to process claims in a timely  manner.

Our report states that the full extent and nature of physician- assisted fraud is difficult to measure and that even one instance of this  type of fraud could result in a large number of beneficiaries improperly  receiving benefits, as well as substantial costs to the government. SSA  also commented that our report overemphasized the potential utility of the  List of Excluded Individuals and Entities for identifying potential physician- assisted fraud. In our report, we noted key limitations and challenges to  using this list. Nonetheless, we maintain that some physicians\u2014an  important component of the disability determination process\u2014have been  at least suspected of fraudulent activities by others and this is important  information for SSA to consider. We believe SSA can improve staffs\u2019  ability to identify cases that deserve closer scrutiny by more fully  assessing the potential threat posed by sanctioned physicians.
