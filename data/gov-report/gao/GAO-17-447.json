Indian Affairs is in the process of replacing 3 schools and plans to replace 10 additional schools from a list of 54 schools that applied in 2015. However, Indian Affairs has not developed a comprehensive, long-term capital asset plan for the repair or replacement of the remaining schools in its portfolio, as required by Interior policy. Until Indian Affairs develops a capital asset plan, it risks using federal funds inefficiently and not prioritizing funds to schools with the most pressing needs.", "Indian Affairs has not consistently used accountability measures or conducted sufficient oversight to ensure that BIE school construction projects are completed on time, within budget, and meet schools' needs. For instance, Indian Affairs does not always use accountability measures, such as warranties, to have builders replace defective parts or repair poor workmanship. Project managers, who are responsible for helping to ensure accountability, do not always understand how to use accountability measures because Indian Affairs has not provided guidance on when and how to use them to ensure successful completion of construction projects. In addition, Indian Affairs has not adequately overseen school projects managed by tribal organizations. Officials interviewed by GAO at three schools said Indian Affairs was not timely in reviewing new school designs, which resulted in project delays. For 49 construction projects completed from 2003 through 2016, the inconsistent use of accountability measures and inadequate oversight led to projects that took longer than expected, were sometimes over budget, or had to be scaled back to remain within their allotted budgets. For example, of the 49 projects:", "16 were 3 or more years behind schedule (see fig. 1).", "1 was almost 10 years behind schedule.", "10 were 20 percent or more over budget.", "Further, the new projects did not always meet schools' needs, according to school officials.

According to OMB guidance, agencies should  engage in capital asset planning and management to help ensure that  their assets are acquired, operated, and maintained at the right size, cost,  and condition to support agency missions and objectives. OMB encourages agencies to develop capital asset plans as a part of their  strategic planning efforts because such plans help provide agencies with  information and analysis needed to make more informed long-term  decisions.

This outline lacked key details, including a description of  agency goals and plans, a prioritized list of future school repair and  renovation projects, updates on the status of previous projects, and  projected student enrollment numbers. In addition, in May 2017 Indian  Affairs stated that the Division of Facilities Management and Construction  had submitted a prioritized list of projects to be funded in 2017 to Indian  Affairs\u2019 Construction Investment Review Board. Officials said that given  constrained funding, they generally based their plans on the previous  year\u2019s budget, rather than on need.

Portions of permanent modular buildings would be  manufactured off-site, transported, and then assembled at the site. This  construction technique can reduce the construction period because much  of the work can be done simultaneously, rather than sequentially.  Officials said another way they will address schedule delays is by using a  design-build approach in which the same contractor is responsible for  designing and building a facility rather than having one contractor design  the project and other contractors bid to build it.", "Officials at the three BIE schools we visited that had recent federally  managed construction projects pointed to aspects of the projects that did  not meet their needs.

In particular, in  interviews with Indian Affairs and school officials and our review of  contract files for recent school construction projects, we found Indian  Affairs officials responsible for working with the contracting officer did not  always understand how to use accountability measures. Because Indian  Affairs does not have guidance on incorporating accountability measures  into its school construction contracts with commercial vendors, and on  properly implementing them during contract performance, facilities  management officials we interviewed did not always understand which  tools were available to ensure accountability in construction or how to use  those tools.

Contracting officers, construction  project managers, and a senior facilities management official with whom  we discussed the use of retainage said they generally did not use this  measure to ensure accountability in contracts, and they appeared to  misunderstand how it could be used. Retained funds can provide an  immediate source of funding for correcting problems that a contractor  cannot or will not correct. When asked why they typically did not use  retainage in contracts, the officials we interviewed provided various  reasons.

For  example, officials at four schools we visited told us they had roofs that  leaked soon after installation. As a result, there was damage to the  interior of the buildings which had to be repaired at additional cost to the  government. At two schools, the roofs leaked from the day they were  installed, officials said. Indian Affairs accepted the roofs as meeting  contract requirements, even though the leaks were not satisfactorily  repaired prior to acceptance. At one of the schools, officials said the new  roof had to be replaced two more times.", "Another school we visited in Arizona almost two years after it was built  reported a long list of nonfunctioning and malfunctioning building  components\u2014including technological, electrical, and plumbing problems  and issues with safety and handicap accessibility\u2014that were not  addressed when Indian Affairs accepted the building or during the  warranty period. We also observed classrooms where agency officials  pointed out windows that did not allow enough room for students to  escape in case of emergency, and other emergency exit windows with  rails that had sharp protrusions that could cause injury, among other  construction and safety issues. School officials told us they found Indian  Affairs to be unresponsive to their efforts to resolve warranty issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lifecycle Cost Analysis", "paragraphs": ["Lifecycle cost analysis is a tool to determine the most cost-effective  option among competing alternatives to purchase, own, operate,  maintain, and dispose of a building. However, we found that some  recently replaced BIE schools were planned, designed, and built without  first conducting a lifecycle cost analysis. Such analysis would have  required the design to take into account the overall cost and the ability of  school staff to operate and maintain the facility over its useful life.", "According to senior Indian Affairs officials, a lifecycle cost analysis is not  routinely conducted for new school construction projects. As a result,  schools have been designed and equipped with features, such as  complex heating and cooling systems, that some school facility staff do  not have the technical skills, training, and certification to properly operate  and maintain. Officials at three schools we visited told us they sometimes  had to override the systems in an attempt to address operational  problems. Improper use and maintenance of these systems may  ultimately result in increased costs, reduced performance, and shorter  lifespans, and may potentially void the warranty. Additionally, in our  review of contract files, we found a letter from a contractor recommending  that one school contract with certified maintenance staff to maintain its  complex heating and cooling system after school staff were unsuccessful  in maintaining it themselves. Some BIE schools do not have sufficient  resources to hire contractors or certified maintenance staff, or they may  be in such remote locations that it is difficult to find qualified staff.", "When we asked Indian Affairs officials why they did not routinely analyze  the lifecycle costs of building systems and required that schools be  designed with complex heating and cooling systems, they told us they  believed such systems were a requirement under federal green building  standards. However, such complex systems are not an absolute  requirement under the green building certification system adopted by  Indian Affairs, which allows flexibility to substitute simpler systems as long  as the building\u2019s overall rating is within the acceptable range. Instead, it is Indian Affairs\u2019 own School Facilities Design Handbook\u2014which federal  contractors and tribal organizations use when designing schools\u2014that  requires systems, such as those for heating and cooling, that have  complex features. However, the handbook also requires that a school\u2019s  design take into account an analysis of the lifecycle costs of purchasing,  installing, and operating such systems over time. In addition, the  handbook requires that when selecting a heating and cooling system,  factors including a system\u2019s simplicity of operation and its maintainability  also be taken into account.", "The design handbook\u2019s requirement to take lifecycle cost-effectiveness  and other factors into consideration, and the requirement to install heating  and cooling systems with complex features, could be in conflict in some  situations, such as when school facility staff lack the requisite skills and  training to operate and maintain such systems. Federal standards for  internal control require management to define objectives so that they are  consistent with external requirements and internal expectations. If Indian  Affairs had ensured that a comprehensive lifecycle cost analysis was  conducted, as required by its own handbook, it may have found that in  some cases such systems were not cost effective or practical when  compared to other alternatives. However, even if a thorough lifecycle cost  analysis demonstrates that the requirement for sophisticated heating and  cooling operating systems is not practicable, it is not clear from the  handbook when and how school designs can deviate from this  requirement. Until Indian Affairs clarifies its design handbook\u2019s  requirements, the agency risks spending money on costly equipment that  school officials may be unable to properly operate and maintain.", "Without specific guidance for ensuring accountability in contracts,  contracting officers and project managers may continue to misunderstand  how and when to use accountability measures that are available to them  under federal regulations. Therefore, Indian Affairs will have little  assurance that contracts are consistently managed to ensure projects are  completed satisfactorily, on time, and within budget. As a result, Indian  Affairs could risk spending millions of dollars on new schools that do not  meet the needs of students and staff in terms of their size, quality of  construction, or sustainability over time."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "For Tribally Managed Projects, Indian Affairs Has Not Provided Sufficient Oversight and Technical Assistance to Ensure Projects Are on Time, Within Budget, and Meet Schools\u2019 Needs", "paragraphs": ["For school construction projects managed by tribal organizations under  grants or self-determination contracts, Indian Affairs also has not provided  sufficient oversight and technical assistance to the tribal organizations.  Indian Affairs\u2019 facilities management manual states that facilities  management and regional facilities staff are responsible for providing  technical assistance throughout the construction process. In addition, the  manual notes that the Indian Affairs staff are also responsible for fiscal  and programmatic oversight of facilities programs, including those  operated under tribal grants and self-determination contracts. In  addition, according to the Guide to Opportunities for Improving Grant  Accountability by the Domestic Working Group Grant Accountability  Project, agencies need to oversee grants to ensure that grant funds are  used for intended purposes and will lead to planned results. When  grantees further distribute funds, such as to contractors, it is important for  them to be able to ensure that the contractors perform in accordance with  their contracts. One way agencies help ensure compliance with grant  requirements is to provide technical assistance on how to manage grant  funds.", "Because tribal organizations may not always have the capacity to ensure  accountability for large school construction projects, Indian Affairs policy  requires an organizational capacity review before awarding school  construction grants. The organizational capacity review is an  assessment of the tribal organization\u2019s capacity to perform construction  activities, including assessing its financial management, procurement,  personnel, and property management systems. Indian Affairs contracts  with a certified public accountant to conduct the review. The findings of  the review help the agency determine if the tribal organization represents  a high risk of not being able to complete the project satisfactorily. Indian  Affairs uses the risk rating to determine its level of oversight, which is  reflected in the performance, reporting, and funding schedules included  as grant conditions. If it determines the organization is at high risk,  Indian Affairs may decide not to award the grant and manage the project  itself, although Indian Affairs officials told us this rarely occurs. Instead,  Indian Affairs usually adds conditions to the grant or self-determination  contract with the tribal organization that are intended to increase Indian  Affairs\u2019 oversight. Examples of such grant conditions we found in our  grant file reviews and in interviews included Indian Affairs: making progress payments only after the tribal organization is able to  demonstrate that it has met project requirements, rather than  providing grant funds to the organization in one lump sum;  requiring tribal organizations to provide more detailed financial reports  and undergo additional project monitoring; or disbursing the grant on a reimbursement basis, meaning the tribal  organization has to spend its own money and be reimbursed after  project requirements are met.", "Some tribal organizations do have the experience and capacity to  manage large construction projects. For example, at two schools, we met  with officials who had previously managed construction and maintenance  projects for multiple tribally managed schools, and, therefore, had the  capacity to manage large projects. In one case, the school used a tribal  grants office to manage grant funds. The school was also part of a  consortium of tribal schools that obtained facilities management and  architectural services through a tribally administered non-profit  organization. The organization employed two experienced architects who  served as project managers. The other school was also part of a  consortium, this one with three schools for which the consortium  manages educational as well as construction funds for the schools.", "However, not all tribal organizations have such high capacity. Even  though Indian Affairs evaluates the capacity of these organizations before  awarding a grant or self-determination contract for school construction, it  does not always provide those that lack capacity with sufficient technical  assistance to improve their ability to manage construction projects.  Instead, to address these capacity issues, Indian Affairs directs these  organizations to hire professional project managers, construction  administrators, and on-site inspectors to help them manage the  construction projects. However, some tribal organizations were not able  to perform basic aspects of project management, such as finding  professional services providers. During our contract and grant file review,  we found correspondence from a tribal organization that was struggling to  hire a skilled project manager for its school and dormitory replacement  project. Without sufficient technical assistance, the tribal organization  selected a relatively inexperienced project manager over a more  experienced one. The school subsequently had problems with the project  manager and had to hire another one, resulting in delays of several  months. Further, school officials said they did not know how to remedy  issues that arose during or after construction was completed or which  office to contact for assistance. They noted that when they reached out to  Indian Affairs, Indian Affairs did not provide adequate technical  assistance.", "In addition, unless a tribal organization specifically asks for assistance,  Indian Affairs generally does not provide technical assistance to tribal  organizations on how to negotiate and administer contracts and hold  contractors accountable for completing projects on time and within  budget. According to Indian Affairs\u2019 guidance on overseeing tribally  managed construction projects, tribal organizations must request  technical assistance in writing. Tribal organizations managing school  construction projects may need more oversight and technical assistance  to develop contract requirements and ensure they are met. For example,  an environmental audit cited one newly replaced BIE school in Arizona for  having biosolids and lagoon sludge in a fenced-in area adjacent to the  school. The contractor had removed the sludge during the school  construction process and renovation of a lagoon on school property.  According to Indian Affairs, the school did not properly contract for  renovating the lagoon, did not set aside funds for sludge disposal, and  allowed the contractor to dump the sludge near the school rather than  dispose of it properly. The school subsequently had to hire a new  contractor to dispose of the sludge at an additional cost to Indian Affairs  of $1.8 million.", "We found other instances in which tribal organizations managing BIE  school construction projects would have benefited from more technical  assistance from Indian Affairs to structure their construction contracts to  ensure they held contractors accountable. For example, a BIE school in  South Dakota that was replaced in 2009 requested technical assistance  from Indian Affairs when it wanted to make a claim against a contractor  for not properly testing the soil under the school, which school officials  said caused structural damage to the new buildings. The officials said the  school lacked the resources to hire an attorney and wanted to obtain  assistance from an Interior attorney or obtain Indian Affairs funds to pay  for a private attorney. However, Indian Affairs did not provide any  technical assistance. Officials said the school had been built under a  grant and as a result the tribal organization was responsible for settling  any problems with its construction contracts. This is consistent with  examples we found in our prior work. As we reported in 2015, one tribally  managed project at a South Dakota school to construct a $1.5 million  building for bus maintenance and storage resulted in a building that was  too small to accommodate a large school bus on a hydraulic lift when the  exterior door was closed. Leaving the door open was not practical in cold  South Dakota winters. The tribal organization had not used financial  incentives to ensure the contract performance was satisfactory.  Specifically, it paid the firm nearly the full amount for the project before  final completion, according to school officials, leaving it little financial  leverage over the contractor. Unless Indian Affairs provides assistance to  tribal organizations in structuring contracts to protect their interests, tribal  organizations with low capacity may have little recourse to address poor  contractor performance, possibly resulting in a waste of federal funds.", "Furthermore, we found that Indian Affairs did not always provide  adequate oversight for ongoing tribally managed projects. For example,  an official at one school we reviewed in South Dakota told us that the  Indian Affairs technical representative only visited the school once in two  years when it was completing its project. Indian Affairs\u2019 policy states that  the technical representative will inspect projects of this size quarterly.  Officials at another school we reviewed in South Dakota told us that  Indian Affairs was so slow to perform its oversight tasks that school and  tribal officials had to travel to Albuquerque, where the Division of Facilities  Management and Construction is located, to inquire about the delays in  reviewing and approving the design of the new school. Moreover, Indian  Affairs was not always able to perform oversight before payments were  made to tribal organizations. Indian Affairs facilities officials told us that  grant officers, the BIE officials that administer school construction grants,  occasionally approve payments without proper review by Indian Affairs.  For example, Indian Affairs facilities managers were sometimes informed  that BIE had fully allocated funds for school construction projects before  the facilities managers had a chance to review the final project.", "As a result of this lack of technical assistance and oversight, some new  school facility projects managed by tribal organizations took longer than  expected and were over budget or had to be scaled back by eliminating  buildings or major features. Eight of the 30 tribally managed school  replacement projects completed since 2003 were completed three or  more years after the estimated completion date. Three of the 30 projects  were 20 percent or more over budget, and one was more than 60 percent  over budget (see fig. 5). Some planned school designs had to be scaled  back to stay within budget. For example, one replacement plan for a  school in Arizona initially included both an elementary and a high school,  but the tribal organization was not able to build the high school for  budgetary reasons. Officials at the South Dakota school that  experienced delays in obtaining Indian Affairs\u2019 approval for its design told  us that due to the delays, the costs of supplies and labor increased,  resulting in its planned gymnasium and kitchen no longer being within  budget.", "Delays and issues with budget may also be expected on the last three  schools on BIE\u2019s 2004 school replacement list, two of which are tribally  managed replacement projects. During our visits to the three schools, we  noted that Indian Affairs has not addressed tribal organizations\u2019 requests  for assistance or reviewed desired changes in a timely manner. All three  schools received funds for planning and design in 2013 and 2014 and are  currently at various stages of design. As of February 2017, construction  had not yet begun on any of the projects. One school was concerned  about rising costs, mainly because BIE was slow to review the school\u2019s  requests for changes in the type of space and square footage allowed by  BIE. The tribal organization waited over 2 years to obtain a waiver from  BIE to build a slightly larger facility based on the reservation\u2019s current  census data, which indicated larger incoming kindergarten classes than  BIE had projected. Although BIE eventually granted the school more  space, it did not initially grant additional funding. Until March 2017, the  school and Indian Affairs were at an impasse because the cost for the  new design exceeded the budget allotted by Indian Affairs. School  officials were concerned that as time passed, the cost of construction  continued to rise. In March 2017, Indian Affairs approved funding to  supplement the project and notified school officials that the design could  proceed. For another school on the 2004 replacement list, the tribal  organization asked BIE to approve additional space for its gymnasium.  School officials said that after months of hearing nothing from BIE  officials, the tribal organization decided to move ahead with the project  with a smaller gym.", "Until Indian Affairs improves its oversight of tribally managed construction  projects and provides technical assistance to those tribal organizations  that lack the capacity to manage major projects, tribal organizations may  not be able to ensure their new schools are completed on schedule,  within budget, and in accordance with schools\u2019 needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Indian Affairs Did Not Adequately Maintain Contract and Grant Files, Making it Difficult to Ensure Accountability", "paragraphs": ["Indian Affairs has not maintained copies of complete contract or grant  files for recently completed BIE school and dormitory construction  projects. The agency was unable to provide us complete sets of key  contract or grant documents for any of the 10 recently constructed  schools we selected for review. Numerous key documents were missing  from all of the files we requested. In one case, BIE was unable to locate  any of its own grant files for a tribally managed school and dormitory  construction project completed in 2014. The school faced many serious  construction issues, such as non-working fire alarms and large cracks in  the foundation, but because school and agency officials were unable to  provide the grant documents, there was no documentation to identify how  the tribal organization attempted to address these problems or how the  contractor responded. Interior\u2019s Departmental Manual on Information  Resources Management requires the bureaus to develop efficient and  effective filing systems to organize and retrieve their records. In  addition, for contracts for federally managed construction projects, the  Federal Acquisition Regulation requires assignment of responsibility for  their maintenance, and establishment of a system to locate any contract  files promptly when files are not maintained in a central location. In our  review, we found that different phases of major Indian Affairs construction  projects were sometimes handled by different contracting offices, which  each maintained the files in their respective locations. Indian Affairs  officials said that it is Indian Affairs\u2019 policy that the contracting or grant  officers maintain a complete set of files. They said this does not always  occur. Further, they told us that contracting officers have large workloads  that sometimes take precedence over maintaining contract files.", "According to Indian Affairs officials, the agency has begun to maintain  electronic files for contracts awarded after 2012, which could make it  easier to locate certain files. However, it is unclear whether contract  administration files will be included as part of this system. Further, agency  officials told us the new system will not include grant files and self- determination contract files for tribally managed construction projects.", "Turnover among senior Indian Affairs\u2019 managers responsible for  overseeing school construction and a resulting loss of institutional  knowledge makes a set of complete contract files important in order to  better manage current and future projects. Without a complete set of  construction contract or grant files for recently built BIE schools, it is also  difficult to use contract provisions to hold contractors accountable for  problems resulting from construction. Further, without a complete set of  contract files for all projects, Indian Affairs will be less likely to learn from  past experience to ensure future school and dormitory construction  projects are better managed.

The cost of repairing,  renovating, and replacing BIE\u2019s school and dormitory facilities represents  a substantial liability, particularly in a resource-constrained environment.

Moreover, by including more detailed information on proposed capital  expenditures for future projects and updates on ongoing and recent  construction in its annual congressional budget justifications, Indian  Affairs could provide Congress with more complete information on the  costs of its programs. Such information could help inform decision-making  about the agency\u2019s annual budget for school construction and, more  generally, provide greater transparency of federal resource allocation and  facilitate oversight.", "It is critical that Indian Affairs develop and implement clear, specific  guidance for project managers and contracting officers on the effective  use of accountability measures to ensure that federally managed projects  are on time, within budget, and meet schools\u2019 needs. Without such  guidance, Indian Affairs may be unable to ensure that new construction  meets the needs of students and staff in terms of its size, quality, or  sustainability over time. In addition, unclear guidance in Indian Affairs\u2019  design handbook makes it difficult to ensure that design requirements\u2014 such as for heating and cooling systems\u2014are cost effective and practical.  Without clarification on when and how school designs can deviate from  such requirements based on lifecycle cost analysis, the agency risks  planning, designing, and building school facilities that do not offer the  most cost effective solutions over their lifespan or include features that  school facility staff can easily operate and maintain. As a result, school  facilities staff may continue to override the systems in an attempt to  address operational problems causing systems to fail, operate  inefficiently, or void warranties, which could lead to increased costs,  reduced performance, and shorter system lifespan.", "For tribally managed projects, unless Indian Affairs provides adequate  technical assistance and oversight, it may not be able to ensure that tribal  organizations are well positioned to effectively manage their construction  projects.

We  believe that an updated design handbook that includes a process for  deviations is critical, and we agree with Interior\u2019s statement that the  handbook does not need to describe every scenario where a deviation  may be requested.
