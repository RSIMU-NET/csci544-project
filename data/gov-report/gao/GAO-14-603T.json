GAO's work over more than 30 years demonstrates that these are longstanding policy issues, without easy solutions. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) May 2013 release of a National Mitigation Framework and establishment of a group to help coordinate interagency and intergovernmental mitigation efforts offers one avenue for leadership on these issues.", "In ongoing work on federal resilience efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, GAO identified three high-level actions that demonstrated an intensified federal focus on incorporating resilience-building into the recovery.", "The President issued an executive order to coordinate the recovery effort and created a task force that issued 69 recommendations aimed at improving recovery from Sandy and future disasters\u2014including recommendations designed to facilitate resilient rebuilding.", "Congress appropriated about $50 billion in supplemental funds for multiple recovery efforts, including at least five federal programs that help support resilience-building efforts. One of these, FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), is the only federal program designed specifically to promote mitigation against future losses in the wake of a disaster; while, another, the Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program made more than $4 billion available for transit resilience projects.", "The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 provided additional responsibilities and authorities related to FEMA's mitigation and recovery efforts. In response, FEMA has undertaken efforts to make HMGP easier for states to use\u2014for example by streamlining application procedures.

Hazard mitigation and climate adaptation are strategies to  promote resilience to extreme weather events, among other things. The  term mitigation, in this context, describes the capabilities necessary to  reduce loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters;  while, climate change adaptation is specific to such adjustments made in  response to actual or expected climate change. These resilience-building  strategies include efforts to protect critical infrastructure and reduce  specific vulnerabilities\u2014by for example, increasing the capacity of storm  water systems and raising river or coastal dikes.", "As we reported in 2012, from fiscal years 2004 through 2011, the Federal  Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) obligated over $80 billion in  federal assistance for disasters, and the growing number of major  disaster declarations had contributed to increasing federal disaster  assistance expenditures. Moreover, the United States Global Change  Research Program has reported that the impacts and costliness of  weather disasters\u2014resulting from floods, drought, and other events such  as hurricanes\u2014will increase in significance as what are considered \u201crare\u201d  events become more common and intense due to climate change. In  addition, less acute effects of changes in the climate, such as sea level  rise, could also result in significant long-term effects on people and  property.

For our prior work, among  other things, we reviewed key federal documents and efforts such as  previous congressional reports and publications from the federal agencies  involved in mitigation activities, analyzed information collected from  relevant agencies and officials, and visited locations with comprehensive  mitigation programs. Further details on the scope and methodology of our  previously issued reports are available within each of the published  products. For our ongoing work on federal mitigation efforts, we reviewed  documents such as the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Strategy and  FEMA\u2019s report on recommendations for a national strategy to reduce the  costs of future disasters, and studies on nonfederal resilience-building  efforts, and we interviewed federal officials at FEMA and the Department  of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

For example, leaders may be concerned that hazard mitigation  activities will detract from economic development goals and may perceive  that mitigation is costly and involves solutions that are overly technical  and complex.", "In our work on hazard mitigation issued in August 2007, we found that  these issues persisted. We reported that hazard mitigation goals and  local economic interests often conflict, and the resulting tension can often  have a profound effect on mitigation efforts. For example, we reported  that community goals such as building housing and promoting economic  development may be higher priorities than formulating mitigation  regulations that may include restrictive development regulations and more  stringent building codes. In particular, local government officials we  contacted as part of that work commented that developers often want to  increase growth in hazard-prone areas (e.g., along the coast or in  floodplains) to support economic development. These areas are often  desirable for residences and businesses, and such development  increases local tax revenues but is generally in conflict with mitigation  goals.", "In 2012, the National Academies National Research Council (NRC)  issued a report on disaster resilience, noting that understanding,  managing, and reducing disaster risks provide a foundation for building  resilience to disasters. Risk management\u2014both personal and  collective\u2014is important in the resilience context because the perceptions  of and choices about risk shape how individuals, groups, and public- and  private-sector organizations behave, how they respond during and after a  disaster event, and how they plan for future disasters. However, the  National Academies report described a variety of challenges that affect  risk management.

Residents of hazard-prone areas tend to treat the possibility of a  disaster\u2019s occurrence as sufficiently low to permit them to ignore the  consequences.", "We have also reported that the availability of federal assistance may  inhibit actions to mitigate disaster losses. As long ago as 1980, we  reported that individuals may not act to protect themselves from the  effects of severe weather if they believe the federal government will  eventually help pay for their losses. The 1993 National Performance  Review also found that the availability of post-disaster federal funds may  reduce incentives for mitigation. Moreover, FEMA\u2019s 1993 review of the  National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program concluded that at the  state level there is \u201cthe expectation that federal disaster assistance will  address the problem after the event. Concerns about individuals\u2019 ability  to appropriately evaluate risk and take action to protect themselves  continued in our August 2007 work when we reported that individuals  often have a misperception that natural hazard events will not occur in  their community and are not interested in learning of the likelihood of an  event occurring.

At the  same time, we testified that a lack of comprehensive, reliable data to  make decisions about cost-benefit tradeoffs may also inhibit local  governments from deciding to invest in hazard mitigation activities. First,  we noted that by definition, natural hazard mitigation reduces the loss of  life and property below the levels that could be expected without  mitigation, but it is impossible to measure what loss would have been  incurred without mitigation. Second, the dispersion of mitigation funds and  responsibilities across various agencies makes it difficult to determine the  collective benefit of federal efforts. Finally, we noted that federal savings  depend on the frequency of future disasters and the extent to which the  federal government will bear the resulting losses, which is unknown.", "Moreover, in 2007 we reported that limited public awareness may also be  a result of the complexity of the information that is needed for individuals  to understand their hazard risks. We concluded that for local decision  makers to develop mitigation strategies for their communities they need  appropriate and easily understandable information about the probability of  natural hazards and that efforts to improve public awareness and  education are long-term and require sustained effort. Similarly, in our  February 2014 testimony on limiting fiscal exposure from and increasing  resilience to climate change, we noted that local decision makers need  expert assistance translating climate change information into something  that is locally relevant. The 2012 NRC study identified understanding how  to share scientific information with broad audiences as one of the key  challenges for resilience researchers.", "The challenges we identified in prior work\u2014competing priorities for state  and local governments, imperfect individual risk decision making, and  imprecise, incomplete, and complex information about both risk and  benefits\u2014are difficult issues that are likely to persist. These issues are  longstanding and difficult policy issues. Indeed, the increasing number of  federal disaster declarations and the growing role of the federal  government in funding post disaster relief and recovery efforts may serve  to exacerbate some of the inherent challenges. We are encouraged that  DHS finalized the National Mitigation Framework in 2013 to coordinate  interagency and intergovernmental efforts and that the framework  established a Mitigation Framework Leadership Group to coordinate  mitigation efforts of relevant local, state, tribal, and federal organizations.  The framework and the group create an avenue for interagency and  intergovernmental leadership to pursue solutions to these difficult policy  issues.

In 1992, voters approved an additional 0.5 percent transfer tax on  top of the existing 1 percent tax on all real estate transactions, with  the tax paid equally by buyer and seller. This portion of the transfer  tax is available for voluntary seismic upgrades to residential property.  Residential property owners have up to 1 year to complete the  seismic retrofit (or lose the funds).

The buyout  program developed a novel land-transfer system and engaged  government agencies and non-profit organizations to execute it. The  non-profit organization\u2019s role was instrumental because landowners  were hesitant to sell their property to the government, but were  comfortable selling it to the non-profit. The non-profit used a formula  to set the land price, which contributed to the success of the buyout  because purchasers didn\u2019t have to negotiate prices with each  individual landowner and it removed the incentive for landowners to  hold out for a better price.", "Chairman Begich, Ranking Member Paul, and members of the  subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
