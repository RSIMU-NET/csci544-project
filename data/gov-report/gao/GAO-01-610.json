To assess VA\u2019s implementation of its policies for servicing troubled loans, we visited three of the nine VA regional loan centers. We obtained information on their supplemental servicing activities and interviewed VA officials, including loan servicing representatives responsible for providing supplemental servicing. We also reviewed VA\u2019s quality-control procedures. To analyze VA\u2019s measures for assessing the effectiveness of its supplemental loan servicing program and ability to generate meaningful data for overseeing and improving its loan servicing performance, we reviewed VA\u2019s performance measures and VA data on loan status for the nine VA regional loan centers. Although we identified inconsistencies in data provided by VA, we did not assess the accuracy of the data. We also compared VA\u2019s performance measures to those employed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for its Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insured loan program. We conducted our work in Washington, D.C.; Cleveland, OH; St. Petersburg, FL; and Phoenix, AZ, between July 2000 and March 2001, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Written comments from the Secretary of Veterans Affairs on a draft of this report are presented in appendix VI. A detailed description of our scope and methodology is presented in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The VA loan program is an entitlement program for eligible veterans, service members, reservists, and surviving spouses. The program provides single-family, residential mortgage loan guarantees for purchasing, constructing, repairing, or refinancing homes. The loan guaranty provides private-sector mortgage lenders, such as banks, thrifts, or mortgage companies, with a partial guaranty on mortgage loans when these loans go into foreclosure. In exchange for the guaranty, VA encourages lenders to offer loans to veterans on terms more favorable than those available with conventional financing\u2014for instance, requiring a small down payment, or none at all.", "The VA loan guaranty program was initially established in 1944 as an adjustment benefit for veterans who had served in the Armed Forces during World War II. Its objectives have evolved over time. The main objective of the current program is to provide a long-range housing benefit to veterans that will help them finance the purchase of homes on favorable loan terms and retain ownership of their homes. Over the years, the VA loan guaranty program has been amended in an effort to increase home ownership among veterans. These amendments have extended eligibility to all parties on active duty or honorably discharged from military service, increased the maximum loan term and guaranty amount, and allowed borrowers and lenders to negotiate loan interest rates.", "The basic features of the VA loan guaranty program are set by law. Currently, the maximum amount of a guaranty or entitlement is $50,750. VA places no limits on the size of loans, but lenders generally limit the loan amount to $203,000, owing to secondary mortgage market requirements.In exchange for protection against financial losses when VA-guaranteed loans end in foreclosure, lenders are encouraged to provide eligible borrowers with loans that do not require a down payment. Lenders originating VA guaranteed mortgages are subject to VA\u2019s underwriting standards. The standards are meant to ensure that borrowers have the ability to pay and are creditworthy. The interest rate on VA-guaranteed loans can be negotiated based on prevailing mortgage rates. Borrowers also have obligations to VA. They must meet VA\u2019s eligibility requirements and pay VA funding fees of 1.25 to 2.75 percent of the loan amount, depending on the size of down payment and the type of military service completed. Veterans disabled while in service are exempt from payment of the funding fee. Appendix II provides more detailed background information on VA\u2019s loan guaranty program.", "In addition to helping borrowers finance the purchase of homes, the VA loan program helps them retain ownership of their homes by providing assistance to those in default through its supplemental servicing program. The supplemental servicing performed by VA\u2019s loan servicing representatives is a unique feature of VA\u2019s loan guaranty program. Other federally insured loan programs do not provide such servicing. For example, HUD delegates all servicing responsibilities to the lenders in its program for FHA insured loans. FHA lenders are required by law to engage in loss mitigation action to provide alternatives to foreclosure. See appendix III for a comparison of the VA and HUD servicing programs.", "The VA provides supplemental loan servicing through its nine regional loan centers in Atlanta, Cleveland, Denver, Houston, Manchester, Roanoke, Phoenix, St. Paul, and St. Petersburg. Prior to 1996, the VA\u2019s 45 regional offices administered loans, provided full-scale loan servicing, processed claims, and handled property management. However, according to VA officials, the agency decided to consolidate loan processing, servicing, and claims functions into the nine regional loan centers after a comprehensive review of its loan guaranty program. The consolidation, which began in 1997 and was completed in June 2000, was intended to improve services to veterans and reduce costs by increasing efficiency and economies of scale. The 45 regional offices provide services related to property appraisal and foreclosed properties, as well as services related to other veterans\u2019 programs.", "VA\u2019s loan servicing representatives conduct work using the LS&C computer system. The LS&C system was implemented throughout the regional loan centers during August and September 1999. The LS&C system is an on-line, production-oriented system, which was intended to help the loan servicing representatives to provide better supplemental servicing capabilities. The LS&C system also was intended to help VA reduce costs by allowing servicing personnel to service loans rather than spend time entering basic data and status updates into their old batch- oriented system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Performs Its Own Supplemental Servicing of Defaulted Loans", "paragraphs": ["While lenders have primary responsibility for servicing delinquent loans, VA performs its own supplemental servicing of defaulted loans to ensure that each veteran-borrower is afforded the maximum opportunity to continue as a home owner during periods of temporary financial distress.

VA\u2019s loan servicing representatives are to work with veterans and sometimes lenders to arrange or assist in arranging a number of possible alternatives to foreclosure. These alternatives include   encouraging lenders to extend reasonable forbearance,   encouraging lenders to modify the terms of the original loan agreement,   purchasing the defaulted loan from the lender and then reamortizing the loan to eliminate a delinquency,   encouraging the private sale of a property,   arranging a compromise claim payment to the lender if an offer to purchase the property is received but the proceeds will not be enough to pay off the loan, and   accepting a deed in lieu of foreclosure."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Lenders\u2019 Loan Servicing Responsibilities", "paragraphs": ["Private lenders that hold loans guaranteed by VA are responsible for servicing them.

VA requires lenders to take several steps to resolve the problem. First, a lender must provide written notice to borrowers requesting immediate payment if a loan installment has not been received within 17 days of the due date. This notice must be mailed within 3 days and must include the amount of any late charges due. Second, the lender must try to contact the borrower by telephone to determine why the borrower has not made the payment and to make arrangements for resolving the delinquency. Third, if the borrower has not made a payment within 30 days after the payment was due and cannot be contacted by telephone, VA requires the lender to send a personal letter to the borrower. Fourth, if the lender cannot work out arrangements for repayment by the time that three installments are due, the default is to be reported to VA. The lender must send a Notice of Default (NOD) to VA within 45 days of the third missed payment. This notice must explain why the loan has gone into default and provide a summary of the lender\u2019s servicing efforts. If the lender does not notify VA within 45 days of the borrower\u2019s third missed payment, VA may adjust any claim under the guaranty.", "Figure 1 provides an example of a time line showing a lender\u2019s servicing responsibilities for a delinquent loan. For example, if a borrower misses a payment on January 1, the lender must send a delinquency notice to the borrower by January 20. If the lender has not received a payment by March 1\u2014the third missed loan payment\u2014the lender must send an NOD to VA by April 15."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA\u2019s Supplemental Servicing Policies", "paragraphs": ["VA\u2019s policies require that its loan servicing representatives begin supplemental servicing immediately after receiving a NOD from the lender. VA loan servicing representatives are to closely review the lender\u2019s servicing of the account and follow up by contacting the borrower. Based on the information provided by the borrower, regarding present and future income, employment status, and other relevant case-specific facts, the VA loan servicing representatives may attempt to arrange or assist in arranging one of the following alternatives for borrowers:   Forbearance: VA\u2019s policy is to encourage lenders to extend reasonable forbearance when a borrower is unable to begin making payments immediately. VA loan servicing representatives may intercede with the lender on behalf of the veteran to work out a plan for forbearance and repayment that is acceptable to both parties. Payments are allowed to remain delinquent for a reasonable amount of time\u2014usually not more than 12 months. After that time, the borrower reinstates the loan either by making a lump-sum payment or by increasing monthly payments.", "Modification: In some cases, VA also encourages lenders to modify the terms of the original loan agreement\u2014e.g., by extending the loan period. Modifications can succeed when the borrower cannot maintain the original monthly payments or pay off delinquencies, but can keep the loan current on less stringent terms. VA loan servicing representatives may also intercede with the lender on behalf of the borrower to help arrange modification agreements.", "Refunding: When a lender is not willing to extend further forbearance or modify the terms of the loan, but the borrower has the ability\u2014or will have the ability in the near future\u2014to make payments, VA may refund the loan. In these cases, VA purchases the defaulted loan from the lender.", "When VA refunds a loan, the loan becomes a part of VA\u2019s direct portfolio and is serviced by VA\u2019s loan portfolio service contractor. VA may reamortize the loan to eliminate a delinquency and reduce the interest rate. The law giving VA this authority does not vest borrowers with any right to have their loans refunded or to apply for refunding. Nevertheless, VA\u2019s policy is to consider in every case before foreclosure whether refunding is in the best interests of the veteran and the government.", "Private sale of property: When a borrower has no realistic prospects for maintaining even reduced mortgage payments, VA encourages the private sale of property to avoid foreclosure. Counseling by VA loan service representatives about the benefits of a private sale may allow a borrower to salvage any equity in the home and reduce or eliminate losses to all interested parties. When the borrower has equity in the home, VA\u2019s policy is to encourage lenders to grant the borrower reasonable forbearance to permit a sale.", "Compromise claim: In some cases, a borrower in default may not be able to arrange a private sale because the value of the property is less than the total amount owed on the loan. This might be the case, for example, in areas with depressed housing markets. In such a situation, VA may consider providing a \u201ccompromise claim\u201d payment to the lender if an offer to purchase the property is received, but the proceeds will not be sufficient to pay off the loan. For example, if a veteran finds a buyer who will purchase the property for its fair market value and the proceeds of the sale are applied to the existing indebtedness, a compromise agreement would enable VA to pay a claim to the lender to cover the difference between the sale price and the amount remaining on the loan. VA is to consider this if the difference between the loan payoff amount and the purchase price is less than the amount of VA\u2019s maximum guaranty.", "Deed in lieu of foreclosure: When a borrower is unable to resolve a default, refunding is not appropriate, and a private sale cannot be arranged, VA may consider accepting a deed in lieu of foreclosure. VA will accept a deed if it is in the best interests of both the borrower and VA. Accepting a voluntary deed saves on foreclosure costs, cuts down on possible decreases in the value of the security, avoids having a foreclosure on the borrower\u2019s credit record, and reduces or eliminates the amount of the borrower\u2019s indebtedness. However, obtaining a deed must be legally feasible, and the borrower must be willing to cooperate. A deed in lieu will usually not be accepted if there are any junior liens on the property or if the claim amount under the deed in lieu is more than under foreclosure.", "Figure 2 provides a simplified example of the decisionmaking process VA loan servicing representatives use when considering alternatives to foreclosure.", "VA or the lender may implement any of the alternatives to foreclosure discussed above, except only VA may implement refunding. Additionally, VA must approve in advance lender initiated compromise claims and deeds in lieu of foreclosure, unless a lender participates in VA\u2019s Servicer Loss Mitigation Program (SLMP). Participation in SLMP allows lenders to not only initiate, but also perform most of the analyses involved in approving compromise claims or deeds in lieu of foreclosure. VA pays lenders a fee for processing such alternatives to foreclosure. The purpose of VA\u2019s SLMP program is to (1) reduce the cost of the loan guaranty program to the taxpayer by decreasing the length of time required to implement these alternatives, (2) reduce the workload of VA\u2019s regional offices by paying authorized servicers to perform the analysis and approval functions usually completed by VA, and (3) increase the number of these alternatives used by providing servicers with an incentive to consider a compromise sale or deed in lieu of foreclosure at earlier stages of default, when these alternatives are more often feasible. Lenders must apply to VA to obtain approval to participate in this program. VA officials told us that approximately 130 lending institutions are currently participating in VA\u2019s SLMP program and that these institutions process most of the compromise claims and deeds in lieu of foreclosure.", "If it is not feasible for VA or the lender to process any of the alternatives to foreclosure discussed above, the lender will generally proceed with foreclosure."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VA\u2019s Supplemental Servicing Practices Generally Conform to its Policies and Procedures", "paragraphs": ["The practices of the three regional loan centers we visited generally conform to VA policies and procedures.

The most common alternative VA\u2019s loan servicing representatives implement is what VA calls a successful intervention, which includes VA involvement in lenders granting either forbearance or modifying the delinquent loan. These successful interventions account for an average of 42 percent of all alternatives to foreclosure implemented by VA over the past 5 years. The next most frequent alternative implemented was the compromise claim, followed by refunding, and then deed in lieu of foreclosure. (See fig. 4.)

The Cleveland Regional Loan Center was the largest, with a total of 52 employees; and the Manchester center was the smallest, with 12 employees. Employees at the nine regional loan centers handled an average of 294 NODs each, during fiscal year 2000. The Atlanta Regional Loan Center had the highest number\u2014361 NODs per employee. The Cleveland center had the lowest number\u2014237 NODs per employee. Figure 5 shows the number of loan servicing employees and the number of NODs per employee in fiscal year 2000 at each regional loan center. It also shows the state jurisdictions serviced by each regional loan center, as well as the year of each center\u2019s consolidation.", "Both the number of employees and average number of NODs they handle have varied over the years, mostly because of the consolidation of the regional loan centers. In fiscal year 1996, before the consolidation of the regional loan centers, VA had a total of 430 employees performing loan service and claims functions. In fiscal 2000, after the consolidation was completed, that number fell to 351 \u2014 a decrease of approximately 18 percent from 1996. The average number of NODs per employee rose from 292 in fiscal year 1996 to 397 in fiscal year 1998. However, in fiscal year 2000, the number of NODs per employee dropped to 294, the level prior to consolidation in 1996. (See fig. 6.)", "As figure 6 indicates, consolidation ultimately reduced the number of employees handling loan servicing and claims; although the average number of NODs per employee remained about the same. However, the consolidation left some offices short staffed for a period of time, and this temporarily affected service. For example, officials at the St. Petersburg Regional Loan Center told us that it took their center nearly a year to catch up with the backlog of loan cases, some of which were transferred from other regional loan offices. VA\u2019s officials in St. Petersburg also told us that they expected their office to be permanently closed; and they completely stopped servicing loans for a period of time, as they prepared for the move. In addition, officials at the Phoenix Regional Loan Center told us that at one point during consolidation, two of its loan service representatives were responsible for servicing approximately 2,300 defaulted loans\u2014six times the workload that is considered reasonable because few employees of the closed offices were willing to relocate to Phoenix after the consolidation. However, we have since learned that the Phoenix Regional Loan Center, which was the last to complete its consolidation in July 2000, is now almost fully staffed and has achieved a reasonable number of NODs per employee. The Phoenix center, however, continues to have a large number of relatively new loan servicing representatives, and it will take time for them to be fully trained.", "While the consolidation helped to centralize the loan servicing function, each regional loan center we visited still had a high degree of administrative autonomy from the VA headquarters in Washington, D.C. As a result, administrative practices vary somewhat among centers. For example, the St. Petersburg center management told us that they follow a \u201ccase management\u201d approach to supplemental loan servicing. This center has teams that are responsible for all aspects of loan administration\u2014from servicing to processing foreclosures. Teams at the Phoenix center, however, are organized more along the lines of a functional structure where each team is responsible for a particular loan administration function. Additionally, teams in various regional loan centers may have different internal management structures. For example, managers in the St. Petersburg center told us that their five loan servicing teams operate autonomously. Each team has \u201cempowered\u201d loan servicing representatives that rotate within the team and serve as the team leader. These team leaders serve as a focal point for the team and review the work of other team members. They are also empowered to approve all alternatives to foreclosure without further supervisory approval. This was not the case, for example, at the Cleveland center. Additionally, the management of the St. Petersburg center told us that the teams, rather than individuals, are responsible for meeting internal performance goals. They said the teams have become competitive among themselves and that this has improved performance. VA headquarters managers told us that they plan to complete a comprehensive review of their loan servicing program in the near future that will include a review of such administrative practices at the regional loan centers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VA Does Not Have Meaningful Performance Measures Nor Useful and Timely Management Reports for Its Supplemental Servicing Program", "paragraphs": ["VA\u2019s ability to effectively manage its supplemental servicing program is hindered by a lack of meaningful performance measures and useful and timely management reports.

The shortcomings of this measure include its (1) insensitivity to the quality of loan servicing, (2) inability to account for regional differences in economic conditions, and (3) inability to reflect the ultimate disposition of a particular loan. In addition, VA does not have a meaningful performance measure to account for the costs associated with alternatives to foreclosure compared with foreclosure.", "Moreover, VA\u2019s computer system has not been able to generate useful and timely management reports that regional loan center managers and VA\u2019s headquarters staff can use in managing their supplemental servicing program. During our review, we also found that VA could not efficiently generate reliable aggregate data on its supplemental servicing program."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "VA Does Not Have Meaningful Performance Measures", "paragraphs": ["The FATS ratio is equal to the number of cases resolved through direct VA intervention, divided by this number plus foreclosures. The total number of cases resolved through direct VA intervention is the sum of all cases involving any of the alternatives to foreclosure.", "According to VA\u2019s fiscal year 2001 Performance Plan, VA has set a goal of raising the FATS ratio to 40 percent. This would mean that VA\u2019s interventions helped 40 percent of veterans facing foreclosure resolve their defaulted loans using one of VA\u2019s alternatives to foreclosure. In fiscal year 2000, the FATS ratio was 30 percent.", "Before fiscal year 1999, VA calculated the FATS ratio by a different method, weighting the various alternatives to account for the difficulty of implementing them and the benefits they offered. After a review of the FATS ratio in September of 1999, VA officials said they decided to drop the weighting system because it encouraged the use of alternatives that may not have been the best choice and distorted the number of actual interventions taken. To present comparable data over time, we calculated the unweighted FATS ratio\u2014the measure VA currently uses\u2014based on the aggregate data VA provided to us. Figure 7 shows the nationwide FATS ratio for fiscal years 1996 through 2000. Figure 8 shows the FATS ratio at each of VA\u2019s regional loan centers in fiscal year 2000.", "While the FATS ratio is intended to reflect the level of activity performed by VA on behalf of veterans, it presents a number of problems. First, it is not sufficiently sensitive to changes in servicing levels, and thus it has not varied much over time. It has not been possible, in some cases, to observe changes in the FATS ratio due to loan servicing difficulties associated with the regional office consolidation at the time the servicing was affected. For example, when the St. Petersburg Regional Loan Center stopped servicing loans, the impact on the FATS ratio appeared to be minimal. However, the ratio is actually lower for fiscal year 2000 than for the period that includes the consolidation. Representatives from the Phoenix center told us that they had similar problems during the regional office consolidation. (Appendix V provides specific information on the FATS ratio at each regional loan center over the past 5 years.) A VA headquarters official said that processing alternatives to foreclosures requires a long time; and such a time lag could allow VA to take credit for loan servicing provided much earlier, evening out the FATS ratio over time. Additionally, other factors that are unrelated to the actual performance of VA loan servicing representatives may also affect the FATS ratio. For example, when lenders participate in the SLMP program, VA loan servicing representatives must provide the lenders with a determination of insolubility; and, because of this involvement, these alternatives are still counted in the FATS ratio.", "Second, the FATS ratio does not account for regional differences in economic conditions, although regional economic conditions may affect the ability of loan servicing representatives to implement various alternatives to foreclosure. For example, according to VA regional loan center officials, recent economic conditions in southern California resulted in lower home prices, making it nearly impossible for loan servicing representatives to arrange compromise claims. This occurs because decreases in home prices increase the amount needed to pay a claim, and VA will not offer a compromise claim if the amount of the payout under the compromise claim is greater than the claim under a foreclosure. According to VA documents, during VA\u2019s September 1999 review of the FATS ratio, two regional loan center directors expressed concern about using the FATS ratio as a performance measure, primarily because they believed that economic factors could severely affect it. For instance, if there is a substantial increase in the number of foreclosures, the directors maintained that even a loan center with experienced, productive loan servicing representatives might not be able to significantly raise the number of alternatives to foreclosure counted in the FATS numerator. In this case, the FATS ratio would decline.", "VA officials said that when VA managers look at the FATS ratio for individual regional loan centers, local teams, or individual loan servicing representatives, they must take into account the local economic conditions, which impact that performance, as well as other factors such as staffing and training levels. We note, however, that VA does not have a systematic method to account for the impact of regional economic conditions or other such factors.", "Third, the FATS ratio does not take into account the ultimate disposition of a particular loan. It only accounts for individual servicing events, so a loan, which had a successful intervention at one point, could ultimately default. VA provided data on previous interventions on loans that eventually ended in foreclosure, and the percentage appeared to be small\u2014an average of 1.6 percent over the past 5 years. Nevertheless, if this number were to increase in the future for any reason, this consideration may be important when reviewing the performance of regional loan centers. In other words, the benefit to the veteran from the intervention depends on the duration over which the veteran remains in the home due to the intervention.", "In addition, the FATS ratio is intended to measure the benefits of VA\u2019s loan servicing program but omits another important component: cost reduction. In fact, VA officials told us that they have not tracked the costs associated with the various alternatives to foreclosure. To provide a very broad estimate of the cost-effectiveness of VA\u2019s supplemental servicing, VA officials told us that they multiply the average claim paid by the number of cases in which VA intervention prevents foreclosure. In the last few fiscal years, VA officials said they have made claim payments averaging around $19,000 and arranged some 6,000 successful interventions. They concluded, based on these rough calculations, that the government had saved more than $100 million by avoiding the payment of claims in these cases, even after personnel and overhead costs were factored in.", "VA officials said that their previous computer system did not have reports designed for tracking average claims paid on deeds in lieu of foreclosure, and the amount paid for compromise claims was not captured within the system. Officials said that the LS&C computer system tracks these amounts, but it is still undergoing development; and reports are still being developed.", "VA\u2019s FATS ratio reflects the level of activity performed by VA on behalf of veterans. However, VA does not have an effective way to measure the cost savings its supplemental servicing program generates. Other agencies, such as FHA, do have such a measure. FHA, for example, calculates a lender performance score based, in part, on the lender\u2019s success in holding down costs to FHA while reinstating or terminating defaulted mortgages. FHA effectively creates a benchmark by comparing the performance of each FHA lender with the performance of other lenders in the same jurisdiction. Although VA cannot use FHA\u2019s benchmark, because the unit of observation for VA is the regional loan center, VA could create benchmarks that account for variations in economic conditions; legal requirements, such as different state foreclosure laws; and other factors that vary among its nine regions.", "Once it is fully implemented, the LS&C system appears to provide the potential for VA to significantly improve its ability to assess the costs and benefits and improve the management of its supplemental servicing program. Over time, as VA\u2019s LS&C computer system obtained extensive data on defaulted loans, the system could be used to create measures for data items such as the average cost of the various alternatives to foreclosure. The system could also be used to create benchmarks. For example, VA could use its database to analyze how trends in alternatives to foreclosure and foreclosures over time and across regions are related to economic conditions in those regions. Economic conditions in a region at each point in time can be measured by variables such as an unemployment rate.
