Treasury emphasized that enactment of section 330 provided a welcomed congressional endorsement of long-standing U.S. policy to combat international financial crime by negotiating with foreign jurisdictions through multilateral organizations, such as FATF. Since its formation in 1995, FinCEN has helped foreign jurisdictions establish new FIUs and improve the capabilities of existing units. The number of FIUs has jumped from 14 in 1995 to 101 currently, partly because of training and technical support provided by FinCEN and Treasury's Office of Technical Assistance and funding provided by the Department of State. Given the growth in the number of FIUs, future efforts likely will involve giving more attention to improving the capabilities of existing units, especially in reference to combating terrorist financing--an operational task now included in the formal definition of an FIU. To maximize performance as a global partner, FinCEN is taking various actions, such as assigning an analyst to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Terrorist Financing Operations Section. Also, FinCEN is modernizing the Egmont Secure Web, which is used by FIUs worldwide to exchange sensitive case information. To enhance its responsiveness to FIUs that request case assistance, FinCEN is allocating additional staff to its Office of Global Support and also is developing a new case management system. However, in the most recent customer satisfaction survey, FinCEN invited less than one-half of FIUs to participate and received only two responses. Future surveys would need to be more inclusive and incorporate better survey development and administration practices, such as follow-up efforts to achieve higher response rates, if the surveys are to serve as a useful management information tool for monitoring and enhancing performance."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Money laundering and terrorist financing are transnational crimes that can  have devastating effects, involving severe economic consequences as well  as loss of lives.

At its formation in 1989 by the  United States and other industrialized nations, FATF\u2019s original focus was  to establish anti-money-laundering standards and monitor the progress of  nations in meeting the standards. In 1990, FATF issued its \u201cForty  Recommendations on Money Laundering\u201d to promote the adoption and  implementation of anti-money-laundering measures. For instance, the  recommendations encouraged nations to enact legislation criminalizing  money laundering and requiring financial institutions to report suspicious  transactions.

Specifically, in October 2001, FATF  adopted \u201cEight Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing.\u201d Among  other actions, these recommendations committed members to criminalize  the financing of terrorism and to freeze and confiscate terrorist assets.

These regional groups are to  help nations in the region to implement the international standards  developed by FATF. Also, these standards have been recognized and  endorsed by the World Bank and IMF for use in conducting evaluations  and assessments of nations\u2019 progress in implementing measures to counter  money laundering and terrorist financing.

Pretesting the survey  instrument is a way to help evaluate whether the potentially adverse  effects of these types of factors have been minimized. Further, during  survey administration, follow-up efforts with prospective respondents can  help to promote the highest possible response rate. Such follow-up efforts  can include e-mail messages, letters, or telephone calls.
