These programs are intended to enhance the capacity of state and local first responders to prevent, respond to, and recover from a terrorism incident. GAO was asked to evaluate the extent to which: (1) overlap and other factors among these programs could impact the risk of duplication; (2) mechanisms exist that enhance coordination and reduce the risk of duplication and how they are being implemented; and (3) DHS has implemented performance measures to evaluate the effectiveness of these programs. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed grant guidance and funding allocation methodologies. GAO also interviewed DHS officials, and grant administrators in five urban areas\u0097selected because they receive funding from all four grant programs in this review\u0097about grant processes and program challenges, among other things."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Multiple factors contribute to the risk of duplication among four FEMA grant programs that GAO studied\u0097the State Homeland Security Program (SHSP), Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASI), Port Security Grant Program, and Transit Security Grant Program. Specifically, these programs share similar goals, fund similar projects, and provide funds in the same geographic regions. Further, DHS\u0092s ability to track grant funding, specific funding recipients, and funding purposes varies among the programs, giving FEMA less visibility over some grant programs. Finally, DHS\u0092s award process for some programs bases decisions on high-level, rather than specific, project information. Although GAO\u0092s analysis identified no cases of duplication among a sample of grant projects, the above factors collectively put FEMA at risk of funding duplicative projects. FEMA officials stated that there is a trade-off between enhancing management visibility and reducing administrative burden, but also recogized that FEMA should use more specific project-level information for award decisions and have taken initial steps towards this goal. For example, FEMA is considering how to better use existing grant information and has also begun to phase in a grants management system that includes an explicit goal of collecting project-level information. However, FEMA has not determined all of its specific data requirements. As FEMA determines these requirements, it will be important to collect the level of information needed to compare projects across grant programs. Given the limitations in currently collected information, FEMA would benefit from collecting information with greater detail as this could help FEMA better position itself to assess applications and ensure that it is using its resources effectively.", "FEMA, as well as state and local stakeholders, have taken steps to improve coordination in administering the four programs, but FEMA could take further action. For example, FEMA does not internally coordinate application reviews across the four programs. Specifically, the programs are managed by two separate FEMA divisions which review grant applications for each program separately and there is no process in place to ensure that application information is shared among the programs during this process. Thus, it is difficult for FEMA to identify whether grant monies are being used for the same or similar purposes. FEMA could benefit from further examining its internal grant coordination process, while considering the large volume of grant applications it must process.", "FEMA introduced some performance measures for the UASI and SHSP programs in 2011 that add value, but these measures do not assess program effectiveness. FEMA has efforts under way to develop outcome measures\u0097that will focus on program effectiveness\u0097for each of the four grant programs in this review, but has not completed these efforts. Further, the FEMA project plan that guides these efforts does not provide information on what measures will be implemented for each grant program and when this will occur. A revised project plan that includes more specific schedule information and accurate implementation timelines could help guide these efforts. DHS also has several efforts under way to measure the collective effectiveness of its grant programs in achieving shared program goals, but these efforts are recent and ongoing. Thus, it is too soon to evaluate the extent to which these initiatives will provide FEMA with the information it needs to determine whether these grant programs are effectively improving the nation\u0092s security."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DHS: (1) collect project information with the level of detail needed to identify any unnecessary duplication; (2) explore opportunities for enhanced internal coordination in grant administration; and (3) revise its plan to ensure the timely implementation of performance measures to assess the effectiveness of these grants. DHS concurred with all recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["More than 10 years after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the  United States remains vulnerable to attack, as evidenced by the  attempted Christmas Day bombing of Flight 253 in 2009, the attempted  car bombing of Times Square in New York City in 2010, and the disrupted  plot to attack the subway system in Washington, D.C., in 2010, among  other examples. As noted by the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS), terrorist threats continue to evolve and can vary widely in their  origin and scope, ranging from a lone U.S. citizen detonating a pipe-bomb  to a sophisticated biological attack by an international group. In addition  to the vast expansion of federal homeland security measures over the last  decade, state, local, tribal, and private sector entities, as well as citizens  themselves, have assumed a greater role in protecting the nation from  terrorism. To assist states and localities in strengthening the security and  resilience of their communities against risks associated with potential  terrorist attacks, the federal government has undertaken a variety of  initiatives. For example, the government has expanded financial  assistance to a wide array of public and private stakeholders for terrorism  preparedness activities through various grant programs administered by  DHS through its component agency, the Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA). For certain grant programs that require a  particular subject-matter expertise, FEMA also coordinates with other  DHS entities, such as the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) or the  Transportation Security Administration (TSA), to administer the grant  program. Through these grant programs, DHS has sought to enhance the  capacity of states, localities, and other entities, such as ports or transit  agencies, to prevent, respond to, and recover from a terrorism incident.", "From fiscal years 2002 through 2011, the federal government  appropriated over $37 billion to a variety of DHS homeland security  preparedness grant programs. DHS distributed approximately $20.3  billion of this funding to grant recipients through four programs: the State  Homeland Security Program (SHSP), the Urban Areas Security Initiative  (UASI), the Port Security Grant Program (PSGP), and the Transit Security  Grant Program (TSGP). Although these four programs are administered  separately, they fund broadly similar activities, such as planning, training,  equipment, and exercises. We previously reported on FEMA\u2019s full suite of  17 fiscal year 2010 preparedness programs, including these four  programs, and noted that FEMA needed to improve oversight and  coordination of its grant awards to identify and address any unnecessary  overlap and duplication, among other things.", "For the purposes of this report and our analysis of the four grant  programs, we considered \u201cduplication\u201d to occur when two or more  agencies or programs were engaged in the same activities or provided  the same services to the same beneficiaries. We used the term \u201coverlap\u201d  when multiple agencies or programs had similar goals, engaged in similar  activities or strategies to achieve them, or targeted similar beneficiaries.  The presence of overlap can suggest the need to look closer at the  potential for unnecessary duplication. However, determining whether and  to what extent project funding is actually duplicative requires project-level  information, which we collected for a sample of grant projects as  discussed below.", "You requested that we evaluate these four grant programs, including the  administrative coordination and effectiveness of these programs. This  report addresses the extent to which:  1.  overlap, if any, among the four selected grant programs and other  factors impact the risk that duplication may occur within and across  the programs;  2.  federal, state, and local mechanisms exist that enhance coordination  and reduce the risk of unnecessary duplication, and how DHS and  other stakeholders are implementing these mechanisms; and  3.  DHS has implemented performance measures to evaluate the  effectiveness of these grant programs.", "To determine the extent to which overlap, if any, among the four selected  grant programs and other factors impact the risk that duplication may  occur within and across the programs, we analyzed FEMA grant guidance  and information for each program throughout the grants cycle, including  grant recipients, project types, and funding amounts. To determine the  eligible recipients, grant program purposes, and allowable projects, we  analyzed federal grant guidance. To establish the various methods that  DHS used to distribute grant funds, we analyzed the grant guidance and  applicable federal statutes. Then, to understand how these various  distribution methods affected coordination within and across the grant  programs, we interviewed FEMA\u2019s federal partners\u2014USCG and TSA\u2014 both of which play important roles in program management for PSGP and  TSGP, respectively. To determine the extent to which DHS components  were involved with the project selection process, we analyzed grant  guidance, applicable federal statutes and regulations, state and urban  area homeland security strategies, and other documents that describe  local project selection processes. We also spoke with federal, state, and  local officials and collected documentation on distribution methods during  site visits to five urban areas: Houston, Texas; Jersey City/Newark, New  Jersey; New York City, New York; San Francisco, California; and Seattle,  Washington. We used specific criteria to select these urban areas,  including their levels of grant funding for all four grant programs,  recommendations from stakeholders familiar with the programs such as  FEMA program officials and association groups, and their diversity of  terrorism and disaster threats. While the information we obtained from  these urban areas and corresponding states cannot be generalized, it  provided insights into projects initiated using grant funding across the  grant programs we reviewed.", "To assess the extent to which SHSP, UASI, PSGP, and TSGP funds  could have been allocated to unnecessarily duplicative projects, we  reviewed FEMA Investment Justifications (IJ), Biannual Strategy  Implementation Reports (BSIR), and other FEMA files, such as  spreadsheets related to PSGP and TSGP awards. We also reviewed a  DHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) report on DHS preparedness  grant funding that reported on each of the programs we reviewed. We  reviewed the methodology and findings of this work and determined the  findings to be sufficiently reliable to be included in this report. We also  analyzed every project submitted by the selected five urban areas for all  four programs for fiscal years 2008 through 2010, which totaled 1,957  projects. For our project analysis, we defined overlap as any projects that  appeared to have the same purpose, the same project type, or the same  entities receiving funds. Projects were defined as unnecessarily  duplicative if they overlapped and FEMA had no evidence of coordination  between the recipients or in certain cases, between different FEMA  divisions. We did not regard projects that used different funding streams  for different aspects of a single project to be duplicative. Using this  definition, we analyzed FEMA information on grant projects and  categorized overlapping projects that had the same or similar project type  and description and were within the same jurisdiction. We used BSIR  data categories as the foundation for our analysis. Port and transit  projects are not included in the BSIR, thus information for these two grant  programs was obtained from FEMA spreadsheets and recategorized  according to the BSIR for comparison. The accuracy of the categorization  of the projects was confirmed independently by two GAO analysts. For  the purposes of our report, we concluded that FEMA\u2019s project information  was sufficiently reliable for each of the programs we reviewed. For  projects identified as potentially duplicative, we obtained and analyzed  additional information from state officials, including coordination plans,  project ledgers, equipment inventory lists, planning and training rosters,  and expanded project descriptions, to evaluate the extent to which any  funded activities were actually duplicative. To determine if the information  maintained by FEMA allowed the agency to meet its goals, we compared  the results of our data analysis to Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government.", "To determine the extent to which mechanisms exist to enhance  coordination and prevent unnecessary duplication within and across the  four selected grant programs, we reviewed national planning documents,  such as the National Preparedness Guidelines, along with grant  guidance and federal statutes that establish linkages across grant  programs. In addition, we interviewed FEMA officials from the grants  divisions responsible for administering each of the programs, along with  USCG and TSA officials involved with administering PSGP and TSGP. To  assess state and local coordination of grant programs in each of the five  selected urban areas, we interviewed State Administrative Agency (SAA)  officials, various members of Urban Area Working Groups (UAWG),  PSGP fiduciary agents (FA), local USCG officials, and transit system  officials familiar with the TSGP. We also reviewed state, urban area, port,  and regional transit homeland security strategies for the selected areas,  along with other state or local guidelines related to the administration of  the grants programs, such as membership charters for the UAWGs. We  also reviewed FEMA guidance to states and urban areas on aligning their  homeland security strategies with national preparedness objectives. We  assessed coordination efforts against best practices described in our prior  reports.", "To determine the extent to which DHS has implemented performance  measures to evaluate the effectiveness of these four grant programs, we  analyzed DHS and FEMA documents from 2011 related to current  performance measures as well as performance measures under  development. This analysis included FEMA\u2019s Performance Measure  Implementation Plan, a document that provides FEMA\u2019s general  approach to performance measurement including effectiveness  measures, as well as a list of key milestones to implement new  performance measures and refine existing measures. We interviewed  grant officials from FEMA\u2019s Grant Programs Directorate (GPD) and  FEMA\u2019s National Preparedness Directorate (NPD) to determine what  grant performance measurement data FEMA had collected or planned to  collect in the future.

More specifically, each program funds similar projects such  as training, planning, equipment, and exercises. For example, the four  programs have overlapping lists of allowable costs, so certain types of  equipment, such as communication radios, may be purchased through  each grant program. Further, although the programs target different  constituencies, such as states and counties, urban areas, and port or  transit stakeholders, there is overlap across recipients.

This is due to differences in the grant programs\u2019 administrative processes.  For example, in some cases, FEMA relies on stakeholders to review and  recommend projects for grant funding\u2014adding layers to the review  process. Delegating administrative duties to stakeholders reduces  FEMA\u2019s administrative burden, but also contributes to FEMA having less  visibility over some grant applications, specifically those funded via SHSP  and UASI. A combination of federal statutes and DHS policy determine  specific grant allocation mechanisms and the federal partners involved in  grants administration. Figure 2 below describes the federal agencies  involved, the path of the grant funds to the final recipient, and the  application and award process for each grant, as of fiscal year 2011.", "As depicted in figure 2, grant funding follows a different path to final  recipients depending on the program\u2019s administrative process. For  example, grant awards made under SHSP and UASI go through three  steps before the money reaches the final grant recipient. First, DHS  awards SHSP and UASI funds through FEMA to a designated SAA\u2014 typically a state homeland security or emergency management office. The  SAA then passes funds to subrecipients, such as county or city  governments or designated urban areas. These subrecipients/local  governments may then further distribute SHSP and UASI funds to other  entities, including individual law enforcement agencies. It is these other  entities that will ultimately spend the grant funds to implement security  projects. Because state governments are required by the Implementing  Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (9/11  Commission Act) to have a role in the application process and distribution  of SHSP and UASI funding, and because of the thousands of individual  projects that comprise these programs, FEMA relies on the SAAs to  administer the awards to smaller entities.", "In delegating significant grants administration duties to the SAA for the  larger SHSP and UASI programs, FEMA officials recognized the trade-off  between decreased visibility over grant funding, subrecipients, and  specific project-level data in exchange for their reduced administrative  burden. For these two programs, the SAA, as the official grant recipient,  assumes responsibility for holding subrecipient entities accountable for  their use of funding, including ensuring that recipients use grant funds to  pay costs that are allowable (e.g., reasonable and necessary for proper  performance of the award). states\u2019 capacities to effectively administer and coordinate their grants vary  considerably.", "Among other requirements, grant funds may only be used for allowable costs.   Allowable costs are those that, among other things, are reasonable and necessary for  proper and efficient performance and administration of federal awards, and a cost is  reasonable if, in its nature and amount, it does not exceed that which would be incurred by  a prudent person under the circumstances prevailing at the time the decision was made to  incur the cost.  See 2 C.F.R. pt. 225. In this report, potential \u201coverlap\u201d and \u201cduplication\u201d  generally refer to two or more SHSP, UASI, PSGP, or TSGP projects that address the  same preparedness need and could be redundant or unnecessary if not coordinated.", "In contrast, FEMA receives far fewer applications for TSGP and PSGP  funds and awards grant funding more directly to the final grant recipients,  with one and two steps, respectively, rather than three steps. As a result,  FEMA has a greater ability to track grant funding, specific funding  recipients, and funding purposes for these two smaller grant programs.  Beginning in fiscal year 2009, appropriations acts required FEMA to  award TSGP funds directly to transit authorities instead of through  SAAs. Per FEMA policy, the agency distributes PSGP funds to local  FAs who then distribute grants to local entities within the port area, but  FEMA is directly involved in this process. Due to the legal and  departmental policies that establish a more direct award process for  PSGP and TSGP, along with the smaller scope of those programs, FEMA  has more information and is better able to track these grants through to  the end user of the grant monies.", "Differences in administrative processes among each of the four grant  programs also impact the extent to which federal, state and local entities  share responsibility for prioritizing and selecting the individual  preparedness projects that will ultimately receive funding. Due to its  greater involvement with the PSGP and TSGP project selection at the  local level, DHS generally has more information on specific PSGP and  TSGP projects than SHSP and UASI projects. For example, DHS  components\u2014USCG and TSA\u2014are involved with the PSGP and TSGP  selection process, which provides DHS with additional information over  the use of grant funds. For instance, TSGP projects from fiscal years   The  2007 through 2010 were selected by regional working groups. regional groups based their project selection on Regional Transit Security  Strategies that each transit region had developed. For this grant program  TSA had better information about the funding as well as influence over  the project selection because TSA set the parameters for and approved  the transit security strategies, and final project selection was based on  TSA approval.", "The regional working groups choose projects for the highest risk Tier 1 regions. The  remaining transit regions\u2019\u2014Tier 2 regions\u2014projects are fully competitive.", "Similarly, the USCG, and in particular the Captain of the Port, exerts  influence over the PSGP project selection process, given the agency\u2019s  maritime security expertise and role in the PSGP award process. PSGP  project applications also undergo a second national review facilitated by  FEMA that includes the USCG, the Department of Transportation\u2019s  Maritime Administration, and other stakeholders. Along with federal  stakeholders, numerous local stakeholders are involved with the PSGP  selection process and in many locations are required to base their grant  award decisions largely on FEMA-required port security mitigation  strategies. These strategies also require FEMA approval before PSGP  grants can be awarded to port areas. Thus, for these projects, FEMA is  more involved and has greater information on which to base award  decisions.", "In contrast, local officials select SHSP and UASI projects with less federal  involvement, although the projects must comport with various program  rules, such as those related to allowable activities or costs, and address  any funding priorities stipulated in the grant guidance. For SHSP, FEMA  awards funds to states for certain broad purposes, such as interoperable  communications, but federal law and DHS policies allow states to  distribute these funds to individual projects or jurisdictions using different  mechanisms, given different local conditions and needs. One state may  choose to use a consensus-based approach to disburse the funds to  counties, for example, while another may distribute funding equally to all  of its jurisdictions. For example, in Washington State, SHSP grant  applications are reviewed by four distinct entities\u2013\u2013the state\u2019s homeland  security committee, the all-hazards statewide emergency council, the  state\u2019s domestic security executive group, and the governor\u2019s office\u2013\u2013 prior to the state making risk-informed allocation decisions. In contrast,  one regional government council in Texas allocated SHSP funds equally  to all eligible jurisdictions within its region regardless of their risk level.", "For UASI grants, FEMA requires each region to create its own UAWG,  but does not participate in these groups. The UAWGs convene to select  individual projects for UASI funding based on the FEMA-identified grant  priorities for that grant year that are also consistent with the area\u2019s grant  application and state and urban area strategic plans. For example, in  2009 the New York City UAWG identified protecting critical infrastructure  and key resources as one of eight goals in its homeland security strategic  plan, received UASI funding for this purpose, and selected and allocated  funds to specific projects in the urban area related to this goal.

In our prior work  on overlap and duplication, we identified challenges agencies face in  collecting and analyzing the information needed to determine whether  unnecessary duplication is occurring. For example, we identified 44  federal employment and training programs that overlap with at least 1  other program in that they provide at least one similar service to a similar  population. However, our review of 3 of the largest 44 programs showed  that the extent to which individuals actually receive the same services  from these programs is unknown due to program data limitations. We  found similar data limitations in this review as FEMA bases its awards for  SHSP, UASI, PSGP, and TSGP in part upon IJs which contain limited  information. For the SHSP and UASI programs, states and eligible urban  areas submit IJs for each program with up to 15 distinct investment  descriptions that contain general proposals to address capability gaps in  wide-ranging areas such as interoperability communications or critical  infrastructure protection. Each IJ may encompass multiple specific  projects to different jurisdictions or entities, but project-level information,  such as a detailed list of subrecipients or equipment costs, is not required  by FEMA. According to FEMA, data system limitations, the high volume of  individual SHSP and UASI projects, and the desire to give states and  urban areas increased flexibility to add or modify specific projects after  the award period contributed to less detailed IJs.", "In contrast, FEMA makes PSGP and TSGP award decisions based on  federal reviews of IJs that contain information about specific projects,  providing FEMA officials with more detailed knowledge of what is being  requested and what is being funded by these programs. Furthermore,  before awards are made, FEMA directs PSGP and TSGP applicants to  submit detailed budget summaries, but does not call for such information  from SHSP and UASI applicants. The 9/11 Commission Act establishes  minimum application requirements for SHSP and UASI, such as a  description of how funds will be allocated, but the act does not call for  specific project data. For example, with SHSP, the statute requires states to include in their grant applications the purpose for the grant  funds, a description of how they plan to allocate funds to local  governments and Indian tribes, and a budget showing how they intend to  expend the funds. FEMA officials stated that the SHSP and UASI IJ  format meet these statutory requirements, albeit at \u201ca high summary  level.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA Is Considering Additional Action and Taking Steps to Enhance Grant Information, but Further Efforts Are Needed to Avoid the Risk of Duplication", "paragraphs": ["To improve the level of information that FEMA has available for making  grant award decisions, FEMA is considering collecting more detailed  information on proposed grant projects. In May 2011, a FEMA report  based on the work of a Reporting Requirements Working Group  recommended collecting additional project information at the application  stage. Specifically, the FEMA report recommended that the agency  modify the IJ format for SHSP and UASI applications to include a detailed  project list. This project list would contain information that is currently  collected through the BSIR later in the grant cycle after FEMA makes  grant awards.collecting additional information at the application stage could be initiated  in the fiscal year 2013 grant cycle, according to FEMA. Although  collecting this additional information may be useful to FEMA, we  determined that the level of information contained in the BSIR alone  would not provide sufficient project information to identify and prevent  potentially unnecessary duplication within or across grant programs.", "If this recommendation is implemented, the policy of  To make this determination, we reviewed the type of information that  FEMA would have available at the application stage if it implemented the  report recommendation. Specifically, we reviewed IJ and BSIR  information for the 1,957 grant projects awarded through the four grant  programs to five urban areas\u2013\u2013Houston, Jersey City/Newark, New York  City, San Francisco, and Seattle\u2013\u2013for fiscal years 2008 through 2010.  Our analysis determined that 140 of the projects, or 9.2 percent of the  overall funding associated with these projects\u2013\u2013about $183 million\u2013\u2013 lacked sufficient detail to determine whether these projects were  unnecessarily duplicative or had involved coordination during the state\u2019s  planning or selection processes to prevent any unnecessary duplication.  Table 3 further illustrates the challenge that FEMA would face in  identifying potential duplication using the BSIR data for SHSP and UASI  as recommended by the report. For example, table 3 contains SHSP,  UASI, and PSGP project information from a single jurisdiction in one of  the five urban areas we reviewed and shows the level of detail that FEMA  would have available to compare projects. The overlap in the descriptions  of the project types and titles suggest that duplication could be occurring  among three of the four grant programs, and warranted further analysis.", "After identifying the projects that appeared to be potentially duplicative,  we contacted the SAA and FA for this state, and officials provided us with  extended narratives, coordination details, and subrecipient lists. It was not  until we reviewed this additional, more detailed information that we could  ascertain that these four projects were not duplicative, but rather were  part of a larger, coordinated public safety interoperability and video  initiative taking place in the region.", "Table 4 below contains a second example of project data associated with  BSIR and IJ information from a single jurisdiction in one of the five urban  areas we reviewed. Again, we identified the potential for duplication  because of the similarities in funded projects for both the SHSP and  TSGP. Both of the projects identified below are related to the purchase of  chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear detection equipment  (CBRNE). However, upon examining additional state-provided information  and the TSGP IJ, we had sufficient information to determine that these  projects were distinct and involved separate equipment. However, as with  the previous example in table 3, FEMA would not be able to make these  determinations using only BSIR data.", "Based on our analysis using BSIR and IJ project data, we were able to  ascertain that over 90 percent of the projects we reviewed had sufficient  detail to determine that the projects (1) were substantively different and  not likely duplicative, or (2) involved coordination to prevent any  unnecessary duplication. Furthermore, our subsequent analysis using  additional information from state and local grant recipients indicated that  none of these projects were duplicative. Nonetheless, we believe that  more detailed project information could be of value to FEMA in its grant  review process since, as demonstrated above, the information currently  being considered does not always allow for the necessary differentiation  between projects funded by the four grant programs. Moreover, FEMA\u2013\u2013 through its own internal analysis\u2013\u2013and the OIG have both separately  concluded in recent years that FEMA should use more specific project- level data in making grant award decisions, especially for SHSP and  UASI, in order to identify and mitigate potential duplication. Specifically, in  a March 2010 report, the OIG noted that the level of detail in IJs and in  other grant program applications was not sufficient for FEMA to identify  duplication and redundancy. In its written comments to the OIG, the  DHS Office of Infrastructure Protection concurred with this assessment,  noting that a SHSP IJ \u201cwas little more than a checklist of previous funding  with a brief strategy narrative.\u201d Further, Standards for Internal Control in  the Federal Government state that program managers need operational  and financial data to determine whether they are meeting their goals for  accountability for effective and efficient use of resources.", "FEMA has acknowledged the agency\u2019s difficulties in effectively using  grants data and is taking steps to improve its data collection and  utilization through resolving staffing shortages by filling key grants  management personnel vacancies, and taking steps to implement a new  data management system. As part of this effort, FEMA introduced a new  non disaster grant management system (ND Grants) for the fiscal year  2011 grant cycle, and the system is scheduled for completion by fiscal  year 2014. Agency officials stated that this system, once completed, will  help FEMA to manage all of its preparedness grants, and has an explicit  goal of enhancing project-level data collection. In addition, the ND Grants  system is anticipated to consolidate data from multiple systems and  facilitate greater utilization and sharing of information. according to FEMA documentation, FEMA has not yet determined all of  its specific data needs for ND Grants.

The Director of GPD\u2019s Preparedness Grants  Division reported in September 2011 that the report recommendations  were still under consideration and thus FEMA had not yet determined the  specifics of future data requirements. Thus, the agency\u2019s goal to improve  data collection by collecting project-level information through its ND  Grants system is a worthwhile action. This effort could provide the level of  detail that FEMA needs to identify possible unnecessary duplication  within and across all four grant programs.

The Director of GPD\u2019s  Preparedness Grants Division discussed multiple projects that FEMA had  initiated to potentially improve coordination in the grants management  area. He told us that at the federal level, there is an effort within FEMA to  increase planning and training exercises in order to increase its ability to  track what projects are being funding by which grants. He added that this  FEMA-led initiative is currently assessing public information on grants to  reduce the risk of duplication. FEMA has a variety of reporting tools and  guidelines that FEMA personnel have recently been working with to  improve coordination and linkages between programs.

State steps to improve coordination  range from tracking equipment purchases to enhancing administrative  tools. For example, in Texas, jurisdictions must register all deployable  equipment purchased through a homeland security grant and costing  more than $5,000 on a statewide registry known as the Texas Regional  Response Network. The purpose of the network is to raise awareness  about the assets that neighboring jurisdictions might have available for  use by another jurisdiction during an emergency. According to a Texas  official familiar with the initiative, the registry was established with the  recognition that sharing deployable equipment would be cost effective  since it would be difficult for every jurisdiction to maintain every piece of  equipment that might be needed in an emergency. In New Jersey, the  SAA\u2019s office developed a Grants Tracking System, a web-enabled  application to capture and track each subgrantee\u2019s state-approved  Homeland Security Grant Program\u2013funded projects which includes SHSP  and UASI. The Grant Tracking System is the state\u2019s primary oversight  mechanism to monitor the progress of each county, city, and state agency  toward completing or procuring their budgeted projects or equipment. The  system permits the SAA to review every program that receives funding,  which allows for increased coordination across grants and efficiencies in  procurement and helps alleviate the risk of funding duplicative grants.

Additionally, officials from three locations we visited  also noted having tried to set up more formal coordination structures. For  example, the UAWG in one Texas locality set up a peer-to-peer network  with other UASI regions around the state to exchange information. A  county official from a UAWG in Washington State reported that they have  set up monthly small group meetings with officials from surrounding  counties who deal with SHSP and UASI in an effort to exchange  information and improve coordination.", "While FEMA, states, and local government have taken steps to improve  coordination, our review of FEMA\u2019s internal coordination showed that the  agency lacks a process to coordinate reviews across the four grant  programs. GPD has divided the administration of the grant programs into  two separate branches: UASI and SHSP are administered by the  Homeland Security Grant Program branch while PSGP and TSGP are  administered by the Transportation Infrastructure Security branch. The  result of this structure is that grant applications are reviewed separately  by program but are not compared across each other to determine where  possible unnecessary duplication may occur. As we noted earlier, each  grant program we reviewed has similar goals, allowable costs, and  geographic proximity. Due to this structure, these four programs share  applicants as state and local entities seek to maximize grant dollars for  their projects. However, since the review process for grant applications  falls within each separate branch and grant program\u2013\u2013and since there is  no process in place to ensure that grant information is exchanged in the  review process\u2014FEMA cannot identify whether grant monies are being  used for any unnecessary duplicative purposes.

Because the four grant programs are being reviewed by  two separate divisions, yet have similar allowable costs, coordinating the  review of grant projects internally could allow FEMA to have more  complete information about grant applications across the four different  programs. This is necessary to identify overlap and mitigate the risk of  duplication across grant applications. One of FEMA\u2019s section chiefs noted  that the primary reasons for the current lack of coordination across  programs are the sheer volume of grant applications that need to be  reviewed and FEMA\u2019s lack of resources to coordinate the grant review  process.

Further, senior FEMA officials have noted challenges to measuring preparedness. For example, they have noted  that SHSP and UASI fund a wide range of different preparedness  activities, which makes it difficult to devise applicable measures. Thus, if  measures are too broad they are meaningless and if too narrow they may  not adequately capture the effectiveness of a range of activities. Senior  FEMA officials noted another challenge in that grant program goals are  purposefully broad to accommodate a broad constituency. For example,  SHSP is administered in all states.

We recognize  that even when programs overlap, they may have meaningful differences  in their eligibility criteria or objectives, or they may provide similar types of  services in different ways. However, because the four DHS programs in  our review have similar goals, fund similar types of projects, and are  awarded in many of the same urban areas, it will be important for FEMA  to take additional measures to help ensure that the risk of duplication is  mitigated. FEMA has delegated significant administrative duties to the  SAA for the larger SHSP and UASI programs, and FEMA officials  recognize the trade-off between decreased visibility over these grants and  the reduced administrative burden on FEMA. However, the limited  project-level information on how funds are being used and the lack of  coordinated reviews of grant applications across programs, increases the  risk that FEMA could fund duplicative projects. Additional action could  help mitigate this risk. For example, as FEMA develops the ND Grants  system, it will be important for the agency to ensure that information  collected for all grant programs provides enough detail to allow for project  comparisons in order to identify any unnecessary duplication. In addition,  while some steps have been taken at the federal, state, and local levels to  improve coordination in administering the four grant programs, additional  actions could also help reduce the risk of duplication. For example,  without a process to coordinate reviews across the four grant programs,  FEMA lacks the information necessary to identify whether grant monies  are being used for duplicative purposes, especially since all four grant  programs are being reviewed separately, yet have similar allowable costs.

Because the project plan FEMA has in place to  guide its efforts to develop measures does not provide adequate  information to determine what measures will be implemented for each  grant program and when this implementation will occur, FEMA does not  have reasonable assurance that these measures will be implemented in a  timely way to help assess the programs\u2019 effectiveness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making three recommendations for the four grant programs.
