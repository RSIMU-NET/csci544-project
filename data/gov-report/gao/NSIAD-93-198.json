The Management College expects software costs to continue to rise at a rate proportionately higher than computer hardware costs. According to the DOD Inspector General, the costs of computer hardware components integral to weapon systems and other critical military and intelligence systems, are expected to remain stable at about $6 billion annually between 1990 and 1995, whereas corresponding software costs are expected to grow from about $30 billion to $42 billion.(See fig. 1.1.)", "DOD estimates that about 30 percent of its software life-cycle expenditures are for initial development and 70 percent are for post-deployment software support, that is, maintaining, upgrading, and modifying existing software to correct deficiencies, respond to mission changes, or enhance technology.

For example, in August 1992, the Navy tasked a Test and Evaluation Process Action Team to develop recommendations to improve the Navy\u2019s test and evaluation process throughout all phases of the acquisition process and readiness of systems for OT&E.", "On the basis of a 4-month review that included an analysis of Army and Air Force software management initiatives and policy guidance, the team concluded that the Navy needed to implement stronger fleet support for test and evaluation in Navy acquisition a formal working group to coordinate and resolve Navy test planning a clearer, more timely requirements definition and management process; a rigorous OT&E certification review process.", "The team further concluded that certification and testing of software releases and of mission-critical systems needed additional study. With respect to metrics, the team concluded that a common set of metrics was needed as a tool to measure software maturity but that metrics alone should not be the determining factor in the certification of systems as ready for OT&E.", "In addition, the team concluded that the Navy should issue revised policy guidance on the procedures necessary for effective test and evaluation of software-intensive systems, conduct rigorous operational test readiness reviews before systems are certified as ready for operational test, develop and recommend a common set of at least eight metrics to be used by decisionmakers as indicators of software maturity, develop additional metrics that can be used by program managers to measure the progress of development efforts, determine the appropriate level of testing for major and minor releases of develop and recommend methods to streamline the process for testing software releases.", "The report concluded that the test and evaluation initiatives and recommendations would work if implemented by instructions, formal policy, and clear command guidance and accompanied with command involvement. Although it is far too soon to tell if these recommendations will be effective for Navy acquisition programs, they appear to be consistent with those made by the DOD Software Test and Evaluation Project report in 1983.", "By contrast, the Navy Fleet Combat Direction Systems Support Activity, with the assistance of the Software Engineering Institute, has already developed an improvement program that mirrors the best practices in the private sector and may assist government software development activities in improving their processes. Begun in January 1992, the program was intended to improve the Activity\u2019s software development and support processes. As a result, the Activity began using 13 software management metrics to make fact-based decisions about systems\u2019 performance during software development. Activity officials said that the indicators provided a clear and concise reporting structure; improved planning and data collection for future projections; provided a degree of standardization among projects, contractors, and in-house personnel; fostered closer adherence to military standards; greatly improved communication and problem and process definition; acted as a reliable early-warning system if plans were not met; and highlighted small problems early so that they could be resolved before they grew.", "The Activity\u2019s software development process, in our view, is structured and measurable and includes relatively open, periodic reporting to management, which is a good foundation for decision-making."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["Test and evaluation of software and software-intensive defense systems remains among the most difficult, most expensive, and least understood processes in the defense acquisition cycle. Although key software test and evaluation study recommendations have provided a starting point for DOD to address and resolve the software crisis, only limited progress has been made in improving the ability of software-intensive systems to meet users\u2019 requirements.", "Some OSD officials believe that the lack of a single OSD-level office for software has been the primary reason long-standing software problems have not been resolved. Other officials have concluded that OSD needs to take a more direct role in ensuring that software-intensive systems are ready for OT&E before this critical process begins.", "In our view, consistent adoption across DOD of the recommendations in this report could greatly enhance the OT&E of software and better enable DOD to accomplish its objectives of developing software-intensive systems on schedule, within cost, and in accordance with required performance capabilities. DOD must go beyond simply reworking the prior studies on software test and evaluation. Moreover, promulgating more policy guidance without ensuring that the guidance is implemented is not the solution.", "Overall, DOD has not (1) developed an overarching strategy that ensures development and implementation of key software test and evaluation policy throughout DOD; (2) issued definitive acquisition and life-cycle support policies that focus on software test and evaluation; and (3) adopted a focused, disciplined approach to software development and test and evaluation that recognizes the critical nature of software.", "To achieve the potential of its mission-critical software and to accomplish its software improvement objectives, DOD must overcome the prevailing acquisition culture\u2019s failure to react to the problems of modern defense systems; that is, DOD must understand that software is a critical path through which systems achieve performance objectives. Because this message has often been ignored, systems have proceeded into production when software had not yet achieved the appropriate level of maturity to yield valid test results. Because of the acquisition community\u2019s bias toward hardware, DOD has not adequately ensured that software was fully mature and had undergone thorough and rigorous DT&E before systems were certified as ready for OT&E.", "DOD does not currently have a high-quality decision-making data base to ensure that decisions concerning mission-critical software are made based on reliable, credible data. Further, DOD does not have reasonable assurance that unnecessary duplication and redundancy in software development are being avoided. DOD has not adequately (1) coordinated its efforts to develop and use software metrics for defense acquisition programs; (2) made maximum use of contractors\u2019 software development processes that have been favorably assessed by credible, independent evaluation; (3) developed team-building efforts to ensure the early and continuous involvement of users with acquisition, post-deployment support and testing personnel; and (4) filled in the policy and oversight voids that have contributed to the shortfalls that we have addressed.", "OSD has recently established a Software Test and Evaluation Task Force to work toward common policies. Further, some senior defense officials and software development and support personnel at the services\u2019 working levels are working independently to resolve some of the pressing software issues. Overall, however, the agency has not adequately responded to the magnitude of the problem.", "We are encouraged by the progress the services have made in developing policy guidance to improve the OT&E of its software-intensive systems and of its software requirements. We are particularly encouraged by the Army\u2019s implementation of requirements, management, and quality software metrics, as well as a centralized metrics data base. Accordingly, we believe these Army initiatives should be watched closely by OSD, since these efforts may show potential for application throughout DOD.", "We are similarly encouraged by senior defense acquisition and technology officials\u2019 recognition of the critical need to improve management of the requirements process for software-intensive systems.

However, we believe that the issuance of revised policy guidance without incentives to change behavior or ensure effective implementation could have little effect in ensuring software maturity.", "DOD pointed out that many of the reasons for immature software during OT&E were outside the control of the test and evaluation community. We agree with DOD\u2019s comment and specifically address this fact in the report.", "DOD indicated that programs reviewed as part of our analysis preceded DOD\u2019s most recent acquisition guidance and that the potential benefits of such guidance were therefore not sufficiently acknowledged in the report. DOD indicated that current updates of its acquisition policy series provided improved guidance and stronger program oversight for development strategies, testing, and requirements. However, this policy has some voids and, more importantly, it remains to be seen whether and to what degree the policy updates will be implemented and whether they will address the long-standing problems.", "DOD also indicated that the benefits of software metrics for OT&E were not supported. We did not attempt to quantify the direct benefits of software metrics for OT&E.
