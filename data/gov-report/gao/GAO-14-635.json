This report examines (1) the policies and guidance that State has established to administer and oversee grants, and (2) the extent to which the implementation of those policies and guidance provides reasonable assurance that funds are being used as intended. GAO analyzed State's policies and guidance, and interviewed cognizant grants officials at 14 bureaus headquartered in Washington, D.C., and three overseas missions (Afghanistan, Cambodia, and Turkey).

State's policies also delineate specific internal control activities that grants officials are required to both implement and document in the grant files as a way of promoting accountability (see fig.).", "GAO found that inconsistent implementation of policies and guidance weakens State's assurance that grant funds are used as intended.", "Inadequate risk analysis . In most of the files GAO reviewed, grants officials did not fully identify, assess, and mitigate risks, as required. For example, officials conducted a risk identification process for 45 of the 61 grants that GAO reviewed. While grants officials identified risk in 28 of those 45 grants, they mitigated risks in only 11.", "Poor documentation . Grants officials generally did not adhere to State policies and procedures relating to documenting internal control activities. For example, 32 of the 61 files reviewed did not contain the required monitoring plan. Considerable turnover among grants officials makes documenting internal control activities particularly important.

To further determine how State implements these policies,  we selected three case study countries\u2014Afghanistan, Cambodia, and  Turkey\u2014based on criteria that included total dollar value of grants in a  country, geographic diversity, and balance among the bureaus involved in  managing the awards. For these countries we examined a  nongeneralizable sample of 48 grants and cooperative agreements by  award size and bureau that had obligations in fiscal year 2012. In  addition, we used the same criteria to draw another nongeneralizable  sample of 13 grants managed in Washington, D.C. Overall, the 61 grants  we reviewed ranged in value from just over $25,000 to $28,000,000, and  totaled approximately $172 million. Collectively, the grants in our  samples were managed by 3 posts and 14 of the 27 grant-making  bureaus and offices in State, and included grants by 6 of the top 10  bureaus and posts in terms of total dollar amount obligated for federal  financial assistance in fiscal year 2012. We developed a data collection  instrument that we used to conduct file reviews for the 61 grants. Our file  review assessed grants officials\u2019 implementation of a selection of State\u2019s  required internal control activities for grants management, including risk  assessment, monitoring of recipients, and documentation of key activities.  We also conducted interviews with cognizant grants officials for each of  the grants to learn how they implemented grants management policies.

Twenty-seven  bureaus and offices within State, including the U.S. Mission to the United  Nations, have grant-making authority or grant oversight responsibilities.  Posts, including embassies and consulates overseas, may also make  grants. Ten bureaus and posts accounted for the majority of federal  assistance obligations that State made in fiscal year 2012 (see table 1).  For those GOs located in Washington, D.C., the GOR is usually located in  the principal place of performance, which may be at State headquarters in  Washington, D.C.\u2014for cultural exchange programs, for example\u2014or  overseas. Eighteen of the 27 bureaus with grant-making authority have  their own GOs. Those that do not have GOs or whose GOs do not have a  high enough grant-making authority rely on the Office of Acquisitions  Management to fulfill the GO role. This office provides a full range of  grant management services, including planning, negotiations, cost and  price analysis, and administration. In those instances, the bureau  requesting the grant then generally provides the GOR, program officer, or  both to supply program-specific expertise. As of May 2014, there were  571 GOs worldwide, with 503 of them based overseas. Most GOs at  posts are Foreign Service Officers with multiple other duties. In addition,  Foreign Service Officers usually rotate to another post within 1-3 years,  per State\u2019s normal operating procedures.

In the preaward phase, grants  officials develop the program idea, evaluate proposals, and select a  recipient. The GO then negotiates the costs of the grant with the recipient  and drafts the award document during the award phase.

State\u2019s policy on risk management  further elaborates that risk assessment should begin in the preaward  phase and continue throughout the grant life cycle. Furthermore, it states  that a risk management plan must include identification, assessment, and  monitoring and mitigation of risk. In most of the files we reviewed,  however, we did not find evidence that grants officials had fulfilled these  requirements, as described below.", "Risk identification: State\u2019s policies require grants officials to carry out  a comprehensive review of potential recipients to identify risks. Risk  factors could include a lack of stable financial infrastructure or  experience in managing a U.S. government grant, past performance  problems, an unusual or difficult environment, responsibility for a large  amount of funds, and concern the organization might be involved in  terrorist activities. Of the 61 grant files we reviewed, 45 showed that  grants officials had at least partially undertaken a risk identification  process. However, 33 of these were missing key elements of a risk  identification process, such as a review of the recipient\u2019s financial  systems and internal controls.", "Risk assessment: State policy requires grants officials to exercise a  greater level of oversight for high-risk versus low-risk grants; however,  we found in our file reviews that grants officials often did not assess  identified risks to determine the grants\u2019 risk level. Of the 45 grants that  underwent a risk identification process, 28 had risks identified.  However, only 15 of those 28 grants that identified risks also included  at least a partial assessment of risks, such as a preaward checklist at  one post that included some questions about prior federal grant  management experience and other past performance issues. In  addition, while State has established a variety of guidance on risk  assessment, the wording of the guidance is not consistent in certain  aspects, such as assessment of external risk factors. For example,  while one of the grants policy directives lists Transparency  International\u2019s Corruption Perception Index as a risk assessment  resource, none of A/OPE\u2019s sample risk assessment templates  mention the index or corruption in general. In another example, we  found that a grant to support civil society had received a \u201clow-risk\u201d  determination, based on calculations from a risk assessment  checklist, although grants officials remarked in the notes section of the  checklist that corruption was rampant in that country. Since corruption  was not an element of the checklist itself, it did not factor into the  overall risk-level determination\u2014nor was it reflected anywhere else in  the grant file documentation.", "Risk mitigation: State policies require grants officials to document how  they will mitigate, or address, identified risks, including by preparing  and implementing a monitoring plan. Of the 15 grants that showed  both identification and assessment of risks, 11 showed at least partial  mitigation of those risks (see fig. 2). Of the remaining 4 grants that  showed no risk mitigation, 1 included an audit report identifying  significant financial management risks, such as noncompliance with  allowable costs, on the part of the grant recipient. The grants  officials, however, did not reflect these risks in a risk mitigation or  monitoring plan. In two other grant files we reviewed, grants officials  identified allegations of prior financial mismanagement, but awarded  the grant without addressing how the risk would be mitigated.  Furthermore, State\u2019s various risk-related guidance does not clearly  emphasize the importance of linking risk assessment to monitoring.  Federal standards state that risk analysis generally includes deciding  how to manage the risk and what actions should be taken. Of the five  sample monitoring templates that A/OPE has developed, however,  three do not mention risk. Grants officials who use these templates,  therefore, may not make the link between monitoring and risk. For  example, of the 13 grants from two bureaus in our sample that had  developed their own risk assessment checklists based on A/OPE\u2019s  templates, we found that 7 did not reflect risks identified in a  monitoring plan. Moreover, of the 23 grants in our sample overall that  had assessed risks and had a monitoring plan, only 10 reflected the  risks in the plan.", "Without identifying and assessing risks, it may be difficult for State to  determine whether there are any observable impediments to the  recipient\u2019s effective management of State funds that would need to be  mitigated.

Federal standards call for the clear, prompt, and accurate  documentation of internal control and all other significant events,  including risk assessments and monitoring activities, and state that this  documentation should be readily available for examination. State  guidance directs grants officials to document key internal control activities  throughout the life cycle of a grant, including the use of funds, the  recipient\u2019s progress, and the grants officials\u2019 assessment of that progress  (see fig. 3). To support officials as they implement this guidance, State  has created multiple systems for organizing, retaining, and sharing  information about grants, whether the files are in electronic or hard copy  form. Documenting grant management activities is particularly important  because of grants officials\u2019 considerable turnover rate, which can leave  newly assigned grants officials dependent on files to determine what  control activities are required and which have been conducted.", "However, the grant files we reviewed did not consistently document key  grant activities as required, to demonstrate that internal controls had been  implemented. In many of the files we reviewed, required documents were  missing from the official file or incomplete, as described below.", "Internal control checklist: State requires each grant file to contain a  checklist, which grants officials are supposed to use to document the  completion of many internal control activities throughout the grant\u2019s  life cycle. These activities include vetting recipients, identifying the  amount of funds and project duration, identifying key contacts at State  and the recipient organization, and tracking receipt of information from  the recipient about progress made and costs incurred. State\u2019s training  further emphasizes the importance of keeping all sections of this  checklist current to assist managers in monitoring grants and ensure  that they fulfill the U.S. government\u2019s obligation to grant recipients.  However, 17 out of the 61 files we reviewed did not contain this  checklist, and only about 11 percent (5 out of 44) of the forms that did  exist were completely filled out.", "Grant award justification: State requires grant files to contain a  justification for awarding any grants without a full and open  competition. However, for the 24 grants in our sample that were  sole-sourced, 7 did not contain this justification.", "Monitoring plans: State policies require grants officials to prepare a  monitoring plan to measure the recipient\u2019s progress toward achieving  the grant\u2019s goals and objectives and ensure that the recipient  complies with the grant agreement. The grants officials must use the  plan to indicate the type and frequency of monitoring they will conduct  given the risks involved and the resources available for these  activities. However, about half of the files we reviewed (32 of the 61)  did not contain a monitoring plan. Furthermore, some of the 29 plans  that were documented did not address key aspects of monitoring the  terms and conditions of the grant agreement, such as risk analysis  and evaluation. For example, 3 of the 29 documented plans we  reviewed did not describe how the GO planned to monitor progress  toward the grant\u2019s specific goals and objectives.", "Monitoring activities conducted: While most of the files contained  evidence of some monitoring activities, such as e-mail communication  with recipients, this monitoring did not completely adhere to State\u2019s  guidance. Of the 29 documented monitoring plans, the evidence  showed that grants officials had fully executed 8 of them and partially  executed an additional 10. For example, some of the partially  executed plans indicated that the grants officials were to conduct site  visits and review recipient reports, but the grant files showed that the  grants officials had closed the grants without documenting any  evidence of these planned monitoring activities. Regardless of  whether grants had monitoring plans, we found that only 16 of the 61  files contained evidence that the grants officials had completed the  required review of all the recipient\u2019s financial and programmatic  reports to monitor for key information\u2014including verifying timely  progress toward the goals, as well as identifying and addressing any  delays or inappropriate expenditures. Another 24 of the 61 files  contained evidence that grants officials had done partial reviews of  these reports. These reviews, as well as reviews of the final recipient  reports, are required to close an award, but we found four awards that  GOs had closed without evidence that they had reviewed the  recipient\u2019s final reports. On more than one occasion, State had  difficulty providing required internal control documentation to us, either  because a grants official was on leave or had moved on to another  post. For example, we identified incomplete documentation in some  award files at one post, including missing final financial and  programmatic reports. Three months after our site visit, the GO still  could not produce the documents, because the grants management  specialist whose computer\u2019s hard drive contained the documents was  on extended leave. Two other GOs we interviewed said the files they  inherited did not contain required documents, such as the approval  forms from bureau headquarters for awards exceeding $25,000.", "Without documentation such as the internal control checklist, the grant  award justification, monitoring plans, and monitoring reports, State cannot  provide adequate oversight to ensure grant funds are being used as  intended. Without the required checklist, for example, managers cannot  readily ensure that the required documentation supporting the  management of each grant is present and complete. State also cannot  determine whether the GO\u2019s decision not to award a grant through open  competition was justifiable according to State\u2019s guidance unless the GO  documents that decision.

State policies, however, do not preclude well- known organizations from risk analysis. Moreover, we found an example  where the GO assumed the grant was low-risk without doing a full risk  analysis, even though it was the first time that State had awarded a grant  to the recipient. The grant files contained evidence that as the grant  progressed, the recipient had a variety of performance issues, including  trying to use the grant funds for activities other than what was intended.  The amount of time and resources dedicated to an appropriate risk  analysis may vary for lower dollar value grants, well-known recipients, or  other factors; nonetheless, according to an A/OPE official, a risk analysis  is still required in these circumstances. State, however, does not have a  process in place for ensuring that grants officials conduct a risk analysis.", "According to State officials and the files we reviewed, multiple  responsibilities and large portfolios limited the oversight they conducted to  ensure that required documentation was in place. Grants officials  reported having high numbers of grants to manage and multiple  responsibilities beyond managing grants. At bureaus with GOs based in  Washington, D.C., workloads tended to be higher, according to an A/OPE  official. This official reported that the average number of grant  transactions undertaken by these domestic GOs in fiscal year 2013 was  46, and two Washington, D.C.-based GOs we interviewed reported  having portfolios of 110 and 200 active grants, respectively. At two posts  we visited, the GOs were responsible for managing portfolios of about 56  to 66 grants in fiscal year 2012, in addition to their primary responsibilities  as public affairs officers for the embassies. Both GOs reported relying on  GORs and others to complete the award documentation. They reported  conducting occasional spot checks of the files compiled by the GORs. At  both posts, however, we found that each grant file in our sample  managed by these GOs was missing required internal control documents.  Furthermore, we brought oversight issues to the attention of the GOs of  which they had previously been unaware, such as unexpended funds  from a closed-out grant.", "Some grants officials told us that State\u2019s systems for documenting key  management activities are not easy to use. A/OPE officials told us they  are working to improve the main electronic management systems used by  grants officials (the Grants Database Management System and the State  Assistance Management System), but the accuracy of some information  will still depend on the person inputting it, and State does not have a  process for ensuring that all of the required documentation is included.  Three grants officials we interviewed reported that interns and grant  assistants update the paper and electronic files and that the grants  officials do not check their work. In addition, some grants officials told us  that while official files might be missing required documentation, the  information was stored elsewhere and could be retrieved upon request.

Some grants officials told us that they kept  information about recipient performance on their computer\u2019s hard drive, a  fact that may limit other grants officials\u2019 access to this information.  Furthermore, the official files did not indicate where this information could  be found."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Has Assessed Implementation of Internal Controls at Bureaus and Posts, but Has Not Followed Up on Most Recommendations for Improvement", "paragraphs": ["State has assessed the implementation of internal controls at several  bureaus and posts and has recommended improvements; however, it has  not followed up to ensure the implementation of its recommendations.  According to the federal standards, successful monitoring should include  policies and procedures for regularly assessing the effectiveness of the  internal controls in place and for ensuring that the findings of audits and  other reviews are promptly resolved. In 2008, A/OPE issued a policy to  systematically review grants management at posts and bureaus. The   policy stated that the number and extent of the reviews conducted each  year would be dependent on A/OPE\u2019s available resources. monitoring should assess the quality  of performance over time and ensure  that any issues are promptly  resolved.", "A/OPE has assessed compliance with grant management policies at  some bureaus in Washington, D.C., and overseas posts and found some  deficiencies in grants officials\u2019 implementation of those policies. In 2008,  State created a Grants Management Review (GMR) program with  guidelines and a checklist for reviews. The bureaus and posts are to be  selected for review based on weaknesses identified by the Inspector  General, dollar amount and volume of grants processed, informal risk  assessments, public visibility of the grants, and bureau or post requests  to be reviewed. In addition to the GMRs and other reviews of grant- making bureaus headquartered in Washington, D.C., A/OPE has  conducted less formal reviews at grant-making posts overseas,  combining file reviews with training. These reviews\u2014called Grants  Review Evaluation and Assistance Trainings (GREAT)\u2014are initiated in  response to requests for training or when A/OPE becomes aware of  challenges faced at certain posts, including considerable turnover.  According to officials, A/OPE tries to select posts for review if they are  located at or near destinations where A/OPE staff have other reasons to  travel, so as to conserve resources. A/OPE officials said their method for  conducting GREATs was similar to that used for GMRs, but less in-depth.  As a result, unlike the formal GMRs\u2014which State officials said can take 2  to 3 months to conduct\u2014these informal GREATs take 2 to 3 days and  result in shorter reports. Between 2001 and February 2014, A/OPE  completed 13 GMRs and other reviews at 12 bureaus and offices  headquartered in Washington, D.C., and 42 GREATs at 37 posts around  the world.", "These assessments of grants officials\u2019 implementation of grants  management policy at bureaus and posts have found insufficient  documentation, among other deficiencies, and recommended solutions.  Specifically, 52 of the 55 reviews found insufficient documentation in  grant files, affecting 47 bureaus and posts. Ten of the bureaus and posts  where A/OPE had conducted GMRs, GREATs, and other reviews were  included in our review samples. At all 10 bureaus and posts, State found  challenges with documentation similar to those we identified. For  example, in 5 of the 10 bureaus and posts, A/OPE found that grants  officials did not consistently document monitoring reports or site visit  reports, and in one case the post had no monitoring plans in its award  files. A/OPE found insufficient documentation in the other 4 bureaus as  well, such as incomplete internal control checklists or inadequate  documentation of sole source justification. One bureau in Washington,  D.C., kept its monitoring reports on an electronic shared drive, but the  award files did not indicate where to find the reports. A/OPE has made  many recommendations to bureaus and posts aimed at correcting the  deficiencies it identified. These recommendations have included the  establishment of standard operating procedures and more effective use of  electronic systems for documentation, among others.", "However, State has not systematically followed up to ensure the  implementation of these recommendations. State\u2019s system for tracking  compliance with its grants management policies has yielded  recommendations for improvement at 48 of the 49 bureaus and posts it  has reviewed, but State has conducted follow-up with only 6 of those 48  bureaus and posts to ensure that these recommendations were  implemented. State\u2019s policy for GMRs outlines how State will select and  conduct a review, but does not provide a procedure for ensuring that  corrective action has been taken and no further management action is  needed. However, A/OPE officials report that they have limited staff, with  currently only one individual leading both the GMR and GREAT reviews.  In addition, they report having a limited travel budget for conducting  follow-up reviews. A senior A/OPE official said it is necessary to be  vigilant about regularly sending messages regarding important grant- related tasks, particularly when there is considerable turnover among  personnel at posts. Because State does not track or report on the  implementation of recommendations, State cannot determine whether its  grants management reviews and training are achieving their purpose of  strengthening the management and oversight of assistance agreements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Given the relatively large amount of funding for grants and the  widespread use of these instruments to achieve foreign policy goals, it is  important for State to ensure that grant funds are used as intended. State  has made progress toward establishing the internal controls it needs to  gain this assurance. For example, State has outlined its expectations for  grants management in detailed policies and guidance that should be clear  for all grants officials. In particular, the requirements to conduct a risk  analysis and document the implementation of required control activities  conform to the federal standards for internal control. However, we found  that most of the grant files we reviewed did not contain evidence of an  appropriate risk analysis or were missing other required internal control  documentation, and State has not developed processes for ensuring that  grants officials implement these requirements. Therefore, State\u2019s  assurance that grant funds are used as intended is weakened.  Recommendations made in State\u2019s internal reviews of grant-making  practices reinforce expectations concerning documentation. However,  State management does not systematically follow up to ensure that  grants officials throughout the department consistently implement these  required control activities or act upon recommendations made. As a  result, State cannot be certain that its oversight of grants management is  adequate or that it is using its limited oversight resources effectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that State\u2019s grants officials fully implement grants  management policies and internal controls that are in place, and that  grant funds are used as intended, we recommend that the Secretary of  State take the following two actions:  Develop processes to help ensure that bureaus and missions conduct appropriate risk assessments, and grants officials complete required documentation for all grants. Such a  process could include systematic inspections of grant files, with the  results shared among A/OPE, the appropriate bureaus and missions,  and the grants officials themselves, so as to promote accountability.", "In addition, we recommend that the Secretary of State take the following  action:  follow up systematically on recommendations from State\u2019s internal  reviews of its grants management."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to State for its review and comment.

To describe the  internal control standards applicable to State grants management, we  reviewed the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  (the federal standards).", "To describe the policies and guidance that State has established to  administer and oversee grants, we reviewed federal regulations, Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) circulars, and State\u2019s GPDs, as well as  training and other resources the department provides its grants officials.  We collected and analyzed all 54 active GPDs issued by State\u2019s Office of  the Procurement Executive (A/OPE). We reviewed State Department  training regarding State\u2019s incorporation of federal regulations into its  grants policies and interviewed A/OPE officials regarding this topic. We  interviewed officials from A/OPE and the Office of the Deputy Chief  Financial Officer, who set department-wide policies on grant performance  and financial management, and bureau and post officials regarding any  additional policies and guidance they provide that is specific to the  programs they manage. To describe the extent to which State\u2019s GPDs  establish internal controls throughout the phases of a grant\u2019s life cycle, we  compared the key activities the grants officials must conduct at each  phase, as well as the additional training and guidance A/OPE provides to  grants officials, with the federal standards and with federal regulations for  grants management.", "To assess the extent to which State\u2019s policies and guidance provide  reasonable assurance that funds are being used as intended, we  assessed State\u2019s policies and guidance for grants management against  the implementation of those policies, as well as reviewing State\u2019s own  process for conducting internal assessments of the implementation of  those policies. We interviewed State officials from A/OPE, the Office of  the Deputy Chief Financial Officer, and various functional and regional  bureaus and offices headquartered in Washington, D.C., and three  overseas missions to determine how State both designs and implements  department-wide internal control policies on grants performance and  financial management.", "To further determine how State implements these policies, we selected  three case study countries \u2014Afghanistan, Cambodia, and Turkey\u2014  based on criteria that included total dollar value of grants in a country,  geographic diversity, and balance among the bureaus involved in  managing the awards. For these countries we examined a  nongeneralizable sample of 48 grants by award size and bureau that had  obligations in fiscal year 2012. In addition, we used the same criteria to  draw another nongeneralizable sample of 13 grants managed in the  United States, Washington, D.C. Overall, the 61 grants we reviewed  ranged in value from just over $25,000 to $28,000,000, and totaled  approximately $172 million. To arrive at these 61 grants, we included all  grants over $25,000 with obligations in fiscal year 2012 in Cambodia and  Turkey, which had 15 and 21 such grants respectively, and selected 20  such grants managed in the other two countries, for a total of 76 files. We  excluded grants where multiple places of performance were listed and  selected only those grants where our four countries were listed as the  only place of performance. However, once we began conducting  interviews regarding these grants, we discovered that some of the grants  had been mislabeled in State\u2019s Grants Database Management System.  Specifically, 2 were managed in countries other than the ones listed in the  database; another grant was listed in the database as being managed in  Cambodia alone, but was in fact managed from Washington, D.C., and  implemented worldwide; and a fourth grant was a duplicate of a grant  already in our sample. Correcting for these errors and adjustments, our  sample was reduced to 72 grants. Three bureaus each managed 10 or  more of these, accounting for 39 of the 72 grants. We determined that we  had obtained sufficient coverage of grants from the three bureaus in  question by reviewing 28 of their 39 grants. This determination further  reduced our overall sample size from 72 to 61 grants. The final sample of  61 grants we conducted file reviews for included 19 in Afghanistan, 10 in  Cambodia, 19 in Turkey, and 13 in the United States.", "Collectively, the grants in our samples were managed by 3 posts and 14  bureaus of the 27 grant-making bureaus and offices in State. Our sample  included grants by 6 of the top 10 bureaus and posts in terms of State\u2019s  total federal financial assistance obligations in fiscal year 2012. Our  sample was nongeneralizable and did not allow us to determine whether  there were any statistically significant differences by factors such as  bureau or award size. In this report, we presented the overall results of  the data on internal control activities for all 61 grants that we selected for  data collection instrument review. During our analysis, we also looked for  any overall patterns or differences by bureau and award size in terms of  dollar value, but did not note any. We identified examples of concerns  about controls that we reported on, such as incomplete documentation  and absence of a risk assessment, in awards with high and low dollar  values across the bureaus in our sample. To examine how grants  officials implemented grants management policies, we conducted file  reviews for 61 grants using a data collection instrument and interviews  regarding those 61 grants using a standard set of questions. We  developed the data collection instrument to assess grants officials\u2019  implementation of a selection of State\u2019s required internal control activities  for grants management, including risk assessment, monitoring of  recipients, and documentation of key activities. To identify these required  internal control activities, we analyzed federal regulations and State  policies and guidance related to management of grants across their life  cycle and compared them against the federal standards. The data  collection instrument asked a series of questions about critical elements  of these internal control activities. During our reviews, we examined the  files that State provided for each grant to determine whether they  contained sufficient evidence to indicate whether the control activities had  been performed. Our file review guidance indicated that while State policy  requires the complete official file to be located in at least one place,  analysts completing the reviews were directed to contact grants officials  responsible for the files to request missing information where possible.  Comments sections in the data collection instrument allowed the  reviewers to document these requests and other notes they had about  each question in the file. Two analysts reviewed each file, with the second  analyst verifying the first analyst\u2019s review. The focus of our analysis was  the degree to which the grants officials had performed the required  control activities for the grants in our sample. As noted above, we also  considered whether there were any patterns or differences by award size  in dollars or by bureau, but did not find any. In addition, the interview  questions asked grants officials to identify training and guidance they  found helpful, as well as any challenges they encountered as they  implemented these policies. We pretested both the data collection  instrument and interview questions in Kabul, and tested revised versions  in Washington, D.C. Our file review and interview questions covered each  phase of the grant life cycle, from preaward to closeout. We then  compared the file review results for control activities against responses  collected using the standard interview questions to provide a more  complete picture of how the grants officials implemented the policies and  identify reasons these officials cited for instances of noncompliance, as  well as any State policies and guidance they found helpful.", "We conducted interviews using the standard set of questions with at least  one grants officer (GO) for each of the 61 grants in our sample, ultimately  interviewing more than 50 GOs and grants officer representatives (GOR),  as well as some program officers. To identify any internal control  deficiency patterns or trends, we analyzed and compared the data we  collected from our file reviews and interviews and also compared them to  the findings from State\u2019s internal inspections of grant-making operations.", "To describe State\u2019s assessment of grants officials\u2019 implementation of its  internal controls, we reviewed State\u2019s guidance for conducting these  reviews, interviewed A/OPE officials regarding the review process, and  reviewed 55 assessment reports A/OPE issued between 2001 and  February 2014. These 55 included the assessment reports A/OPE  conducted in 12 grant-making bureaus, including 10 Grants Management  Reviews and 3 other reviews, and reports from the 42 Grants Review  Evaluation and Assistance Trainings A/OPE conducted at 37 posts  around the world. Of the 55 assessment reports, 10 covered 10 of the 17  bureaus and posts included in our review. We analyzed those 10 reports  to identify any findings related to the federal standards.
