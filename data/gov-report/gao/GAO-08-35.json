Recognizing that fusion centers are a mechanism for information sharing, the federal government--including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Program Manager for the Information Sharing Environment (PM-ISE), which has primary responsibility for governmentwide information sharing and is located in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence--is taking steps to partner with fusion centers. In response to Congressional request, GAO examined (1) the status and characteristics of fusion centers and (2) to what extent federal efforts help alleviate challenges the centers identified. GAO reviewed center-related documents and conducted interviews with officials from DHS, DOJ, and the PM-ISE, and conducted semistructured interviews with 58 state and local fusion centers. The results are not generalizable to the universe of fusion centers. Data are not available on the total number of local fusion centers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Most states and many local governments have established fusion centers to address gaps in information sharing. Fusion centers across the country vary in their stages of development--from operational to early in the planning stages. Officials in 43 of the centers GAO contacted described their centers as operational, and 34 of these centers had opened since January 2004. Law enforcement entities, such as state police or state bureaus of investigation, are the lead or managing agencies in the majority of the operational centers GAO contacted; however, the centers varied in their staff sizes and partnerships with other agencies. Nearly all of the operational fusion centers GAO contacted had federal personnel assigned to them. For example, DHS has assigned personnel to 17, and the FBI has assigned personnel to about three quarters of the operational centers GAO contacted. DHS and DOJ have several efforts under way that begin to address challenges fusion center officials identified. DHS and DOJ have provided many fusion centers access to their information systems, but fusion center officials cited challenges accessing and managing multiple information systems. Both DHS and the FBI have provided security clearances for state and local personnel and set timeliness goals. However, officials cited challenges obtaining and using security clearances. Officials in 43 of the 58 fusion centers contacted reported facing challenges related to obtaining personnel, and officials in 54 fusion centers reported challenges with funding, some of which affected these centers' sustainability. The officials said that these issues made it difficult to plan for the future and created concerns about the fusion centers' ability to sustain their capability for the long-term. To support fusion centers, both DHS and the FBI have assigned personnel to the centers. To help address funding issues, DHS has made several changes to address restrictions on the use of federal grants funds. These individual agency efforts help address some of the challenges with personnel and funding. However, the federal government has not clearly articulated the long-term role it expects to play in sustaining fusion centers. It is critical for center management to know whether to expect continued federal resources, such as personnel and grant funding, since the federal government, through the information sharing environment, expects to rely on a nationwide network of centers to facilitate information sharing with state and local governments. Finally, DHS, DOJ, and the PM-ISE have taken steps to develop guidance and provide technical assistance to fusion centers, for instance, by issuing guidelines for establishing and operating centers. However, officials at 31 of the 58 centers said they had challenges training their personnel, and officials at 11 centers expressed a need for the federal government to establish standards for training fusion center analysts to help ensure that analysts have similar skills. DHS and DOJ have initiated a technical assistance program for fusion centers. They have also developed a set of baseline capabilities, but the document was still in draft as of September and had not been issued."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["A breakdown in information sharing was a major factor contributing to the  failure to prevent the attacks of September 11, 2001, according to the  National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (the  9/11 Commission). Since then, most states and some local governments  have, largely on their own initiative, established fusion centers to address  gaps in homeland security, terrorism, and law enforcement information  sharing by the federal government and to provide a conduit of this  information within the state. Indeed, developing a fusion center was a high  priority of state homeland security directors, according to a 2006 National  Governors Association survey. Although fusion centers vary because they  were primarily established to meet state and local needs, a fusion center is  generally \u201ca collaborative effort of two or more agencies that provide  resources, expertise, and information to the center with the goal of  maximizing their ability to detect, prevent, investigate, and respond to  criminal and terrorist activity.\u201d Fusion centers may include a range of  federal, state, and local entities and collect and analyze information  related to homeland security, terrorism, and law enforcement.", "With information-sharing weaknesses recognized as a major contributing  factor to the nation\u2019s lack of preparedness for the 9/11 attacks, a number  of information-sharing initiatives were mandated by the Homeland  Security Act of 2002 and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention  Act of 2004 (Intelligence Reform Act). The Homeland Security Act, for  example, requires that the President prescribe and implement procedures  under which federal agencies can share relevant and appropriate  homeland security information with other federal agencies and with  appropriate state and local personnel, such as law enforcement agencies  and first responders. The President assigned most responsibilities for  executing this requirement to the Secretary of the Department of  Homeland Security in July 2003. The Intelligence Reform Act, as amended  in August 2007 by the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11  Commission Act of 2007 (9/11 Commission  Act), mandates a more  extensive information-sharing regime that requires the President to take  action to facilitate the sharing of terrorism and homeland security  information by establishing an Information Sharing Environment (ISE)  that is to combine policies, procedures, and technologies that link people,  systems, and information among all appropriate federal, state, local, and  tribal entities and the private sector. This act also requires, among other  things, that the President appoint a program manager to oversee  development and implementation of the ISE, which the President did in  April 2005.", "Recognizing that state and local fusion centers represent a critical source  of local information about potential threats and a mechanism for providing  terrorism-related information and intelligence from federal sources, the  Program Manager for the ISE (PM-ISE), the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS), and the Department of Justice (DOJ) are taking steps to  partner with and leverage fusion centers as part of the overall information  sharing environment. The PM-ISE issued an implementation plan in  November 2006 that incorporated presidentially approved  recommendations for federal, state, local, and private sector information  sharing and largely relied on efforts under way by DHS and DOJ with  respect to fusion centers. Recognizing that the collaboration between  fusion centers and with the federal government marks a tremendous  increase in the nation\u2019s overall analytic capacity that can be used to  combat terrorism, the plan envisions that the federal government will  work to leverage and promote fusion center initiatives to facilitate  effective nationwide terrorism-related information sharing, with fusion  centers becoming the focal point of this sharing. Under the plan, DHS and  DOJ are to work with states to designate a primary fusion center to serve  as the statewide or regional hub to interface with the federal government  and through which to coordinate the gathering, processing, analyzing, and  disseminating of terrorism-related information. DHS and DOJ are to  assume the responsibility for technical assistance and training to support  the establishment and operation of the fusion centers. Finally, according  to PM-ISE officials, the plan envisions that in order to receive grant  funding, each designated fusion center must develop a coordinated  approach with any other fusion centers in the state and will eventually  achieve a baseline level of capability and ensure compliance with all  applicable privacy laws and standards. Both DHS and DOJ have  established program offices to oversee their relationships with fusion  centers.", "In addition, the 9/11 Commission Act contains several provisions related to  fusion centers. For example, the act requires the Secretary of DHS, in  consultation with the Attorney General, the PM-ISE, and others to  establish a state, local, and regional fusion center initiative within DHS to  establish partnerships with state, local, and regional fusion centers that  will, among other things, provide operational and intelligence advice and  assistance, as well as management assistance, and facilitate close  communication and coordination between fusion centers and DHS. In  addition, the initiative is to provide training to fusion centers and  encourage the centers to participate in terrorism-threat-related exercises  conducted by DHS.", "In response to your request to describe state and local fusion centers and  federal efforts underway to support them, this report answers the  following two questions:    What are the stages of development and characteristics of state and  local fusion centers?", "To what extent do efforts under way by the PM-ISE, DHS, and DOJ  help to address some of the challenges identified by fusion centers?", "To answer these questions, we reviewed relevant directives, plans, and  documents and interviewed officials\u2014including many of those from the  PM-ISE, DHS, and DOJ\u2014who are involved with those entities\u2019 efforts to  support fusion centers. In addition, we spoke with officials from  11 organizations conducting research on state and local information  sharing, including officials at the Congressional Research Service (CRS)  who released a report in July 2007 on fusion centers. We also conducted  semistructured telephone interviews with the director (or his or her  designee) of every state fusion center, the District of Columbia fusion  center, and eight local fusion centers to obtain information about the  centers\u2019 characteristics, challenges encountered, and support received  from DHS and DOJ. Our selection criteria for the local fusion centers  included their relationships with the state fusion center, stage of  development, and geographic diversity. Where a fusion center was in the  planning stages, we spoke with officials involved in the planning and  establishment of the center, such as directors of homeland security  offices. From February through May 2007, we spoke with officials from all  50 states, the District of Columbia, and 8 local jurisdictions. While we did  contact officials in all state fusion centers, we did not contact officials in  all local fusion centers; therefore our results are not generalizable to the  universe of fusion centers. Data were not available to determine the total  number of local fusion centers.", "To describe the challenges fusion centers encountered in establishing and  operating, we asked officials during our semistructured telephone  interviews whether they encountered challenges in 10 different categories  and, if so, the extent to which the category was a challenge both at  establishment and, for operational centers, in day-to-day operations. These  categories included federal partnerships, personnel, guidance, training,  funding, access to information, and security clearances. Fusion center  officials provided open-ended, descriptive responses of challenges faced  by their centers. On the basis of a content analysis of fusion center  officials\u2019 responses, we identified, categorized, and counted similar  challenges. Fusion center officials may not have indicated that they  encountered all the challenges discussed in the report. In addition,  individual fusion center officials may have identified multiple challenges in  a given category, for example funding.", "We also obtained and summarized descriptive information from the fusion  centers including structure, organization, personnel, and information  technology systems used. Finally, to obtain detailed information about  centers\u2019 operations and challenges encountered, we conducted site visits  to fusion centers in Atlanta, Georgia; Phoenix, Arizona; Richmond,  Virginia; Baltimore, Maryland; West Trenton, New Jersey; and New York,  New York. Our selection criteria for these centers included their stage of  development, extent of federal partnerships, and geographic  representation.

Specifically with respect to  fusion centers, DHS envisions creating partnerships with state and local  centers to improve information flow between DHS and the centers and to  improve their effectiveness as a whole. As such, the Office of Intelligence  and Analysis (I&A) was designated in June 2006 by the Secretary as the  executive agent to manage a program to accomplish DHS\u2019s state and local  fusion center mission. The Assistant Secretary for Intelligence and  Analysis approved the establishment of the State and Local Program Office  (SLPO) under the direction of a Principle Deputy Assistant Secretary to  implement this mission. Specifically, the office is responsible for deploying  DHS personnel with operational and intelligence skills to state and local  fusion centers to facilitate coordination and the flow of information  between DHS and the center, provide expertise in intelligence analysis and  reporting, coordinate with local DHS and FBI components, and provide  DHS with local situational awareness and access to fusion center  information. As part of this effort, DHS is conducting needs assessments at  fusion centers to review their status and determine what resources, such  as personnel, system access, and security, are needed. As of September  2007, DHS had conducted 25 fusion center needs assessments. The SLPO  also coordinates the granting of DHS security clearances for personnel  located in fusion centers and the deployment of DHS classified and  unclassified systems for use in the fusion center.", "The Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP) awards funds to states,  territories, and urban areas to enhance their ability to prepare for, prevent,  and respond to terrorist attacks and other major disasters. HSGP consists  of five separate programs, three of which can be used by states and local  jurisdictions, at their discretion, for fusion center-related funding. The  State Homeland Security Program (SHSP) supports the implementation of  the State Homeland Security Strategies to address the identified planning,  equipment, training, and exercise needs for preventing acts of terrorism.  The Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program (LETPP) provides  resources to law enforcement and public safety communities to support  critical terrorism prevention activities. Each state receives a minimum  allocation under SHSP and LETPP and additional funds are allocated  based on the analyses of risk and anticipated effectiveness. The Urban  Areas Security Initiative (UASI) program addresses the unique planning,  equipment, training, and exercise needs of high-threat, high-density urban  areas and assists them in building an enhanced and sustainable capacity to  prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from acts of terrorism.  UASI funds are allocated on the basis of risk and anticipated effectiveness  to about 45 candidate areas. The fiscal year 2007 HSGP grant guidance  specified the establishment and enhancement of state and local fusion  centers as a prevention priority, making them a priority for LETPP.

Following the attacks on September  11, 2001, the FBI shifted its primary mission to focus on counterterrorism;  that is, detecting and preventing future attacks. The FBI primarily  conducts its counterterrorism investigations through its Joint Terrorism  Task Forces (JTTF), which are multi-agency task forces that generally  contain state and local officials. As of September 2007, there were JTTFs  in 101 locations, including one in each of the FBI\u2019s 56 field offices. Since  2003, each of the 56 field offices has also established a Field Intelligence  Group (FIG) to serve as the centralized intelligence component  responsible for the management, execution, and coordination of  intelligence functions.", "Recognizing that fusion centers are becoming focal points for the sharing  of homeland security, terrorism, and law enforcement information among  federal, state, and local governments, the FBI has directed that its field  offices, through their FIGs, become involved in the fusion centers in order  to enhance the FBI\u2019s ability to accomplish its mission and \u201cstay ahead of  the threat.\u201d In June 2006, the FBI\u2019s National Security Branch directed each  field office to assess its own information sharing environment and, when  appropriate, detail a FIG special agent and intelligence analyst to the  leading fusion center within its territory. The FBI\u2019s Directorate of  Intelligence established an Interagency Integration Unit in January 2007 to  provide headquarters oversight of FBI field offices\u2019 relationships with  fusion centers. While the FBI\u2019s role in and support of individual fusion  centers varies depending on the interaction between the particular center  and the FBI field office, FBI efforts to support centers include assigning  FBI special agents and intelligence analysts to fusion centers, providing  office space or rent for fusion center facilities, providing security  clearances, conducting security certification of facilities, and providing  direct or facilitated access to the FBI. FBI personnel assigned to fusion  centers are to provide an effective two-way flow of information between  the fusion center and the FBI; participate as an investigative or analytical  partner uncovering, understanding, reporting, and responding to threats;  and ensure the timely flow of information between the fusion center and  the local JTTF and FIG."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Role of the Program Manager of the Information Sharing Environment in Fusion Centers", "paragraphs": ["Established under the Intelligence Reform Act, the PM-ISE is charged with  developing and overseeing implementation of the ISE, which consists of  the policies, processes, and technologies that enable the sharing of  terrorism information among local, state, tribal, federal, and private sector  entities as well as foreign partners, and, as such, released an ISE  Implementation Plan in November 2006.

To improve information sharing\u2014related to  homeland security, terrorism, and law enforcement\u2014among federal, state,  and local entities and to prevent terrorism or threats after the attacks of  September 11 were the most frequently cited reasons. For example,  officials in one state said that their state was \u201cmentioned 59 times in the  9/11 Commission Report, the majority of which were not complimentary,\u201d  and as a result established a 24-hour-per-day and 7-day-per-week  intelligence and information analysis center to serve as the central hub to  facilitate the collection, analysis, and dissemination of crime and  terrorism-related information. Several officials cited the need to enhance  information sharing within their own jurisdictions across disciplines and  levels of government as the reason why their jurisdiction established a  center. While most officials from fusion centers that were in the planning  or early stages of development stated that they were establishing a fusion  center in general to enhance information sharing or protect against future  threats, officials in a few centers also noted that their jurisdictions were  discussing or establishing fusion centers because of available DHS grant  funding or their perception that DHS was requiring states to establish a  center.

Officials in 16 of the 43 operational  fusion centers said that their fusion centers were at an \u201cintermediate\u201d  stage of development, that is, the centers had limited operations and  functionality. For instance, several of these officials said that while they  had many operational components (such as policies and procedures,  analytical personnel, or technical access to systems and networks) in  place, at least one of these components was still in the process of being  developed or finalized. For example, officials in one fusion center said that  its analysts have completed training and are producing products, but the  center is still in the final stages of reconstructing its facility and  establishing access to systems and networks. Officials in 21of the  43 operational fusion centers considered their fusion centers to be  \u201cdeveloped,\u201d that is, fully operational and fully functional. For example, an  official in one center said that the fusion center has analysts from DHS,  FBI, and state and local entities; operates at the Top Secret level; and has a  Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF). Additionally,  several officials also stated that even though their centers were developed,  the centers would continue to expand and evolve. Officials in the  remaining six fusion centers considered their centers to have more than  limited operations and functionality but not yet be fully operational. For  example, one official said that the center would like to develop its  strategic component, for example related to risk assessments. Another  official stated that his center would like to expand its operations but does  not have enough personnel.", "Thirty-four of the operational centers are relatively new, having been  opened since January 2004, while 9 centers opened in the couple of years  after September 11, as shown in figure 2.", "Consistent with the purpose of a fusion center, as defined by the Fusion  Center Guidelines, officials in 41 of the 43 operational centers we  contacted said that their centers\u2019 scopes of operations were broader than  solely focusing on counterterrorism. For example, officials in 22 of the  43 operational centers described their centers\u2019 scopes of operations as all  crimes or all crimes and counterterrorism, and officials in 19 operational  centers said that their scopes of operations included all hazards. There  were subtle distinctions in officials\u2019 descriptions of an all-crimes scope;  however, they generally either said that their center focused on all  \u201cserious\u201d crimes, such as violent crimes or felonies, or specified that the  center focused on those crimes that may be linked to terrorist activity.", "Officials who described their centers as including an all-hazards focus  provided different explanations of this scope, including colocation with  the state\u2019s emergency operations center or partnerships with emergency  management organizations or first responders. One official referred to  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita as reasons why the center had an all-hazards  scope of operation.", "Officials provided two primary explanations for why their fusion centers  have adopted a broader focus than counterterrorism. The first explanation  was because of the nexus, or link, of many crimes to terrorist-related  activity. For example, officials at one fusion center said that they have an  all-crimes focus because terrorism can be funded through a number of  criminal acts, such as drugs, while another said that collecting information  on all crimes often leads to terrorist or threat information because  typically if there is terrorist-related activity there are other crimes involved  as well. The second reason why officials said that their fusion centers had  a broader focus than counterterrorism was in order to include additional  stakeholders or to provide a sustainable service. For example, one official  said that because the state is rural with only two metropolitan areas and  many small communities, the center needed to have a broader focus than  terrorism to obtain participation from local law enforcement. Officials in  another center said that their center opened in the months after  September 2001, so it focused on homeland security and terrorism, but  since then has evolved to include an all-hazards focus as it has established  partnerships with agencies outside of law enforcement. An official in  another center said that while counterterrorism is the primary mission of  the center, in the past year the center has included an all-crimes element  since on average the center only receives three terrorism-related tips a  day, and as a result, it is difficult to convince agencies to detail a staff  person to the center for this mission alone.", "The majority of the operational fusion centers we contacted were  primarily led by law enforcement entities, such as state police or state  bureaus of investigation. Some of these centers were established as  partnerships between state or local law enforcement entities and the FBI,  and others were established as partnerships with the state homeland  security offices. While all of the operational fusion centers we contacted  had more than one agency represented in the centers, the staff size and  agencies represented varied. For example, three centers we contacted had  fewer than five people on their staff representing fewer than five agencies.", "Whereas, 2 of the centers we contacted had over 80 people staffed to the  center, representing about 20 agencies. In its fusion center report, CRS  determined that the average number of full-time staff at about 27 persons.  In addition to law enforcement agencies, such as state police or highway  patrol, county sheriffs, and city police departments, 29 of the  43 operational centers we contacted had personnel assigned to their  centers from the state\u2019s National Guard, and some centers\u2019 also included  emergency management, fire, corrections, or transportation partners.", "At least 34 of the 43 operational fusion centers we contacted had federal  personnel assigned to their centers.  Officials in about three quarters of the  centers we contacted reported that the FBI has assigned personnel,  including intelligence analysts and special agents, to their centers. Most  had one or two full-time intelligence analysts or special agents at their  center. Additionally, 12 of the 43 operational centers we contacted were  colocated in an FBI field office or with an FBI task force, such as a JTTF  or a FIG, allowing the center\u2019s personnel access to FBI systems and  networks.  Also, officials in 17 of the 43 operational centers reported that  DHS\u2019s Office of Intelligence and Analysis had assigned intelligence officers  to their centers.  These officers are assigned to fusion centers on a full- time basis and are responsible for, among other things, facilitating the flow  of information between the center and DHS, providing expertise in  intelligence analysis and reporting, and providing DHS with local  situational information and access. Finally, officials in 19 of the  43 operational centers reported that they had other DHS and DOJ  components represented in their centers including personnel from U.S.  Customs and Border Protection; U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement (ICE); United States Secret Service; United States Coast  Guard; Transportation Security Administration; United States Attorneys  Office; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; Drug Enforcement  Administration (DEA); or the United States Marshals Service.", "As we have previously highlighted, operational fusion centers we  contacted reported having access to a variety of networks and systems for  collecting homeland security, terrorism-related, and law enforcement  information.

Fusion  centers reported issuing a variety of products, such as daily and weekly  bulletins on general criminal or intelligence information and intelligence  assessments that, in general, provide in-depth reporting on an emerging  threat, group, or crime. For example, one center\u2019s weekly bulletin  contained sections on domestic and international terrorism, cold case  investigations, missing persons, officer safety, and items of interest to law  enforcement.", "Some centers provide investigative support for law enforcement officers.  For example, one fusion center reported that it provided response within  20 minutes to requests for information from law enforcement officers who  were conducting traffic stops or responding to major crime scenes.

Further, DHS and DOJ have outlined plans to  provide access to their primary classified networks, HSDN and FBINET, to  state and local fusion centers that have federal personnel at the center.  However, officials in 31 of the 58 fusion centers we contacted told us that  they had difficulty obtaining access to federal information networks or  systems. For example, officials in some centers cited challenges with DHS  and FBI not providing fusion center personnel with direct access to their  classified systems. In these centers, fusion center personnel must rely on  federal personnel who are assigned to the center or other state personnel  assigned to FBI task forces to access these systems, obtain the relevant  information and share it with them. Further, officials in 12 of 58 fusion  centers reported challenges meeting system security requirements or  establishing technical capabilities necessary to access information  systems. For example, officials cited challenges with the cost and logistics  of setting up a secure room or installing the requisite hardware to access  the information systems.", "DHS and FBI have taken steps to address these logistical challenges to  providing access to classified systems. For example, as part of its needs  assessment process, DHS reviews the fusion centers\u2019 security status and  assesses its adequacy in light of DHS\u2019s intention to assign personnel and  information systems in the center. The FBI has provided fusion centers  access to classified systems through JTTF members and has colocated  with some fusion centers in FBI space. Finally, several FBI field offices  have coordinated with fusion centers to rent or build and certify facilities  or secure rooms for those centers located outside of FBI-controlled space.  For example according to FBI field offices, it is paying estimated costs of  about $40,000 and $50,000 respectively to provide secure facilities in two  fusion centers.", "While officials in many fusion centers cited challenges obtaining access to  systems, primarily classified systems, officials in 30 of the 58 fusion  centers we contacted told us that the high volume of information or the  existence of multiple systems with often redundant information was  challenging to manage. More specifically, officials in 18 fusion centers said  that they had difficulty with what they perceived to be the high volume of  information their center receives, variously describing the flow of  information as \u201coverwhelming,\u201d \u201cinformation overload,\u201d and \u201cexcessive.\u201d  For example, officials said that center personnel must sort through the  large amount of information, much of which is not relevant to the center,  to find information that is useful or important to them. Additionally,  officials in 18 fusion centers found the lack of integration among these  multiple, competing, or duplicative information systems challenging, or  said that they wanted a single mechanism or system through which to  receive or send information. Finally, officials in 11 centers said that the  redundancy of information from these multiple sources posed a challenge.  For instance, an official said that the center receives volumes of  information that contain redundancies from DHS and the FBI. CRS also  reported that one of the most consistent and constant issues raised by  fusion center officials relates to the plethora of competing federal  information-sharing systems, including, but not limited to, DHS and DOJ  systems such as HSIN, HSDN, LEO, and RISS.", "DHS/DOJ\u2019s current joint guidance on operating fusion centers\u2014the  Fusion Center Guidelines\u2014does not delineate the primary systems to  which fusion centers should have access or provide guidance to centers  about how to manage multiple systems with potentially redundant  information. For example, the guidance recommends that fusion centers  obtain access to a variety of databases and systems and provides a list of  17 available system and network resources that provide homeland  security, terrorism-related, or law enforcement information, including the  LEO, RISS, and HSIN, but do not identify which of the 17 available systems  are critical to sharing information with federal counterparts. In addition,  we have previously reported on the redundancies and lack of coordination  among DHS\u2019s HSIN and other systems. For example, we found in April  2007 that in developing HSIN, DHS did not work with the two key state  and local initiatives comprising major portions of the RISS program,  thereby putting itself at risk that HSIN duplicated state and local  capabilities. In that report, we recommended that DHS identify existing  and planned information-sharing initiatives and assess whether there are  opportunities for DHS to avoid duplication of effort. In response, DHS  initiated efforts to accomplish this goal\u2014such as creating a bridge  between the RISS and HSIN systems to allow reports to flow back and  forth between these two systems\u2014though it is currently too early to  determine the effect of these efforts.", "The PM-ISE also reported that in consultation with the Information  Sharing Council, it has been coordinating the efforts of a working group  intended to address the issue of duplicative or redundant information  systems that handle sensitive but unclassified information. Officials from  the PM-ISE stated that this group has completed a review of the most  commonly used systems, such as LEO, RISS, and HSIN. According to the  officials, the review included an examination of the services provided by  the systems and the needs of the systems\u2019 users to identify any potential  areas to streamline system access. The review is in accordance with  recommendations that fusion centers made during the National Fusion  Center Conference in March 2007. Specifically, fusion centers  recommended the federal government explore using a single sign-on or  search capability, which would facilitate accessing multiple systems.  Further, in our interviews, officials in 23 of the 58 fusion centers said that  DHS and DOJ, to facilitate the implementation of a national network of  fusion centers, should streamline existing systems or develop a unified  platform or mechanism for information sharing with fusion centers. In  addition, PM-ISE officials said that they, along with DHS and DOJ and  other federal agencies, were taking steps to improve the quality and flow  of information through the development of an Interagency Threat  Assessment Coordination Group (ITACG). As part of the National  Counterterrorism Center, this group will provide advice, counsel, and  subject-matter expertise to the intelligence community regarding the types  of terrorism-related information needed by state, local, and tribal  governments and how these entities use that terrorism-related information  to fulfill their counterterrorism responsibilities. In doing so, ITACG will  enable the timely production by the National Counterterrorism Center of  clear, relevant, and federally coordinated terrorism-related information  products intended for dissemination to state, local, and tribal officials. As  of September 2007, ITACG has achieved an initial operational capability,  according to PM-ISE officials.

DHS and the FBI provide clearances at the  Secret level for state and local officials with a need-to-know national  security information classified at the Confidential or Secret level, and the  FBI, when necessary, also provides clearances at the Top Secret level to  state and local officials with a need-to-know national security information  classified at this level and who need unescorted access in FBI facilities.  For instance, to date DHS reported that it had provided security  clearances, typically granted at the Secret level, for 1,291 state and local  personnel\u2014not necessarily personnel in fusion centers.  The FBI, in  fiscal year 2007, reported that as of April it had provided 520 security  clearances, typically granted at the Top Secret level, to state and local  fusion center personnel.  Further, CRS reported that on average, as of  July 2007, each fusion center appeared to have 14 staff with Secret  clearances and 6 staff with Top Secret clearances. However, officials in  21 of the 58 fusion centers we contacted reported difficulties obtaining the  clearances necessary to access different levels of classified materials.", "DHS and FBI also have provided centers with information for state and  local personnel about the security clearance process, stating that  processing time for individual security clearances can vary depending on  complexity. For example, DHS set a goal of 90 days to complete a Secret  clearance, and FBI set a goal of 45 to 60 days to complete a Secret  clearance and 6 to 9 months to complete a Top Secret clearance. Yet,  officials in 32 of the 58 fusion centers at the time we contacted them  reported difficulties with the length of time it takes to receive a security  clearance from DHS or the FBI. For example, in one center that receives  security clearances from both DHS and the FBI, officials said that it was  taking 6 to 9 months for a Secret clearance and 1 year to 1\u00bd years for a  Top Secret clearance. While some fusion center officials acknowledged  that the process (and the associated length of time) was necessary\u2014to  perform the requisite background checks to ensure that clearances are  only given to individuals who meet the requirements\u2014others said it was  detrimental to the fusion center because newly hired or newly promoted  analysts were unable to work without the clearances to perform their  duties. To address timeliness concerns, the FBI has taken steps to reduce  the turnaround time for clearances. According to the FBI, Top Secret  security clearances granted by the FBI to state and local personnel in  March 2007 took an average of 63 days to complete, down from an average  of 116 days in fiscal year 2006. The FBI is also implementing both short- term solutions\u2014including prioritization of background investigations for  state, local, and tribal officials and the electronic submission of  fingerprints\u2014and long-term solutions, such as training fusion center  security officers to conduct preliminary background checks, according to  a May 2007 FBI Interagency Integration Unit review of security clearances.  Indeed, officials at one fusion center told us that when the center was  opening in 2003, it took approximately 2 years to obtain a clearance, but in  January 2007, it took only 3 months to obtain a security clearance for new  personnel.", "While law and executive order provide that a security clearance granted by  one federal agency should generally be accepted by other agencies,  officials in 19 fusion centers we contacted said they faced challenges with  federal agencies, particularly DHS and the FBI, accepting each others\u2019  clearances. This reported lack of reciprocity could hinder the centers\u2019  ability to access facilities, computer systems, and information from  multiple agencies. For example, an official at one fusion center who holds  an FBI security clearance said he was unable to access other federal  agencies\u2019 facilities. An official at another fusion center said that DHS did  not accept clearances that had been issued by the FBI to fusion center  personnel and therefore would not provide access to information  technology or intelligence.", "DHS and DOJ officials said that they were not aware of fusion centers  encountering recent challenges with reciprocity of security clearances, but  they said that there were complications in the clearance process. For  example, a DHS official said that multiple federal agencies carry out their  own clearance processes and grant clearances without central  coordination. For example, both DHS and the FBI could each be  conducting a separate security clearance investigation and determining  eligibility for access to classified information on the same individual. An  FBI official also explained that some agencies and some parts of the  Department of Defense do require a polygraph examination to obtain a  clearance and some do not, so reciprocity among those agencies with  different standards may be an issue.

One official said that the fusion center  did not perceive a link between the work performed at the center and the  level of federal funding received, and hence, he did not understand how  DHS made its funding decisions for fusion centers. The official added that  it is important for local units of government to better understand these  issues to help them understand the need to provide funding for fusion  centers. Further, officials in 22 of the fusion centers said that they  encountered challenges related to the sustainability of federal funding,  such as the potential for, or actual, declining federal funding, which  created concerns for the officials about their centers\u2019 ability to sustain  capability for the long term. Officials at another fusion center said that  they are concerned that they will establish a fusion center with DHS  funding only to have the funding end in the future and the center close  because the region is unable to support it.

For example, one  official at another fusion center said that the 2-year time limit on the use of  DHS grant funds for personnel makes retaining the personnel challenging  because state and local agencies may lack the resources to continue  funding the positions, which could hinder the fusion center\u2019s ability to  continue to operate. Officials in eight of the fusion centers expressed  concerns about maintaining their personnel levels, particularly if federal  funding declines. For instance, one fusion center official said that a state  police official did not want to fund analysts with federal grant funds  because of a concern that, if the federal grant funds end, the center will  lose qualified personnel who will take away their knowledge base.  Furthermore, officials in 17 of the 58 fusion centers we contacted found  complying with the DHS grant requirement for training newly hired  analysts (that they attend training within 6 months or have previous  analytical experience) or the funding costs associated with training  challenging. For example, one fusion center official said that the center  found limitations on the particular training the grant funds can be used for  to be challenging. In addition, officials in 14 of the centers said that they  had difficulty funding training costs, such as when using the funds for  training conflicted with buying equipment or other tangible goods. Finally,  officials in 14 fusion centers said that funding their facilities poses a  challenge, particularly because of DHS restrictions on the use of grant  funds for construction and renovation. For example, officials in eight  fusion centers said that the DHS grant restrictions on construction and  renovation have made it challenging to meet security requirements for  their facilities, build a secure room, or build or renovate their facilities.", "Officials in 17 of the 58 fusion centers we contacted said that competition  for funding with state and local entities was challenging, particularly as a  result of the pass-through requirement associated with DHS grant funding  in which the state must make no less than 80 percent of the total grant  available to local units of government. For example, one fusion center  official said that it is very difficult for state-run fusion centers to cover  costs such as hiring analysts and completing renovations to their physical  space out of the 20 percent of the DHS grant funds they are eligible to  receive after the state complies with the pass-through requirement. Other  officials noted that, even after the state has complied with the pass- through requirement, fusion centers must still compete with other state  and local entities for the remaining DHS funding. For instance, one fusion  center official said that the state emergency management agency wants to  dedicate DHS funds to priorities other than the fusion center, such as the  purchase of new fire-fighting equipment.

Further, 5 of these fusion  center officials expressed concerns about their centers\u2019 long-term  sustainability without state or local funding. For example, one official said  that federal funding for the center will eventually end and the state will  need to provide funding to support the fusion center, but the state  currently has no plan for providing that support.

Exact funding amounts for fusion centers  will be determined on the basis of the prioritization and allocation of funds  by states. For fiscal year 2007, DHS included language in its grant  guidelines emphasizing fusion center activities and explicitly made  establishing and enhancing fusion centers a priority for the Law  Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program. However, these grant  programs are not specifically targeted at or limited to fusion centers. As a  result, funding provided to states may not necessarily reach a particular  fusion center because, as a DHS official noted, states are free to  reprioritize their use of grant funds after submitting their grant  justifications to DHS and receiving allocated funds. Thus, fusion centers  cannot be certain that they will receive funds to sustain fusion center  activities from year to year or over the long term.", "Over time, DHS has also made several changes to help address challenges  identified by fusion centers by focusing homeland security grants on  fusion-related activities, by taking steps to ease the grant process, and by  adjusting some of the restrictions on the timing and use of grant funds. For  example, DHS expanded grant funding in fiscal year 2006 in the area of  allowable costs for information sharing and collaborative efforts. Funds  could be used by states to develop and enhance their fusion centers,  particularly by hiring contract or government employees as intelligence  analysts; purchasing information technology hardware, software and  communications equipment; hiring consultants to make recommendations  on fusion center development; or by leasing office space for use by a  fusion center. In addition, DHS continued to make Homeland Security  Grant Program adjustments in fiscal year 2007 based on outreach to grant  program stakeholders.

For example, officials in some fusion centers we contacted  said that they lacked guidance on sharing and handling classified  information, and officials in five fusion centers said the lack of guidance  on privacy and civil liberties issues is a concern when sharing or storing  information. To illustrate, officials at one fusion center said that the  absence of an encompassing guideline to use as a standard makes it  difficult to manage information sharing across levels of government and  among states because of the variations in state and federal privacy laws  and regulations. For instance, federal regulation provides that certain  information on individuals may not be retained for longer than 5 years,  whereas the center\u2019s state requirement provides that information may not  be retained for longer than 1 year.", "FEMA/NPD, DOJ\u2019s Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), and the FBI have  partnered to provide a program of technical assistance services for fusion  centers to facilitate information sharing.

Officials in another fusion center said  that the center had difficulty creating a training program for its analysts  because of the lack of a coordinated, trusted set of training guidelines.  Two other officials said that they would like to see a federal baseline for  appropriate and necessary training for analysts with a certification  attached to its completion or a standardized course of analyst training to  ensure that analysts are trained in the same way nationwide. They said  that this would help fusion center analysts better communicate and be  more likely to share information with analysts in other centers.", "DHS and FBI officials noted some challenges with designating a single  training curriculum for fusion center analysts because agencies and  training groups differ on what should constitute the minimum baseline.  To remedy this, the NFCCG has developed and documented minimum  baseline capabilities for state and major urban area fusion centers, and as  of September 2007 was in the process of evaluating the current level of  capability of designated state and major urban area fusion centers. The  minimum baseline capabilities require fusion centers to develop a training  plan to ensure their personnel are knowledgeable of fusion center  operations, policies, and procedures, including training on the intelligence  and fusion processes, analytic processes and writing skills, security policy  and protocols, and the fusion center mission and goals.

Given the federal  interest in fusion centers and the fusion centers\u2019 interest in supporting  such a national network, it is important that the federal government  continue to provide fusion centers with added value as an incentive to  facilitate such a network. To date, DHS\u2019s and DOJ\u2019s efforts to assist fusion  centers, such as providing access to information systems, security  clearances, personnel, funding, and guidance have begun to address a  number of the challenges fusion center directors identified to us.  However, it is also important for fusion center management to understand  the federal government\u2019s longer-term role with respect to these centers.  Many fusion center officials were uncertain about the level of future  resources and the sustainability of federal support. Although the federal  government cannot make promises regarding future resources, decisions  could be made and articulated to fusion centers regarding whether the  federal government views its role with respect to providing resources\u2014 such as grant funding, facilities, personnel, and information-sharing  systems\u2014to fusion centers as short term for start-up resources or longer  term for operational needs.

A governance committee, to be chaired by the  State Administrative Agency with representatives from the Northern and  Southern Anti-Terrorism Advisory Councils, state police, National Guard,  health care, higher education, the private sector, and the interoperability  coordinator will be responsible for providing guidance and policy. At the  time of our review, the West Virginia Fusion Center was beginning its  phased opening and bringing in personnel from the National Guard and the  state police.", "The vision for the fusion center is to prevent, deter, and disrupt terrorism  and criminal activity, enabling a safe and secure environment for the  citizens of West Virginia. The fusion center will adopt an all-crimes, all- hazards, and counterterrorism scope of operations but plans to tailor each  depending on the stakeholders in the center. For example, the West  Virginia Public Broadcasting System will be represented in the fusion  center to help gather and manage information. However, if there is an  evacuation event, it will also disseminate the information directly to the  public as public service announcements through television and radio  stations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Wisconsin", "paragraphs": ["There are two fusion centers in Wisconsin: the Wisconsin Statewide  Intelligence Center (WSIC) and the Milwaukee-based Southeastern  Terrorism Alert Center (STAC)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Wisconsin Statewide Intelligence Center", "paragraphs": ["Led by the Wisconsin Department of Justice Division of Criminal  Investigation, the Wisconsin Statewide Intelligence Center (WSIC) became  operational in March 2006 as the central information and intelligence-  gathering entity for the state of Wisconsin and acts as the clearinghouse  for information and intelligence coming from local and county agencies.  WSIC\u2019s mission includes managing intelligence gathering efforts and  passing information to appropriate agencies and the JTTF; interfacing with  the Emergency Operations Center and Joint Operations Center during  critical incidents or as requested; producing general weekly law  enforcement bulletins and daily intelligence briefings for the Governor,  top law enforcement officials, and partner agency heads, among others;  supporting the Division of Criminal Investigation technology assets in the  field; and providing statewide major case support and analytical services.  Though counterterrorism is the primary concern of WSIC, the center  operates with an all-crimes, all-hazards, all-events approach directed by  the state Homeland Security Council, which wanted the center to be the  intelligence voice for the state and to help the state in a comprehensive  way.", "WSIC is staffed by eight full-time personnel, five of whom are Division of  Criminal Investigation personnel.

WSIC provides a variety of  products and services that include weekly law enforcement bulletins for  every agency in the state containing sections on domestic and  international terrorism, cold case investigations, missing persons, officer  safety, and items of interest to law enforcement. Additionally, WSIC  prepares a daily Command Staff Intelligence Briefing for the Governor, the  Attorney General, the Adjutant General, and top law enforcement officials  across the state that is primarily focused on issues within the previous  24 hours.
