FCC conducts an extensive data collection effort using its Form 477 to assess the status of advanced telecommunications service in the United States. For its zip-code level data, FCC collects data based on where subscribers are served, not where providers have deployed broadband infrastructure. Although it is clear that the deployment of broadband networks is extensive, the data may not provide a highly accurate depiction of local deployment of broadband infrastructures for residential service, especially in rural areas. A variety of market and technical factors, government efforts, and access to resources at the local level have influenced the deployment of broadband infrastructure. Areas with low population density and rugged terrain, as well as areas removed from cities, are generally more costly to serve than are densely populated areas and areas with flat terrain. As such, deployment tends to be less developed in more rural parts of the country. Technical factors can also affect deployment. GAO also found that a variety of federal and state efforts, and access to resources at the local level, have influenced the deployment of broadband infrastructure. A variety of characteristics related to households and services influence whether consumers adopt broadband service. GAO found that consumers with high incomes and college degrees are significantly more likely to adopt broadband. The price of broadband service remains a barrier to adoption for some consumers, although prices have been declining recently. The availability of applications and services that function much more effectively with broadband, such as computer gaming and file sharing, also influences whether consumers purchase broadband service. Stakeholders identified several options to address the lack of broadband in certain areas. Although the deployment of broadband is widespread, some areas are not served, and it can be costly to serve highly rural areas. Targeted assistance might help facilitate broadband deployment in these areas. GAO found that stakeholders have some concerns about the structure of the Rural Utilities Service's broadband loan program. GAO was also told that modifications to spectrum management might address the lack of broadband infrastructure in rural areas. Also, because the cost of building land-based infrastructure is so high in some rural areas, satellite industry stakeholders noted that satellite broadband technology may be the best for addressing a lack of broadband in those regions. While several options such as these were suggested to GAO, each has some challenges to implementation. Also, a key difficulty for analyzing and targeting federal aid for broadband is a lack of reliable data on the deployment of networks."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The universal availability of high speed Internet access over broadband  technologies\u2014commonly referred to as broadband Internet access\u2014has  become a national goal. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 directed the  Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and state commissions to  encourage the deployment of advanced telecommunications capability.  Similarly, in 2004, the President stated that there should be a national goal  for universal, affordable access to broadband technology by 2007. The  importance placed on access to broadband correlates to its many benefits  for individuals and society.

We focus particularly on the deployment and adoption of  broadband to households, as opposed to businesses or institutions. In  particular, this report provides information on (1) the current status of  broadband deployment and adoption; (2) the factors that influence the  deployment of broadband networks; (3) the factors that influence the  adoption, or purchase, of broadband service by households; and (4) the  options that have been suggested to spur greater broadband deployment  and adoption. In January 2006, we released a report that examined the  impact of the Internet tax moratorium on state and local tax revenues, as  also mandated by the law.", "To respond to the objectives of this report, we selected eight states and  conducted case studies on the status of broadband deployment and  adoption. For each of the states\u2014Alaska, California, Kentucky,  Massachusetts, North Dakota, Ohio, Texas, and Virginia\u2014we interviewed  state and local officials, including local franchising authorities, state public  utility regulators, and representatives from governors\u2019 offices; state  industry and government associations; private cable and telephone  providers; wireless Internet service providers; and municipal and  cooperative telecommunications providers. We also spoke with a variety of  individuals and organizations knowledgeable about broadband services,  such as national industry associations and experts. We spoke with  representatives from FCC, the National Telecommunications and  Information Administration of the Department of Commerce, and the Rural  Utilities Service (RUS) of the Department of Agriculture. To assess the  status of broadband deployment and to understand the factors affecting the  deployment and adoption of broadband, we used survey data from  Knowledge Networks/SRI\u2019s The Home Technology MonitorTM: Spring 2005  Ownership and Trend Report. Knowledge Networks/SRI interviewed  approximately 1,500 randomly sampled households, asking questions about  each household\u2019s purchase of Internet services and the availability of cable  television service. Using these data, we estimated two econometric models:  One model examined the factors affecting broadband deployment and the  second examined the factors affecting households\u2019 adoption of broadband  services. We combined the household survey data with information from  FCC\u2019s Form 477 filings, which contain information on companies\u2019 provision  of broadband services by zip codes. This enabled us to develop information  about what options for broadband a particular household would have. To  assess the impact of Internet taxes on broadband deployment and  adoption, we contacted officials in 48 states and the District of Columbia to  determine whether the state, or local governments in the state, imposed  taxes on Internet access in 2005; we did not evaluate the level of taxation.  We concluded that information from Knowledge Networks/SRI and FCC  (with modifications discussed later in this report) was sufficiently reliable  for the purpose of this report. All percentage estimates from the  Knowledge Networks/SRI survey have margins of error of plus or minus 7  percentage points or less, unless otherwise noted.

For a few years, the primary mechanism to access the Internet was a  dial-up connection, in which a standard telephone line is used to make an  Internet connection. A dial-up connection offers data transmission speeds  up to 56 kilobits per second (Kbps). Broadband, or high-speed, Internet  access became available by the late 1990s. Broadband differs from a dial-up  connection in certain important ways. First, broadband connections offer a  higher-speed Internet connection than dial-up\u2014for example, some  broadband connections offer speeds exceeding 1 million bits per second  (Mbps) both upstream (data transferred from the consumer to the Internet  service provider) and downstream (data transferred from the Internet  service provider to the consumer). These higher speeds enable consumers  to receive information much faster and thus enable certain applications to  be used and content to be accessed that might not be possible with a dial- up connection. Second, broadband provides an \u201calways on\u201d connection to  the Internet, so users do not need to establish a connection to the Internet  service provider each time they want to go online.", "Consumers can receive a broadband connection to the Internet through a  variety of technologies. These technologies include, but are not limited to,  the following:  Cable modem. Cable television companies first began providing  broadband service in the late 1990s over their hybrid-fiber coaxial  networks. When provided by a cable company, broadband service is  referred to as cable modem service. Cable providers were upgrading  their infrastructure at that time to increase their capacity to provide  video channels in response to competition from direct broadcast  satellite (DBS) providers such as DirecTV\u00ae and Dish Network. By also  redesigning their networks to provide for two-way data transmission,  cable providers were able to use their systems to provide cable modem  service. Cable modem service is primarily available in residential areas,  and although the speed of service varies with many factors, download  speeds of up to 6 Mbps are typical. Cable providers are developing even  higher speed services.", "DSL. Local telephone companies provide digital subscriber line (DSL)  service, another form of broadband service, over their telephone  networks on capacity unused by traditional voice service. Local  telephone companies began to deploy DSL service in the late 1990s\u2014 some believe, in part, as a response to the rollout of cable modem  service. To provide DSL service, telephone companies must install  equipment in their facilities and remove devices on phone lines that may  cause interference. While most residential customers receive  asymmetric DSL (ADSL) service with download speeds of 1.5 to 3 Mbps,  ADSL technology can achieve speeds of up to 8 Mbps over short  distances. Newer DSL technologies can support services with much  higher download speeds.", "Satellite. Currently, three providers of satellite service can offer nearly  ubiquitous broadband service in the United States. These providers use  geosynchronous satellites that orbit in a fixed position above the  equator and transmit and receive data directly to and from subscribers.  Signals from satellites providing broadband service can be accessed as  long as the user\u2019s reception dish has a clear view of the southern sky.  Therefore, while the footprint of the providers\u2019 transmission covers  most of the country, a person living in an apartment with windows only  facing north, or a person living in house in a heavily wooded area might  not be able to receive Internet access via satellite. Earlier Internet  services via satellite could only receive Internet traffic downstream\u2014 that is, from the satellite to the subscriber\u2014and upstream Internet  traffic was transmitted through a standard telephone line connection.  Currently, however, satellite companies provide both upstream and  downstream connections via satellite, eliminating the need for a  telephone line connection and speeding the overall rate of service.  Transmission of data via satellite typically adds one-half to three-fourths  of a second, causing a slight lag in transmission and rendering this  service less well-suited for certain applications over the Internet. While  satellite broadband service may be available throughout the country, the  price for this service is generally higher than most other broadband  modes; both the equipment necessary for service and recurring monthly  fees are generally higher for satellite broadband service, compared with  most other broadband transmission modes.", "Wireless. Land-based, or terrestrial, wireless networks can offer a  broadband connection to the Internet from a wide variety of locations  and in a variety of ways. Some services are provided over unlicensed  spectrum and others over spectrum that has been licensed to particular companies. In licensed bands, some companies are offering fixed  wireless broadband throughout cities. Also, mobile telephone  carriers\u2014such as the large companies that provide traditional cell  phone service\u2014have begun offering broadband mobile wireless  Internet service over licensed spectrum\u2014a service that allows  subscribers to access the Internet with their mobile phones or laptops  as they travel across cities where their provider supports the service.  Such services are becoming widely deployed and are increasingly able  to offer high-speed services. A variety of broadband access  technologies and services are also provided on unlicensed spectrum\u2014 that is, spectrum that is not specifically under license for a particular  provider\u2019s network. For example, wireless Internet service providers  generally offer broadband access in particular areas by placing a  network of antennae that relay signals throughout the network.  Subscribers place necessary reception equipment outside their homes  that will transmit and receive signals from the nearest antenna. Also,  wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) networks\u2014which provide broadband service in  so-called \u201chot spots,\u201d or areas up to 300 feet\u2014can be found in cafes,  hotels, airports, and offices. Some technologies, such as Worldwide  Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), can operate on either  licensed or unlicensed bands, and can provide broadband service up to  approximately 30 miles in a line-of-sight environment.", "Under section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress directs  FCC to encourage deployment of advanced telecommunications capability,  which includes broadband, to all Americans. In implementing the act, FCC  has treated the two most widely available broadband services\u2014cable  modem and DSL service\u2014as information services having a  telecommunications component. FCC\u2019s approach of not treating such  services as telecommunications services has important legal implications  because a service defined as a telecommunications service could be  subject to regulation under Title II of the Communications Act, which  imposes substantial common carrier regulations unless the commission  choose to forebear from their enforcement. As part of its responsibilities,  FCC periodically issues a report to Congress on the status of advanced  telecommunication capability in the United States. To prepare this report,  FCC developed a periodic reporting requirement using Form 477. In  November 2004, FCC modified its rules regarding the filing of the 477 form,  which went into effect for the companies\u2019 second filing in 2005.  Specifically, FCC removed existing reporting thresholds, and companies  are now required to report their total state subscribership by technology."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "About 30 Million American Households Purchase Broadband Service; Despite Evidence of Substantial Broadband Deployment throughout the United States, It Is Difficult to Assess Deployment Gaps in Some Areas", "paragraphs": ["We found that in 2005, about 30 million American households\u2014or 28  percent\u2014subscribed to broadband, although households in rural areas  were less likely to subscribe to broadband service than were households in  urban and suburban areas.

In early 2004, FCC initiated a proceeding to examine whether it  should collect more detailed information for its broadband data gathering  program than had previously been collected. Specifically, FCC asked  whether it should do several things to enhance the broadband data  including (1) requiring providers to report the speeds of their broadband  services, (2) eliminating the reporting threshold such that all providers of  broadband\u2014no matter how small\u2014must report to FCC on its services, and  (3) requiring that providers report the number of connections by zip code.  In late 2004, FCC released an order in which it decided to require all  providers\u2014no matter how small\u2014of broadband to report in the 477 data  collection effort on broadband and also required providers to report  information about their services within speed tier categories. The  commission decided not to require providers to report the number of  connections (or subscribers) that they serve within each zip code or the  number of connections in speed tiers or by technology within each zip  code, finding that finding that such a requirement would impose a large  burden on filers (particularly smaller entities), and would require  significant time to implement. In particular, several providers commented  in the 2004 proceeding that it would be costly and burdensome to develop  the software and systems to generate the detailed zip code-level data and  that the cost and burden of further reporting requirements would likely  outweigh the benefits of more substantial information on broadband  deployment in the United States. On the other hand, 3 state utility  commissions asked FCC to gather more information within zip codes or by  some other Census boundary because such information is, in their view,  important for tracking broadband availability.", "Based on the modifications to the filing requirements FCC implemented,  FCC collects, through its Form 477 filings, information on several aspects  of each company\u2019s provision of broadband at the state level, such as the  total number of subscribers served, the breakdown of how those  subscribers are served by technology, and estimates within each  technology of the percentage of subscribers that are residential. For each  technology identified in the state reporting, providers also submit a list of  the zip codes in which they serve at least one customer. As discussed  above, companies do not report the number of subscribers served or  whether subscribers are business or residential within each zip code; they  also do not report information on the locations within the zip code that  they can serve.", "In July 2005, FCC found that 99 percent of the country\u2019s population lives in  the 95 percent of zip codes where at least one provider reported to FCC  that it serves at least one high-speed subscriber as of December 31, 2004. In  83 percent of the nation\u2019s zip codes, FCC noted that subscribers are served  by more than one provider, and the commission noted that for roughly 40  percent of zip codes in the United States, there are five or more providers  reporting high-speed lines in service. Although these data indicate that  broadband availability is extensive, we found that FCC\u2019s 477 data may not  be useful for assessing broadband deployment at the local level. While  FCC, in general, notes that the 477 zip-code data are not meant to measure  deployment of broadband, in its July 2005 report, the commission states  that in order to be able to evaluate deployment, the commission \u201cinstituted  a formal data collection program to gather standardized information about  subscribership to high speed services. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added. ) Based on  our analysis, we found that collecting data about where companies have  subscribers may not provide a clear depiction of their deployment,  particularly in the context of understanding the availability of broadband  for residential users.", "One quandary in analyzing broadband deployment is how to consider the  availability of satellite broadband services. Even though broadband over  satellite may not be seen by some as highly substitutable for other  broadband technologies because of certain technical characteristics or  because of its higher cost, satellite broadband service is deployed: Three  companies have infrastructure in place to provide service to most of the  country. The actual purchase of satellite broadband is scattered  throughout the country and shows up in FCC\u2019s 477 zip-code data only  where someone actually purchases the service. It is not clear how satellite  service should be judged in terms of deployment. Since it is available  throughout the entire country, one view could be that broadband is near  fully deployed. Alternatively, it could be viewed that satellite broadband\u2014 while available in most areas\u2014does not reflect localized deployment of  broadband infrastructure and should therefore not be counted as a  deployed broadband option at all. In either case, FCC\u2019s zip-code data on  satellite broadband\u2014which is based on the pattern of scattered  subscribership to this service\u2014does not seem to be an appropriate  indicator of its availability.", "Aside from the question of how to view satellite deployment, other issues  arise in using subscribership indicators for wire or wireless land-based  providers at the zip-code level as an indicator of deployment. These issues  include the following:   Because a company will report service in a zip code if it serves just one  person or one institution in that zip code, stakeholders told us that this  method may overstate deployment in the sense that it can be taken to  imply that there is deployment throughout the zip code even if  deployment is very localized. We were told this issue might particularly  occur in rural areas where zip codes generally cover a large geographic  area. Based on our own analysis, we found, for example, that in some  zip codes more than one of the large established cable companies  reported service. Because such providers rarely have overlapping  service territories, this likely indicates that their deployment was not  zip-code-wide and that the number of providers reported in the zip code  overstates the level of competition to individual households. We also  found that a nontrivial percentage of households lie beyond the 3-mile  radius of their telephone central office, indicating that DSL service was  unlikely to be available to these homes.", "Companies report service in a zip code even if they only serve  businesses. One academic expert we interviewed expressed a concern  about this issue. Based on our own analysis, we found that many of the  companies filing 477 data indicating service in particular zip codes only  served business customers. As such, the number of providers reported  as serving many zip codes is likely overstated in terms of the availability  of broadband to residences.", "FCC requires that companies providing broadband using unbundled  network elements (UNE) report their broadband service in the zip  code data. When a provider serves customers using UNEs, they  purchase or lease underlying telecommunications facilities from other  providers\u2014usually incumbent telephone companies\u2014to serve their  customers. Having these providers report their subscribers at the state  level is important to ensure that correct numbers on the total  subscribers of broadband service is obtained. However, while UNE  providers may make investments in infrastructure, such as in  collocation equipment, they do not generally own or provide last-mile  connectivity for Internet access. Thus, counting these providers in the  zip-code-level data may overstate the extent of local infrastructure  deployment in the sense that several reporting providers could be  relying on the same infrastructure, owned by the incumbent telephone  company, to provide broadband access.", "Based on our analysis, we believe that the use of subscriber indicators at  the zip-code level to imply availability, or deployment, may overstate  terrestrially based deployment. We were able to check these findings for  one state\u2014Kentucky\u2014where ConnectKentucky, a state alliance on  broadband, had done an extensive analysis of its broadband deployment.  ConnectKentucky officials shared data with us indicating that  approximately 77 percent of households in the state had broadband access  available as of mid-2005. In contrast, we used population data within all zip  codes in Kentucky, along with FCC\u2019s 477 zip-code data for that state, and  determined that, according to FCC\u2019s data, 96 percent of households in  Kentucky live in zip codes with broadband service at the end of 2004. Thus,  based on the experience in Kentucky, it appears that FCC\u2019s data may  overstate the availability and competitive deployment of nonsatellite  broadband.", "Additionally, to prepare our econometric models, we relied on FCC\u2019s 477  data to assess the number of providers serving the households responding  to Knowledge Networks/SRI\u2019s survey. Based on FCC\u2019s data, we found that  the median number of providers reporting that they serve zip codes where  the households were located was 8; in 30 percent of these zip codes, 10 or  more providers report that they provide service. Only 1 percent of  respondents lived in zip codes for which no broadband providers reported  serving at least one subscriber, according to FCC\u2019s data. To better reflect  the actual number of providers that each of the survey respondents had  available at their residence, we made a number of adjustments to FCC\u2019s  provider count based on our analysis of the providers, certain geographic  considerations, and information provided by the survey respondents.  After making these adjustments, the median number of providers for the  respondents fell to just 2, and we found that 9 percent of respondents likely  had no providers of broadband at all.", "Despite these concerns about FCC\u2019s 477 data, several stakeholders,  including a state regulatory office and a state industry association, said  they found FCC\u2019s data useful. An official at a state governor\u2019s office also  noted that analysis of FCC data allowed them to make conclusions about  the extent of deployment in their state. Similarly, an official in another  governor\u2019s office said that they use FCC\u2019s data to benchmark the  accessibility of broadband in their state because it is the only data  available.

In particular, we were  told that the cost of building a broadband infrastructure in areas where  people live farther apart is much higher than building infrastructure to  serve the same number of people in a more urban setting. As such, some  stakeholders noted that highly rural areas\u2014which generally have low  population density\u2014can be costly to serve. Results from our econometric  model confirm the views of these stakeholders. We found that densely  populated and more urbanized locations were more likely to receive  broadband service than were less densely populated and rural locations.  For example, we found that urban areas were 9 percentage points more  likely to have broadband service available than were rural areas.", "Terrain was also frequently cited as a factor affecting broadband  deployment decisions. In particular, we were told that infrastructure build- out can be difficult in mountainous and forested areas because these areas  may be difficult to reach or difficult on which to deploy the required  equipment. Conversely, we were told that flat terrain constitutes good  geography for telecommunications deployment. For wireless providers, we  were told that terrain concerns can present particular challenges because  some wireless technologies require \u201cline-of-sight,\u201d meaning that radio  signals transmitted from towers or antennas need an unobstructed  pathway\u2014with no mountains, trees, or buildings\u2014from the transmission  site to the reception devices at users\u2019 premises. Terrain can also affect  satellite broadband availability in rural areas that have rolling hills or many  trees that can obstruct a satellite\u2019s signal.", "Some stakeholders also said costs for what is known as \u201cbackhaul\u201d are  higher for rural areas and can affect the deployment of broadband  networks in these areas. Backhaul refers to the transmission of  information\u2014or data\u2014from any of a company\u2019s aggregation points to an  Internet backbone provider that will then transmit that data to any point on  the Internet. This is also sometimes referred to as the \u201cmiddle mile.\u201d  Internet traffic originating from rural areas may need to travel a long  distance to a larger city to connect to a major Internet backbone provider.  Because the cost of transmitting over this distance\u2014that is, the backhaul\u2014 can be high, one stakeholder noted that backhaul costs are another barrier  to deployment in rural areas. However, using our econometric model, we  did not find that the distance to a metropolitan area with a population of  250,000 or more\u2014our proxy for backhaul\u2014was associated with a lower  likelihood of broadband deployment.", "In Alas, backhaul from rl villge reqire the  use of satellite.

In particular, because  stakeholders noted that potential providers seek to deploy in markets  where demand for their service will be sufficient to yield substantial  revenues, certain elements of markets were identified as affecting the  demand for broadband:   Ability to aggregate demand. For rural locations, officials we spoke  with stressed the importance of aggregating sufficient demand. For  example, officials in one state told us that to justify the cost of  deployment in rural areas where population density is low,  telecommunications providers need to be able to aggregate all of the  possible demand to make a business case. We were also told that  aggregation is furthered by ensuring that a large \u201canchor tenant\u201d will  subscribe to the service. Possible anchor-tenant customers described to  us included large businesses, government agencies, health-care  facilities, and schools.

A key underlying factor may be that computer  ownership is substantially higher among higher-income households,  according to a survey conducted by the Census Bureau. Second, our model  results showed that households with a college graduate are 12 percentage  points more likely to subscribe to broadband services compared with  households without a college graduate. In fact, when discussing the effects  of education on the demand for broadband, we were told that some college  graduates see broadband as a necessity and would be less likely to choose  to live in a rural area that did not have adequate broadband facilities. Third,  we found that households headed by young adults are more likely to  purchase broadband than are households headed by a person 50 or older.  Similarly, a few stakeholders we spoke with said that older adults are less  likely to purchase broadband. This may be the case because older  Americans generally have lower levels of computer ownership and  computer familiarity. We also were told that households with children in  school are more likely to have broadband service. Figure 4 provides some  descriptive statistics to illustrate the relationship between several  demographic characteristics and the adoption of broadband.", "We also examined whether households residing in rural areas were less  likely to purchase broadband service than those living in urban areas. As  noted earlier, we found that only 17 percent of rural households subscribe  to broadband service. Our model indicated, however, that when the  availability of broadband to households, as well as demographic  characteristics, are taken into account, rural households no longer appear  less likely than urban households to subscribe to broadband. That is, the  difference in the subscribership to broadband among urban and rural  households appears to be related to the difference in availability of the  service across these areas, and not to a lower disposition of rural  households to purchase the service.", "In addition to household characteristics, we also found that characteristics  and uses of broadband service available to consumers can also influence  the extent to which households purchase broadband service.", "Some stakeholders we spoke with mentioned that the price of  broadband service is an important factor affecting a household\u2019s  decision to purchase this service. Some stakeholders mentioned, for  example, that one of the key reasons for the recent surge in DSL  subscribership is due to recent price declines for the service: Some  providers are now offering DSL for less than $15 per month. Conversely,  because satellite broadband service is expensive and also requires the  upfront purchase of expensive equipment needed to receive the satellite  signal, several of those we spoke with said that the expense of satellite  broadband deters its purchase. In fact, a recent study suggests that  areas served by multiple providers, where prices may tend to be lower,  may have higher rates of broadband adoption. However, because we  lacked data on the price of broadband service, we were unable to  include this variable in our econometric model. We did not find that the  number of companies providing broadband service affected the  likelihood that a household would purchase broadband service.", "Some stakeholders also told us that the availability of applications and  content not easily accessible through dial-up, as well as the degree to  which consumers are aware of and value this availability, contribute to a  household\u2019s decision to adopt broadband. For example, some functions,  applications, and content\u2014such as gaming, VoIP, and music and video  downloads\u2014either need or function much more effectively with  broadband service than with dial-up service and, as such, make  broadband a major attraction for households that value these types of  services and content. Alternatively, some applications, such as e-mail,  function adequately with dial-up service, and for households that  primarily use the Internet for e-mail, there may be little need to upgrade  to broadband service.

The  Community Connect Broadband grant program provides funding for  communities where no broadband service currently exists. One loan  program, which provides loans at 4 percent, also requires that no existing  broadband providers be present in a community, but loans at the Treasury  interest rate are available to entities that plan to serve communities with  existing broadband service. Several stakeholders with whom we spoke, as well as the findings of a recent report by the Inspector General (IG) of the  Department of Agriculture, raised concerns about these programs: Effectiveness of loans. It is not clear whether a loan program\u2014such  as the RUS loan program\u2014is effective for helping rural areas gain  access to broadband services. RUS requires applicants to submit an  economically viable business plan\u2014that is, applicants must show that  their business will be sufficiently successful such that the applicant will  be capable of repaying the loan. But developing a viable broadband  business plan can be difficult in rural areas, which have a limited  number of potential subscribers. As a result, RUS has rejected many  applications because the applicant could not show that the business  plan demonstrated a commercially viable and sustainable business. In  fact, the agency has been unable to spend all of its loan program funds.  Since the inception of the program in 2002, the agency has fallen far  short of obligating the available funding in this program. For example,  RUS officials told us that in 2004, they estimated that the appropriations  for the broadband loan program could support approximately $2.1  billion in loans, but only 28 percent of this amount\u2014or $603 million\u2014 was awarded for broadband projects. RUS officials also told us that its  2005 appropriations could support just over $2 billion in loans, but only  5 percent\u2014or $112 million\u2014was awarded to broadband projects. One  stakeholder we spoke with suggested that a greater portion of RUS  funds should be shifted from loans to grants in order to provide a more  significant level of assistance for rural broadband deployment. RUS  officials noted that they are currently evaluating the program and  recognize that the program criteria limit the ability of the agency to  utilize their full loan funding.", "Competitive environment requirements. During our interviews,  some stakeholders expressed concerns about how the presence of  existing broadband deployment was considered in evaluating RUS grant  and loan applications. In the case of the grant program, RUS approves  applications only for communities that have no existing broadband  service. Some local government officials and a company we spoke with  noted that this \u201cunserved\u201d requirement for RUS grants can disqualify  certain rural communities that have very limited Internet access\u2014 perhaps in only one small part of a community. Alternatively, regarding  the Treasury rate loan program, a few providers and the IG\u2019s report  criticized the program for supporting the building of new infrastructure  where infrastructure already existed. In particular, we learned that loans  were being let for deployment in areas that already had at least one  provider and in some cases had several providers. As such, it is not clear  whether these funds are being provided to communities most in need.  RUS officials noted, however, that the statute specifically allows such  loans. Additionally, the issue of how the status of existing service is  gauged was a concern for one provider we spoke with. RUS obtains  information about existing providers from applicants, and agency  officials told us that agency field representatives review the veracity of  information provided by applicants during field visits. However, RUS  officials told us that FCC zip-code data is not granular enough for their  needs in evaluating the extent of broadband deployment in rural areas.", "Community eligibility. A few local officials we spoke with criticized  the community size and income eligibility requirements for the grant  and loan programs. In Massachusetts, one stakeholder said that most  small towns in part of that state exceed RUS\u2019s population requirements  and thus do not qualify for grants or loans. The grant and loan programs  also have per-capita personal income requirements. One service  provider in Alaska said that the grant program income eligibility  requirements can exclude Alaskan communities, while failing to take  into account the high cost of living in rural Alaska.", "Technological neutrality. Satellite companies we spoke with said  RUS\u2019s broadband loan program requirements are not readily compatible  with their business model or technology. Once a company launches a  satellite, the equipment that individual consumers must purchase is the  remaining infrastructure expense. Because the agency requires  collateral for loans, the program is more suited for situations where the  providers, rather than individual consumers, own the equipment being  purchased through the loan. Yet, when consumers purchase satellite  broadband, it is common for them to purchase the equipment needed to  receive the satellite signal, such as the reception dish. Additionally,  broadband service must be provided at a speed of at least 200 kilobits in  both directions\u2014which is not necessarily the case for satellite  broadband\u2014for it to qualify for RUS loans. Moreover, RUS officials  noted that for satellite broadband providers to be able to access RUS  loans, they would have to demonstrate that each customer lives in a  community that meets the community size eligibility requirement. As  such, this program may not be easily utilized by satellite broadband  providers. Yet for some places, satellite could be a cost-effective  mechanism to provide broadband infrastructure into rural areas. For  example, in 2005, the RUS Community Connect program provided  grants to 19 communities that average 554 residents and 194  households. The total cost of these grants was roughly $9 million. Thus,  RUS spent an average of $2,443 per covered household, but the cost  per household that adopted broadband would be even higher since only  a subset of these households would choose to subscribe to broadband  service. By contrast, two satellite providers we spoke with estimate that  their consumer equipment and installation costs are roughly $600 per  subscribing household. These figures might not fully represent the full  nature of the services provided through the grant program and those  available via satellite; for example, grantees of the RUS program are  required to provide free Internet service to community centers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USF Programs Indirectly Support Broadband Service, but Several Stakeholders Expressed Concerns", "paragraphs": ["While the USF program does not directly fund broadband service, the  funding provided to support telecommunications networks indirectly  supports the development of infrastructure that can provide many  communications services, including broadband.

Three stakeholders we spoke with in Alaska, Ohio, and North Dakota  attributed the relative success of broadband deployment in rural areas to  the USF program.

The two types of ILECs have different  eligibility criteria under which they can qualify to receive high-cost  support and more support is provided to rural companies than to  nonrural companies serving rural areas. Two stakeholders we spoke  with suggested that the eligibility criteria should be modified, such that  the criteria better reflect the cost to provide service in particular areas,  rather than the type of company providing the service. Alternatively, two  stakeholders we spoke with favor the current eligibility criteria and  funding mechanism.", "Two stakeholders we spoke with expressed concerns about a lack of  coordination across USF funding sources, which could lead to  inefficient use of funds and inadequate leveraging of funds. For  example, in Alaska, two stakeholders noted that governments and  providers receive \u201csilos\u201d of funding for schools, libraries, and rural  health centers. Because the programs are narrowly defined, multiple  entities might be the recipient of funding for broadband service, which  could lead to multiple broadband connections in relatively small rural  communities. One stakeholder noted that since each entity might use  only a fraction of its available broadband capacity, there can be capacity  for Internet traffic available for other uses or users, but funding  recipients are sometimes not allowed to share this capacity, either with  other entities or with residents in the community. Thus, communities  may be unable to leverage the available funding for other uses.", "While two stakeholders we spoke with suggested expanding the USF  program to include broadband service, we found little support for this  overall.

For example, in some geographic areas, we heard that  congestion in certain unlicensed spectrum bands makes providing wireless  broadband Internet access more difficult, and a few stakeholders said that  with more unlicensed spectrum, wireless providers could support greater  broadband deployment. Additionally, wireless providers we spoke with  also expressed concern about the management of spectrum, particularly  the quality of certain bands and quantity of spectrum available for wireless  broadband service. Two stakeholders mentioned that spectrum allocated to  wireless broadband service is susceptible to having communications  obstructed by interference from trees and buildings. In a 2005 report, we  noted that experts agreed that the government should evaluate its  allocation of spectrum between licensed and unlicensed uses.

Universal availability of broadband has been set forth as a policy goal for  the near term\u20142007. And progress toward this goal has been substantial.  The availability of broadband to residential consumers has grown from its  nascent beginnings in the latter part of the 1990s to broad coverage  throughout the country. In the last 10 years, providers in traditional  communications industry segments\u2014telephone and cable\u2014have upgraded  and redesigned miles of their networks in order to offer broadband  services. The provision of broadband through various wireless means, as  well as over the existing electricity infrastructure, have also been  developed, and for many, if not most Americans, the burgeoning broadband  marketplace is characterized by competitive choice in broadband access  and creative and ever-expanding applications and content. Many would  consider the rollout of broadband infrastructure as a success story of  entrepreneurial initiative.", "But not all places or people have experienced the full benefits of this rapid  rollout of broadband services. As with many other technologies, the costs  of bringing broadband infrastructure to rural America can be high. For  private providers who must weigh the costs and returns of their  investments, the feasibility of serving the most rural parts of our country  may not work within a reasonable business model. While there are federal  support mechanisms for rural broadband, it is not clear how much impact  these programs are having or whether their design suggests a broad  consideration of the most effective means of addressing the problem. And  one of the difficulties of assessing the gaps in deployment and where to  target any federal support is that it is hard to know exactly where  broadband infrastructure has not been deployed. FCC does collect data on  the geographic extent of providers\u2019 service, but these data are not  structured in a way that accurately illustrates the extent of deployment to  residential users. Without accurate, reliable data to aid in analysis of the  existing deployment gaps, it will be difficult to develop policy responses  toward gaps in broadband availability.

In that proceeding, the commission also determined that it  would be costly and could impose large burdens on filers\u2014particularly  small entities\u2014to require any more detailed filings on broadband  deployment. Although FCC staff told us that analysis of potential costs had  been conducted, exact estimates of these costs and burdens have not yet  been determined.

According to the  FTTH Council, as of September 2005, 2.7 million homes were passed by  fiber and over 300,000 homes were connected to fiber in 652 communities  in 46 states. Stakeholders expressed concerns about the high cost  associated with deploying FTTH, and also that FTTH deployment was  concentrated in urban and suburban communities, or in newly developed  communities (known as \u201cgreenfields\u201d)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from Industry Participants", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to several associations representing  industry trade groups and state and local government entities for their  review and comment. The following associations came to GAO  headquarters to review the draft: Cellular Telecommunications and Internet  Association (CTIA), National Association of Regulatory Utility  Commissioners (NARUC), National Association of Telecommunications  Officers and Advisors (NATOA), National Cable and Telecommunications  Association (NCTA), National Telecommunications Cooperative  Association (NTCA), Satellite Industry Association (SIA), US Internet  Industry Association (USIIA), United States Telecom Association (USTA),  and Wireless Internet Service Providers Association (WISPA).", "Officials from CTIA, NARUC, and NTCA did not provide comments.  Officials from NATOA, NCTA, SIA, and USIIA provided technical comments  that were incorporated, as appropriate.", "USTA officials noted that our discussion of the effects of local franchising  on deployment imply that franchise agreements have helped to ensure  broad deployment of broadband, but that, in the view of USTA, franchise  buildout requirements can deter entry and thus reduce deployment.", "WISPA officials expressed concern about our findings regarding the  taxation of Internet access and noted that it is important, in their view, that  wireless Internet access provided by small providers not be taxed, and in  fact, WISPA officials noted that small providers should be provided a tax  incentive to encourage investment and expansion in underserved areas.  Additionally, these officials expressed concern about the presentation of  data on how households currently access the Internet from their homes.  WISPA stated that these data understate the importance that wireless  access will have toward the goal of universal broadband coverage both  within and outside of users\u2019 homes. WISPA stated that the report accurately  depicts that wireless Internet service providers (WISP) currently hold a  minority market share, and WISPA officials note that without certain  government policies to foster growth in the wireless industry, WISPs will be  at a competitive disadvantage. WISPA officials also expressed concern that  the report understates factors that are hindering the growth of the wireless  Internet industry\u2014most notably, the need for additional spectrum under 1  Ghz, such as the TV white spaces. Further WISPA noted that the data  showing broadband penetration rates in urban, rural, and suburban areas  should not be interpreted as indicating that access to broadband is lower in  only rural areas. They suggested that differences in broadband penetration  rates across these types of locations are not that great and that pockets of  areas with no access exist in many areas. As such, WISPA suggests that  policy response regarding spectrum availability, USF funding, and Rural  Utilities Service be focused on engaging smaller providers that can bring  broadband to areas not currently served by the larger incumbent providers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Individuals making key contributions to this report include Amy  Abramowitz (Assistant Director), Eli Albagli, Stephen Brown, Michael  Clements, Sandra DePaulis, Nina Horowitz, Eric Hudson, Bert Japikse,  John Mingus, Sara Ann Moessbauer, Karen O\u2019Conor, Lindsay Welter, and  Duffy Winters."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
