The goals of RSPA's Transportation Infrastructure Assurance program are to identify, and develop ways to mitigate the impact of, threats to the nation's transportation infrastructure. DOT's Office of Intelligence and Security is responsible for defining the requirements for transportation infrastructure protection, ensuring that vulnerability assessments of transportation infrastructure are conducted, and taking action to mitigate those vulnerabilities. The House Committee on Appropriations asked GAO to determine (1) the status and anticipated results of the Transportation Infrastructure Assurance (TIA) program, and (2) the extent to which RSPA and the Office of Intelligence and Security have coordinated their activities in selecting the vulnerabilities to be assessed and implementing the vulnerability assessments for the program.

The Department of Transportation (DOT) formally began one  such effort in June 2001\u2014the Transportation Infrastructure Assurance  program\u2014within its Research and Special Programs Administration  (RSPA). The Transportation Infrastructure Assurance program focuses on  identifying and mitigating against threats, such as from acts of terrorism  and sabotage, which could adversely affect the operation of the nation\u2019s  transportation infrastructure and cause harm to humans. The program is  crosscutting, defining \u201ctransportation infrastructure\u201d to include highways,  transit systems, railroads, airports, waterways, pipelines and ports, as well  as the vehicles, aircraft, and vessels that operate on these networks. The  program is also directly related to the mission of DOT\u2019s key transportation  security stakeholder. DOT\u2019s Office of Intelligence and Security is  responsible on behalf of the Secretary for defining the requirements for  transportation infrastructure protection, ensuring that vulnerability  assessments of transportation infrastructure are conducted, and taking  action to mitigate those vulnerabilities.", "In House Report 107-722, accompanying DOT and Related Agencies  Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 2003, the House Appropriations  Committee asked us to examine the Transportation Infrastructure  Assurance program. In subsequent discussions with Committee staff we  agreed to address the following questions: (1) What is the status and what  are the anticipated results of the Transportation Infrastructure Assurance  program? and (2) To what extent has RSPA coordinated their activities  with DOT\u2019s Office of Intelligence and Security in selecting the  vulnerabilities to be assessed and implementing the assessments for the  program?", "To answer these questions, we examined Transportation Infrastructure  Assurance program documents, including budget data and project plans.", "We also interviewed officials from RSPA\u2019s Office of Innovation, Research  and Education\u2014which manages the program, and the Volpe National  Transportation Systems Center\u2014which is conducting the program  research\u2014regarding the status, management, and operation of the  program, as well as plans for disseminating and evaluating program  results. In addition, we interviewed officials from the Office of Intelligence  and Security about the extent of their participation in the program.", "Although the Transportation Security Administration was formally part of  DOT during the course of our review, it was not established until after the  Transportation Infrastructure Assurance program began. Moreover, the  Transportation Security Administration\u2019s initial efforts focused on  safeguarding the nation\u2019s aviation industry; as a result, the Office of  Intelligence and Security continued to lead DOT\u2019s efforts in fulfilling  national critical infrastructure protection responsibilities. Consequently,  our review focused on the Office of Intelligence and Security\u2019s  involvement in the program. We did, however, talk with officials from the  Transportation Security Administration regarding their role in identifying  and undertaking future research activities necessary to enhance  transportation security.", "We conducted our review from September 2002 through February 2003 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["On May 22, 1998, President Clinton issued a pair of directives to guide  federal efforts to address critical infrastructure vulnerabilities.  Presidential Decision Directive 62 (PDD 62) highlighted the growing threat  of unconventional attacks against the United States. It described a new  and more systematic approach to fighting terrorism through interagency  efforts to prepare for response to incidents involving weapons of mass  destruction. Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD 63) further directed  federal agencies to conduct risk assessments and planning efforts to  reduce exposure to attack. Specifically, the assessments were to consider  attacks that could significantly diminish the abilities of (1) the federal  government to perform essential national security missions and ensure the  general public health and safety; (2) state and local governments to  maintain order and to deliver minimum essential public services; and (3)  the private sector to ensure the orderly functioning of the economy and  the delivery of essential telecommunications, energy, financial, and  transportation services. PDD 63 called for the government to complete  these assessment efforts no later than May 2003. According to the Office of  Intelligence and Security\u2019s (OIS) Associate Director for National Security  (hereafter referred to as the Associate Director), the Transportation  Infrastructure Assurance (TIA) program is, in part, DOT\u2019s effort to meet  these Presidential Decision Directive requirements.", "RSPA concentrates on multimodal issues (research that applies to more  than one mode of transportation) that affect the entire U.S. transportation  system rather than on a specific sector of the system. RSPA\u2019s Office of  Innovation, Research and Education is responsible for managing the TIA  program. The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, located in  Cambridge, Massachusetts, is the research arm of RSPA and is conducting  the program\u2019s vulnerability assessments. OIS is the key transportation  security stakeholder within DOT responsible for analyzing, developing,  and coordinating departmental and national policies addressing national  defense, border security, and transportation infrastructure assurance and  protection issues. Other OIS responsibilities include: coordinating with the  public and private sectors, international organizations, academia, and  interest groups regarding issues of infrastructure protection; acting as the  Secretary of Transportation\u2019s liaison with the intelligence, law  enforcement, and national defense communities and assisting  departmental organizations in establishing and maintaining direct ties with  those communities; and serving as the Secretary of Transportation\u2019s  primary advisor on significant intelligence issues affecting the traveling  public, the transportation industry, and national security. According to  OIS\u2019s Associate Director, OIS has historically been involved in the  department\u2019s transportation security research efforts. He added that OIS\u2019s  lead role in fulfilling the department\u2019s critical infrastructure  responsibilities, including the implementation of Presidential Decision  Directives addressing critical infrastructure vulnerabilities, is likely to  change as the roles and responsibilities of the Transportation Security  Administration (TSA) and the newly created Department of Homeland  Security are defined.", "Congress established TSA in November 2001 to be responsible for  ensuring transportation security, including identifying and undertaking  research and development activities necessary to enhance transportation  security. For fiscal year 2003, TSA received $110 million to fund  transportation security research activities for all modes of transportation.  Further, on November 25, 2002, the President signed the Homeland  Security Act of 2002, which established the Department of Homeland  Security with the responsibility of, among other tasks, coordinating efforts  in securing America\u2019s critical infrastructure.

RSPA officials said that two of these assessments (the  interdependency of the transportation system with other critical  infrastructures and transportation and logistical requirements for  emergency response teams in dealing with weapons of mass destruction)  were selected, in part, to meet DOT\u2019s PDD 62 and 63 requirements, and are  scheduled for completion in mid-2003 to meet the deadlines outlined in the  presidential directives. The other two assessments (the feasibility of  alternative backup systems for the global positioning system, and an  assessment of the options to transition from hazardous materials  transportation security guidelines to security requirements) were selected  based upon a perceived need for assessments in these areas as defined by  officials from RSPA\u2019s Office of Hazardous Materials Safety and the Volpe  National Transportation Systems Center, and are scheduled for  completion in December 2003. RSPA\u2019s Volpe Center is conducting the TIA  program\u2019s four assessments and has conducted research related to  transportation infrastructure since 1996.

The purpose of this  assessment is to describe the current and evolving dependence between  the nation\u2019s transportation infrastructure and some of the nation\u2019s other  critical infrastructures including energy, electronic-commerce, banking  and finance, and telecommunications. For example, the nation\u2019s air traffic  control system relies on telecommunications to manage the safety and  efficiency of air transportation, as shown in figure 2. Researchers plan to  determine the costs, in terms of economic disruption and loss of lives,  associated with terrorists exploiting transportation infrastructure  vulnerabilities.", "Transportation and logistical requirements for emergency response  teams in dealing with weapons of mass destruction: The purpose of this  assessment is to evaluate the transportation and logistics assets required  in responding to terrorist activities. The assessment will include an  analysis of transportation operations and procedures, personnel, supplies,  and transportation assets such as vehicles, containers, and pallets.  Specifically, researchers plan to analyze the institutional and economic  implications of terrorist activities involving weapons of mass destruction  in order to develop emergency transportation action plans and compile  emergency transportation procedure best practices. Emergency teams  were transported to respond to the terrorist attack on the World Trade  Center on September 11, 2001, as shown in figure 3.", "Feasibility of alternative backup systems for the global positioning  system: The purpose of this assessment is to provide a continuation of the  August 2001 report by the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center,  Vulnerability of the Transportation Infrastructure Relying On The Global  Positioning System. The report concluded that the global positioning  system is vulnerable to both intentional and nonintentional disruption, and  identified a need for a backup for the global positioning system. To follow- up on the August 2001 report, researchers plan to analyze and describe the  performance, cost, and practicality of backup systems and procedures.  Figure 4 shows a picture of a global positioning satellite.", "Options to transition hazardous materials transportation security  guidelines to security requirements: The purpose of this assessment is to  evaluate the tradeoffs in the transportation of hazardous materials that  exist between security, economic, proprietary, and delivery factors.

For example, RSPA consulted with OIS to select one of the  two vulnerabilities for assessment in fiscal year 2001 and notified OIS of  its selection of a second vulnerability. Specifically, in a memorandum  dated March 6, 2001, OIS identified and proposed a list of critical  infrastructure protection research requirements for assessment and  requested that RSPA address them as a high priority. In this initial  proposal, the Director of OIS said that significant OIS involvement would  be required to effectively implement the program given its responsibilities  for defining transportation security vulnerabilities, ensuring that  vulnerability assessments are conducted, and implementing actions to  mitigate those vulnerabilities. On April 9, 2001, RSPA issued a  memorandum to OIS outlining its research agenda for fiscal year 2001 and  stating that OIS\u2019s involvement in assuring the program\u2019s quality,  credibility, and review was critical. This memorandum confirmed RSPA\u2019s  plans to assess the interdependency of the transportation system with  other critical infrastructures, as suggested by OIS\u2019s proposed list, and  notified OIS of RSPA\u2019s intention to conduct a second assessment\u2014the  transportation and logistical requirements for emergency response teams  in dealing with weapons of mass destruction\u2014that was not included on  OIS\u2019s list.", "In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, RPSA  issued a solicitation on behalf of all DOT modes for additional  transportation security technology research and concepts to be included  in the TIA program or related transportation security programs. OIS  officials participated with RSPA in reviewing the proposals received in  response to the solicitation. However, according to the Associate  Administrator of RSPA\u2019s Office of Innovation, Research, and Education  (hereafter referred to as the Associate Administrator), DOT did not receive  the funds to pursue any of these proposals.", "During fiscal year 2002, RSPA did not coordinate with OIS to determine  what additional assessments to select for inclusion in the program.  Instead, RSPA selected two transportation vulnerabilities for assessment  under the program after holding discussions with Volpe Center  researchers and officials from RSPA\u2019s Office of Hazardous Materials  Safety. While the Associate Director of OIS said he was unaware that  additional vulnerabilities had been selected for assessment in fiscal year  2002 prior to our discussions with him regarding the status of the program,  he noted that both of these assessments\u2014on the feasibility of alternative  backup systems for the global positioning system, and an assessment on  options to transition hazardous materials transportation security  guidelines to security requirements\u2014were valid and of high priority.  According to OIS and RSPA officials, this lack of coordination resulted, in  part, from disagreements and misunderstandings about the other\u2019s  respective role in the program. As indicated by a series of e-mail  communications between OIS and RSPA officials during the period  between October 2001 and January 2002, questions about the respective  roles of OIS and RSPA in the program\u2019s management, specific research  areas, and the logistics of this research were raised on numerous  occasions with no apparent resolution. Neither RSPA nor OIS were able to  provide us with documentation to show that these issues were resolved.

While OIS has participated in meetings  regarding the assessment of the options to transition hazardous materials  transportation security guidelines to security requirements, RSPA did not  similarly involve OIS in the program\u2019s three other vulnerability  assessments. OIS and RSPA officials said that this lack of coordination  during the implementation of the program resulted, in part, from  continued disagreements and misunderstandings about the other\u2019s  respective role in the program. Further, OIS\u2019s Associate Director said that  because of OIS\u2019s lack of involvement in the TIA program, he was not  aware of the program\u2019s progress to date and therefore expressed  uncertainty about whether the program\u2019s research is meeting the  requirements of PDD 62 and 63.", "OIS\u2019s Associate Director also said that OIS\u2019s working relationships with  private industry stakeholders might have helped RSPA obtain industry- sensitive information for the program\u2019s assessments. RSPA officials  acknowledged that a primary challenge of the TIA program involves  obtaining information on industry-specific, competition-sensitive issues.  For example, RSPA officials said that private sector owners and operators,  such as those from the oil industry, are cautious about releasing  proprietary information because of the possibility that this information  could be used by (1) business rivals to gain a competitive advantage, (2)  terrorists to harm and destroy critical infrastructure, and (3) the federal  government to pursue further regulations of the industry. As a result, TIA  program researchers told us that they are limited in their ability to identify  specific threats and weaknesses relating to some of the specific  vulnerabilities under assessment. According to RSPA\u2019s Associate  Administrator, because of these limitations, the TIA program is, in some  instances, examining vulnerability issues on a conceptual level rather than  through specific case studies of industry infrastructure. For example,  instead of assessing the vulnerabilities of specific privately owned  infrastructures, such as oil refineries, RSPA is addressing some critical  details of crude oil transport using ports in Louisiana and Texas to  illustrate the complexities in defining the interdependency vulnerabilities  between the nation\u2019s transportation and energy infrastructures.

The first update  was held in March 2003. Furthermore, RSPA\u2019s Associate Administrator  agreed to provide TSA\u2019s Director for Threat Assessment and Risk  Management with information on the TIA program\u2019s findings, challenges,  and lessons learned. In our discussions with TSA\u2019s Director for Threat and  Risk Assessment, she said that such information regarding the TIA  program would be helpful in guiding TSA\u2019s future efforts in planning and  conducting transportation security research.
