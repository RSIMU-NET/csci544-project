First, enrolling workers and issuing TWIC cards in a timely manner to a significantly larger population of workers than was done during testing of the TWIC program. Second, ensuring that the TWIC technology, such as biometric card readers, works effectively in the maritime sector. TSA has obtained limited information on the use of biometric readers in the maritime sector because most facilities that tested the TWIC program did not use these types of readers. Thirs, balancing the added security components of the TWIC program with the potential impact that the program could have on the flow of maritime commerce. An independent contractor's assessment found deficiencies with TWIC program testing and recommended that additional testing be conducted to determine its effectiveness. TSA has acknowledged that there are challenges to implementing the TWIC program and has taken some actions to address these issues, including allowing more time to consider requirements for installing TWIC access control technologies. However, TSA plans no additional testing of the TWIC program. Rapidly moving forward with implementation of the TWIC program without developing and testing solutions to identified problems to ensure that they work effectively could lead to further problems, increased costs, and program delays without achieving the program's intended goals. TSA experienced problems in planning for and overseeing the contract to test the TWIC program. Specifically, TSA made a number of changes to contract requirements after the contract was awarded, contributing to a doubling of contract costs, and TSA did not ensure that all key components of the program were tested. TSA has acknowledged that problems with contractor oversight occurred because the agency did not have sufficient personnel to monitor contractor performance. TSA has taken some actions to address this problem. However, until TSA issues the contract for TWIC implementation and develops its plans for monitoring contractor performance, it is not clear to what extent these actions will ensure that the contract to implement the TWIC program will include comprehensive and clearly defined requirements and that contractor performance will be closely monitored to ensure that the program is implemented successfully and costs are controlled."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Protecting the nation\u2019s transportation facilities, including seaports,  airports, and railroad terminals, from the threat of terrorism has taken on  special urgency in the post\u2013September 11, 2001, environment. These  facilities are critical components of the U.S. economy and are necessary  for supplying goods throughout the country and supporting international  commerce. For example, the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach  estimate that they alone handle 43 percent of the nation\u2019s oceangoing  cargo. An attack at one of these port facilities could severely affect the  country\u2019s economy. About 6 million workers, including longshoreman,  mechanics, aviation and railroad employees, truck drivers, and others  access secure areas of the nation\u2019s estimated 4,000 transportation facilities  each day while performing their jobs. Some of these workers, such as  truck drivers, regularly access secure areas at multiple transportation  facilities. Ensuring that only workers that do not pose a terrorist threat are  allowed access to secure areas is important to preventing an attack. In the  aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the Aviation and  Transportation Security Act (ATSA) was enacted in November 2001 and,  among other things, requires the Transportation Security Administration  (TSA), an agency within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), to  work with airport operators to strengthen access control points in secure  areas and consider using biometric access control systems to verify the  identity of individuals who seek to enter a secure airport area.  In response  to ATSA, TSA established the Transportation Worker Identification  Credential (TWIC) program in December 2001 to mitigate the threat of  terrorists and other unauthorized persons from accessing secure areas of  the entire transportation network. In November 2002, the Maritime  Transportation Security Act of 2002 (MTSA) was enacted which, among  other things, required the Secretary of DHS to issue a maritime worker  identification card that uses biometrics, such as fingerprints, to control  access to secure areas of seaports and vessels. TSA intends the TWIC  program to satisfy the requirements of MTSA and to enhance access  control security across all modes of transportation.", "The purpose of the TWIC program is to protect the nation\u2019s transportation  facilities from the threat of terrorism by issuing identification cards only to  workers who do not pose a terrorist threat and allow these workers  unescorted access to secure areas of our nation\u2019s transportation system.  To accomplish this objective, the TWIC program is to include background  checks on transportation workers to ensure they do not pose a threat to  security, collection of personal and biometric information to validate  workers\u2019 identities, issuance of tamper resistant biometric credentials that  cannot be counterfeited, verification of these credentials using biometric  access control systems before a worker is granted unescorted access to a  secure area, and revocation of credentials if workers are found to pose a  threat to security or if a card is lost or stolen.", "In December 2004, we reported on the status of the TWIC program.  Specifically, we described the reasons TSA cited for continued program  delays and recommended that TSA develop plans to better manage the  project, identify risks to the program, and analyze the costs and benefits of  program alternatives. TSA agreed with these recommendations. TSA\u2014 through a private contractor\u2014tested the TWIC program from August 2004  to June 2005 at 28 transportation facilities around the nation. In August  2005, the TWIC testing contractor submitted a report summarizing the  results of the TWIC testing to TSA.", "Recently, the proposal to transfer control of the operations of various U.S.  port terminals to a foreign company heightened concerns regarding the  security of the nation\u2019s transportation system, specifically related to  access at ports. In response to these concerns, the Secretary of DHS  announced in April 2006 that the TWIC program had been delayed too long  and that DHS would accelerate implementation of the program beginning  in the maritime sector. In May 2006, DHS issued a proposed rule that  describes the requirements of the TWIC program that the owners and  operators of maritime facilities and vessels would be required to  implement. The maritime industry was provided the opportunity to  comment on the proposed rule until July 6, 2006. In August 2006, DHS  decided that the TWIC program would be implemented in the maritime  sector using two separate rules in response to numerous maritime industry  concerns about whether the access control technologies necessary to  operate the TWIC program will work effectively. One rule will cover  enrolling workers and issuing cards and a second rule will cover  implementing TWIC access control technologies, such as biometric card  readers. DHS plans to finalize the first TWIC rule by the end of calendar  year 2006, and the second TWIC rule will be issued subsequently. TSA  estimates that implementation of the TWIC program in the maritime sector  will cost the federal government and transportation facilities about   $800 million over the next 10 years. TSA estimates that individuals  applying to receive a TWIC card will be charged a fee of $149. According  to TSA, the agency is considering implementing TWIC in other modes of  transportation in the future, but has not established a time frame for   doing so.", "To help Congress evaluate TSA\u2019s overall progress in implementing the  TWIC program, we answered the following questions: (1) What problems,  if any, did testing of the TWIC program identify and what challenges, if  any, do DHS and industry stakeholders face in implementing the program?  and (2) To what extent, if at all, did TSA experience problems in planning  for and overseeing the contract to test the TWIC program?", "To answer these questions, we interviewed officials from the two DHS  components responsible for implementing the TWIC program, TSA and the  Coast Guard. Specifically, we interviewed these officials regarding the  development and implementation of the TWIC program, the results of tests  of the key components of the TWIC program, the challenges of  implementing the program, and the planning for and oversight of the  contract to test the TWIC program. To determine the goals and  requirements of TWIC testing, testing results, and status of the TWIC  program, we obtained and analyzed TWIC program documents, including  program management plans, the contract for testing the TWIC program,  the final report on the test results, an independent assessment of TWIC  testing, and the TWIC proposed rule and the corresponding regulatory  impact analysis. We also reviewed applicable laws, regulations, policies,  and procedures to determine the requirements for implementing the TWIC  program. In addition, we interviewed TWIC testing contractor officials  concerning testing results, oversight provided by TSA, and the  independent assessment of TWIC testing. We also interviewed officials  from the contractor that performed an independent assessment of TWIC  testing. We also reviewed TSA policies and procedures for contract  oversight related to monitoring the performance of contractors. We  conducted site visits to 15 of the 28 facilities that participated in testing  the TWIC program in California, Delaware, Florida, New Jersey, New  York, and Pennsylvania to observe the operation of the TWIC program at  these facilities, obtain information on stakeholder experiences related to  the TWIC testing, and discuss any challenges associated with  implementing TWIC. We visited testing facilities in each of the three  testing regions, East Coast, West Coast, and Florida, as well as locations  representing three modes of transportation\u2014maritime, aviation, and rail.  We attended three of the four public meetings held by TSA and the Coast  Guard in May and June 2006 to obtain industry comments on the TWIC  proposed rule and reviewed stakeholder comments submitted to TSA and  the Coast Guard during the rulemaking process. This work was also  informed by our prior reports and testimony related to TWIC, maritime  and transportation security, and TSA and DHS contracting practices.

The Ports of Los  Angeles and Long Beach estimate that they alone handle about 43 percent  of the nation\u2019s oceangoing cargo. The importance of these systems and  facilities also make them attractive targets to terrorists. These systems and  facilities are vulnerable and difficult to secure given their size, easy  accessibility, large number of potential targets, and close proximity to  urban areas. A terrorist attack at these systems and facilities could cause a  tremendous loss of life and disruption to our society. An attack would also  be costly. According to recent testimony by a Port of Los Angeles official,  a 2002 labor dispute led to a 10-day shutdown of West Coast port  operations, costing the nation\u2019s economy an estimated $1.5 billion per  day. A terrorist attack to a port facility could have a similar or greater  impact.", "One potential security threat stems from those individuals who work in  secure areas of the nation\u2019s transportation system, including seaports,  airports, railroad terminals, mass transit stations, and other transportation  facilities.

Some of  these workers, such as truck drivers, regularly access secure areas at  multiple transportation facilities. Ensuring that only workers that do not  pose a terrorist threat are allowed unescorted access to secure areas is  important in helping to prevent an attack. According to TSA and  transportation industry stakeholders, many individuals that work in secure  areas are currently not required to undergo a background check or a  stringent identification process in order to access secure areas. For  example, according to stakeholders at several ports, truck drivers need  only present a driver\u2019s license, which can be easily falsified and obtained,  to access secure areas of the nation\u2019s ports. In addition, without a standard  credential that is recognized across modes of transportation and facilities,  many workers must obtain multiple credentials to access each  transportation facility they enter. For example, in Florida, truck drivers  who deliver goods to multiple ports in the state must obtain credentials for  as many as 13 individual ports.

At the federal government level, TSA, the agency  responsible for the security of all modes of transportation, has taken the  lead in developing the TWIC program, while the Coast Guard is  responsible for developing maritime security regulations and ensuring that  maritime facilities and vessels are in compliance with these regulations. As  a result, TSA and the Coast Guard are working together to implement  TWIC in the maritime sector. According to TSA officials, TWIC is being  implemented in the maritime sector first to meet MTSA requirements and  because the aviation sector already has established systems to control  access to secure areas. According to TSA, the agency is considering  extending the program to other modes of transportation. Most seaports,  airports, mass transit stations, and other transportation systems and  facilities in the United States are owned and operated by state and local  government authorities and private companies. As such, certain  components of the TWIC program, such as installing access control  systems, such as card readers, will be the responsibility of these state and  local governments and private industry stakeholders. For example, at most  seaports, the private companies that operate the terminal are responsible  for controlling access to secure areas, while at other ports, local  governments handle this responsibility. As a result, the responsibility for  implementing certain components of the TWIC program at each facility  will be shared between local governments and the private sector.", "TSA\u2014through a private contractor\u2014tested the TWIC program from  August 2004 to June 2005 at 28 transportation facilities around the nation,  including 22 port facilities, 2 airports, 1 rail facility, 1 maritime exchange,   1 truck stop, and a U.S. postal service facility. In August 2005, TSA and the  testing contractor completed a report summarizing the results of the TWIC  testing. TSA also hired an independent contractor to assess the  performance of the TWIC testing contractor.

First, TSA is to conduct a security threat  assessment to make sure that the worker is not listed in any terrorism  databases or on a terrorism watch list, such as TSA\u2019s No-fly and  selectee list. Second, a Federal Bureau of Investigation criminal history  records check is to be conducted to identify if the worker has any  disqualifying criminal offenses.

The report did not specifically discuss the effectiveness of the link  between card readers and the facility access control system at these   10 locations. TSA said it was unable to identify the specific testing  locations where card readers were linked to local access control systems  or any additional results regarding the link between card readers and  access control systems. According to TSA and the testing contractor, they  encountered difficulties in linking card readers to access control systems  during testing because many facilities lacked the infrastructure necessary  to do so. For example, TSA and testing contractor officials told us that at  most maritime facilities participating in testing, electrical power supplies  and high-speed communications lines were not available at all of the  access control points where card readers were needed, especially those  far away from the facility\u2019s central access control system. As a result,  linking card readers to the access control system would have been too  difficult and costly to perform during testing.

In addition, the difficulties encountered by the  TWIC testing contractor in establishing this link raises questions about the  difficulty in doing so during TWIC implementation. For example, some  stakeholders stated that they tried but were unable to link biometric card  readers to the computers and computer software running their current  access control systems. An official at one testing facility told us that his  facility spent its own money to hire a technology integrator to link TWIC  card readers to the facility access control system because TSA and the  testing contractor did not do so during testing of the TWIC program.  Stakeholders also expressed concerns that the new biometric TWIC card  readers will not be compatible with their existing access control systems  and as a result, they will incur additional costs if they are required to  purchase new access control systems. According to TSA, while facility and  vessel owners and operators will be required to install TWIC card readers,  it is up to these facilities and vessels whether they want to link these card  readers to their access control systems.

This requires that (1) TSA identify that a worker is a threat to  security or that their card has been lost or stolen and invalidate their TWIC  card from the national TWIC database; (2) TSA quickly communicates  information to facilities regarding those workers whose TWIC cards have  been invalidated; and (3) the facility removes a worker\u2019s access privileges  to secure areas from their local access control system. However,  according to TSA, the testing contractor encountered problems in  connecting the national TWIC database to local facilities\u2019 access control  systems during testing of the TWIC program.

Several TWIC testing  facilities that we visited lacked the technology, such as computer systems  and high-speed communications lines, to connect with TSA\u2019s national  TWIC database to obtain information on workers that may pose a potential  threat or whose TWIC cards had been lost or stolen. An independent  contractor\u2019s assessment of the testing also found that TSA did not test the  connection between the national TWIC database and local facility access  control systems.

TSA officials stated that, while they did not test the  connection between the national TWIC database and facilities in the field,  they tested this component in a laboratory. However, TSA officials said  they were unable to provide any reports on this laboratory testing.  According to TSA officials, under the TWIC proposed rule, this problem  will be resolved because facilities and vessels can download updates from  the national TWIC database on a regular basis regarding workers who  pose a threat as an alternative to directly connecting with the national  database.

However, in commenting on the TWIC  proposed rule, stakeholders stated that they believe that upgrading and  installing access control systems at maritime facilities will cost much more  than the TSA and the Coast Guard estimate. For example, one port facility  has 37 individual terminals, several of which could require 20 or more card  readers for entry and exit lanes at one terminal alone. Port officials  estimated that it could cost up to $300,000 per terminal to install the  necessary TWIC card readers. Several stakeholders are also concerned  that TSA and the Coast Guard cost estimates do not take into account the  facilities\u2019 costs to maintain equipment and technology, such as card  readers, or the cost to hire additional staff needed to perform such  maintenance.

TSA officials confirmed that the addition of  these key requirements caused the contract cost to increase.", "First, according to TSA and the testing contractor, although the initial  contract did not stipulate a date to begin program testing, they initially  agreed that the contractor should begin testing the TWIC program in April  2005. However, TSA officials moved up the start date to November 2004 to  try to complete testing sooner. According to TSA and the testing  contractor, the contractor incurred additional costs to move up the  schedule. Second, TSA\u2019s initial testing contract was amended to require  the contractor to install infrastructure necessary to test the TWIC program  at transportation facilities. TSA added this requirement right after it  awarded the contract because the agency learned that many testing  facilities needed additional infrastructure to support testing the TWIC  program and lacked the necessary funding to pay for it. According to TSA  and the testing contractor, requiring the contractor to install infrastructure  further increased the cost of the contract. Lastly, TSA changed the  requirements after it awarded the testing contract to facilitate the  enrollment of all port workers that were already enrolled in Florida\u2019s  uniform port access credential program. This required the testing  contractor to use a different approach to enrolling workers in Florida than  was used at other TWIC testing locations. TSA did not include this  approach in the original contract. According to TSA officials, these  modifications were not included in the initial TWIC testing contract  because TSA officials were under pressure to begin TWIC testing and did  not have sufficient time to ensure that the contract included  comprehensive and clearly defined requirements.

Specifically the FAR states that government personnel should  avoid issuing contract requirements on an urgent basis, as was done  during the TWIC testing contract, since this could increase contract prices.  In addition, best practices for contract planning include defining key  contract requirements and making critical decisions before moving  forward and committing funds or resources to a major system, or  acquisition, such as the TWIC program.

For example, at two maritime facilities we visited, officials  told us that communication and coordination with TSA was the most  significant problem they encountered during TWIC program testing. These  officials stated that all communications from TSA and the testing  contractor would stop for months during TWIC testing and that questions  to TSA regarding the status of testing and various problems encountered  often went unanswered. Another example of poor communication and  coordination cited by stakeholders was that TSA never provided any  results of the TWIC testing, including the final testing report, to the  facilities that participated in the testing. According to TSA, the agency did  not provide the final testing report to stakeholders because the report  contained sensitive security information.

The assessment also stated that TSA did not  adequately (1) define testing contract requirements, (2) develop a  comprehensive implementation plan to secure adequate stakeholder  involvement, or (3) monitor TWIC program schedules and costs.

The  maritime industry and other transportation stakeholders are generally  supportive of the TWIC program as a means to strengthen access control  security and establish a national standard for worker identification  credentials. TSA tested the TWIC program at a select number of  transportation facilities to identify problems, develop solutions to these  problems, and help determine how TWIC can be effectively implemented  across the nation. However, the TWIC testing fell short of meeting its  goals. Specifically, during testing, TSA issued cards to only about   1,700 workers and tested card readers at 19 facilities, a much smaller  population than planned, and TSA did not fully test all key components of  the TWIC program, such as biometric card readers. As a result, TSA faces  the challenge of transitioning from this limited testing to successful  implementation of the program on a much larger scale covering   750,000 workers at over 3,500 maritime facilities and 10,800 vessels. While  TSA has taken some actions to address problems identified during TWIC  program testing, the agency and the maritime industry still face key  challenges in ensuring that the program will meet its intended goal of  providing an effective means of preventing unauthorized access to secure  areas.", "TSA has recently announced that it will use two separate rulemakings to  implement the TWIC program. The first will provide the requirements for  enrolling workers, conducting background checks, and issuing TWIC  cards. A subsequent rule will include requirements for purchasing and  installing TWIC access control technologies. Postponing the issuance of  requirements for TWIC access control technologies will afford the  maritime industry additional time to comment on these requirements.  However, it is not clear what, if any, additional testing of the TWIC access  control technologies will be conducted as part of this subsequent  rulemaking to ensure that they work effectively. Moreover, TSA\u2019s decision  to issue two TWIC rules poses an additional challenge in that TSA will  need to ensure that the TWIC cards issued to workers enrolled under the  first rule will be compatible with the card reader technologies that will be  part of the second rule. TSA\u2019s decision to rapidly move forward with  implementation of the TWIC program without developing and testing  solutions to identified problems could lead to additional problems,  increased costs, and further program delays without achieving the  program\u2019s intended goals. Considering the large investment that the  federal government and maritime industry will be required to make to  implement the TWIC program, it is particularly important that solutions to  the problems and challenges facing the program be developed and tested  before implementation to avoid wasting resources. We have found during  prior work that in a rush to implement programs quickly, TSA has not  always followed a disciplined development process, including conducting  appropriate systems testing, and did not always follow their own systems  development guidance when developing programs.

TSA  officials stated that the agency has taken steps to address these problems  by hiring additional staff with technical and program management  expertise to assist in developing contract requirements and providing  oversight. While these actions may address problems that occurred during  TWIC program testing, whether they will resolve all of the contract  planning and oversight problems will not be clear until TSA develops and  awards the contract to implement the TWIC program and develops plans  for overseeing and evaluating contractor performance and communicating  and coordinating with maritime industry stakeholders."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that the TWIC program can be implemented as efficiently  and effectively as possible, we recommend that the Secretary of Homeland  Security direct the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security for the  Transportation Security Administration, in close coordination with the  Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, to take the following two actions:  1.  Before TWIC is implemented in the maritime sector, develop and test  solutions to the problems identified during TWIC program testing, and  raised by stakeholders in commenting on the TWIC proposed rule, to  ensure that all key components of the TWIC program work effectively.  In developing and testing these solutions, TSA should:    ensure that the TWIC program will be able to efficiently enroll and  issue TWIC cards to large numbers of workers;    ensure that the technology necessary to operate the TWIC program  will be readily available to industry stakeholders and will function  effectively in the maritime sector, including biometric card readers  and the capability to link facility access control systems with the  national TWIC database;    ensure that the TWIC program balances the added security it  provides with the potential effect that the program could have on  the flow of maritime commerce; and    closely coordinate with maritime industry stakeholders\u2014 particularly those that are currently implementing or using  biometric access control systems\u2014to learn from their experiences.  2.  Strengthen contract planning and oversight practices before awarding  the contract to implement the TWIC program to achieve the following  purposes:    ensure that the contract to implement the TWIC program contains  comprehensive and clearly defined requirements;    ensure that resources are available and measures are in place to  provide effective government oversight of the contractor\u2019s  performance; and    establish a communication and coordination plan to capture and  address the views and concerns of maritime industry stakeholders  during implementation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DHS for review and comment. On  September 22, 2006, we received written comments on the draft report,  which are reproduced in full in appendix II. DHS concurred with the  findings and recommendations and stated that the report will help  improve TSA\u2019s management of the TWIC program and strengthen  oversight of contractor performance. DHS further stated that the report\u2019s  recommendations will help facilitate the nationwide implementation of the  TWIC card and thus, the agency has already taken steps to implement  them.", "Regarding our recommendation to develop and test solutions to the  problems identified during TWIC program testing, and raised by  stakeholders in commenting on the TWIC proposed rule, DHS stated that it  is taking a number of actions. Specifically, to ensure that the TWIC  program will be able to efficiently enroll and issue TWIC cards to large  numbers of workers, TSA is using experience gained during TWIC testing  to improve the enrollment and card issuance process, which should  address the problems encountered during testing. For example, TSA plans  to use an easier and faster form of scanning to capture workers\u2019  fingerprints and is taking additional steps to ensure that the process for  enrolling workers and issuing TWIC cards is efficient. In addition,  according to DHS, TSA is seeking an experienced and capable contractor  to enroll workers and operate the information technology systems  necessary to support the program. Taking these steps should help TSA to  address the problems experienced during testing regarding enrollment and  card issuance. Nevertheless, TSA will face the challenge of enrolling and  issuing TWIC cards to a significantly larger population of workers than  was enrolled during testing.", "Concerning our recommendation that DHS ensure that the technology  necessary to operate the TWIC program will be readily available to  industry stakeholders and will function effectively in the maritime sector,  including biometric card readers and the capability to link facility access  control systems with the national TWIC database, DHS stated that TSA  and the Coast Guard will not require maritime facilities and vessels to  purchase or install card readers as part of the first rulemaking process.  Instead, requirements for biometric card readers and access control  technologies will be part of a subsequent rulemaking. According to DHS,  the two-phased rulemaking process allows more time for maritime facility  and vessels owners and operators to plan for the installation of biometric  card readers and access control infrastructure and allows the public  additional opportunity to comment on this aspect of the program. In  addition, TSA is considering additional field testing of biometric card  readers within the funding and schedule parameters of the TWIC program  and has already solicited stakeholders\u2019 involvement in these tests.  Furthermore, according to DHS, the General Services Administration  (GSA) and NIST are currently testing products, including biometric card  readers, for compliance with FIPS 201 standards. GSA is also developing a  list of qualified access control technology products and vendors that will  be available for purchase by maritime facilities and vessels to implement  the TWIC program in the future. Obtaining additional comments from the  public regarding TWIC access control technology requirements,  conducting additional testing of TWIC program technologies in the  maritime environment, and ensuring that access control technologies are  compliant with FIPS 201 standards are important steps for ensuring that  the TWIC program works effectively in the maritime environment. In  regard to linking facility access control systems with the national TWIC  database, DHS stated that facilities and vessels will be provided secure  web access to a list of TWIC cards that are lost, stolen, expired, or belong  to individuals found to pose a threat to security.", "In addressing our recommendation that TSA and the Coast Guard ensure  that the TWIC program balances the added security it provides with the  potential effect that the program could have on the flow of maritime  commerce, DHS stated that TSA and the Coast Guard have reviewed  industry comments, are cognizant of stakeholder concerns, and  acknowledge the potential impact that the TWIC program could have on  the flow of maritime commerce. As a result, TSA and Coast Guard plan to  obtain additional comments on this issue from industry stakeholders in  the second rulemaking pertaining to access control technology. Soliciting  additional comments from maritime industry stakeholders should help  TSA and the Coast Guard balance the added security of the TWIC program  with the potential affects on the flow of maritime commerce. Conducting  additional testing of TWIC in the maritime environment would further help  TSA and the Coast Guard determine how to balance security and the flow  of maritime commerce.", "With regard to our recommendation that DHS closely coordinate with  maritime industry stakeholders\u2014particularly those that are currently  implementing or using biometric access control systems\u2014to learn from  their experiences, DHS stated that the TWIC program is considering field  testing of biometric card reader technology to support the second phase of  the TWIC program within the funding and schedule parameters of the  program. According to DHS, multiple TWIC stakeholders have expressed  an interest in participating in this field testing. In addition, TSA and the  Coast Guard plan an upcoming conference of TWIC qualified contractors  and TWIC stakeholders to discuss experiences during TWIC testing. DHS  also stated that the agency has invited other stakeholders to provide  feedback on the TWIC program. Taking action to better coordinate with  maritime stakeholders are steps in the right direction and will be essential  to effectively implementing the TWIC program.", "In response to our recommendation that TSA strengthen contract planning  and oversight practices before awarding the contract to implement the  TWIC program, DHS stated that it is taking several actions to implement  this recommendation. Specifically, to ensure that the contract to  implement the TWIC program contains comprehensive and clearly defined  requirements, TSA has recently selected qualified contractors and released  the request for proposal (RFP) to implement the TWIC program. The TWIC  RFP includes a detailed requirements document that identifies the  performance outcomes expected to be met by the contractor selected to  implement the TWIC program. According to DHS, any future changes to  the TWIC requirements will be managed under a formal change control  process. If properly implemented, these actions should better position TSA  to ensure that the TWIC implementation contract contains comprehensive  and clearly defined requirements.", "Regarding our recommendation that TSA ensure that resources are  available and measures are in place to provide effective government  oversight of the contractor\u2019s performance, DHS stated that the TWIC  program has recently established a Program Control Office to help oversee  contractor performance and deliverables. In addition, the TWIC program  has developed a Quality Assurance and Surveillance Plan and acceptable  quality levels of performance in the TWIC RFP to provide a foundation for  contract management and oversight. TSA has also hired additional staff to  provide better program management and improved oversight of TWIC  contracts. Allocating additional resources and taking steps to ensure that  TSA provides effective oversight of the TWIC implementation contract are  important steps toward improving contract oversight. If properly  implemented, these actions should address the intent of this  recommendation.", "Concerning our recommendation that TSA establish a communication and  coordination plan to capture and address the views and concerns of  maritime industry stakeholders during implementation, DHS stated that  the TWIC program has increased its communication and coordination  efforts with stakeholders during the TWIC rulemaking process and plans  to continue these activities during implementation of the program.  According to DHS, the TWIC program office has developed a  communication strategy and plan and the TWIC RFP requires the TWIC  implementation contractor to establish a communications plan to provide  information to stakeholders and address their concerns during  implementation. Developing plans to better communicate and coordinate  with stakeholders will be key to the success of the TWIC program.", "DHS also offered technical comments and clarifications, which we have  considered and incorporated where appropriate.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 21 days after its  issue date.

To determine the status of the TWIC program,  goals, and requirements of TWIC testing and testing results, we obtained  and analyzed TWIC program documents, including program management  plans, the final report on TWIC testing, an independent contractor\u2019s  assessment of TWIC testing, the TWIC proposed rule, and the TWIC  regulatory impact analysis. We also reviewed applicable laws, regulations,  policies, and procedures to determine the requirements for implementing  the TWIC program. We attended public meetings held by TSA and the  Coast Guard in Newark, New Jersey; Tampa, Florida; and Long Beach,  California; to obtain industry comments on the TWIC proposed rule. We  also reviewed stakeholder comments submitted to TSA and the Coast  Guard during the rulemaking process. We conducted site visits to 15 of the  28 facilities that participated in testing the TWIC program in California,  Delaware, Florida, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania to obtain  information on stakeholder experiences regarding the TWIC testing,  observe the operation of the TWIC program at these facilities, and discuss  any challenges associated with implementing TWIC. We visited testing  facilities in each of the three testing regions\u2014East Coast, West Coast, and  Florida\u2014as well as locations representing the maritime, aviation, and rail  modes of transportation. We selected the 15 facilities based on geographic  location, mode of transportation, and diversity of facility size and area of  business operations.  Table 3 lists the 15 facilities we visited that  participated in TWIC testing.", "To address our second objective, to determine to what extent, if at all, the  contract to test the TWIC program identified contract planning and  oversight problems that should be addressed before implementing the  program, we interviewed TSA officials regarding the planning for and  oversight of the contract to test the TWIC program. We obtained and  analyzed TWIC program documents, including the TWIC testing contract  and report, an independent contractor\u2019s assessment of TWIC testing, and  TSA\u2019s internal contract planning and oversight guidance. We interviewed  TWIC contractor officials regarding contract requirements, testing results,  and TSA\u2019s planning for and oversight of the testing contract. We also  interviewed officials from the independent contractor that assessed the  TWIC testing to discuss the results of this assessment. Further, we  reviewed the methodology of the independent contractor\u2019s assessment by  examining documents, interviewing contractor officials, and performing  internal analyses to help ensure data reliability.
