In 2004, SEC split its Office of Administrative and Personnel Management into the Office of Administrative Services and the Office of Human Resources (OHR), allowing the agency to separate its administrative and personnel functions and hire an associate executive director to focus on assessing, developing, and implementing human capital programs. In April 2005, SEC created a more structured human capital council by expanding the role of the Executive Resources Board (ERB), now called the Human Capital Review Board (HCRB). The HCRB includes senior management from all major divisions and offices, the Chairman's office, the Executive Director, and OHR and follows a more formalized and regular process for reviewing and approving human capital decisions. According to SEC, as of November 2005, the agency was in the process of creating its first strategic human capital plan, which will be based on the Office of Personnel Management's Human Capital Assessment and Accountability Framework, but it has not set a completion date. GAO also found that many of SEC's efforts related to workforce planning to date have been consistent with five key principles for effective strategic workforce planning; however, some of these efforts were still being developed or could be improved. Specifically: SEC has involved top management and a variety of stakeholders during the development of its strategic human capital plan, but only some employees will have the opportunity to provide feedback before the plan is finalized; SEC has been taking steps to identify needed critical skills and competencies, but it lacks a formal process for identifying existing skills among staff and linking them to SEC's strategic goals; SEC has been using human capital strategies to address workforce needs and skill gaps, but some of these strategies have not been in place long enough to assess results; SEC is developing or changing many of the administrative, educational, and other requirements to support workforce strategies, particularly pertaining to the use of human capital flexibilities; and SEC is developing additional human capital indicators and a more formal process by which to measure the achievement of its human capital goals. However, SEC currently does not formally evaluate the effectiveness of its human capital strategies in fulfilling SEC's strategic goals."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over the past several years, in the wake of corporate failures and  accounting scandals, changes in legislation governing U.S. securities  markets have resulted in increased demands on the Securities and  Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) regulatory capacity. Through the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley), Congress augmented SEC\u2019s  responsibilities but also authorized a substantial budget increase for the  agency to better address workload challenges. In fiscal year 2003, SEC  received $716 million, or a 39 percent increase over its previous year\u2019s  budget authority, and has used much of it to fund more than 842 new staff  positions. In addition, SEC used a portion of the fiscal year 2003  appropriations to fund its new pay parity authority, which allowed the  agency to pay staff commensurate with other federal financial regulators.  In fiscal year 2004, SEC received a 13 percent increase over its previous  year\u2019s budget authority. These increases offered SEC a unique opportunity  to obtain the resources and expertise necessary to meet its mission, but the  transformation will require a rigorous effort to recruit, hire, and retain the  right staff with the right expertise to fulfill agency mission and strategic  goals.", "In formalizing its strategic direction, on July 9, 2004, SEC approved its  2004-2009 strategic plan, which identifies the vision, mission, values, and  goals shaping the agency\u2019s activities during the next 5 years. The fourth  goal of the strategic plan outlines SEC\u2019s commitment to maximize the use  of SEC resources. It further states that in an effort to attract, hire, and  retain the right staff with the expertise necessary to carry out its mission,  the agency plans to use a variety of human capital strategies that will  complement the agency\u2019s other ongoing activities. To respond to your  request to review SEC\u2019s strategic workforce planning, our report discusses  the following: (1) the progress SEC has made toward developing a strategic  human capital plan and (2) whether SEC uses effective strategic workforce  planning practices for acquiring, developing, and retaining staff.", "To address the first objective, we collected information and data from  representatives of SEC\u2019s Offices of the Chairman and Executive Director,  SEC\u2019s Office of Human Resources (OHR), and key divisions and offices on  the agency\u2019s recent workforce planning activities. To gain insights on SEC\u2019s  progress in this area, we also reviewed SEC\u2019s strategic plan, budget  requests, and other relevant documents, and GAO reports. To address the  second objective, we compared SEC\u2019s workforce planning activities with  five key principles for effective strategic workforce planning, which we  developed based on our review of studies by leading workforce planning  organizations and interviews with officials from the Office of Personnel  Management (OPM) and the National Academy of Public Administration.  We identified related tasks for each principle (described in our prior work)  to provide more specific examples of how each principle may be  implemented and we determined whether SEC was undertaking these or  similar tasks. In addition, we interviewed representatives from the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) and OPM to discuss SEC\u2019s activities and  best practices in strategic workforce planning in the federal government.  This report primarily focuses on strategic workforce planning efforts under  the former Chairman, whose resignation was effective June 30, 2005.

In March 2002, we found that SEC  had not reviewed its staffing and resource needs independent of the budget  process and that SEC generally developed its annual budget request based  on the previous year\u2019s appropriation, not on what the agency actually  needed to fulfill its mission. We also commented that SEC was making its  staffing allocation decisions without the benefit of a strategic plan. We  recommended that SEC broaden its strategic planning process to  determine its regulatory priorities and the resources needed to fulfill its  mission, including identifying the staff skills needed to do so.", "In July 2004, we found that although SEC received more flexible pay and  hiring authority, it continued to face challenges filling critical vacancies,  such as for accountants.

Federal agencies have used varying  frameworks for developing and presenting their strategic human capital  plans. More recently, various agencies have begun using OPM\u2019s Human  Capital Assessment and Accountability Framework (HCAAF) as the basis  for preparing such plans. HCAAF, which OPM developed in conjunction  with OMB and us, outlines six standards for success, key questions to  consider, and suggested performance indicators for measuring progress  and results.

The 2003  workforce and work-flow review process required division and office  directors to present justifications for resource requests to the ERB for the  board\u2019s approval. One outcome of the 2003 review was the decision to split  SEC\u2019s Office of Administrative and Personnel Management into two  offices\u2014the Office of Administrative Services and OHR. According to OHR,  the separation of the office\u2019s administrative and personnel functions was  made to improve efficiency and effectiveness in these functions, which was  necessitated by the agency\u2019s growth of approximately 1,000 individuals  after the implementation of Sarbanes-Oxley. In addition, the split created  an opportunity for SEC to hire an Associate Executive Director for OHR,  who is tasked with assessing, developing, and implementing human  resources programs.", "Following the creation of OHR, SEC broadened the role of the  ERB\u2014renamed the HCRB in April 2005\u2014to include a senior executive  review of all human capital issues.

SEC executives said that in an effort  to more proactively regulate the securities industry, they are taking  initiatives to identify emerging risks in securities markets and are working  on creating more coordination among divisions. For example, the recently  created Office of Risk Assessment (ORA) works with various divisions and  offices to develop methodologies to address identified risk. ORA consults  with risk-assessment committees that consist of staff from various  divisions. Committees currently exist for the following areas: (1) full  disclosure, (2) investment management and regulation, and (3) SEC  infrastructure. ORA also uses software in coordination with divisions to  identify how emerging risks have affected SEC\u2019s workload and  responsibilities.

For  example, SEC\u2019s Enforcement staff attorneys were responsible for  collecting disgorgement, as well as investigating potential violations of  securities law. Partly in response to the new Fair Fund provision under  Sarbanes-Oxley, the Division of Enforcement hired attorneys dedicated to  collections, as well as case management specialists, to assist with  maximizing collections and addressing competing priorities and the  growing workload of the Enforcement attorneys. Enforcement also stated  that it is working with technology staff to improve systems, so that  collection information is tracked in one system rather than captured in  multiple systems. Furthermore, the Division of Investment Management is  now conducting integrated disclosure reviews and participates in  cross-divisional task forces, such as the Investor Education and Soft Dollar  task forces, to leverage skills across divisions. In addition, as a result of  using a risk-based approach to more proactively identify and address  compliance risks, OCIE recently gained the approval of the HCRB to create  20 additional staff positions, to be filled by individuals with data analysis  skills to collect surveillance data. SEC is also now responsible for  overseeing investment firms that want to become a consolidated  supervised entity (CSE).

SEC indicated that  selection, or hiring, is a critical tool to meet its changing needs, particularly  following the increase in SEC\u2019s responsibilities under Sarbanes-Oxley. SEC  made several changes to its hiring process to fill accountant positions  within Corporation Finance, which had been a challenging task for the  agency partly due to the slowness of the hiring process and the reluctance  of some candidates to relocate to Washington, D.C. First, SEC retained an  executive recruiting firm to carry out some of the recruitment. Second, to  expedite the hiring process, OHR introduced an automated hiring system to  accelerate the review of applications by automatically disseminating  information on job candidates to Corporation Finance. Third, to  accommodate qualified applicants who might not want to relocate to SEC  headquarters, Corporation Finance instituted a \u201cvirtual workforce\u201d pilot  where several of its employees can work from an alternate site and  physically report to an SEC location on a limited basis. OHR staff indicated  that the pilot phase of the program would be useful in helping managers  learn how to manage off-site employees. However, it is unclear to what  extent the program will be expanded, or whether it will be continued.  Finally, OHR said that category rating will be introduced to the agency  during 2006.", "In addition to exploring ways to improve the hiring processes, SEC also has  tried to more strategically allocate skills and experience when creating or  filling existing vacancies. For example, recognizing the need for more  administrative support for its collection program, the Division of  Enforcement recently filled a number of positions with paralegals and  administrative personnel instead of attorneys. SEC also recognized that as  an agency, it would benefit from the knowledge and skills possessed by  individuals with business degrees. Therefore, as mentioned earlier, SEC  developed a Summer Honors Business Program in 2001 to attract future  MBA graduates to SEC. In September 2005, OHR implemented a 2-year  program where MBA graduates rotate through various SEC divisions as  associates before being permanently placed in a division.", "To increase employee retention, SEC has increased the use of its SLR   program and telework arrangements. SEC began using the SLR program in  the last half of fiscal year 2003 and reported making 384 student loan  repayments totaling approximately $3.3 million in fiscal year 2004. This is  an increase from fiscal year 2003, in which 257 employees received  payments. To receive loan repayment, enrollees agree to work for an  additional 3 years at SEC. According to SEC officials, few employees leave  before the 3-year employment agreement terminates. SEC is also  expanding the use of telework arrangements for its employees, with  approximately 20 percent of its workforce now participating in the  program. As of August 2005, SEC reported having 813 approved  teleworking employees, an increase from March 2005, when it had 648  employees approved for telework. SEC also found that strategic use of  recruitment and retention bonuses for employees with qualifications  critical to SEC\u2019s mission has been an effective way to achieve its hiring  goals and an efficient use of funding.", "In addition, SEC has been expanding its training programs to eliminate  gaps and maximize employee contributions. Training efforts at SEC  previously focused on specific division and office needs, and division  managers told us they have training units within their divisions. With the  development of SEC University, OHR hopes to bring about a cultural  change within the agency and encourage cross-divisional and agencywide  training. Although OHR plans to consolidate various training programs at  SEC through the university, some divisions indicated that they found  in-house training on technical issues performed by division staff critical to  meeting agency goals and felt such training should remain outside the main  training center at SEC. To date, OHR has taken no action to discontinue  training offered within divisions. In September 2005, SEC placed a new  position announcement to hire a person from within SEC who would be  devoted exclusively to directing SEC University. OHR officials expect this  position to be filled by the end of November 2005. As part of the current  SEC University plan, OHR is assessing employee training interests and  relevancy to programmatic functions, and is exploring establishing training  partnerships with government, public and private entities, and five or six  law and business schools.
