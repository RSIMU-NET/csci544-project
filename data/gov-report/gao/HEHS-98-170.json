Following passage of this legislation, concerns have deepened that the card is easily counterfeited and does not prevent individuals from illegally working in the United States due to employers not knowing whether job applicants\u2019 cards are genuine. While a card with certain security features was issued in 1983, the media has since reported instances of thousands of counterfeit Social Security cards being seized. In addition, some congressional members believe that the card\u2019s susceptibility to fraudulent use hurts public confidence in the Social Security program. To enhance the security of the card, some Members of Congress have asked, on several occasions, the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to estimate the cost of issuing a counterfeit-resistant card.", "In 1996, under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, the Congress included a mandate requiring SSA to develop a prototype counterfeit-resistant card made of a durable tamper-resistant material with various security features that could be used in establishing reliable proof of citizenship or legal noncitizenship status.The mandate also required SSA and GAO to estimate and compare the cost of producing and disseminating several types of enhanced cards to all living number holders over 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods. These estimates were to include an evaluation of the cost of imposing a user fee on those who request a replacement of the enhanced card and enhanced cards requested prior to the time individuals were scheduled to receive them. Earlier that year, a Member of Congress asked CBO to estimate the cost of issuing a counterfeit-resistant card, believing an earlier SSA estimate of producing such a card was high.", "CBO estimated that it would cost SSA an additional $512 million over its current card issuance costs to issue an enhanced Social Security card to 172 million people. SSA\u2019s most recent cost estimates of issuing such a card\u2014provided in its Report to Congress on Options for Enhancing the Social Security Card, September 1997\u2014range from $3.9 billion to $9.2 billion, depending on which of seven card options SSA developed was chosen.", "To avoid duplicating SSA\u2019s work, you redirected us to (1) explain differences in CBO\u2019s and SSA\u2019s estimates for replacing the Social Security card, (2) evaluate SSA\u2019s estimates of the cost of issuing a more secure card, and (3) present additional issuance options. To assess the cost estimates, we examined SSA\u2019s and CBO\u2019s basic assumptions; reviewed their methodology for and data supporting their workload and cost estimates; as well as discussed with appropriate staff SSA\u2019s estimates of the reasonableness of the time to perform certain functions such as taking a number holder\u2019s picture to place on the cards. We discussed available card technologies, such as including information on a magnetic stripe or microprocessor chip, and their costs with industry representatives. We also developed alternative card issuance options, which we discussed with knowledgeable officials in federal and state governments, as well as private industry.

For example, federal, state, and local governments require individuals to have a Social Security number to receive certain benefits or services, such as Supplemental Security Income, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and food stamps. Recent legislation provides strong incentives for states to include Social Security numbers on death certificates and drivers\u2019 licenses, and private industry uses them for credit applications and insurance purposes, among other uses. In addition, the card is used to establish an individual\u2019s eligibility to work in the United States. This range of uses has increased the potential for the number to be misused and the card to be counterfeited, causing concern in the Congress, which has, on several occasions, considered directing SSA to issue a more tamper-proof and less easily counterfeited card.", "Originally, SSA assigned a Social Security number to anyone based solely on the applicant\u2019s unverified statements regarding age, identity, and place of birth, and issued everyone a card that contained the person\u2019s name and Social Security number. Over time, SSA strengthened its requirements for assigning numbers and varied the information shown on the cards it issued. Since 1978, SSA has required applicants for original Social Security numbers to provide proof of age, identity, and citizenship or alien status. SSA later began printing legends, noting work restrictions on cards issued to noncitizens. Since 1982, SSA has provided Social Security numbers only to U.S. citizens, noncitizens authorized to work in the United States, and noncitizens with an approved nonwork reason for needing a number. Beginning in 1982, SSA printed \u201cNot Valid for Employment\u201d on cards issued to noncitizens who lacked work authorization but needed cards for nonwork purposes; and since 1992, it printed \u201cValid for Work Only With INS Authorization\u201d on cards issued to noncitizens with temporary work authorization.", "Some Members of Congress have also been concerned about the public\u2019s confidence in the Social Security system in general, and the message it sends to the public when the card is easily counterfeited and illegal uses of an individual\u2019s Social Security number are easily made. In 1983, the Congress sought to combat illegal use of the number by passing legislation requiring SSA to develop its first counterfeit-resistant Social Security card. In response, SSA introduced counterfeit-resistant and tamper proof cards with security features including a blue tint random marbleized pattern, planchettes, and intaglio printing. Members of Congress subsequently expressed disappointment with the new card SSA developed, alleging that its security features did not make it significantly more difficult to counterfeit and that employers could not easily determine its authenticity for work authorization purposes.

Applicants 18 or over are required to have an in-person interview and explain why they never obtained a Social Security number before. The Enumeration at Birth program allows parents to obtain a Social Security number for newborn babies through the hospital during the birth registration process. Applicant information is transmitted through the state to SSA, and a Social Security number and card are issued.", "When an individual\u2019s card is lost or mutilated or the individual reports changes to information contained in SSA\u2019s records (such as a legal name change after marriage), SSA issues a replacement card. However, unlike the process for issuing original cards, SSA does not verify the citizenship of individuals who indicate to SSA that they were born in the United States, as long as the information they previously provided to SSA supports their assertion. As a result, the process for issuing replacement cards does not provide for the cards to be reliable proof of the number holder\u2019s entitlement to work in the United States. To receive a replacement card, an individual completes an application for a Social Security number and provides proof of identity, such as a drivers\u2019 license, government or state identification, or school records. If, however, an individual is foreign-born and has not become a naturalized U.S. citizen, additional documents must be shown. These applicants must provide evidence of current lawful alien status and either INS work authorization or a valid nonwork reason for needing a number.", "SSA has issued new versions of Social Security cards while allowing existing cards to remain valid. As a result, current number holders may conceivably have one of 47 valid versions of the card that SSA has issued since the inception of the program. For example, cards issued before 1982 to noncitizens without work authorization do not contain legends indicating their lack of work authorization. The 40 versions of cards issued before 1983 lack counterfeit-resistant and tamper-proof security features.

While not labor intensive, handling Social Security number applications constitutes the largest volume of transactions for field offices. In fiscal year 1996, it cost SSA about $200 million to issue about 6 million original and 10 million replacement cards.

The documents are provided by the prospective employees, and the law allows them discretion as to which of numerous approved documents they provide to employers. However, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 required a reduction in the types of documents individuals can use to prove their identity and eligibility to work and gave the Department of Justice (DOJ) the authority to set conditions for implementing the reduction.

However, DOJ proposes to eliminate birth certificates from among the list of approved work eligibility documents.

This included $2.8 billion for processing the card and an additional $2.5 billion to include pictures or capture fingerprints on the cards. However, SSA\u2019s estimates were much higher than some in the Congress anticipated they would be; so in 1996, a Member of Congress asked CBO for an independent estimate to coincide with proposed legislation making the Social Security card the primary work authorization document. In its 1996 informal staff-level estimate, CBO said it would cost SSA about $512 million to issue an enhanced card.", "These CBO and SSA estimates were so different that the Congress mandated SSA to develop a new estimate as part of the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. The Congress also required GAO to develop its own estimate to compare with SSA\u2019s. Our analysis of the CBO and SSA estimates shows that they are the result of very different assumptions, including the size of the population to whom the proposed card would be issued and consideration of ongoing card-processing costs. These differences make it difficult to compare the estimates. CBO\u2019s estimate, for example, was for a single card option with security features similar to a drivers\u2019 license, while SSA\u2019s most recent and most comprehensive estimate considered seven different card options in response to the 1996 congressional mandate.", "In addition, CBO\u2019s and SSA\u2019s estimates were based on significantly different numbers of enhanced cards to be issued. CBO estimated the cost of issuing an enhanced card to 172 million number holders. These number holders consisted of 136 million people who CBO estimated would normally request original and replacement cards over an 8-year period, plus an additional 36 million people who it estimated would request the enhanced card. SSA, on the other hand, was mandated to estimate the cost of developing and issuing an enhanced card to all current number holders, which it estimated at 277 million.

CBO also did not include other pertinent card and processing costs for the 172 million number holders included in its estimate. For example, CBO did not include the personnel costs associated with SSA employees taking pictures for the new card for all 172 million cards. SSA currently estimates this cost at $1.00 per card. For roughly 85 million individuals who have not previously proven their work eligibility status, CBO did not include costs for time necessary to review original documentation.

For 36 million individuals, CBO did not include the cost of producing the card itself (CBO estimates this cost at $1.50 per card) and underestimated the average processing costs for these cards.

SSA refined its methodology for estimating the cost to issue a new Social Security card in its 1997 estimates. The estimates include the cost of producing the card; the cost of equipment; the postal cost of notifying number holders that they must apply for a new card; and the cost, where necessary, to establish the number holder\u2019s work eligibility status.

However, the estimates also appear to overstate some implementation costs and not fully consider others.", "In response to the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 mandate, SSA developed cost estimates for seven different card technologies, as shown in table 1.", "Several assumptions regarding how cards would be reissued also have a significant effect on SSA\u2019s estimates. Since the agency was mandated to estimate the cost of providing the enhanced card to all living number holders, SSA assumed that all such individuals would have to complete a Social Security card application, as they do in its current card issuance and reissuance process. Using both Census Bureau data and its analysis of its own records of numbers issued since the beginning of the program in 1935, SSA estimated that there are 277 million living number holders. This number appears reasonable based on our analysis of SSA\u2019s estimate and review of Census Bureau-based projection data. SSA further assumed that out of the total number of number holders, it would add the verification of citizenship for about 190 million individuals who would need to provide to SSA proof of their work eligibility status. SSA field offices would review applications and documents establishing the number holders\u2019 identity; verify their citizenship status, as appropriate; and take pictures, capture fingerprints, or both, if required for the new card. For the remaining 87 million people, SSA would only need to take new applications, establish identity, and take individuals\u2019 pictures because SSA has already documented their citizenship status. SSA proposed mailing at least two correspondences to inform number holders of the reissuance and request that they contact the agency. SSA estimates that this effort will require a total expenditure of up to 73,000 work years, or about 7,000 to 24,000 work years annually, depending on the issuance period and option selected.

He told us that without detailed specifications, it would be difficult to be more precise but noted that card volume is the major factor in any card cost estimate. On the basis of these statements, it would appear that SSA\u2019s estimate of card and personalization costs are reasonable.

SSA based its equipment estimates, in large part, on those provided by its contractor, a large producer of card manufacturing equipment, as well as estimates by state and local government operations participating in its survey on the amount of time necessary to take a picture. Officials from Schlumberger Malco stated that because there are so many equipment variations, it is difficult to give specific equipment estimates without exact equipment specifications, but a large application such as SSA\u2019s would keep prices low; moreover, equipment costs tend to decline as new technology is introduced.

However, based on our analysis of the equipment capacity, it appears that fewer than four installations would be necessary to handle projected workloads. In addition, SSA could reasonably expect equipment demand to be lower for an extended issuance over 5 or 10 years, thereby reducing the need for four equipment installations per office, if those options were chosen.

SSA proposed customizing the correspondences in the case of individuals who have previously proven their citizenship status in SSA records to reflect that only proof of identity would be needed. SSA did not include in its estimate the additional costs for preparing the customized correspondence or for handling phone calls and walk-in traffic in response to the correspondences.

This estimate is based on cost and workload data associated with SSA\u2019s current process for issuing or reissuing cards. SSA used fiscal year 1996 workload counts and costs from its cost analysis system for Social Security number related activities to estimate that it would take about 27 minutes each for processing applications at its 1,300 field offices. To this, it applied an average cost of about $.43 per minute, which included the salary for affected employees plus other indirect costs. This results in a unit cost of $11.70 for processing each application. (See app. V.)

In our discussions with members of congressional staffs involved in drafting the mandate, they said they agree with our interpretation and never intended for everyone who receives the new card to be charged a user fee.", "However, SSA opposes charging for any cards because participation in the program is generally mandatory and it fears charges for cards could lead individuals not to report important changes, such as name changes due to marriage. This would in turn cause recordkeeping problems for the agency and potentially inaccurate records for number holders. Yet SSA acknowledges in its report that the fee could be waived under some circumstances, such as in the case of a name change due to marriage, to encourage individuals to report such changes and enable SSA to keep its records current. This may also be true for hardship reasons for individuals who cannot afford to pay for the replacement card. In addition, SSA also fails to recognize in its report that the costs of collecting the user fee would be offset to some extent by the fees paid. Consequently, the cost to SSA of collecting a user fee should be much less than the $1.3 billion SSA estimated.", "SSA\u2019s estimate of the cost for handling user fees was based on a unit cost of $4.60 per card, which it derived from its estimates of the amount of time necessary for handling three alternative forms of payment from all 277 million number holders. SSA reported that it based its estimates on its experience in receiving remittances in its field offices, primarily recipients\u2019 repayments of overpaid benefits. However, it does not track workload and cost data for handling these payments, and SSA officials told us that the agency has no measurement system for determining, and has not conducted studies of, how long it takes field offices and processing centers to handle these payments. Consequently, we cannot determine whether SSA\u2019s unit cost is reasonable or not. To handle the collection of user fees, SSA said it would redesign the current process used by its field offices for handling remittances to accommodate the substantially higher volume of payments for the new card. SSA stated that it would liberalize existing procedures that only allow individuals to make cash or check payments at field offices by providing them with the option of being billed and mailing payments to SSA processing centers or paying by credit card at field offices.", "SSA\u2019s per card cost is the average unit cost for field offices and processing centers to handle payments based on SSA\u2019s assumptions about the rate applicants would select among three payment methods\u2014pay cash or charge at an SSA facility or be billed and pay by mail. SSA assumes that of these options\u2014each of which has a different cost to SSA\u2014one-half of the applicants would elect to be billed by mail at a cost of $4.09 each, one-fourth would opt to pay at a field office by credit card at $1.71 each, and one-fourth would opt to pay at a field office by cash or check at $8.45 each. To the extent the percentage of applicants who select payment methods vary from those assumed by SSA, the average cost of handling payments will also change.

Consequently, it may be more effective to meet the goals of the mandate by issuing new cards only to those who may be seeking new jobs or changing jobs. A new legislative requirement could be written to require that all those seeking employment would have to show the enhanced Social Security card for identification and work authorization purposes.", "This alternative maximizes control over illegal workers and reduces the impact on SSA resources. It could potentially reduce the number of new cards SSA has to issue and remove the need for SSA to locate and contact number holders in order to issue new cards\u2014because individuals would be responsible for obtaining a new card. Public confidence in the system would also be addressed for a significant portion of the population since all individuals entering the workforce and changing jobs would be required to get the new card. For those who do not get the new card, they would know that the Social Security system was protected from those who were not entitled to work.", "Under this alternative, the number of individuals who would require a card would be much smaller than for a mass reissuance. Based on BLS data, in February 1996, there were 110 million employed wage and salary workers age 16 and over and an additional 7.9 million unemployed individuals. However, BLS data do not capture individuals not currently in the workforce who could obtain employment in the future. In addition, SSA could be unable to control the flow of applications for an enhanced card. Many people may choose to apply for an enhanced card to avoid having to wait until they are seeking employment or changing jobs.

SSA currently spends only about $200 million yearly enumerating 6 million people and replacing 10 million cards. The added costs of this alternative would be those associated with enhancing the card (card cost and required equipment), any additional processing time required for taking pictures or capturing biometric information, and the time necessary to verify citizenship status for those whose status has not previously been verified. It is possible, however, that legislation to consolidate the number of acceptable work eligibility documents and an individual\u2019s desire to have the new card will increase the number of requests for replacement cards that SSA is currently experiencing. But the overall cost savings from prospective issuance of the new card would be substantial. Although this option would be less costly to SSA, it would allow the current work authorization problem to continue until all current number holders either voluntarily replace their cards or stop working.

This approach could save significant SSA resources, and could make the reissuance of an enhanced Social Security card unnecessary. States already issue to residents drivers\u2019 licenses and state identification cards, which are renewed every few years. According to the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA), an organization that helps establish uniform licensing standards and practices for state Motor Vehicle Administrations (MVA), most people already have drivers\u2019 licenses or state identification cards. All licenses include the individual\u2019s picture, have various security features, and are already widely accepted as identification documents. Currently, 40 states use digital pictures as a security feature on their licenses. This digital technology allows an individual\u2019s image to be viewed electronically from a database in order to help ensure the proper identification of an individual whose license has been lost or stolen.", "This alternative, however, would impose a significant burden on state MVAs, because they would have to review original documents to prove an individual\u2019s citizenship or alien status and indicate their status on drivers\u2019 licenses. States would have the same difficulty SSA would have in securing original documentation from older and foreign-born individuals to support their claim of citizenship and work eligibility in order to certify their work status. In addition, state MVA workloads would increase because individuals who do not currently have a license or identification card may need one for work purposes.", "While AAMVA believes that states would strongly oppose this alternative because of the additional burden it would place on their already limited resources, recent legislation provides strong incentives for states to include Social Security numbers on drivers\u2019 licenses. Doing so would likely help eliminate some of the burden on state MVAs because SSA may be able to provide citizenship information to the states for up to 87 million number holders whose work eligibility status SSA has already established. While this alternative would address the worker eligibility verification aspect of the mandate, it would do little to increase public confidence in the Social Security system, since no enhanced Social Security card issuance is involved."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["SSA\u2019s estimate of the cost for issuing new Social Security cards meets the literal interpretation of the mandate, but alternatives exist to the high costs of replacing every card. SSA estimates that it would cost $3.9 to $9.2 billion for the new card, depending on which of seven alternative technologies is chosen. These costs are so high because SSA was mandated to estimate the costs of reissuing a new card to all 277 million number holders. Moreover, most of the costs, $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion, represent the personnel costs for retaking applications, establishing work eligibility status, and taking a picture or capturing a fingerprint, if applicable. Therefore, regardless of the material the new card is made from and the technologies built in to increase its security, a complete reissuance of cards is very expensive.", "Given the high estimated cost of issuing cards to all current number holders, we believe that there are alternatives, such as using less costly technology, limiting the universe of number holders who will be required to have the new card, and extending the time period over which the new card will be disseminated. If the primary goal is to control work authorization, there is little need for a new enhanced card for those not seeking or changing jobs, particularly the very young and very old. Ultimately, the costs associated with meeting the congressional goals of work eligibility verification and public confidence in the Social Security system will be dependent on a congressional decision as to the specific role of a new Social Security card."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["SSA informed us that it would not provide formal comments on this report.
