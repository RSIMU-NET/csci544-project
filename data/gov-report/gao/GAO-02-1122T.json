Both the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the  House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence have, in their joint  inquiry, helped to illuminate many issues from which lessons can be drawn  to improve how our intelligence community and other homeland security  stakeholders share, analyze, integrate and disseminate important  information, both at home and overseas.", "Today, governments at all levels, as well as private sector entities,  recognize that they have a greater role to play in protecting the nation from  terrorist attacks.  To achieve this collective goal, homeland security  stakeholders must more effectively work together to strengthen the  process by which critical information can be shared, analyzed, integrated  and disseminated to help prevent or minimize terrorist activities.  The work  of these committees and of others in Congress and the Administration in  crafting solutions to leverage agencies\u2019 abilities and willingness to share  timely, useful information is critical to the fundamental transformation  required in our homeland security community to ensure an affordable,  sustainable and broad-based response to new and emerging threats to our  country.", "In your request that GAO provide a statement for the record, you asked us  to focus on the information sharing activities of the intelligence, law  enforcement, and other agencies involved in homeland security, as well as  the role of state and local governments and the private sector.  You also  requested that we provide a description and status of the principal  recommendations we have made related to combating terrorism.", "We have developed an extensive body of work on combating terrorism over  the years and more recently we have issued a number of reports on  homeland security.  Based on GAO\u2019s Strategic Plan issued in January 2000,  which included a new emphasis on addressing key emerging threats to  national security in a post-Cold War environment, GAO issued many  reports prior to September 11th on combating terrorism and related  matters.  At the request of Congress, or on our own initiative, we currently  have more than 80 engagements under way to examine a variety of  homeland security issues.  Our ongoing work includes evaluations of  information sharing activities in homeland security, including reviews of  airport and transportation security, seaport security and law enforcement  agencies.  However, as the committees are aware, GAO\u2019s work in evaluating  the activities of the intelligence community historically has been limited,  due in part to limitations imposed by the intelligence agencies and the  small number of requests made by Congress.  My statement today reflects  this limitation on evaluations of the intelligence community and focuses  more broadly on information sharing among various homeland security  stakeholders.", "In my testimony today, I will discuss (1) some of the challenges to effective  information sharing, including the fragmentation of information analysis  responsibilities, and technology and collaboration challenges, and  (2) GAO\u2019s views on addressing these challenges through transformational  strategies, including strengthening the risk management framework;  refining the national strategy, policy, and guidance structures to emphasize  collaboration and integration among homeland security stakeholders to  achieve common goals; and bolstering the fundamental management  foundation integral to effective public sector performance and  accountability.

In  recent years, GAO has made numerous recommendations related to  changes necessary for improving the government\u2019s response to combating  terrorism.  Prior to the establishment of the Office of Homeland Security  (OHS), GAO found that the federal government lacked overall homeland  security leadership and management accountable to both the President and  Congress.  GAO has also stated that fragmentation exists in both  coordination of domestic preparedness programs and in efforts to develop  a national strategy.", "GAO believes that the consolidation of some homeland security functions  makes sense and will, if properly organized and implemented, over time  lead to more efficient, effective, and coordinated programs, better  information sharing, and a more robust protection of our people, borders,  and critical infrastructure.  At the same time, even the proposed  Department of Homeland Security (DHS), will still be just one of many  players with important roles and responsibilities for ensuring homeland  security.   In addition, the creation of DHS will not be a panacea.  It will  create certain new costs and risks, which must be addressed.", "As it is with so many other homeland security areas, it is also the case for  intelligence and information sharing that there are many stakeholders who  must work together to achieve common goals.  Effective analysis,  integration, and dissemination of intelligence and other information critical  to homeland security requires the involvement of the Central Intelligence  Agency (CIA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the National Security  Council (NSC), the National Security Agency (NSA), the Department of  Defense (DOD), and a myriad of other agencies, and will also include the  proposed DHS.   State and local governments and the private sector also  have critical roles to play \u2013 as do significant portions of the international  community.  Information is already being shared between and among  numerous government and private sector organizations and more can be  done to facilitate even greater sharing, analyzing, integrating, and  disseminating of information.", "We have observed fragmentation of information analysis and sharing  functions potentially requiring better coordination in many homeland  security areas.  For example, in a recent report on critical infrastructure  protection (CIP), we indicated that some 14 different agencies or  components had responsibility for analysis and warning activities for cyber  CIP.  Our recent testimony on aviation security indicated that the  Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), FBI and the Department of  State all need the capacity to identify aliens in the United States who are in  violation of their visa status, have broken U.S. laws, or are under  investigation for criminal activity, including terrorism. GAO has also noted  that information sharing coordination difficulties can occur within single  departments, such as those addressed in our July 2001 review of FBI  intelligence investigations and coordination within the Department of  Justice.  Procedures established by the Attorney General in 1995 required,  in part, that the FBI notify the Criminal Division and the Office of  Intelligence Policy and Review whenever a foreign counterintelligence  investigation utilizing authorized surveillance and searches develops  \u201c\u2026facts or circumstances\u2026that reasonably indicate that a significant  federal crime has been, is being, or may be committed\u2026.\u201d However,  according to Criminal Division officials, required notifications did not  always occur and often, when they did, were not timely.  The Attorney  General and the FBI issued additional procedures to address the  coordination concerns and ensure compliance, but these efforts have not  been institutionalized."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Technological Impediments", "paragraphs": ["This country has tremendous resources at its disposal, including leading  edge technologies, a superior research and development base, extensive  expertise, and significant human capital resources.  However, there are  substantial challenges in leveraging these tools and using them effectively  to ensure that timely, useful information is appropriately disseminated to  prevent or minimize terrorist attacks.  One challenge is determining and  implementing the right format and standards for collecting data so that  disparate agencies can aggregate and integrate data sets.  For example,  Extensible Markup Language (XML) standards are one option for  exchanging information among disparate systems.  Further, guidelines and  procedures need to be specified to establish effective data collection  processes, and mechanisms need to be put in place to make sure that this  happens \u2013 again, a difficult task, given the large number of government,  private, and other organizations that will be involved in data collection.   Mechanisms will be needed to disseminate data, making sure that it gets  into the hands of the right people at the right time.  It will be equally  important to disaggregate information in order to build baselines  (normative models) of activity for detecting anomalies that would indicate  the nature and seriousness of particular vulnerabilities.  Additionally, there  is a lack of connectivity between databases and technologies important to  the homeland security effort.  Databases belonging to federal law  enforcements agencies, for example, are frequently not connected, nor are  the databases of the federal, state, and local governments.  In fact, we have  reported for years on federal information systems that are duplicative and  not well integrated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ineffective Collaboration", "paragraphs": ["Ineffective collaboration among homeland security stakeholders remains  one of the principal impediments to integrating and sharing information in  order to prevent and minimize terrorist attacks.  The committees\u2019 joint  inquiry staff\u2019s initial report detailing numerous examples of strategic  information known by the intelligence community prior to September 11th  highlights the need to better ensure effective integration, collaboration, and  dissemination of critical material.  The joint inquiry staff\u2019s report focuses  on the national intelligence community, but its implications are clearly  evident for all homeland security stakeholders \u2013 government at all levels,  as well as the private sector, must work closely together to analyze,  integrate, and appropriately disseminate all useful information to the  relevant stakeholders in order to combat terrorism and make the nation  more secure.", "GAO recognizes that this goal is easier to articulate than achieve and that  some long-standing obstacles to improving information sharing between  and among stakeholders at all levels will require significant changes in  organizational cultures, shifts in patterns of access to and limitations on  information, and improved processes to facilitate communication and  interaction.", "GAO\u2019s ongoing work illuminates some of the issues.  For instance, officials  from the Department of Justice, FBI, and the Office of the Secretary of  Defense indicated that the vast majority of information\u2014about 90  percent\u2014is already publicly available, and that only about 10 percent of the  information is classified, sensitive, or otherwise restricted.  The officials  said that the expectation for all homeland security participants to obtain  actionable information (actionable intelligence is information that is  specific enough to tell who, what, where, and when an attack will take  place) is unrealistic because, in most cases, the data do not exist or cannot  be recognized as actionable.  These officials also said that they do share  actionable information with appropriate entities, but must also balance the  release of the information against the possibility of disclosures that may  reveal the sources and methods used to collect the information.", "Non federal officials tend to echo these concerns.  Since September 11th,  GAO has met with representatives of various state and local organizations  and conducted dozens of case studies of transit authorities, port  authorities, and pipeline safety commissions and others entities, as well as  testified before and heard testimonies from federal, state, and local  officials at 11 congressional field hearings around the country.  State and  local officials continue to be frustrated by difficulties in the communication  and sharing of threat information among all levels of government.  Some of  the problems they cited include: limited access to information because of  security clearance issues, the absence of a systematic top-down and  bottom-up information exchange, and uncertainties regarding the  appropriate response to a heightened alert from the new homeland security  advisory system.  It is clear that sharing, analyzing, integrating, and  disseminating information needs to occur both in and between all levels of  government -- and throughout organizations both vertically and  horizontally.", "A number of steps have been taken to address these issues, but clearly  more needs to be done.  Following the terrorist attacks of September 11th, a  review by the Department of Justice found that America\u2019s ability to detect  and prevent terrorism has been undermined significantly by restrictions  that limit the intelligence and law enforcement communities\u2019 access to, and  sharing of, information.   The USA Patriot Act, enacted shortly after the  terrorist attacks, was designed to address this problem through enhanced  information sharing and updating information-gathering tools.  The Patriot  Act gives federal law enforcement agencies greater freedom to share  information and to coordinate their efforts in the war on terrorism.   Methods to use this authority are now being established and implemented,  but the effectiveness of these changes will need to be evaluated.", "Moreover, the private sector has a critical role in reducing our vulnerability  from terrorists.  The national strategy for homeland security states:   \u201cGovernment at the federal, state, and local level must actively collaborate  and partner with the private sector, which controls 85 percent of America\u2019s  infrastructure.\u201d   The strategy further states that the government at all  levels must enable the private sector\u2019s ability to carry out its protection  responsibilities through effective partnerships and designates the proposed  DHS as the primary contact for coordination at the federal level.", "Recently, the President\u2019s Critical Infrastructure Protection Board issued a  strategy recognizing that all Americans have a role to play in cyber security,  and identifies the market mechanisms for stimulating sustained actions to  secure cyberspace.   The strategy recommends that the federal  government identify and remove barriers to public-private information  sharing and promote the timely two-way exchange of data to promote  increased cyberspace security.  Although industry groups already exchange  security data, confidentiality concerns over the release of information may  limit private sector participation.  For example, the technology industry has  said that any security information shared with the government should be  exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, which  provides that any person has the right to request access to federal agency  records or information.", "GAO has also reported on how public-private information sharing practices  can benefit CIP.  In a report issued last October, GAO cited a number of  important practices, including:  establishing trust relationships with a wide variety of federal and  nonfederal entities that may be in a position to provide potentially  useful information and advice on vulnerabilities and incidents;  developing standards and agreements on how information will be used   establishing effective and appropriately secure communications   taking steps to ensure that sensitive information is not inappropriately  disseminated, which may require statutory change.", "Clearly, these practices are applicable to intelligence and information  sharing in the broadest sense\u2014and for stakeholders.

Such an assessment, which  needs to be integrated at all levels within the homeland security  community, is necessary to better protect the nation\u2019s people, borders, and  property.  As your committees\u2019 work indicates, threats are many, and  sources are numerous.", "A comprehensive assessment can help the nation to better understand and  manage the risks associated with terrorism.  Moreover, a comprehensive  risk and threat assessment is critical to setting priorities and allocating  resources.  There is no such thing as zero risk and, therefore, hard choices  must be made given our limited resources over the coming years.", "Previously, GAO observed that the federal government has not effectively  planned and implemented risk assessment and management efforts.  We  noted in testimony before Congress last October that individual federal  agencies have efforts under way, but the results to date have been  inconclusive.  In the past, we have recommended that the FBI and the  DOD enhance their efforts to complete threat and vulnerability  assessments and to work with state and local governments in order to  provide comprehensive approaches.  Although some of this work was  accomplished, delays resulting from the September 11th attacks have  prevented their completion.  Nevertheless, assessments can help in efforts  to pinpoint risks and reallocate resources: For example, after September  11th the Coast Guard conducted initial risk assessments of the nation\u2019s  ports. The Coast Guard identified high-risk infrastructure and facilities  within specific areas of operation, which helped it to determine how to  deploy resources to better ensure harbor security.", "The Administration clearly recognizes the importance of such assessments.   The national homeland security strategy points out that vulnerability  assessments must be an integral part of the intelligence cycle for homeland  security activities.  They would allow planners to project the consequences  of possible terrorist attacks against specific facilities or different sectors of  the economy or government.  The strategy also states the U.S. government  does not now perform comprehensive vulnerability assessments of all the  nation\u2019s critical infrastructure and key assets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Integration of Strategic and Policy Framework Needed", "paragraphs": ["GAO has long advocated the development and implementation of a national  strategy to integrate and manage homeland security functions.   The  national strategy for homeland security released by the Administration last  summer recognizes information sharing and systems as key factors cutting  across all mission areas in linking and more effectively using the nation\u2019s  information systems to better support homeland security.  The issuance of  this strategy is a very important step. Moreover, information systems and  processes will need to be better integrated to support the goals established  by the strategy.", "In our current world, we can no longer think of information sharing,  analysis, integration, and dissemination in terms of just the traditional  intelligence community.  Today, a broader network for information sharing  includes the traditional intelligence community, U.S. allies, other federal  agencies, state and local governments, and the private sector.  To optimize  such a network, it is important to have a strong, strategic planning  framework and a supporting policy structure.", "In addition, the national strategy identified one key homeland security  mission area as intelligence and warning to detect and prevent terrorist  actions.  The intent is to provide timely and useful actionable information  based on the review and analysis of homeland security information.  The  national strategy describes a number of initiatives to better develop  opportunities for leveraging information sharing among homeland security  stakeholders, including:  Integrate information sharing across the federal government.  This  initiative addresses coordinating the sharing of essential homeland  security information, including the design and implementation of an  interagency information architecture to support efforts to find, track,  and respond to terrorist threats.  This effort is among the  Administration\u2019s budget priorities for fiscal year 2004.", "Integrate information sharing across state and local governments,  private industry, and citizens.  This initiative describes efforts to  disseminate information from the federal government to state and local  homeland security officials.  One effort, to allow the exchange of  information on federal and state government Web sites, has been  completed.", "Adopt common \u201cmeta-data\u201d standards for electronic information  relevant to homeland security.  This initiative is intended to integrate  terrorist-related information from government databases and allow the  use of \u201cdata mining\u201d tools for homeland security.  This effort is under  way.", "Improve public safety emergency communications.  This initiative is  intended to develop comprehensive emergency communications  systems that can disseminate information about vulnerabilities and  protective measures and help manage incidents.  State and local  governments often report that there are deficiencies in their  communications capabilities, including the lack of interoperable  systems.  Such systems are necessary between and among all levels of  government.  This effort is planned, but no timeline is indicated.", "Ensure reliable public health information.  The last initiative is intended  to address reliable communication between medical, veterinary, and  public health organizations.  It is under way.", "While these initiatives provide a starting point for improved information  sharing, their effective and timely implementation is not assured.  A  commitment to achieve these objectives must be emphasized.   Implementation will require integration, coordination, and collaboration  between organizations both within and outside the federal government.    Further, the initiatives tend to rely on the creation of DHS for their  complete implementation, a department that will require a considerable  transition period to reach full potential.    Improvements in efficiency and  effectiveness are expected in the long term, but there will be additional  costs and challenges, as the new department faces tremendous  communications, human capital, information technology, and other  integration, challenges.", "Moreover, it is also important to note that the national strategy for  homeland security is one of several national strategies that address general  and specific security and terrorism related issues.  In addition to the  homeland security strategy, the Administration recently released a national  security strategy.  The Administration has stated that the national security  strategy could, in conjunction with the homeland security strategy, be  viewed as an overarching framework.  There are also requirements for  several other strategies that cover specific aspects of national and  homeland security.  These include the National Strategy for Combating  Terrorism, National Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction,  National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace, National Money Laundering  Strategy, National Defense Strategy, and National Drug Control Strategy.   These strategies reflect important elements supporting national and  homeland security.", "In is important that clear linkages be established among the various  strategies to ensure common purpose within an overarching framework in  order to clearly define specific roles, responsibilities, and resource  priorities.  An overarching, integrated framework can help to sort out  issues of potential duplication, overlap, and conflict \u2013 not only for the  federal government, but for all key stakeholders.  While the individual plans  will articulate roles and responsibilities, as well as set goals, objectives and  priorities for their areas, effective integration is necessary to ensure that  initiatives are undertaken that complement, not conflict with, each other.", "Further, integration would allow for the better utilization of resources.   Given the many challenges we face, we do not have the resources do  everything and must make some hard choices.", "Finally, a comprehensive, integrated strategic framework requires a review  of the policies and processes that currently guide sharing, analysis,  integration, and dissemination of intelligence and other critical information  to homeland security stakeholders.  Indeed, the policy structure currently  in place is principally the product of a Cold War environment, in which  threats to the United States occurred mainly on foreign soil.  New and  emerging threats clearly demonstrate that terrorist acts can \u2013 and will \u2013  impact America at home.  The changing nature of the threats present an  opportunity for the homeland security community to revisit the legal and  policy structure to ensure that it effectively creates an environment for the  type of broad-based information sharing needed to protect America at  home.  It is not just the intelligence community, or the federal government,  that have roles, as well as needs, in this evolving environment.  Information  can be collected by many sources and analyzed to identify potential  threats. This information must be disseminated to all relevant parties \u2013  whether it is to a federal agency or another level of government.   The  volume and sources of threats, as your committees have reported, present  new and serious challenges to our ability to analyze and integrate  information into meaningful threat assessments.  Not least, this will require  attention to government\u2019s capacity to handle the increased volume of  information.", "Our policy structures need to adapt to these challenges. In fact, the  government has recently implemented several measures that promote the  sharing of information between all levels of government.  For example, the  USA Patriot Act provides for greater sharing of intelligence information  among federal agencies.  The FBI has also implemented several initiatives  that would increase information sharing between all levels of government,  including increasing the number of its Joint Terrorism Task Forces, to be  located at each of its 56 field offices; and establishing the Terrorism Watch  List to serve as its single, integrated list of individuals of investigative  interest.  The FBI plans to make the list accessible throughout the law  enforcement and intelligence communities.", "All of these are recent changes, of course, and will take time to fully  implement.

GAO stands ready to assist the Congress in these efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Management Success Factors", "paragraphs": ["As the recent proposals to create DHS indicate, the terrorist events of last  fall have provided an impetus for the government to look at the larger  picture of how it provides homeland security and how it can best  accomplish associated missions \u2013 both now and over the long term.  This  imperative is particularly clear for the homeland security community,  where information sharing and collaboration issues remain a challenge.  In  this environment, there exists a very real need and possibly a unique  opportunity to rethink approaches and priorities to enable the homeland  security community to better target its resources to address the most  urgent needs.  In some cases, the new emphasis on homeland security has  prompted attention to long-standing problems that have suddenly become  more pressing.  In other cases, it will be equally important for organizations  to focus on the fundamental building blocks necessary for effective public  sector performance and accountability \u2013 foundations that readily apply to  the homeland security community.", "In recent months, we have testified about the long-term implementation  challenges that the homeland security community faces \u2013 not only in  ensuring an effective transition to a consolidated DHS, but in strengthening  the relationships among and between all stakeholders to facilitate  transformational change that can be sustained in years to come.  There are  many tools that organizations involved in homeland security might  consider to drive necessary changes for better collaboration and  integration of information sharing activities.  One such tool is the Chief  Operating Officer (COO) concept.  Strategic positioning of COOs can  provide a central point to elevate attention on management issues and  transformational change, to integrate various key management functions  and responsibilities, and to institutionalize accountability for management  issues and leading change.", "Despite some assertions to the contrary, there is no meaningful distinction  between the intelligence community, other homeland security  organizations, or even other public sector agencies when it comes to  creating an environment where strong leadership and accountability for  results drives a transformational culture.  Over the years, GAO has made  observations and recommendations about many success factors required  for public sector effectiveness, based on effective management of people,  technology, financial, and other issues, especially in its biannual  Performance and Accountability Series on major government  departments.

Meaningful understanding of inter- and intra-agency information  sharing (intelligence or otherwise) necessitates the development of models  depicting both how this occurs today and how this should occur tomorrow  to optimize mission performance.  Such modeling is referred to as  developing and implementing enterprise architectures, which in the  simplest of terms can be described as blueprints (both business and  technology) for transforming how an organization operates.  Included in  these architectures are information models defining, among other things,  what information is needed and used by whom, where, when, and in what  form.  Without having such an architectural context within which to view  the entity in question, a meaningful understanding of the strengths and  weaknesses of information sharing is virtually impossible.", "Currently, such an understanding within the homeland security arena does  not exist.

Serious human capital shortfalls are eroding the capacity of  many agencies, and threatening the ability of others to economically,  efficiently, and effectively perform their missions.

Yet, as GAO has testified previously, our ability to be  fully effective in our oversight role of homeland security, including the  intelligence community, is at times limited.  Historically, the FBI, CIA, NSA,  and others have limited our access to information, and Congress\u2019s request  for evaluations of the CIA have been minimal.  Given both the increasing  importance of information sharing in preventing terrorism and the  increased investment of resources to strengthen homeland security, it  seems prudent that constructive oversight of critical intelligence and  information sharing operations by the legislative branch be focused on the  implementation of a long term transformation program and to foster  information sharing in the homeland security community.", "In summary, I have discussed the challenges and approaches to improving  information sharing among homeland security organizations, as well as the  overall management issues that they face along with other public sector  organizations.

Specifically, these clarifications included defining  \u201csignificant federal crime\u201d to mean any federal felony and defining  the term \u201creasonable indication\u201d to be substantially lower than  \u201cprobable cause.\u201d The memorandum also requires notification to  take place without delay. The only remaining open point, albeit a  significant issue, is the type of advice that the Criminal Division is  permitted to provide the FBI after it has been notified of a possible  criminal violation. In this regard, in March 2002, the Attorney  General signed revised proposed procedures for sharing and  coordinating FISA investigations, including changes resulting from  the USA Patriot Act of 2001. However, the procedures must be  approved by the FISA Court, which recently rejected some of the  them as going too far in terms of loosening the barriers between  criminal investigations and intelligence gathering.", "To improve coordination between the FBI and the Criminal Division  by ensuring that investigations that indicate criminal violations are  clearly identified and by institutionalizing mechanisms to ensure  greater coordination, we recommend that the Attorney General  direct that all FBI memorandums sent to OIPR, summarizing  investigations or seeking FISA renewals contain a section devoted  explicitly to identifying any possible federal criminal violation  meeting the Attorney General\u2019s coordination criteria, and that those  memorandums of investigation meeting the criteria for Criminal  Division notification be timely coordinated with the division.", "Implemented. In an August 6, 2001, memorandum, the Deputy  Attorney General directed the FBI to explicitly devote a section in its  foreign counterintelligence case summary memorandums, which it  sends to OIPR in connection with an initial FISA request or renewal,  for identification of any possible federal criminal violations  associated with the cases. OIPR is to make those memorandums  available to the Criminal Division. The Deptuy Attorney General\u2019s  memorandum also required that, when the notification standard is  met, notification should be accomplished without delay.", "To improve coordination between the FBI and the Criminal Division  by ensuring that investigations that indicate a criminal violation are  clearly identified and by institutionalizing mechanisms to ensure  greater coordination, we recommend that the Attorney General  direct the FBI Inspection Division, during its periodic inspections of  foreign counterintelligence investigations at field offices, to review  compliance with the requirement for case summary memorandums  sent OIPR to specifically address the identification of possible  criminal violations. Moreover, where field office case summary  memorandums identified reportable instances of possible federal  crimes, the Inspection Division should assess whether the  appropriate headquarters unit properly coordinated those foreign  counterintelligence investigations with the Criminal Division.", "Implemented. In a July 18, 2001, memorandum to the Deputy  Attorney General, the Assistant Director of the FBI\u2019s Inspection  Division stated that the division has established a Foreign  Intelligence/Counterintelligence Audit that is to be completed during  its on-site inspections at applicable FBI field offices. The audit,  according to the Assistant Director, will determine whether  significant criminal activity was indicated during intelligence  investigations and, where such activity was identified, determine  whether it was properly coordinated with FBI headquarters and  Justice\u2019s Criminal Division.", "To improve coordination between the FBI and the Criminal Division  by ensuring that investigations that indicate criminal violations are  clearly identified and by institutionalizing mechanisms to ensure  greater coordination, we recommend that the Attorney General  issue written policies and procedures establishing the roles and  responsibilities of OIPR and the core group as mechanisms for  ensuring compliance with the Attorney General\u2019s coordination  procedures.", "Implemented. On June 12, 2001, OIPR issued policy guidance to its  staff on compliance with the Attorney General\u2019s 1995 coordination  procedures. The issuance of this policy partially implements the  GAO recommendation. Later on August 6, 2001, the Deputy  Attorney General issued a memorandum to the Criminal Division,  the FBI and OIPR establishing the roles and responsibilities of the  Core Group to resolve disputes arising from the Attorney General\u2019s  1995 guidelines.", "Combating Terrorism: Actions Needed To Improve DOD Antiterrorism  Program Implementation and Management (GAO-01-909, Sept. 19, 2001).
