In 1997, the Department of Defense (DOD) developed a militarywide health surveillance framework that includes occupational and environmental health surveillance (OEHS)--the regular collection and reporting of occupational and environmental health hazard data by the military services. This testimony is based on GAO's report, entitled Defense Health Care: Improvements Needed in Occupational and Environmental Health Surveillance during Deployment to Address Immediate and Long-term Heath Issues (GAO-05-632). The testimony presents findings about how the deployed military services have implemented DOD's policies for collecting and reporting OEHS data for Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and the efforts under way to use OEHS reports to address both immediate and long-term health issues of servicemembers deployed in support of OIF."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Although OEHS data generally have been collected and reported for OIF, as required by DOD policy, the deployed military services have used different data collection methods and have not submitted all of the OEHS reports that have been completed. Data collection methods for air and soil surveillance have varied across the services, for example, although they have been using the same monitoring standard for water surveillance. For some OEHS activities, a cross-service working group has been developing standards and practices to increase uniformity of data collection among the services. In addition, while the deployed military services have been conducting OEHS activities, they have not submitted all of the OEHS reports that have been completed during OIF. Moreover, DOD officials could not identify the reports they had not received to determine the extent of noncompliance. DOD has made progress in using OEHS reports to address immediate health risks during OIF, but limitations remain in employing these reports to address both immediate and long-term health issues. OEHS reports have been used consistently during OIF as part of operational risk management activities intended to identify and address immediate health risks and to make servicemembers aware of the risks of potential exposures. While these efforts may help in reducing health risks, DOD has not systematically evaluated their implementation during OIF. DOD's centralized archive of OEHS reports for OIF has several limitations for addressing potential long-term health effects related to occupational and environmental exposures. First, access to the centralized archive has been limited due to the security classification of most OEHS reports. Second, it will be difficult to link most OEHS reports to individual servicemembers' records because not all data on servicemembers' deployment locations have been submitted to DOD's centralized tracking database. To address problems with linking OEHS reports to individual servicemembers, the deployed military services have tried to include OEHS monitoring summaries in the medical records of some servicemembers for either specific incidents of potential exposure or for specific locations within OIF. Additionally, according to DOD and Veterans Affairs (VA) officials, no federal research plan has been developed to evaluate the long-term health of servicemembers deployed in support of OIF, including the effects of potential exposures to occupational or environmental hazards. GAO's report made several recommendations, including that the Secretary of Defense improve deployment OEHS data collection and reporting and evaluate OEHS risk management activities and that the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs jointly develop a federal research plan to address long-term health effects of OIF deployment. DOD plans to take steps to meet the intent of our first recommendation and partially concurred with the other recommendations.

The health effects from service in military  operations have been of increasing interest since the end of the 1991  Persian Gulf War\u2014an interest that was renewed when servicemembers  were deployed in early 2003 to the Persian Gulf in support of OIF.  Following the 1991 Gulf War, many servicemembers reported suffering  from unexplained illnesses that they attributed to their service in the  Persian Gulf and expressed concerns about possible exposures to  chemical or biological warfare agents or environmental contaminants.  Subsequent research and investigations into the nature and causes of these  illnesses by the Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of  Veterans Affairs (VA), the Department of Health and Human Services  (HHS), the Institute of Medicine, and a Presidential Advisory Committee  were hampered by a lack of servicemember health and deployment data,  including inadequate occupational and environmental exposure data.", "To address continuing concerns about the health of servicemembers  during and after deployments and to improve health data collection on  potential exposures, DOD developed a militarywide health surveillance  framework for use during deployments beginning in 1997. A key  component of this framework is occupational and environmental health  surveillance (OEHS), an activity that includes the regular collection and  reporting of occupational and environmental health hazard data by the  military services during a deployment that can be used to monitor the  health of servicemembers and to prevent, treat, or control disease or  injury. DOD has created policies for OEHS data collection during a  deployment and for the submittal of OEHS reports to a centralized archive  within specified time frames. The military services are responsible for  implementing these policies in preparation for deployments. During a  deployment, the military services are unified under a deployment  command structure and are responsible for conducting OEHS activities in  accordance with DOD policy. Throughout this testimony, we identify the  military services operating in a deployment as \u201cdeployed military  services.\u201d", "My remarks will summarize our findings on (1) how the deployed military  services have implemented DOD\u2019s policies for collecting and reporting  OEHS data for OIF and (2) the efforts under way to use OEHS reports to  address both the immediate and long-term health issues of  servicemembers deployed in support of OIF. My statement is based on our  report, entitled Defense Health Care: Improvements Needed in  Occupatonal and Environmenta Hea h Surve ance during Deployments  t t GAO-05-632), which is  being released today.  o Address Immediae and Long-erm Health Issues ( To do this work, we reviewed pertinent policies, guidance, and reports  related to collecting and reporting OEHS data obtained from officials at  the Deployment Health Support Directorate (DHSD), the military services,  and the Joint Staff, which supports the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff. We also conducted site visits to the Army, Navy, and Air Force  health surveillance centers that develop standards and guidance for  conducting OEHS. We interviewed DOD officials and reviewed reports  and documents identifying occupational and environmental health risks  and outlining recommendations for addressing risks at deployment sites.  We interviewed officials at the U.S. Army\u2019s Center for Health Promotion  and Preventive Medicine (CHPPM), which archives OEHS reports, both  classified and unclassified, for all the military services. We also  interviewed officials and military service representatives at DOD\u2019s  Deployment Manpower Data Center on the status of a centralized  deployment tracking database to identify deployed servicemembers and  record their locations within the theater of operations. Additionally, we  interviewed VA officials on their experience in obtaining and using OEHS  reports from OIF to address the health care needs of veterans. Finally, we  interviewed DOD and VA officials to examine whether the agencies have  planned or initiated health research to evaluate the long-term health of  servicemembers deployed in support of OIF using OEHS reports. We  conducted our work from September 2004 through June 2005 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "In summary, although OEHS data generally have been collected and  reported for OIF, as required by DOD policy, the deployed military  services have used different data collection methods and have not  submitted all of the OEHS reports that have been completed. Data  collection methods for air and soil surveillance have varied across the  services, for example, although they have been using the same monitoring  standard for water surveillance. Compounding these differences among  the services were varying levels of training and expertise among the  deployed military service personnel who were responsible for conducting  OEHS activities, resulting in differing practices for implementing data  collection standards. For some OEHS activities, a cross-service working  group, called the Joint Environmental Surveillance Working Group, has  been developing standards and practices to increase uniformity of data  collection among the services. In addition, the deployed military services  have not submitted to CHPPM all OEHS reports that have been completed  during OIF, as required by DOD policy. While 239 of the 277 OIF bases had  at least one OEHS report submitted to CHPPM\u2019s centralized archive as of  December 2004, CHPPM could not measure the magnitude of  noncompliance because not all of the required consolidated lists that  identify all OEHS reports completed during each quarter in OIF had been  submitted. Therefore, CHPPM could not compare the reports that it had  received against the list of reports that had been completed. According to  CHPPM officials, obstacles to the services\u2019 reporting compliance may have  included a lack of understanding by some within the deployed military  services about the type of OEHS reports that should have been submitted.  In addition, OEHS report submission may be given a lower priority  compared to other deployment mission activities. Also, while CHPPM is  responsible for OEHS archiving, it has no authority to enforce report  submission requirements. To improve OEHS reporting compliance, DOD  officials said they were revising an existing policy to add additional and  more specific OEHS requirements.", "DOD has made progress using OEHS reports to address immediate health  risks during OIF, but limitations remain in employing these reports to  address both immediate and long-term health issues. OIF is the first major  deployment in which OEHS reports have been used consistently as part of  operational risk management activities intended to identify and address  immediate health risks. These activities included health risk assessments  that described and measured the potential hazards at a site, risk mitigation  activities intended to reduce potential exposure, and risk communication  efforts undertaken to make servicemembers aware of the possible health  risks of potential exposures. While these efforts may help reduce health  risks, there is no assurance that they have been effective because DOD has  not systematically evaluated the implementation of OEHS risk  management activities in OIF. Despite progress in the use of OEHS  information to identify and address immediate health risks, CHPPM\u2019s  centralized archive of OEHS reports for OIF has limitations for addressing  potential long-term health effects related to occupational and  environmental exposures for several reasons. First, access to CHPPM\u2019s  OEHS archive has been limited because most OEHS reports are  classified\u2014which restricts their use by VA, medical professionals, and  interested researchers. Second, it will be difficult to link most OEHS  reports to individual servicemembers because not all data on  servicemembers\u2019 deployment locations have been submitted to DOD\u2019s  centralized tracking database. For example, none of the military services  submitted location data for the first several months of OIF. To address  problems with linking OEHS reports to individual servicemembers, the  deployed military services have made efforts to include OEHS summaries  in the medical records of some servicemembers for either specific  incidents of potential exposure or for specific locations within OIF, such  as air bases. Additionally, according to DOD and VA officials, no  comprehensive federal research plan incorporating the use of the archived  OEHS reports has been developed to address the long-term health  consequences of service in OIF.", "In the report we are issuing today, we recommend that the Secretary of  Defense ensure that cross-service guidance is developed to implement  DOD\u2019s revised policy for OEHS during deployments and ensure that the  military services jointly establish and implement procedures to evaluate  the effectiveness of risk management strategies during deployments. We  also recommend that the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of  Veterans Affairs work together to develop a federal research plan to follow  the health of OIF servicemembers over time that would include the use of  OEHS reports. In commenting on a draft of this report, DOD stated that  cross-service guidance meeting the intent of our recommendation would  be developed by the Joint Staff instead of the military services.

Commanders balance the risk to servicemembers of  encountering occupational and environmental health hazards while  deployed, even following mitigation efforts, against the need to  accomplish specific mission requirements.

Using this information, VA has  developed study guides for physicians on such topics as health effects  from radiation and traumatic brain injury and also has written letters for  OIF veterans about these issues.", "DOD has begun reviewing classification policies for OEHS reports, as  required by the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2005. A DHSD official said that DOD\u2019s newly created Joint  Medical Readiness Oversight Committee is expected to review ways to  reduce or limit the classification of data, including data that are potentially  useful for monitoring and assessing the health of servicemembers who  have been exposed to occupational or environmental hazards during  deployments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Difficulties Exist in Linking Archived OEHS Reports to Individual Servicemembers, but Some Efforts Are Under Way to Include Information in Medical Records", "paragraphs": ["Linking OEHS reports from the archive to individual servicemembers will  be difficult because DOD\u2019s centralized tracking database for recording  servicemembers\u2019 deployment locations currently does not contain  complete or comparable data. In May 1997, we reported that the ability to  track the movement of individual servicemembers within the theater is  important for accurately identifying exposures of servicemembers to  health hazards. However, the Defense Manpower Data Center\u2019s  centralized database has continued to experience problems in obtaining  complete, comparable data from the services on the location of  servicemembers during deployments, as required by DOD policies. Data  center officials said the military services had not reported location data for  all servicemembers for OIF. As of October 2004, the Army, Air Force, and  Marine Corps each had submitted location data for approximately   80 percent of their deployed servicemembers, and the Navy had submitted  location data for about 60 percent of its deployed servicemembers.  Additionally, the specificity of location data has varied by service. For  example, the Marine Corps has provided location of servicemembers only  by country, whereas each of the other military services has provided more  detailed location information for some of their servicemembers, such as  base camp name or grid coordinate locations. Furthermore, the military  services did not begin providing detailed location data until OIF had been  ongoing for several months.", "DHSD officials said they have been revising an existing policy to provide  additional requirements for location data that are collected by the military  services, such as a daily location record with grid coordinates or latitude  and longitude coordinates for all servicemembers. Though the revised  policy has not been published, as of May 2005 the Army and the Marine  Corps had implemented a new joint location database in support of OIF  that addresses these revisions.", "During OIF, some efforts have been made to include information about  specific incidents of potential and actual exposure to occupational or  environmental health hazards in the medical records of servicemembers  who may have been affected. According to DOD officials, preventive  medicine units have been investigating incidents involving potential  exposure during the deployment. For a given incident, a narrative  summary of events and the results of any medical procedures generally  were included in affected servicemembers\u2019 medical records. Additionally,  rosters were generally developed of servicemembers directly affected and  of servicemembers who did not have any acute symptoms but were in the  vicinity of the incident. For example, in investigating an incident involving  a chemical agent used in an improvised explosive device, CHPPM officials  said that two soldiers who were directly involved were treated at a  medical clinic, and their treatment and the exposure were recorded in  their medical records. Although 31 servicemembers who were providing  security in the area were asymptomatic, doctors were documenting this  potential exposure in their medical records.", "In addition, the military services have taken some steps to include  summaries of potential exposures to occupational and environmental  health hazards in the medical records of servicemembers deployed to  specific locations. The Air Force has created summaries of these hazards  at deployed air bases and has required that these be placed in the medical  records of all Air Force servicemembers stationed at these bases. (See  app. I for an example.) However, Air Force officials said no follow-up  activities have been conducted specifically to determine whether all Air  Force servicemembers have had the summaries placed in their medical  records. Similarly, the Army and Navy jointly created a summary of  potential exposure for the medical records of servicemembers stationed at  Port Shuaiba, the deepwater port used for bringing in heavy equipment in  support of OIF where a large number of servicemembers have been  permanently or temporarily stationed. Since December 2004, port officials  have made efforts to make the summary available to servicemembers  stationed at Port Shuaiba so that these servicemembers can include the  summary in their medical records. However, there has been no effort to  retroactively include the summary in the medical records of  servicemembers stationed at the port prior to that time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "No Federal Research Plan Exists for Using OEHS Reports to Follow the Health of OIF Servicemembers over Time", "paragraphs": ["According to DOD and VA officials, no federal research plan that includes  the use of archived OEHS reports has been developed to evaluate the long- term health of servicemembers deployed in support of OIF, including the  effects of potential exposure to occupational or environmental hazards. In  February 1998 we noted that the federal government lacked a proactive  strategy to conduct research into Gulf War veterans\u2019 health problems and  suggested that delays in planning complicated researchers\u2019 tasks by  limiting opportunities to collect critical data. However, the Deployment  Health Working Group, a federal interagency body responsible for  coordinating research on all hazardous deployments, recently began  discussions on the first steps needed to develop a research plan for OIF.  At its January 2005 meeting, the working group tasked its research  subcommittee to develop a complete list of research projects currently  under way that may be related to OIF. VA officials noted that because  OIF is ongoing, the working group would have to determine how to  address a study population that changes as the number of servicemembers  deployed in support of OIF changes.", "Although no coordinated federal research plan has been developed, other  separate federal research studies are underway that may follow the health  of OIF servicemembers. For example, in 2000 VA and DOD collaborated to  develop the Millennium Cohort study, a 21-year longitudinal study  evaluating the health of both deployed and nondeployed military  personnel throughout their military careers and after leaving military  service. According to the principal investigator, the Millennium Cohort  study was designed to examine the health effects of specific deployments  if enough servicemembers in that deployment enrolled in the study.  However, the principal investigator said that as of February 2005  researchers had not identified how many servicemembers deployed in  support of OIF had enrolled in the study. In another effort, a VA researcher  has received funding to study mortality rates among OIF servicemembers.  According to the researcher, if occupational and environmental data are  available, the study will include the evaluation of mortality outcomes in  relation to potential exposure for OIF servicemembers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["As we stated in our report, DOD\u2019s efforts to collect and report OEHS data  could be strengthened. Currently, OEHS data that the deployed military  services have collected during OIF may not always be comparable because  of variations among the services\u2019 data collection standards and practices.  Additionally, the deployed military services\u2019 uncertain compliance with  OEHS report submission requirements casts doubt on the completeness of  CHPPM\u2019s OEHS archive. These data shortcomings, combined with  incomplete data in DOD\u2019s centralized tracking database of  servicemembers\u2019 deployment locations, limit CHPPM\u2019s ability to respond  to requests for OEHS information about possible exposure to occupational  and environmental health hazards of those who are serving or have served  in OIF. DOD officials have said they are revising an existing policy on  OEHS data collection and reporting to add additional and more specific  OEHS requirements. However, unless the military services take measures  to direct those responsible for OEHS activities to proactively implement  the new requirements, the services\u2019 efforts to collect and report OEHS  data may not improve. Consequently, we recommended that the Secretary  of Defense ensure that cross-service guidance is created to implement  DOD\u2019s policy, once that policy has been revised, to improve the collection  and reporting of OEHS data during deployments and the linking of OEHS  reports to servicemembers. DOD responded that cross-service  implementation guidance for the revised policy on deployment OEHS  would be developed by the Joint Staff.", "While DOD\u2019s risk management efforts during OIF represent a positive step  in helping to mitigate potential environmental and occupational risks of  deployment, the lack of systematic monitoring of the deployed military  services\u2019 implementation activities prevents full knowledge of their  effectiveness. Therefore, we recommended that the military services  jointly establish and implement procedures to evaluate the effectiveness of  risk management efforts. DOD partially concurred with our  recommendation and stated that it has procedures in place to evaluate  OEHS risk management through a jointly established and implemented  lessons learned process. However, in further discussions, DOD officials  told us that they were not aware of any lessons learned reports related to  OEHS risk management for OIF.", "Furthermore, although OEHS reports alone are not sufficient to identify  the causes of potential long-term health effects in deployed  servicemembers, they are an integral component of research to evaluate  the long-term health of deployed servicemembers. However, efforts by a  joint DOD and VA working group to develop a federal research plan for  OIF that would include examining the effects of potential exposure to  occupational and environmental health hazards have just begun, despite  similarities in deployment location to the 1991 Persian Gulf War. As a  result, we recommended that DOD and VA work together to develop a  federal research plan to follow the health of servicemembers deployed in  support of OIF that would include the use of archived OEHS reports. DOD  partially concurred with our recommendation, and VA concurred. The  difference in VA and DOD\u2019s responses to this recommendation illustrates a  disconnect between each agency\u2019s understanding of whether and how  such a federal research plan should be established. Therefore, continued  collaboration between the agencies to formulate a mutually agreeable  process for proactively creating a federal research plan would be  beneficial in facilitating both agencies\u2019 ability to anticipate and understand  the potential long-term health effects related to OIF deployment versus  taking a more reactive stance in waiting to see what types of health  problems may surface.", "Mr. Chairman, this completes my prepared statement.
