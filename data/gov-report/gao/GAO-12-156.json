To address these objectives, GAO reviewed studies and other documents on produced water and interviewed federal and state regulatory officials, federal scientists, officials from oil and gas companies and water treatment companies, and other experts.

A 2009 Argonne National Laboratory study estimated that 56 million barrels of water are produced onshore every day, but this study may underestimate the current total volume because it is based on limited, and in some cases, incomplete data generated by the states. In general, the volume of produced water generated by a given well varies widely according to three key factors: the hydrocarbon being produced, the geographic location of the well, and the method of production used. For example, some gas wells typically generate large volumes of water early in production, whereas oil wells typically generate less. Generally, the quality of produced water from oil and gas production is poor, and it cannot be readily used for another purpose without prior treatment. The specific quality of water produced by a given well, however, can vary widely according to the same three factors that impact volume\u0097hydrocarbon, geography, and production method.", "Oil and gas producers can choose from a number of practices to manage and treat produced water, but underground injection is the predominant practice because it requires little or no treatment and is often the least costly option. According to federal estimates, more than 90 percent of produced water is managed by injecting it into wells that are designated to receive produced water. A limited amount of produced water is disposed of or reused by producers in other ways, including discharging it to surface water, storing it in surface impoundments or ponds so that it can evaporate, irrigating crops, and reusing it for hydraulic fracturing. Managing produced water in these ways can require more advanced treatment methods, such as distillation. How produced water is ultimately managed and treated is primarily an economic decision, made within the bounds of federal and state regulations.", "The management of produced water through underground injection is subject to the Safe Drinking Water Act\u0092s Underground Injection Control program, which is designed to prevent contamination of aquifers that supply public water systems by ensuring the safe operation of injection wells. Under this program, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or the states require producers to obtain permits for their injection wells by, among other things, meeting technical standards for constructing, operating, and testing and monitoring the wells. EPA also regulates the management of produced water through surface discharges under the Clean Water Act. Other management practices, such as disposal of the water into surface impoundments, irrigation, and the reuse of the water for hydraulic fracturing, are regulated by state authorities.", "Several federal agencies, including EPA; the Department of Interior\u0092s Bureau of Reclamation and U.S. Geological Survey; and a number of Department of Energy national laboratories, have undertaken research and development efforts related to produced water.

Oil can be found in deep, porous rock or reservoirs that can  flow under natural pressure to the surface after drilling, as well as other  geologic formations, including shale and oil sands, in which other  processes must be used to extract the oil, such as injecting liquid into the  formation or applying heat or steam. Similarly, gas can be found in porous  rock or reservoirs, in coal seams (known as coalbed methane), and in  tighter geologic formations, including tight sands and shale formations.  Extracting oil and gas from any of these reserves can result in produced  water as a byproduct because water can exist naturally along with oil and  gas in geologic formations (known as formation water) or it can be added  to the well to stimulate oil and gas production (known as injected water).  Formation water and injected water can return to the surface as produced  water along with the oil or gas that is being extracted from the well.

Coalbed  methane formations, located at shallow depths of 1,000 to 2,000 feet, are  more permeable formations through which gas can flow more freely than  through shale formations.

This estimate is based on an Argonne National Laboratory study  of produced water volumes generated during 2007\u2014the most recent year  for which such data were collected\u2014and was derived from data collected  from state agencies in 31 oil- and gas-producing states. The study is  considered by agency officials, researchers, and other experts with whom  we spoke to be the most comprehensive and accurate assessment of  produced water volumes to date. However, because the Argonne study is  based on limited and, in some cases, incomplete data, it likely  underestimates the current total volume of produced water being  generated by oil and gas operations today. Specifically, we noted the  following limitations in the Argonne estimate:", "The reporting time frame for the study largely occurred prior to the  recent, dramatic increase in shale gas production in the United States,  which had an average annual growth rate of 48 percent from 2006 to  2010, according to the EIA. In 2010, EIA had estimated that shale gas  accounted for approximately 23 percent of all gas production in the  United States.", "The study is based on state data that were collected and maintained  using a variety of methods, making them difficult to compare and  aggregate at a national level. For example, in some states, producers  are required to report produced water volumes as measured by flow  meters, whereas in other states, producers are required to estimate  produced water volumes using a method of their choosing, which may  limit the precision of the data. Furthermore, in other states, producers  are only required to report produced water volumes they dispose of in  injection wells, which may not reflect the total produced water  generated. Lastly, some states do not collect data on produced water  volumes at all. In such cases, Argonne generated estimates of  produced water volumes based on available information on oil and gas  production in the state and made certain assumptions about water  volumes based on produced water data from neighboring states.", "Although the Argonne study clearly demonstrates that a large amount of  produced water is generated daily, the volume generated by a specific oil  and gas well can vary significantly according to three key factors: the type  of hydrocarbon being produced, the geographic location of the well, and  the method of production used. First, according to literature we reviewed  and stakeholders we spoke with, the type of hydrocarbon influences not  only how much water a well generates, but also when the water is  produced over the life of the well. This is because the geological  formations for different hydrocarbons have different attributes, thus  influencing the amount of water that is produced from a particular well.  For example, coalbed methane wells produce large volumes of water in  the early stages of production, because coal beds are essentially aquifers  that contain coal rock and gas bound together from the pressure of the  water present in the aquifer. By pumping out water, the resulting drop in  pressure allows the gas to detach from the coal and flow to the surface. In  contrast, one producer noted that their conventional gas wells produce  much less water than their coalbed methane wells because the  formations from which conventional gas is drawn contain much less  water. Oil wells, on the other hand, typically generate less water during  the first years of production, when formation pressure is high enough to  allow the oil to flow freely to the surface. As these oil wells age, however,  water volumes increase, as oil taken out is displaced by water flowing in  from the surrounding formation. One producer that we spoke with noted  that their older oil fields produce more than five times the volume of water  produced by their younger oil fields.", "Second, according to the literature we reviewed and stakeholders we  spoke with, the geographic location of a well also influences the volume  of produced water it generates, due to differences in geology. For  example, stakeholders noted that the Barnett Shale formation in Texas is  generally known to be a \u201cwetter\u201d formation than the Marcellus Shale  formation in the Northeast, with shale gas wells in the Barnett typically  producing three to four times more water than shale gas wells in the  Marcellus. Similarly, USGS reported that coalbed methane wells in the  Powder River Basin in Wyoming and Montana produce, on average, 16  times more water than coalbed methane wells in the San Juan Basin in  Colorado and New Mexico. In addition, produced water volumes can vary  among wells in close proximity with one another. For example, at one site  we visited in Wyoming, some gas wells were producing two to three times  more water than other gas wells in the same field, for reasons that were,  in general, not clear to the operator of those wells.", "Lastly, the method of production used to extract oil and gas also  influences the volume of water generated, according to the literature we  reviewed and stakeholders we spoke with. Specifically, stakeholders  reported that methods of production that rely on the injection of water and  other fluids into the formation in order to stimulate oil and gas production  can generate more produced water than in cases in which oil and gas  comes to the surface under existing pressure. For example, one  stakeholder reported that the use of enhanced oil recovery methods such  as steam injection can generate eight to nine barrels of water for every  barrel of oil produced. At one enhanced oil recovery field we visited,  produced water comprised more than 95 percent of the total liquids  produced, with oil comprising the remainder. Similarly, the use of  hydraulic fracturing to produce oil or gas can result in larger volumes of  produced water than production in more porous formations, although the  larger volumes associated with hydraulic fracturing are limited to the initial  flowback of water and fracturing fluids. For example, with shale gas  production, stakeholders reported that flowback volumes can range from  approximately 10,000 to 60,000 barrels per well for each hydraulic  fracture. However, once the initial flowback ceases, the volume of water  produced by shale gas production may be relatively small, sometimes  decreasing to just a few barrels per day."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Produced Water Is Generally of Poor Quality, with the Levels of Contaminants Varying Widely", "paragraphs": ["The quality of produced water from oil and gas production is generally  poor, and in most situations, it cannot be readily used for other purposes  without prior treatment. According to the literature we reviewed and  stakeholders we spoke with, produced water may contain a wide range of  contaminants in varying amounts. Most of the contaminants occur  naturally in the produced water, but some are added through the process  of drilling, hydraulic fracturing, and pumping oil and gas. The range of  contaminants found in produced water can include, but is not limited to  salts, which include chlorides, bromides, and sulfides of calcium,  magnesium, and sodium; metals, which include barium, manganese, iron, and strontium, among oil, grease, and dissolved organics, which include benzene and  toluene, among others; naturally occurring radioactive materials; and production chemicals, which may include friction reducers to help with  water flow, biocides to prevent growth of microorganisms, and  additives to prevent corrosion, among others.", "Exposure to these contaminants at high levels may pose risks to human  health and the environment. For example, according to EPA, a potential  human health risk from exposure to high levels of barium is increased  blood pressure, and potential human health risks from exposure to high  levels of benzene are anemia and increased risk of cancer. From an  environmental standpoint, research indicated that elevated levels of salts  can inhibit crop growth by hindering a plant\u2019s ability to absorb water from  the soil. Additionally, exposure to elevated levels of metals and  production chemicals, such as biocides, can contribute to increased  mortality among livestock and wildlife.", "The specific quality of water generated by a given well, however, can vary  widely according to the same three factors that impact the volume of  water produced from the well: the hydrocarbon being produced, the  geographic location of the well, and method of production used. First,  according to stakeholders we spoke with, the type of hydrocarbon is a key  driver of produced water quality, due to differences in geology across the  formations in which the hydrocarbons are found. Specifically, the depth at  which the hydrocarbons are found influences the salt and mineral content  of produced water, and, in general, the deeper the formation is, the higher  the salt and mineral content will be. For example, produced water from  shale gas wells drilled at depths generally ranging from 5,000 to 8,000  feet have salt and mineral levels 20 times higher than produced water  from coalbed methane wells drilled at depths of 1,000 to 2,000 feet.  Additionally, the amount of oil or gas that is mixed in with the produced  water brought to the surface can also vary. For example, produced water  typically blends more easily with oil than with gas. As a result, produced  water from oil wells generally contains levels of oil, grease, and other  organic compounds that are four to five times higher than water from gas  wells.", "Second, the quality of produced water also varies depending on the well\u2019s  geographic location, also because of differences in geology. For example,  producers we spoke with said that produced water from wells in the  Marcellus Shale formation in the Northeast has higher levels of  radionuclides than water from shale gas wells in the Barnett Shale  formation in Texas. Similarly, according to research, produced water from  coalbed methane wells in the Raton Basin in Colorado and New Mexico  has a salt content, on average, roughly two and a half times higher than  produced water from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and Montana.  In addition, produced water quality can vary within a given region,  according to producers we spoke with. For example, some coalbed  methane wells in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming contain barium  levels five to six times higher than the barium levels found in wells less  than 50 miles away. Additionally, produced water from wells in one oil  field in California contains levels of boron four to five times higher than  produced water from oil wells in neighboring fields.", "Lastly, the method of production can affect the quality of the water  produced. These differences are largely attributable to the chemicals and  other substances added during drilling or production processes, according  to stakeholders we spoke with. Specifically, methods of production that rely  on hydraulic fracturing or enhanced recovery methods can result in poorer  quality produced water than other methods. For example, according to  stakeholders, the range of chemicals, sand, and water that are added to  facilitate the hydraulic fracturing process can lower the overall quality of the  produced water from these kinds of operations. Similarly, the use of  chemicals during enhanced recovery can also affect the quality of water  produced. Stakeholders noted that enhanced recovery involves the  addition of production chemicals such as biocides, corrosion inhibitors, and  friction reducers, along with steam or carbon dioxide. For example, one  stakeholder estimated that wells produced using these enhanced recovery  methods can yield produced water with levels of some production  chemicals three to four times higher than produced water from wells that do  not use enhanced recovery techniques."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "A Number of Practices Are Available to Manage and Treat Produced Water, with Cost Being the Primary Determining Factor", "paragraphs": ["Oil and gas producers have a number of options on how to manage  produced water, but underground injection is the predominant practice. In  addition to underground injection, a limited amount of produced water is  managed by discharging it to surface water, storing it in surface  impoundments, and reusing it for irrigation or hydraulic fracturing. With  regard to treatment options, most produced water is minimally treated,  although more advanced treatment methods are available if the end use  of the water requires a higher level of treatment.

In its 2009 report,  Argonne National Laboratory estimated, and EPA officials that we spoke  with concurred, that most produced water is managed by injecting it  underground into wells that are designated to receive this water. These  wells, known as injection wells, must be constructed to protect  underground sources of drinking water, and they are tested and  monitored periodically to ensure no drinking water is being contaminated  by well operations (see fig. 2). Injection wells can be used for enhanced  recovery or permanent disposal of the water. When producers reuse  produced water for enhanced recovery, they inject it into wells in the  same producing formation to recover additional oil and, in limited  applications, gas, thus prolonging the life of the production well. Some of  this water will come back up as produced water in subsequent well  operations. When producers inject produced water for permanent  disposal into an underground formation, they inject it into wells in the  same formation or a formation that is similar to the one the produced  water was extracted from.", "According to EPA records, in 2010 there were 150,855 injection wells  authorized for the injection of fluids brought to the surface during oil and  gas production, including produced water, although EPA officials told us  that not all are currently operating. About four-fifths of the wells\u2014 124,837\u2014are located in the nine states we reviewed (see table 1).", "According to state regulators we interviewed in the nine states, underground  injection is common in most, but not all, of their states. Specifically,  regulators in five states told us that all or almost all of the produced water is  managed through underground injection, and in three other states, most of  the produced water is managed this way. In the ninth state\u2014Pennsylvania\u2014 many producers use underground injection for enhanced recovery, but the  practice is not widely used for disposal, according to EPA officials.", "Produced water that is not injected into underground injection wells is  disposed of or reused by producers in other ways, including the  following.", "Discharge to surface water. According to Argonne National Laboratory\u2019s  report, less than 1 percent of produced water generated from onshore oil  and gas operations in 2007 was managed by discharging it to surface  water. Surface discharges of produced water directly from oil and gas  production sites are prohibited in much of the United States, but produced  water may be discharged from an off-site treatment facility. According to  Argonne\u2019s report, discharges of produced water to surface water are  primarily limited to the western United States and generally occur only  when the salt content of the water is low. While a current national  estimate of this practice is not available, EPA officials and regulators in  seven of the nine states we reviewed told us that surface discharges of  produced water are limited or are nonexistent in their states. For example,  officials we spoke with from Colorado said that a very small portion of the  produced water generated in that state is discharged to surface water and  only 24 of the approximately 9,900 discharge permits they have issued  are for oil and gas producers. Among the states we reviewed, Wyoming  and Pennsylvania were the only two where producers commonly use  surface discharges to manage produced water. For example, an oil  producer we spoke with in Wyoming told us his company discharges a  small portion of the produced water from some of its fields directly to a  nearby creek because the water quality is high enough to meet the state\u2019s  discharge limits without prior treatment; however, the majority of the water  generated from these fields has a much higher salt concentration and  cannot be discharged into surface waters.", "Surface impoundment. Surface impoundments are lined or unlined ponds  used primarily to facilitate evaporation of produced water, and in the case  of unlined ponds, allow it to infiltrate into the ground. According to  DOE\u2019s NETL, drier climates are favorable for evaporation and spray  nozzles may be used to increase the rate of evaporation. The National  Research Council reported that, in 2008, surface impoundments were  used to manage about 64 percent of produced water generated by  coalbed methane producers in the Wyoming portion of the Powder River  Basin. According to the report, the water was generally untreated, but in  some cases water was treated to meet requirements for discharging to  the impoundment. For example, a coalbed methane producer we visited  in Wyoming treats the produced water at a treatment facility to first  remove barium to meet state water quality standards, then disposes of  most of it in a surface impoundment, where it evaporates or infiltrates to  the subsurface. Officials we spoke with from California, Colorado, and  New Mexico also said that surface impoundments are used to manage  produced water in those states, but it is not a significant practice in any of  them.", "Irrigation. Some produced water from coalbed methane is reused for  irrigation in certain parts of Wyoming and Colorado because the water is  generally of high enough quality that it does not require extensive  treatment in order to avoid damage to the crops or soil. According to the  National Research Council, about 13 percent of the produced water  generated from coalbed methane producers in Wyoming\u2019s Powder River  Basin was reused for managed irrigation or subsurface drip irrigation.  For example, a coalbed methane production operation we visited in  Wyoming disposes of almost all of its produced water from the Powder  River Basin using a managed irrigation system, following minimal  treatment of the water. Because its wells produce more water than can be  disposed of under its surface discharge permit, it is a fairly economical  option, and is allowable under state regulations. While there are  examples of irrigation with produced water occurring elsewhere, it is not a  widely used management practice. According to NETL, a significant  challenge to using produced water for irrigation is the salt content of the  water, which can decrease crop yields and damage the soil. In addition,  the National Research Council reported that while reusing coalbed  methane produced water for beneficial purposes such as irrigation would  seem to be a desirable and relatively easy objective, in reality it is  potentially economically and environmentally burdensome, complex, and  challenging. The suitability of water for irrigation depends on a number of  factors including the type of crops grown, the soil type, irrigation methods,  and the types and quantity of salts dissolved in the water. In addition, the  reliability of the produced water supply over time, proximity to the  irrigation site, and costs also present challenges.", "Hydraulic fracturing. In recent years, some shale gas producers have  begun reusing produced water for hydraulic fracturing of additional wells  at their operations. The water is typically treated first, either on-site or off- site, and then mixed with freshwater if salt concentrations remain high.  Although no national estimate of producers\u2019 use of this practice is  available, a 2009 report on shale gas development reported that interest  in this type of reuse for produced water was high. However, the report  also noted that certain water treatment challenges needed to be  overcome to make this type of reuse more widespread. According to  NETL, in order for reuse of produced water to become widespread, low- cost treatment technologies must be developed. In the last couple of  years, reusing produced water for hydraulic fracturing has become more  common among shale gas producers in Pennsylvania, according to state  regulators and producers we spoke with in the state. The shift was  motivated, in part, by a change in the state\u2019s surface discharge standards  that ultimately made treatment and discharge a comparatively more  expensive practice. For example, one shale gas production site we visited  in Pennsylvania currently reuses all of its produced water for hydraulic  fracturing, although it had used other practices in the past. Other shale  gas producers in the state are also adopting this approach, according to  agency officials and an academic expert we spoke with. In addition,  regulators in five of the other states we reviewed told us that producers in  these states are reusing produced water for hydraulic fracturing, although  generally to a lesser extent than in Pennsylvania."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Produced Water Is Minimally Treated, but More Advanced Treatment Methods Are Available", "paragraphs": ["Because most produced water is managed through underground injection  wells, it is minimally treated; however, if produced water is going to be  reused or disposed of in some other manner, then more advanced  treatment methods are available, depending on the level of treatment  required.", "Treatment methods for produced water managed through underground  injection. Produced water managed through underground injection  generally does not need to be treated because injection wells are  designed to confine the produced water to the receiving formation and  prevent it from migrating to underground sources of drinking water. In  some cases, however, to meet an injection well\u2019s operating requirements  or prevent premature \u201cplugging\u201d of the formation, the water may be  treated to control excessive solids, dissolved oil, corrosion, chemical  reactions, or the growth of bacteria and other microbes, according to  NETL. Such treatment is generally minimal and can include storing the  water in a tank to allow solids to settle out and passing the water through  a screen or filter to remove additional solids. Chemicals may also be  added to prevent corrosion of the injection well equipment and filtration or  biocides may be used to prevent bacteria, algae, or fungi present in the  water from clogging equipment or encouraging corrosion.", "Treatment methods for produced water reused for hydraulic fracturing.  Producers who reuse produced water for hydraulic fracturing told us they  treat the water to meet their own operating requirements. While producers  we spoke with said that they had previously treated the water to a very  high quality before reusing it for hydraulic fracturing, they are currently  experimenting with lower levels of treatment. For example, one producer  told us that 2 years ago his company treated the water so that it was  nearly as clean as freshwater, but based on internal research, the  company no longer removes salt from the produced water that it reuses  for hydraulic fracturing. This lower level of treatment has reduced  operating costs, and the producer is considering eliminating other  treatment steps as long as doing so will not cause operational problems,  such as equipment corrosion.", "Treatment methods for produced water discharged to surface water  bodies or reused for irrigation. If produced water is going to be discharged  to surface water or reused for irrigation, then treatment is often necessary  to reduce hardness, salts, and other contaminants, in addition to settling  and filtration methods to remove solids. Solids and hardness removal are  sometimes referred to as \u201cpretreatment\u201d steps. Hard water contains  dissolved constituents, mainly calcium and magnesium ions, which can  cause scaling of pipes and equipment. Hardness is typically removed  prior to removing salts by adjusting the pH of the water and adding  chemicals that cause dissolved calcium and magnesium to form small  solids, or precipitates, which then settle out or are filtered out of the water  with the aid of additional processes. Alternatively, when produced water  is going to be reused for irrigation, calcium or magnesium may be added  to the water to address sodium levels.  Treatment technologies, including  distillation, reverse osmosis, and ion exchange, are then used to remove  salt and other contaminants from produced water. Distillation is a  treatment process that essentially boils produced water to evaporate and  then condense the clean water, leaving behind concentrated brine.  Reverse osmosis is a filtration process that forces water through a semi- permeable membrane, allowing water to pass through but trapping salt on  the other side. Reverse osmosis generally requires a high level of  pretreatment to prevent fouling of the membranes, and it is only feasible  when salt concentrations in the produced water are less than  approximately 25,000 parts per million, according to a study by the  Colorado School of Mines. For example, produced water from a gas  operation we visited in Wyoming had to first undergo pretreatment to  remove solids, hardness, and other contaminants before being put  through three stages of reverse osmosis. A third treatment technology,  ion exchange, selectively captures sodium ions from produced water and  replaces them with others. The water is passed through a large bed of  resin beads and sodium ions are adsorbed to (i.e., concentrate on the  surface of) the resin. Similar to reverse osmosis, ion exchange faces  upper limits on salt concentrations of approximately 7,000 parts per  million, according to the Colorado School of Mines.technologies to remove salt typically generates concentrated brine, which  must then be properly disposed of as well."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cost Is the Primary Factor That Determines How Produced Water Is Managed and Treated", "paragraphs": ["While a variety of factors influence how produced water is managed and  the level to which it is treated, cost is the primary factor that oil and gas  producers consider when making these decisions. According to producers  and agency officials we spoke with, how produced water is managed and  treated is primarily an economic decision, made within the bounds of  federal and state regulations. In most cases, underground injection is the  lowest-cost option and producers we spoke with said that their costs for  underground injection range from $0.07 to $1.60 per barrel of produced  water. However, if a producer is not operating in close proximity to  injection wells, transporting the water via truck or pipeline can significantly  increase these costs. Furthermore, producers told us that trucking is one  of the most significant cost factors they face, and they seek to minimize  this cost by managing the water closer to the production site when  possible. For example, according to one producer, trucking costs in Texas  range from $0.50 to $1.00 per barrel because injection wells in the area  are plentiful, whereas costs in Pennsylvania range from $4.00 to $8.00  per barrel because injection wells are scarce, and the produced water  often must be transported out of state. As a result, once trucking is  factored in, underground injection may in fact become more costly than  other management practices.", "Another significant component of cost is whether treatment will be  required as part of the management practice being employed. Treatment  costs depend heavily on the technologies used, which in turn depend on  the quality of the produced water being treated and the level of treatment  needed for the disposal or reuse option being considered. For example,  there are a number of treatment methods to remove salt from produced  water, but each option has a different cost and differing level of  effectiveness. Distillation, while effective at removing salts, has  significantly higher costs, and representatives from water treatment  facilities and producers we spoke to said it can cost from $6.35 to $8.50  per barrel, on average. Reverse osmosis and ion exchange are less  costly treatment options for removing salt, but their use is limited by the  level of salt content they can remove from produced water, and reverse  osmosis can require extensive pretreatment, which can significantly drive  up costs. Producers we spoke with who use reverse osmosis and ion  exchange to treat produced water told us that their costs range from  $0.20 to $0.60 per barrel. In some cases, producers may be able to  change the management practice they use to minimize their treatment  costs. For example, state regulators told us that when more stringent  discharge limits were put into place in Pennsylvania, many shale gas  producers in the state stopped discharging produced water to the surface  and started to reuse it for hydraulic fracturing because the latter requires  a simpler, and less expensive, level of treatment.", "In addition to cost, according to our review of the literature and  stakeholders we spoke with, produced water management decisions are  also influenced by a number of other factors including the following:", "Poor water quality is a key reason most produced water is managed  through underground injection, rather than reused or discharged to  the surface. However, when water quality is relatively good, as some  of it is in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming, management practices  such as irrigation and infiltration from surface impoundments may  become viable options. Nonetheless, adequate quantities of produced  water are needed for irrigation to be a sustainable practice, and the  water must be in close proximity to the land it will be used on or  producers can face high transportation costs.", "Proximity and region-specific factors, such as geology, also influence  which management practices are feasible in a given area. For  example, some oil and gas producers are not located in close  proximity to injection wells, or the number of available wells is limited  by the underlying geology of the area, and therefore producers must  manage their produced water some other way. An oil producer we  spoke to told us his company would prefer to manage all of its  produced water through underground injection for enhanced recovery  and disposal. However, opportunities for enhanced recovery at one of  the producer\u2019s sites are limited by its level of oil production and  disposal is constrained by the geology in the area. As a result, the  producer told us he manages about 20 percent of the produced water  from this site through treatment and discharge, which is significantly  more costly and technically challenging than underground injection.", "Climate is also a factor in the decision-making process. Arid climates  are favorable for managing produced water using surface  impoundments for evaporation, and limited water supplies in certain  regions can motivate producers to make the water available for other  purposes, such as irrigation.", "Regulatory requirements at the federal or state level can also  influence producers\u2019 management decisions. As discussed earlier, the  changes in discharge limits in Pennsylvania led to a change in  management practices by shale gas producers in the state.", "Producers\u2019 risk management policies can also influence how they  manage the water. For example, regulators we spoke with from  California told us that liabilities associated with surface discharges and  impoundments are a driving factor in moving away from those practices  and toward underground injection. According to these regulators,  surface impoundments were commonly used in California to manage  produced water in the past, but in the last few years hundreds of them  have closed down and they are no longer widely used."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "EPA and the States We Reviewed Regulate the Management of Produced Water through a Variety of Means", "paragraphs": ["The management of produced water is regulated by EPA and the states  we reviewed through a variety of means, depending on how the water is  disposed of or reused.

Under this program, EPA or  authorized states generally require producers to obtain permits for their  injection wells by, among other things, meeting technical standards for  constructing, operating, and testing and monitoring wells. Of the nine  states we reviewed, all but Pennsylvania have received approval authority  from EPA to implement this program for class II wells, including issuing  permits and conducting oversight. In most of these states, the agency that  oversees oil and gas activities is responsible for implementing this  program.

Officials at many of the state agencies we spoke with said that they  observe these tests in person to ensure that the well is mechanically  sound. According to officials in each of the eight states we contacted, the  state can levy penalties for noncompliance for violations ranging from a  failure to submit a report to exceeding the pressure permitted in the well.

Permits can be tailored to  individual facilities or cover multiple facilities within a specific geographic  region. To obtain a permit, producers must complete an application that,  among other things, describes the waste that will be discharged, where  the discharge will take place, and the method of treatment or  containment, if applicable. Once the state or EPA has issued a permit,  producers must report any discharges, including the volume of effluent  and the amount of each pollutant specified in the permit, to the permitting  authority at least once per year. EPA has issued regulations establishing  Effluent Limitations Guidelines for some onshore oil and gas extraction  including shale gas, but these regulations do not apply to coalbed  methane extraction.", "Of the nine states we reviewed, all but New Mexico have received  approval authority from EPA to implement this program for industrial and  municipal facilities.

Worth area. Discharge of produced water from an off- site treatment plant, however, is allowed under the Clean Water Act  provided the treated water meets applicable water quality standards, and  some states have permitted this activity. For example, a commercial  water treatment facility we visited in Pennsylvania treats produced water  from shale gas to meet the state\u2019s new, more stringent discharge limits  and then releases it to a municipal sewer system. In addition, one  producer we spoke with in Wyoming told us his company takes some of  its produced water to a treatment facility, where it is treated with reverse  osmosis and then discharged to a ravine that flows into the Powder River.
