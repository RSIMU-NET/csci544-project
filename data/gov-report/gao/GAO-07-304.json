In preparing a detailed business plan for implementing the recommendation, the Navy increased onetime costs by $31 million or 96 percent because of costs associated with relocating employees and inflation. The Navy also decreased expected onetime savings from reduced inventory levels by $594 million or 92 percent because Navy officials believed earlier estimates were too optimistic. GAO's analysis of inventory levels for a sample of aviation items indicates that the majority of the revised savings estimate will not occur during the 6-year BRAC implementation period and the amount of such savings are uncertain at this time. GAO believes the annual recurring savings are overstated by about $53 million or 15 percent because the Navy's estimate includes $28 million in savings from eliminating military personnel, which may be assigned elsewhere rather than taken out of the force structure, and $25 million in onetime savings that was erroneously reported as recurring savings. While projected savings would remain substantial, they are still subject to some uncertainties and further efforts will be required to assess actual savings as this recommendation is implemented. The Navy faces challenges in ensuring projected savings are realized and faces some workforce challenges in implementing the recommendation. Since the Navy has already included projected BRAC savings in its budget for fiscal years 2007 through 2011, it will be important for the Navy to monitor the extent to which these savings are actually achieved to prevent adverse affects on naval aviation readiness or the need for additional funding. The Navy also faces workforce challenges, such as identifying and moving about 150 depot artisans with the right skills to various intermediate maintenance departments and integrating a primarily civilian depot workforce with the military intermediate department workforce. This mixing of diverse cultures could pose some challenges in implementation but should help develop a better trained and more productive workforce.

DOD projected these actions  would yield nearly $50 billion in net savings over a 20-year period. The  Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission evaluated DOD\u2019s  recommendations and recommended reducing the estimated 20-year net  savings by about $12 billion over a 20-year period. The BRAC Commission  recommendations were accepted by the President and the Congress, and  became effective on November 9, 2005. The recommendation to establish  six fleet readiness centers reengineers naval air maintenance, which  blends some civilian depot employees with military personnel to complete  repairs at intermediate maintenance departments. The intent behind this  action was to avoid some redundant maintenance procedures and supply  overhead charges and reduce aviation maintenance costs. DOD initially  estimated this recommendation would yield about $4.7 billion in net  savings over 20 years including onetime savings of about $648 million.", "In July 2005, we reported some uncertainty regarding the magnitude of  the expected savings from the recommendation to establish fleet readiness  centers because the estimates were based on assumptions that had  undergone limited testing, and were also dependent on transformation of  the Navy supply system. In addition, after performing its own analysis, the  BRAC Commission believed the Navy overestimated the savings that may  be achieved from business process reengineering efforts. The BRAC  Commission approved the recommendation to establish fleet readiness  centers with an estimated 20-year net savings of $3.7 billion. Of the large  number of 2005 BRAC recommendations, this recommendation is  projected to produce the most dollar savings, based on DOD\u2019s total BRAC  savings projections.", "Once the recommendation became effective, the Navy became responsible  for executing the recommendation to establish fleet readiness centers. The  Office of the Secretary of Defense required the Navy to submit a detailed  business plan for implementing the recommendation, to update estimated  costs and savings, and to provide a schedule for implementing the  recommendation. The fleet readiness center plan was approved by the  Office of the Secretary of Defense on August 1, 2006.", "This report is one in a series of reports that detail the progress DOD has  made in implementing the base closures and realignments included in the  2005 BRAC round.

In this report, we address the Navy\u2019s efforts to implement  the BRAC recommendation to establish fleet readiness centers. Our  specific objectives were to (1) analyze the reasons for changes to the costs  and savings estimates since the recommendation to establish fleet  readiness centers was amended and approved as part of the 2005 BRAC  round; and (2) identify the challenges the Navy faces in successfully  implementing this BRAC recommendation.", "To accomplish these objectives, we performed our work at the Naval Air  Systems Command headquarters, Patuxent River, Maryland; the aviation  intermediate maintenance departments at North Island, San Diego,  California; Mayport, Florida; and Whidbey Island, Oak Harbor,  Washington; and the naval aviation depots at North Island, San Diego,  California, and Jacksonville, Florida. We analyzed the changes to the costs  and savings estimates between the BRAC Commission\u2019s amended and  approved recommendation and the Navy\u2019s approved business plan and  interviewed key Navy officials to identify the reasons for changes and the  challenges they face in implementing the recommendation. To assess the  reliability of data used to generate costs and savings estimates, we  reviewed Navy regulations and instructions for reporting aviation  maintenance data and interviewed officials at the Navy Air Systems  Command, Naval Aviation Depots, and Commander, Naval Air Forces,  about the data and assumptions underlying the estimates. Based on these  discussions and observations and review of the Navy\u2019s calculations, we  believe the DOD data are sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report.

Organizational  maintenance is performed by sailors on the flight line and generally items  are repaired on the aircraft, whether at sea or at a naval station. The  intermediate maintenance activity is generally performed by sailors at the  Navy\u2019s aviation intermediate maintenance departments, which focus on  item repairs in close proximity to the flight line but off-aircraft. Depot  maintenance activities, generally performed by civilian aviation depot  artisans, provide a comprehensive combination of major repair, overhaul,  and modifications to weapons systems and components, assemblies, and  subassemblies in off-flight-line maintenance. The current aviation  maintenance process generally flows as follows: when the organizational  maintenance crews cannot fix a broken aircraft component or item, it is  sent to the intermediate department; if the intermediate maintenance  department cannot repair an item, it declares that the item is beyond its  capability of maintenance. The broken item is then turned over to the  supply system in exchange for a replacement part; and the broken item is  shipped to the depot for further repairs or overhaul.", "The recommendation to establish fleet readiness centers affects the  intermediate department and depot maintenance levels, but not the  organizational level. It involves moving about 150 artisans from the depots  to the intermediate departments to perform aviation repairs. In addition,  six fleet readiness centers will be established to transform naval aviation  maintenance at the intermediate departments and depots as seen in   figure 1.", "According to this BRAC recommendation, relocating depot artisans to  intermediate departments is expected to reduce the number of items that  are declared to be beyond the capability of maintenance at the  intermediate departments and therefore, will not require some items to be  sent to the depot for repair. As a result, repeated and duplicated  maintenance procedures are projected to be avoided and turnaround times  projected to be reduced. More specifically, prior to implementing this  recommendation, when an item is being repaired by military personnel at  the intermediate department, they perform diagnostics, disassemble the  item, and attempt to repair it. When they determine it cannot be repaired  and declare that it is beyond their capability of maintenance, the item is  reassembled, repackaged, and shipped to the depot for repair. Upon  arrival at the depot, the artisans must perform similar diagnostics, and  repeat the processes of disassembly and repair that have already been  performed at the intermediate department. According to Navy officials,  after fleet readiness centers are established, the depot artisans positioned  at the intermediate departments are expected to be able to complete more  repairs there, which will reduce or eliminate some packaging, shipping,  and administrative costs as seen in figure 2.", "At the time DOD originally submitted its recommendations to the BRAC  Commission, it estimated this recommendation would yield $341 million in  annual recurring savings, or $4.7 billion net savings over 20 years. The  preponderance of the annual recurring savings was expected to come  from fewer items being sent to the depots for repair, thus reducing per  item maintenance costs. DOD also expected to achieve significant onetime  savings by reducing existing inventory levels of aircraft component parts.  In July 2005, we reported that while there is potential for significant  savings, there is some uncertainty over the full magnitude of savings. Our  report noted that the Navy used assumptions that had undergone limited  testing, and the full savings realization depends upon the transformation of  the Navy\u2019s supply system to achieve organizational efficiencies. Moreover,  we pointed out that realizing the full extent of the savings would depend  on actual implementation of the recommended actions.", "The BRAC Commission also believed DOD\u2019s overall estimated savings  were overstated because savings were derived from overhead efficiencies  that had not been validated. The commission projected annual recurring  savings of about $248 million a year or $3.7 billion net present value  savings over a 20-year period\u2014about $1 billion less than the DOD\u2019s  estimate. Also, the commission reduced the estimated savings because it  eliminated the proposed realignment of workload from the Naval Support  Activity in Crane, Indiana, to Whidbey Island, Washington, since the Navy  planned to phase out the aircraft associated with the proposed workload  transfer in 10 to 15 years regardless of BRAC. In addition, the commission  found errors in DOD\u2019s estimation of construction costs and the savings  projections based on eliminated personnel.", "The President and the Congress accepted the BRAC Commission  recommendations, which became effective on November 9, 2005. Once the  recommendations became effective, the Office of the Secretary of Defense  designated one of the military services or defense agencies as the business  manager responsible for implementing each recommendation. The Navy is  responsible for establishing the six fleet readiness centers. The Office of  the Secretary of Defense also required the Navy to submit a detailed  business plan to update estimated costs and savings and identify a  schedule for implementing the recommendation. The Navy\u2019s detailed  business plan was approved to implement the recommendation to  establish fleet readiness centers on August 1, 2006.

According to  Navy officials, the initial inventory savings estimate was overly optimistic.  In addition, the lower estimate was based on the BRAC Commission\u2019s  determination that the Navy\u2019s projected savings were overstated because  the commission found errors in the Navy\u2019s savings estimates. Additionally,  our July 2005 report stated that the magnitude of the expected savings for  the fleet readiness centers is in part dependent upon transformation of the  Navy\u2019s supply system, such as eliminating unneeded management  structures and duplicate layers of inventory in the supply system.", "DOD\u2019s original submission to the BRAC Commission assumed that the  dollar value of the inventory of aircraft components and replacement parts  could be reduced by 15 percent. According to Navy officials, the   15 percent savings factor was based on the professional judgment of the  Industrial Joint Cross Service Group members. They expected savings  because fewer items would need to be kept in the shore-based aviation  consolidated inventory because items would be getting repaired more  quickly and returned to the inventory faster. However, the Navy officials  stated that they did not have time during the BRAC process to discuss the  estimated inventory and supply savings with officials from the Navy  Supply Command to validate the estimate. Navy officials stated that they  estimated the onetime savings from inventory reductions ($648 million) by  multiplying the 15 percent factor times the total dollar value of the  inventory and supply of aircraft components and replacement parts in  fiscal year 2003.", "In developing the business plan, the Navy reduced the inventory and  supply savings factor from 15 percent to less than 4 percent based on  discussions with Naval Supply Command officials and a better  understanding of how other BRAC recommendations affected DOD\u2019s and  Navy\u2019s supply system. Specifically, two other recommendations involved  significant savings projections from reengineering DOD\u2019s inventory and  supply system and the reconfiguration of supply, storage, and distribution  management. After considering how these other BRAC recommendations  could affect the Navy\u2019s projected inventory and supply savings estimates,  Navy officials concluded there would be a greater potential overlap of  savings with the fleet readiness center BRAC recommendation.

In addition, we estimate that  projected annual recurring savings increased by approximately $42 million  due to inflation.", "The BRAC Commission projected annual recurring savings of about   $10 million from eliminating about 120 military positions, while the Navy  business plan includes about $28 million in annual recurring savings from  eliminating about 290 military positions as originally planned. Regardless  of the number of military personnel affected by the recommendations, as  we reported in July 2005, the projected net annual recurring savings  associated with eliminating jobs currently held by military personnel could  create a false sense of savings available for other purposes because they  do not represent dollar savings that can be readily reallocated outside the  military personnel accounts. Rather than reduce end strength, these  positions are expected to be reassigned to other areas, which may  enhance capabilities but also limit dollar savings available for other uses.", "The Navy incorrectly reported onetime savings as annual recurring savings  in its business plan. Navy officials stated that $25 million onetime savings  were incorrectly categorized as annual recurring savings in its business  plan. These onetime savings included reductions in aviation depot level  repair charges, decreased spare parts inventory, and reduced materials to  repair aviation components. As a result of the fleet readiness center  implementation to date, Navy has begun to reduce its current spare parts  inventory, which translates into less physical space needed to store the  inventory and fewer sailors needed to manage it. However, GAO believes  that the Navy\u2019s business plan should correctly report the   $25 million as onetime savings and not annual recurring savings.", "Increases in the Navy\u2019s annual recurring savings estimates were offset to  some degree by decreases in projected savings expected from reduced  facility costs. According to the Navy officials, the projected reductions in  personnel should result in reducing floor space for numerous work shops,  but they will not free up enough space to allow the Navy to vacate any  buildings at this time. Since no buildings will be vacated, the Navy reduced  the annual recurring savings expected from facilities maintenance by  about $3 million. Navy officials indicated that as fleet readiness center  implementation progresses, there may be opportunities to combine similar  work shops at some sites, which may result in entire buildings being  vacated, and produce savings in the funding for facilities maintenance. If  this occurs, a Navy official noted the business plan would be updated to  reflect these savings.", "In addition, Navy\u2019s implementation efforts are beginning to show savings.

If savings are not realized, the Navy may  need to get funds from another Navy program or request additional funds  to offset unrealized savings or be unable to repair aviation components in  a timely manner, which could impact readiness.

As depot artisans begin to work in intermediate maintenance  departments, adequate systems and management commitment for  verifying the amount of public-sector depot maintenance is necessary to  comply with 50/50 requirements. We previously reported that the Navy did  not maintain documentation to support the amounts in its 50/50 report and  no formal training on procedural requirements or Navy guidance to  develop and report the 50/50 data was provided to the personnel  responsible for compiling the data. Our report noted that persistent  deficiencies limit the accuracy and usefulness of DOD\u2019s funding allocation  data reported to the Congress, and further, that it is difficult to project out- year data due to factors such as changing depot maintenance requirements  and the ongoing consolidation of maintenance facilities. When the fleet  readiness centers are implemented, depot artisans will be stationed at the  intermediate departments and must document the depot maintenance  performed, which is used for entry into the depot accounting system and  the Naval Aviation Logistics Command/Management Information System.  The Navy has drafted a handbook that provides procedures and quality  assurance for the required details of documentation by the artisans. For  example, all maintenance documentation goes through layers of quality  assurance such as validation specifications within the Naval Aviation  Logistics Command/Management Information System, production controls  that approve each component before moving it back into the supply  system, database administrator screening, and a final reality check by the  fleet readiness center command subject matter experts."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Although projected savings from establishing fleet readiness center remain  significant, it appears likely that the majority of onetime savings from  reduced inventory levels may not occur as expected during the BRAC  implementation period, and projected long-term savings are likely  overstated. To accurately account for and report BRAC savings, the Navy  business plan to establish fleet readiness centers should include onetime  savings that will be achieved during the implementation period and long- term savings that are directly attributed to implementing the  recommendation. While the Navy has recognized the need to assess  progress against goals and track savings, our prior work has shown that  sustained leadership and follow-through will be important to ensure the  recommendation is successfully implemented."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve the reporting of savings projected from BRAC 2005  recommendations, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the  Secretary of the Navy to    update the business plan for the fleet readiness centers (1) to reflect only  savings that are directly related to implementing the recommendation, and  (2) update projected onetime savings when data are available; and    monitor implementation of the recommendation to determine the extent  that savings already taken from the Navy budget are actually achieved.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional  committees; the Secretaries of Defense and the Navy; and the Director,  Office of Management and Budget.

DOD noted that it considers military personnel  reductions attributable to a BRAC recommendation as real savings. It  noted that while the department may not reduce end strength, these  reductions allow the department to reapply these military personnel to  support new capabilities. We believe the department counting of savings  from eliminating military personnel positions, without corresponding  reductions in end strength, creates a false sense of savings available for  other purposes because they do not represent dollar savings that can be  readily reallocated outside the military personnel accounts. We do agree  that assigning these positions to other areas may enhance capabilities.  DOD\u2019s written comments are reprinted in appendix III. DOD also provided  technical comments, which we have incorporated into this report as  appropriate.", "If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me  on (202) 512-4523 or leporeb@gao.gov.

We focused on the major factors that affected  projected onetime costs, onetime savings, and annual recurring savings.  We determined the reasonableness of these estimates by reviewing and  analyzing source data and the methodology used to generate savings  estimates and interviewing Navy officials who prepared these estimates.  We discussed the reasons for variances in costs and savings estimates  between the BRAC Commission and the approved business plan with Navy  officials. To analyze projected onetime savings from reduced levels of  aircraft component inventory, we took a judgmental sample of 99 items  targeted for inventory reduction. We calculated the years of supply for  each item using its required inventory level, inventory on-hand, excess on- hand inventory, condition, and recurring and nonrecurring demands. Our  analysis was reviewed by Navy Supply System officials. We analyzed the  business plan to identify the major elements that contributed to projected  annual recurring savings. Our analysis indicated that the business plan  included savings from an initiative to reduce aviation maintenance costs  referred to as AirSpeed. We interviewed Navy officials to determine the  relationship of AirSpeed to the BRAC recommendation. To assess the  reliability of the data used to generate estimates of costs and savings and  the validity of underlying assumptions used to generate cost and savings  estimates, we reviewed Navy regulations and instructions for reporting  aviation maintenance data and interviewed officials at Navy Air Systems  Command, Navy Aviation depots, Navy Aviation Intermediate Maintenance  Departments, and Naval Supply Systems Command knowledgeable about  the data and the assumptions underlying estimated costs and savings.  Based on this, we believe that the assumptions underlying estimated costs  and savings are generally valid, and that the data used were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report.", "To determine the challenges to successfully implement the fleet readiness  centers, we analyzed pertinent documents and reports and interviewed  officials responsible for developing the original proposal and the business  plan. We also interviewed Navy officials at the Aircraft Intermediate  Maintenance Departments at Whidbey Island, Washington; North Island,  California; and Mayport, Florida; and at Naval Aviation Depots at North  Island, California, and Jacksonville, Florida. In addition, we also reviewed  statutes related to continuing congressional oversight of annual depot  maintenance funding, related reports, and court cases involving depot  personnel.", "We conducted our work from February 2006 to March 2007 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Fleet Readiness Centers Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["165.
