The department has guidance for interagency agreements--the largest category of interagency contracting at the department--but does not have specific guidance for using other types of contracts such as the General Services Administration (GSA) schedules and governmentwide acquisition contracts (GWAC), which amounted to almost $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2005. Moreover, in some cases we found users may have lacked expertise that could be addressed through guidance and training on the use of these types of contracts. DHS did not always consider alternatives to ensure good value when selecting among interagency contracts. While this contracting method is often chosen because it requires less planning than establishing a new contract, evaluating the selection of an interagency contract is important because not all interagency contracts provide good value when considering timeliness and cost. As of July 2005 DHS has required planning and analysis of alternatives for all acquisitions. In this review, we found that in all four cases for which an analysis of alternatives was required, it was not conducted. DHS officials said benefits of speed and convenience--not total value including cost--have often driven decisions to choose these types of contracts. DHS does not systematically monitor its total spending on interagency contacts and does not assess the outcomes of its use of this contracting method. According to officials, DHS' acquisition oversight program has been hindered by limited resources and authority. As of August 2006, the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer had five staff assigned to departmentwide oversight responsibilities for $17.5 billion in acquisitions. In March 2005, GAO recommended that the Chief Procurement Officer be provided sufficient authority to provide effective oversight of DHS' acquisition policies and procedures. Without this authority, DHS cannot be certain that acquisition improvements are made."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) performs a comprehensive  homeland security mission encompassing protecting the nation\u2019s borders,  airports and critical infrastructure, and response and recovery in the event  of national emergencies. DHS meets these goals with some of the most  extensive acquisitions within the federal government. Now one of the  largest procuring agencies, DHS spent about $17.5 billion on contracted  purchases in fiscal year 2005. Over $6.5 billion, or approximately   37 percent of the department\u2019s total fiscal year 2005 contract dollars, was  for purchases made through the use of other agencies\u2019 contracts and  contracting services, a process known as interagency contracting. While  these types of contracts offer the benefits of efficiency and convenience,  in January 2005, GAO noted shortcomings and designated the management  of interagency contracting as a governmentwide high-risk area. Our work  and the work of others has identified the need for improved guidance and  expertise, planning, and oversight to manage and mitigate the risks of  these types of contracts. In March 2005, we reported that DHS was not  effectively managing acquisition, in particular interagency purchases, of  the multitude of goods and services it needed to meet its mission.", "Given the department\u2019s critical national security mission and the results of  our earlier work, you asked us to review the extent to which DHS manages  interagency contracting.

Each  case represented $5 million or more in orders placed through several types  of interagency contracting arrangements in fiscal year 2005. These cases  represented orders placed by DHS\u2019 Office of Procurement Operations  (OPO), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and Coast Guard, which  were the largest users of interagency contracts in fiscal year 2005. We  interviewed senior procurement officials at the three components and at  the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer (OCPO), interviewed  contracting officers and program managers at the three components, and  reviewed the guidance and oversight at the departmental level and at the  components to address the management and planning of interagency  contracting. We obtained data on procurement actions from DHS and  compared it with data from the Federal Procurement Data System-Next  Generation (FPDS-NG) and determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable for our purposes. For more information on our scope and  methodology, see appendix I. We conducted our work from February  through August 2006 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, federal agencies have been making greater use of  interagency contracting\u2014a process by which agencies can use another  agency\u2019s contracting services or existing contracts already awarded by  other agencies to procure many goods and services. An agency can enter  into an interagency agreement with a servicing agency and transfer funds  to the servicing agency to conduct the acquisition on its behalf, or an  agency can order directly from a servicing agency\u2019s contract, such as the  GSA schedules or GWACs. When funds are transferred to another agency,  the contracting service can be provided through entrepreneurial, fee-for- service organizations, which are government-run but operate like  businesses. Interagency contracts are designed to leverage the  government\u2019s aggregate buying power and simplify procurement of  commonly used goods and services. In this way, the contracts offer the  benefits of improved efficiency and timeliness in the procurement process.", "Determining the value of a particular contracting method includes  considering benefits such as timeliness and efficiency as well as cost-- including price and fees. Although interagency contracts can provide the  advantages of timeliness and efficiency, use of these types of vehicles can  also pose risks if they are not properly managed. GAO designated  management of interagency contracting a governmentwide high-risk area  in 2005. A number of factors make these types of contracts high risk,  including their rapid growth in popularity along with their administration  and use by some agencies that have limited expertise with this contracting  method, and their contribution to a much more complex procurement  environment in which accountability has not always been clearly  established. In an interagency contracting arrangement, both the agency  that holds, and the agency that makes purchases against, the contract  share responsibility for properly managing the use of the contract.  However, these shared responsibilities often have not been well-defined.  As a result, our work and that of some inspectors general has found cases  in which interagency contracting has not been well-managed to ensure  that the government was getting good value. For example, in our review of  the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) use of two franchise funds, we found  that the organizations providing these services did not always obtain the  full benefits of competitive procedures, did not otherwise ensure fair and  reasonable prices, and may have missed opportunities to achieve savings  on millions of dollars in purchases. In another review, we found task  orders placed by DOD on a GSA schedule contract did not satisfy legal  requirements for competition because the work was not within the scope  of the underlying contract. Recent inspector general reviews have found  similar cases. For example, the Inspector General for the Department of  the Interior found that task orders for interrogators and other intelligence  services in Iraq were improperly awarded under a GSA schedule contract  for information technology services.", "The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) is the primary regulation  governing how most agencies acquire supplies and services with  appropriated funds. The regulation provides general guidance for  interagency agreements that fall under the authority of the Economy Act  and for the GSA schedules and GWACs. The FAR precludes agency  acquisition regulations that unnecessarily repeat, paraphrase, or otherwise  restate the FAR, limits agency acquisition regulations to those necessary  to implement FAR policies and procedures within an agency, and provides  for coordination, simplicity, and uniformity in the federal acquisition  process. There are several types of interagency contracting. For more  information on those included in our review, see appendix II.", "DHS spends significant and increasing amounts through interagency  contracting\u2014a total of $6.5 billion in fiscal year 2005, including $5 billion  through interagency agreements and about $1.5 billion by placing orders  off other agencies\u2019 contracts (see fig. 1). DHS\u2019 total spending on  interagency contracting increased by about 73 percent in just 1 year.", "DHS was established as of March 1, 2003, by merging the functions of   23 agencies and organizations that specialize in one or more aspects of  homeland security. OCPO is responsible for creating departmentwide  policies and processes to achieve integration and to manage and oversee  the acquisition function but does not have enforcement authority to  ensure that initiatives are carried out.", "There are seven acquisition offices within DHS that pre-date the formation  of DHS and continue to operate at the components. OPO was formed with  the new department to serve the newly established entities and those  components that did not have a separate procurement operation. Of those  that pre-date DHS, the Coast Guard and CBP provide different examples of  the types of components that formed DHS. The Coast Guard, previously  under the Department of Transportation, already had an extensive  procurement operation, whereas CBP was created by combining the  United States Customs Service, formerly part of the Department of the  Treasury, Border Patrol and the inspectional parts of the Immigration and  Naturalization Service, and portions of the Department of Agriculture\u2019s  Animal Plant and Health Inspection Service. Thus, CBP has been faced  with the added challenge of creating a procurement organization to meet  its new mission.

Moreover, we found that some DHS users may have lacked  expertise in the proper use of interagency contracts.

However, as we reported in March 2005, the  directive was not being followed for purchases made through these  agreements. For example, there was little indication that required analyses  of alternatives were performed or that required oversight was in place.  Although DHS began revising the directive in fiscal year 2004, the revisions  have yet to be issued. According to OCPO officials, its limited policy and  oversight resources provide assistance to the components as needed,  taking time away from acquisition policy efforts, such as developing  guidance.

Eight of the 16 contracting officers we interviewed at  OPO, CBP, and Coast Guard told us that using interagency contracts was a  quick and convenient way to acquire needed products and services. A few  DHS contracting officers felt that interagency contracts\u2014in particular,  GSA schedules\u2014were the only viable alternatives given time constraints.  In some cases, officials told us that it could take 4 to 6 months to establish  and obtain goods and services through an in-house contract.

However, we found  that GSA schedule prices may not always be the most competitive, and  agencies do not always obtain the required competition when using the  schedules, thus, there is no assurance that these contracts are providing  good value. In another review, we found that fees charged by the agency  that provides the contracting service may not make these contracts cost- effective in some cases. Purchasing agencies also sometimes pay fee on  top of fee for the use of another agency\u2019s contract because servicing  agencies may be using other agencies\u2019 contracts\u2014including GSA  schedules\u2014to make purchases. Fees charged for the use of GWACs also  range between 0.65 and 5 percent.

In one case, CBP used FedSim, one of GSA\u2019s  contracting service providers, to place an order for $9 million for  information technology support for systems security. In another case, CBP  transferred $5 million to a franchise fund for the purchase of license plate  readers. In the two remaining cases, OPO used FedSim to place orders  totaling about $45 million against one contract to provide information  technology support for the Homeland Secure Data Network.

These findings  are consistent with our March 2005 review, in which we did not find an  analysis of alternatives in 94 percent of the cases where it was required.  Recent internal reviews at OPO and CBP cited similar findings in which  evidence that a determination of findings or an analysis of alternatives was  conducted was missing.", "In our review of 17 cases, we also found several examples where  contracting officers placed orders to fulfill what were perceived to be  critical needs, for convenience without comparing alternatives, or to  spend funds at the end of the fiscal year without obtaining competing  proposals.

However, DHS does not have available information to make comparable  assessments for interagency contracts. For example, DHS officials were  not able to readily provide data on the amounts spent through different  types of interagency contracts.

This will be accomplished in part through the use of new  departmentwide contracts for information technology equipment and  services.  We believe this is a positive step toward improving DHS\u2019  contract management.", "In responding to the Matter for Congressional Consideration that the  Secretary report on efforts to provide the Chief Procurement Officer with  sufficient authority over procurement activities, DHS noted some steps  that the Secretary has taken to improve acquisition oversight.   revised the investment review process, placing the Chief Procurement  Officer in a key position to review and provide oversight of the  Department\u2019s most critical programs;    supported an increase of 25 OCPO positions to improve acquisition and    directed the Chief Procurement Officer to work with all component  heads to report on departmentwide progress in key acquisition areas.", "While these actions should help, they do not provide the Chief  Procurement Officer with sufficient authority to ensure effective oversight  of DHS\u2019 acquisition policies and procedures, and we continue to believe  that the Congress should require the Secretary to report on efforts to  address this lack of authority.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of the Department of  Homeland Security, and to other interested agencies and congressional  committees. We will also make copies available to others upon request. In  addition, this report will be available at no charge on the GAO Web site at  http://www.gao.gov.", "If you have any questions about this report or need additional information,  please contact me at (202) 512-4841 (huttonj@gao.gov).

We compiled a summary of purchases made through  interagency agreements, the General Service Administration\u2019s schedules  and governmentwide acquisition contracts (GWAC) from the individual  reports we received from each component. We found that the Office of  Procurement Operations (OPO), Customs and Border Protection (CBP),  and Coast Guard were the largest users of interagency contracts in fiscal  year 2005. Based on a review of this data, we selected 17 cases, totaling  $245 million. Interagency contracting actions for these components  represented a sample of GSA schedule, GWAC, and interagency  transactions made through fee-for-service contracting providers. See table  5. The 17 cases were selected to represent procurement actions of   $5 million or more at three DHS components. Because our findings  included similar problems across these activities, we believe they  represent common problems in DHS\u2019 procurement process. To assess the  reliability of this data, we compared the data obtained from DHS to the  data maintained in the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation  (FPDS-NG). Based upon the comparison, we determined that the data  were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To assess the extent to which DHS manages the risks of interagency  contracting, we reviewed guidance and oversight at the departmental level  and at the three components in our sample\u2014OPO, CBP and Coast Guard,  and we interviewed officials in the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer  (OCPO) and senior officials of the components under review. To  determine how other large agencies address the management risks of  interagency contracting, we reviewed relevant guidance and training at the  Departments of Defense and Energy. We also reviewed relevant GAO and  Inspector General reports.", "To assess DHS planning for the use of interagency contracts, we  conducted fieldwork at CBP\u2019s National Acquisition Center in Indianapolis,  Indiana; National Data Center in Springfield, Virginia; and at the Coast  Guard\u2019s procurement office in Norfolk, Virginia, and reviewed contract  files and completed a data collection instrument for each of the 17 cases  we selected. We also interviewed the contracting officer, program  manager and Contracting Officer\u2019s Technical Representative to discuss  each case. In conducting our review, we identified the reasons for using  interagency contracts and the reasons for choosing a particular  interagency contract.", "We performed our review between February and August 2006 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Department of Homeland Security Interagency Contracting", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}], "fastfact": []}
