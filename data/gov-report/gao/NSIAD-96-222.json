In 1991, Congress authorized DOD to establish a CTR program to help these states (1) destroy weapons of mass destruction, (2) store and transport the weapons in connection with their destruction, and (3) reduce the risk of proliferation.", "Congress has provided about $1.5 billion in fiscal years 1992-96 to address CTR objectives. As shown in figure 1, DOD has allocated nearly three-quarters of these funds to delivery vehicle and infrastructure dismantlement and destruction and to improving nuclear material controls. It has allocated the remainder to demilitarizing defense activities, destroying chemical weapons, and other efforts. CTR program officials have significantly increased obligations in recent years. As of August 5, 1996, the program had obligated over $1 billion and disbursed $571 million (see app. I for a breakdown of CTR funding notifications, obligations, and disbursements). The CTR program generally procures goods and services for CTR recipient countries instead of providing funds directly to them.", "In 1994 we reported that the program\u2019s projects could have widely varying effects and that DOD had not estimated total requirements for achieving program objectives. We recommended that the Secretary of Defense institute a long-term planning process to help allocate CTR funds among competing demands.

The CTR program office used the project plans, which are updated semi-annually, as the basis of its overall plan.", "In contrast to the previous CTR multiyear plan, the December 1995 draft contained more detailed data concerning several CTR projects and was sometimes more candid in its description of the challenges facing CTR projects than the preceding plan. The draft plan also detailed, for the first time, the program\u2019s measures for assessing the effectiveness of CTR efforts. In its description of these measures, the plan noted that the program lacks the data and tools needed to independently assess the effectiveness of CTR chemical weapons and nuclear safety projects in achieving CTR objectives of reducing the threat from weapons of mass destruction. It indicated that such projects would instead be assessed in terms of their achievement of project milestones. The plan also indicated that the success of delivery vehicle destruction projects will be evaluated by determining the NIS countries\u2019 progress in meeting Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) drawdown schedules. In doing so, the plan noted that the program will only be able to link such progress to specific CTR projects by using recipient-country statements\u2014rather than on any available quantifiable data.", "Despite these improvements over the prior multiyear plan, the December 1995 draft plan had some deficiencies. We found that it did not always fully depict known project uncertainties nor did it reveal the wide variations in certainty of the project cost estimates embedded in its depictions of program cost. For example, the draft plan did not distinguish between cost estimates based on contracts that had already been awarded or completed and estimates based on little or no design data.

Although the CTR program office completed its draft in December 1995, DOD did not complete action on the plan in time to submit it with the President budget\u2019s submission in April 1996. According to DOD officials, DOD failed to issue the plan primarily because the CTR program office could not quickly revise the draft plan to make it fully consistent with the President\u2019s budget submission for fiscal year 1997. Such revisions were called for because the plan\u2019s 1996 spending assumptions had been rendered obsolete by the Fiscal Year 1996 National Defense Authorization Act\u2014which was not enacted until February 1996. Officials in the DOD Comptroller\u2019s office did not want to release the draft plan because it was not consistent with the President\u2019s budget submission for 1997.

DOD plans to award a contract by the end of September 1996. The mobile analytical laboratories are to (1) monitor and analyze environmental and verification samples at storage and destruction sites to assess the impact of chemical weapons destruction operations, (2) train personnel to operate destruction site laboratories and mobile labs, and (3) address public concerns about the safety of chemical weapons destruction activities. According to program officials, the mobile labs will cost $3 million, including vehicles, training, travel, and spare parts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Estimated Costs of Chemical Weapon Destruction", "paragraphs": ["The CTR program\u2019s chemical weapon destruction project costs have been modest to date, relative to other CTR projects, but could increase greatly in the future. DOD has allocated $68 million in fiscal year 1992-96 CTR funds for chemical weapons destruction. DOD has asked Congress for another $78.5 million in fiscal year 1997 to continue program support. DOD will use the funds to further develop chemical and munitions processing equipment and systems and to begin designing the pilot facility. A 1995 CTR estimate\u2014prepared without site-specific data\u2014indicated that the pilot facility could ultimately cost as much as $900 million to build.", "To date, the CTR program has not asked for construction funds and has not committed to provide Russia more than $68 million in chemical destruction aid. U.S. and Russian experts have agreed to amend their bilateral assistance agreement annually to reflect yearly funding requirements\u2014thus limiting the project\u2019s annual financial obligation to the amount agreed upon in the annual amendment.", "Regardless of this arrangement, however, the total cost of the facility\u2014and the U.S. share of that cost\u2014remains undefined and potentially large. CTR officials told us that they hope to prepare a more certain cost estimate, based on a one-third completed design, in 1998. However, this estimate would not be ready until after DOD will have submitted its request for fiscal year 1998 funding. CTR officials told us that they do not plan to cap the program\u2019s total contribution to the project at a certain level, as they have for the Mayak project.

According to a program document, without direct U.S. involvement in Russian chemical weapons elimination, the CTR program lacks the data, control cases, and risk assessment models needed to assess these projects\u2019 impact on the Russian chemical weapon threat. Moreover, DOD officials note that they cannot assess the program\u2019s impact because Russia will not complete the task of destroying chemical weapons until after the CTR program ends in 2001. Nevertheless, DOD stated that Russian movement toward that goal will allow DOD to assess progress.", "While providing Russia with a proven chemical weapon elimination technology and a functioning pilot chemical weapon destruction facility capable of destroying 500 metric tons annually would greatly expand Russia\u2019s current capabilities, the sheer size of the Russian stockpile will limit the pilot facility\u2019s direct impact. The pilot would require more than a decade to destroy the artillery shells that constitute the site\u2019s 14 percent share of the total Russian stockpile. It would not address Russia\u2019s need to construct additional facilities at six more sites in time to meet the Chemical Weapons Convention\u2019s time frames.", "CTR officials acknowledge that the pilot facility will not address Russia\u2019s overall Chemical Weapons Convention requirements and suggest instead that the U.S-funded pilot facility could help \u201cjump start\u201d the slow-moving Russian effort to destroy its stockpiles. However, there are few current indications that Russia will find the needed resources. Russia estimates that it will need roughly $3.3 billion in January 1995 dollars to destroy the stockpile, according to its comprehensive plan. Russian officials told us in March 1996 that they lack such resources and are seeking non-Russian government sources of support.", "However, foreign aid for this effort is very limited. Aid being provided by Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States falls far short of Russia\u2019s stated requirements.
