Under federal law, to be eligible for benefits, individuals are generally required to actively search for work, but the specific work search requirements vary by state. Yet, states found that some benefits were overpaid to UI claimants who were ineligible because they were not meeting work search requirements. GAO was asked to review improper payments due to UI claimants' failure to actively search for work. Building on GAO's prior work ( GAO-18-133R ), this report examines (1) state administrative practices associated with work search overpayments; (2) selected states' approaches to address work search overpayments; and (3) DOL's oversight and support of states' efforts.", "GAO analyzed DOL data, including the results of state reviews of a representative random sample of UI payments made from fiscal years 2013 through 2017.

According to DOL data, 22 states were warning claimants after the first discovered occurrence of their failure to meet work search requirements (i.e., issuing formal warnings) rather than reporting that an overpayment was made, while the other states were reporting such cases as overpayments. In 2017, DOL determined that federal law does not permit states to use such policies. GAO's analysis of DOL data shows that in fiscal year 2017, estimated work search overpayments were nearly $1.4 billion (see fig.), but would have been an estimated $1.8 billion (+/-$0.2 billion) greater if states had not issued formal warnings and established overpayments. DOL officials told GAO in July 2017 that the agency would issue a letter to states informing them that federal law does not permit them to warn claimants instead of establishing an overpayment. To date, DOL has not issued the letter. Until DOL provides states with such notification, states may continue to report inconsistent information on overpayments.", "State officials GAO interviewed reported using multiple approaches to address work search overpayments, including using their online systems that automate collecting information on claimants' work search activities; conducting audits of claimants work search activities beyond those required; and sending automated messages to claimants regarding their work search requirements. Officials said that their approaches encouraged claimants to conduct a more active work search and prevented work search overpayments in some cases.", "DOL monitors states' work search overpayment rate estimates and has helped states address such overpayments, but lacks clear procedures for how states should verify claimants' work search activities. DOL directs states to verify a \u201csufficient\u201d number of work search activities during their audits but has not provided information on what is considered sufficient. DOL data show that some states did not review claimants' work search activities for a majority of audited cases.

By clarifying these procedures, DOL will have greater assurance that states are complying with verification requirements."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making four recommendations to DOL, including that it provide states information about its determination that the use of state formal warning policies is no longer permissible and clarify its work search verification requirements.

Specifically, according to DOL, federal law  requires that when an eligibility issue is detected, the claimant has a right  to receive notice and provide the state information before being denied  benefits. In addition, if an eligibility issue associated with work search,  or any other matter, is detected but not resolved, the state is still required  to pay for a claimed week no later than the week after an eligibility issue  is detected, according to DOL.

The national  work search overpayment rate for such claimants also increased during  this time. (See table 9 in app. II for additional details.) According to DOL  officials, some states implemented more stringent work search  requirements, which may account for the recent trend. As work search  requirements become more stringent, the opportunities for non- compliance and errors increase and thus higher improper payment rates,  according to DOL officials. While the national work search overpayment  rate was 4.5 percent in fiscal year 2017, state work search overpayment  rates varied widely from an estimated 0 to 41 percent of the UI benefits  that states paid in fiscal year 2017.

Until DOL informs states of  the need to discontinue the use of formal warnings through a letter or  another mechanism, states will continue to be inconsistent in whether  they count as overpayments cases in which claimants who failed to  search for work in any week were provided benefits. Additionally, once  DOL provides additional information to states on formal warnings, it  should monitor states\u2019 responses to help ensure that DOL achieves its  desired results.

Some of the approaches states used were specifically designed for  UI claimants participating in state reemployment programs.", "State officials cited several benefits of the approaches they use to  address work search overpayments. The online systems, work search  audits, and messaging helped prompt work search activities and prevent  work search overpayments in some cases, according to state officials.  According to officials from the selected states that used them and a study  on work search improper payments, online systems can facilitate the work  search reporting and verification in several ways:", "Automatically documenting the claimants\u2019 work search activities.", "Online reporting of work search activities can help prevent  overpayments because their work search is documented in the online  claims system, which means the claimant does not need to keep a  work search log. In addition, online job search/training systems can  be used to track the work search activities completed by claimants,  making it easier for the state to verify that the work search was  completed. For example, officials in Mississippi and Indiana told us  they piloted an online system called NextJob and required RESEA  program participants to conduct work search activities through the  system. Mississippi officials reported that NextJob motivated  claimants to conduct their job search and increased the speed of  reemployment among these individuals. Similarly, New Jersey officials  told us that UI claimants selected to participate in New Jersey\u2019s  RESEA program are required to use an online job search and training  system called OnRamp, which, for example, allows job seekers to  create or upload their resume on the website, search for jobs, access  online training, and receive email alerts on potential job matches. In  addition, officials in Nevada said that the online reporting system is  beneficial because the work search activities are documented in the  system and are more reliably retrieved if the claimant is selected for a  BAM audit because few claimants maintain and retain their work  search effort logs.", "Performing automated checks on data the claimants submit. The  online claims systems can identify potentially duplicate job contacts  and check whether the claimant reported the required number of job  contacts. For example, Utah officials reported that if a claimant enters  job contacts from another week, officials would follow up with the  claimant by phone after it is flagged by their online system. If  claimants report self-disqualifying information, such as an insufficient  number of job contacts, the system can automatically put a hold on a  claim until the issue is resolved.", "Facilitating communication with the claimant. Some states added  messages to their online claims system that pop up if the claimant  enters incorrect or insufficient information. For example, Mississippi  officials stated that they used messaging to better inform claimants of  their responsibilities and to encourage them to report accurate  information. According to the officials, if claimants do not report the  required number of work search activities in the online system, a  questionnaire will pop up requesting that the claimants explain why  they did not do so. The system requires the claimants to enter more  information in order to submit their claims and to receive their benefit  payments. Mississippi officials also stated that adding targeted  messaging resulted in fewer denials of benefits due to claimant failure  to meet work search requirements and also reduced the number of  appeals related to this type of denial. Some state officials said that  messaging encouraged accurate reporting. For example, Indiana  officials told us that at the end of the online claim filing process,  claimants receive a message notifying them of the state\u2019s work search  requirements and informing them that they are required to search for  work to continue receiving benefits. In Utah, officials developed a  video that covers claimants\u2019 responsibilities, including work search  requirements, which claimants must view before receiving their initial  benefit payment, according to state officials.", "Officials in three of the states we reviewed reported using additional work  search audits beyond BAM to help reinforce their state policies.  Pennsylvania officials reported conducting 7,182 work search audits for  RESEA program participants in 2016. As a result, officials reported that  the state issued 1,300 warnings to claimants. The two other states\u2014 Mississippi and Utah\u2014report that their random work search audits,  coupled with their online systems, helped prevent work search  overpayments as they are able to disqualify claims before the payment  goes out. Mississippi and Utah officials also reported that they were also  able to identify and recover some work search overpayments (see table  3).", "Despite implementing these approaches, state officials in five of the six  states we contacted told us they face challenges with verifying work  search activities. These officials stated that they have difficulty verifying  work search activities as some claimants do not understand the work  search requirements or do not keep accurate records of their work search  activities, which makes it difficult for the state to confirm compliance with  the state requirements. In addition, state officials also said that many  employers do not keep records of job seekers\u2019 inquiries or do not respond  to state requests for information when they are trying to verify claimants\u2019  work search activities. For example, Nevada officials said that work  search contacts are often virtually unverifiable as many companies  outsource their hiring processes to contractors who refer the job  candidate for a job posting and keep the job application. Officials said  these contractors also rarely respond to state inquiries about claimants\u2019  job applications.

The plans include a summary of  state performance on various measures related to operating the UI  program, including the improper payment rate, according to DOL  documentation we reviewed. States with estimated improper payment  rates of 10 percent or more are required to submit corrective action plans  to DOL.

While  the direction and magnitude of the relationship between estimated work  search overpayment rates and the fraction of cases with claimants  required to search for work was generally similar across specifications, it  was not always statistically significant. The direction, magnitude, and  statistical significance of the relationship between estimated work search  overpayment rates and the fraction of cases for which BAM auditors  investigated job contacts was generally similar across specifications, with  the exception of the linear model with clustered standard errors, where it  was not statistically significant.

Sampling errors are errors  that arise in a data collection process as a result of taking a sample from  a population rather than using the whole population. Non-sampling errors  are errors or biases that arise in a data collection process as a result of  factors other than taking a sample, such as the timeliness of data  collection, data entry errors, biased questions in fact-finding, biased  decision-making, and inappropriate analysis and conclusions completed  by state investigators or false or inaccurate information provided by  survey respondents. We express our confidence in the precision of our  results by reporting the margins of error associated with 95 percent  confidence intervals. This is the interval that would contain the actual  population value for 95 percent of the samples the respective agency  could have drawn.", "In addition, it may be misleading to compare one state's work search  overpayment rates with another state's rates.
