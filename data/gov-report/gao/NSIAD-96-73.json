Quantitative assessment methods mathematically quantify risk on the basis of engineering judgment, calculated probabilities of component reliability, analysis of potential human failures, and whether they occur singly or in combination. A probabilistic risk assessment, for example, addresses three basic questions: (1) What could go wrong? (2) How likely is it that this will happen? and (3) What are the consequences?", "Qualitative assessments, on the other hand, assess risk through descriptive information, identifying the nature and components of risk or an ordinal scale, such as high, medium, and low.

The Commission recommended that NASA give the program manager authority over all program funding and work. In response, NASA centralized program management in a shuttle program director at headquarters with overall responsibility for shuttle operations and budgets. Also, the program manager at the Johnson Space Center was made a headquarters employee in order to minimize center-to-center communications problems. Effective January 31, 1996, however, shuttle program management responsibility was transferred from the headquarters director to the Johnson Space Center director. Because NASA has not yet prepared a detailed plan for implementing this change, we could not fully evaluate its implications. However, according to NASA officials in the Office of Human Space Flight, the Johnson Center director will have full authority over the shuttle resources and work at all participating centers and will report directly to the NASA administrator.

Based on our own analysis and internal NASA studies, we concluded that the shuttle\u2019s ability to meet station launch requirements appeared questionable. To meet the station\u2019s \u201cassembly complete\u201d milestone, shuttle officials had designed a very compressed launch schedule. During certain periods of the station assembly, clusters of shuttle flights are scheduled to be launched within very short time frames. For example, the schedule calls for five launches within a 6-month period in fiscal year 2000 and seven launches during a 9-month period in fiscal year 2002. Because the schedule is so compressed at times, there is very little margin for error. There is little flexibility in the schedule to meet major contingencies, such as late delivery of station hardware, or technical problems with the orbiter.", "We reported in June 1995 that NASA had reduced shuttle operations funding requirements by a cumulative amount of $2.9 billion between fiscal years 1992 and 1995 when the fiscal year 1992 budget request is compared to the fiscal year 1995 request. In our survey, we asked NASA managers and safety representatives what actions had been taken to accommodate the funding reductions and whether these actions, in their opinion, had enhanced, degraded, or had little or no effect on the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of shuttle safety-related information. Generally, their assessment was that the actions either had little or no effect on quality or somewhat degraded quality. For example, of nine respondents who reported funding reductions accomplished by delaying safety improvements, six said the delay somewhat degraded the quality of safety-related information. However, some respondents reported actions taken to cut costs actually enhanced the quality of information.", "Just over 75 percent of NASA managers and safety representatives we surveyed believed that NASA emphasized safety over shuttle schedule to a great or very great extent.

For example, the project managers for two contractors said that workforce reductions can impact their timeliness in responding to situations that arise. One contractor manager noted that while the company measures various indexes such as \u201cfirst time quality\u201d and overtime, it is difficult to specify the point at which additional program changes to accommodate funding cuts might reduce quality. Another contractor manager noted that at some point, funding reductions could translate into not having enough people, so that maintaining the required quality will mean continual schedule delays\u2014a signal to the contractor that their program cannot be reduced further.", "Although firm estimates are not available, NASA expects to achieve significant cost savings by turning shuttle operations over to a prime contractor. The contractor would be responsible for shuttle processing and launch, but NASA will retain the responsibility for making the final launch decision. The single prime contractor would combine many of the tasks now performed under 28 separate shuttle program contracts. Savings are expected to accrue because shuttle operations would be more efficient and require fewer civil service employees.

This was the first assessment to include a complete shuttle mission. The contractor was required to develop and apply a risk model of the shuttle during flight and to quantify in-flight safety risk. The analysis was to identify, quantify, and prioritize risk contributors for the shuttle. According to the model\u2019s author, secondary objectives were to provide a vehicle for introducing and transferring probabilistic risk assessment technology to NASA, and to demonstrate the value of the technology. The model was completed in April 1995.", "According to the contractor who developed the probabilistic risk assessment model, the model could be a useful tool in NASA\u2019s management of shuttle risks. For example, the model might be used to establish realistic cost objectives for redesigning the high risk components, helping to assure that limited resources are focused toward solving those problems that will have the most impact on safety. The National Research Council also noted that a detailed quantitative risk assessment provides decision makers with a better basis for managing risk.", "An internal shuttle program survey of managers, safety experts, and senior engineers revealed mixed reactions to the model.

According to safety officials, NASA does not have current copies of the required software and older inadequate versions are limited. According to these officials, only one NASA employee has been able to use the model on a NASA computer using the older software.
