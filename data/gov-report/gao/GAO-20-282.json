Therefore, for each decennial the Bureau issues guidance describing how the criteria should be applied to certain complex living situations. For the 2020 Census, the Bureau has updated its guidance on where to count people in six complex living situations, such as U.S. employees deployed overseas. The Bureau plans to count people in other living situations in the same manner as it did in 2010.

Similarly, they may unduly lose or gain key benefits  through improperly distributed federal funds or poorly informed policies.  Inappropriate outcomes can also result if some household residents are  counted more than once due to multiple census responses for the same  address or if they are not counted at all due to missing responses.

Count people at their usual residence, which is the place where they live and sleep  most of the time.  2.  People in certain types of group facilities on Census Day are counted at the group  facility.  3.  People who do not have a usual residence, or who cannot determine a usual  residence, are counted where they are on Census Day.", "For most people, applying the concept of usual residence and the  Bureau\u2019s associated residence criteria is straightforward. For others who  may be more mobile, like members of the military, college students,  migrant farm workers, and people living in group quarters, determining  where to count them can be more complicated.

The Bureau is required by law to count the population as of  April 1, 2020 (Census Day); deliver state apportionment counts to the  President by December 31, 2020; and provide redistricting data to the  states by April 1, 2021. To meet these deadlines and ensure an accurate  count, the Bureau carries out thousands of interrelated activities before,  during, and after data collection (see figure 1 for a timeline of selected  key activities)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Bureau Has Refined its Residence Guidance to Help Ensure More People Are Counted in the Right Place", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Bureau Has Updated Its Guidance on Where to Count People in Six Complex Living Situations", "paragraphs": ["The Bureau plans to use its concept of usual residence and its associated  residence criteria to determine where to count people in the 2020 Census  generally as it did in 2010, but in 2018 the Bureau updated its guidance  on how to apply that concept to count people in six complex living  situations (see figure 2 for an overview of these changes). In developing  the guidance for 2020, the Bureau sought input from external  stakeholders on needed changes and solicited public comments on the  draft guidance through the Federal Register. In response, the Bureau  received input and comments from a variety of entities including federal,  state, local, and tribal governments, as well as civil rights and other  advocacy organizations.", "Military and civilian employees of the United States deployed  overseas. In 2010, overseas military and civilian employees of the United  States who were U.S. citizens were counted at their home state of record  for apportionment purposes only. For 2020, the Bureau decided to count  these personnel differently depending on whether their permanent duty  station was in the United States. Personnel assigned or stationed  overseas will continue to be counted as they were in 2010. Personnel  stationed in the United States while deployed overseas, however, will  instead be counted at their usual home address in the United States for  both apportionment and redistricting purposes. According to Bureau  documentation, this change resulted from Bureau analysis of data from  the Department of Defense which found that personnel deployed  overseas were there for shorter periods and were likely to return to their  prior usual place of residence, whereas personnel assigned or stationed  overseas generally remained overseas for greater periods and often did  not return to their prior stateside location.", "Military and civilian employees of the United States deployed,  stationed, or assigned overseas who are legal U.S. residents but not  citizens. For 2020, the Bureau plans to count this population the same  way it counts U.S. citizens working for the federal government overseas,  as described above. According to a Bureau assessment of how it counted  personnel overseas in 2010, its guidance for federal agencies that  provide the Bureau with data on overseas personnel was unclear on the  treatment of non-citizens. According to Bureau officials, it is therefore  likely that other federal agencies following that guidance generally  excluded non-citizens from the 2010 count. Based on the Bureau\u2019s  assessment, the Bureau plans to make clear in its 2020 guidance that  U.S.-resident non-citizens working for the federal government overseas  are to be counted the same way as U.S. citizens. Bureau officials stated  that this change should ensure that U.S.-resident non-citizens are  counted more consistently with other U.S. residents.", "Crews of U.S. maritime and merchant vessels sailing between a U.S.  and a foreign port. In 2010, if a U.S. maritime or merchant vessel was  sailing between a U.S. and a foreign port on Census Day, then the  crewmembers were not counted. For 2020, the Bureau plans to count  these crewmembers at their onshore usual residence in the United States  or, if they have none, then at the vessel\u2019s U.S. port of departure or arrival.  This matches how the Bureau counts crewmembers if their vessel is at a  U.S. port or sailing between two U.S. ports. According to Bureau  documentation, this change resulted from Bureau analysis and  consultation with stakeholders (including the Maritime Administration)  which found that crewmembers in each of these situations usually retain  an onshore residence in the United States where they live and sleep most  of the time so they should be counted in the same way.", "Juveniles in non-correctional residential treatment centers. For 2020,  the Bureau plans to count this population at the U.S. residence where  they live and sleep most of the time or, if they have no usual home  address, then at the facility. In 2010, they were counted at the facility. The  Bureau made this change after concluding that these juveniles typically  only stay at residential treatment center facilities temporarily and  generally have a usual home elsewhere to which they return after  treatment is completed.", "Religious group quarters residents. For the 2020 Census, the Bureau  will count this population at the religious group quarters facility. In 2010,  this population was counted at their usual home address or, if they had no  usual home address, then at the facility. The Bureau made this change  after concluding that this population typically does not have a place of  usual residence elsewhere.", "According to Bureau officials, the Bureau expects the updated guidance  will provide greater clarity and result in more informed responses and,  thus, higher quality data.

However,  the Bureau concluded that counting prisoners anywhere other than the  correctional facility would be less consistent with the concept of usual  residence, since the majority of people in prisons live and sleep there  most of the time. Therefore, for 2020, the Bureau decided that it will  continue to count prisoners at the correctional facility as it did in 2010.  However, the Bureau will make available to states two tools to allow them  to \u201cmove\u201d their prisoner population to the prisoners\u2019 pre-incarceration  addresses for redistricting purposes.

According to Bureau officials, in making this determination, the algorithm  takes into account a wide range of information, including results from its  fraud detection efforts. We did not examine the algorithm for this review.  In addition, to help ensure the integrity of these determinations, the  Bureau does not disclose the details of the algorithm publicly and permits  only Bureau officials with an operational need to know to access the  algorithm.

The Bureau\u2019s count imputation in 2010 added about 1.2 million  people to the final census count. For 2020, however, some of the missing  responses which otherwise would have required count imputation will  instead be resolved through the use of administrative records in  conjunction with the Bureau\u2019s door-to-door non-response follow-up effort.  Specifically, the Bureau plans to draw on relevant data from records of  sufficient quality thereby reducing the amount of follow-up field work  needed and the number of households in need of count imputation.

However, unlike the prior method, the incomplete or conflicting  characteristics cannot be filled in or reconciled using other information  about the same person or household reported within the 2020  response or in prior census or other administrative records.

As discussed earlier, this method employs  continually updated census data from similar nearby households as  the basis for filling in the needed information.", "Use existing information about same or other households. This  method is used when all person characteristics are incomplete. In this  instance, the Bureau will first look to prior census and other  administrative records.

Specifically, in 2010  the Bureau relied on such records to fill in only race and ethnicity.
