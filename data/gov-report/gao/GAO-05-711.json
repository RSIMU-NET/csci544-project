MEPI has obligated about 45 percent of the $129 million that it received for fiscal years 2002-2003, and its partners have obligated the remainder. MEPI used the State and USAID reviews of existing U.S. bilateral economic assistance programs in the Middle East and North Africa in two ways. First, in response to the reviews, MEPI targeted reform activities in the Middle East and North Africa that were not being addressed by other U.S. agencies. For example, responding to the reviews' finding that little progress had been made in supporting women's political involvement, MEPI provided funds to assist women candidates. Second, MEPI shaped its strategy in response to the reviews, particularly regarding the need to monitor projects' short-term results and hold project implementers accountable for project performance. Despite its strategic emphasis on monitoring projects' performance, MEPI's monitoring has been limited by unclear communication of roles and responsibilities and a lack of complete project information. MEPI has acknowledged these deficiencies and begun to address them; in July 2005, State and USAID agreed on a framework for project monitoring roles and responsibilities. Without the ability to evaluate its projects' performance with certainty and access to complete information, MEPI's capacity to meet its strategic goals of producing tangible results and making results-based decisions is limited."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["According to the United Nations, many Middle Eastern and North African  countries face enormous deficits of human development, including limited  political and personal freedoms and low economic growth.

In response, MEPI has provided funds to  help increase the number of women candidates and assist them through  activities such as improving their media presentation techniques.", "Economic reform: The reviews revealed that although limited assistance  was being provided to increase trade capacity within the region, U.S.  agencies were not addressing the need to increase the access and capacity  of small and medium-sized enterprises in countries such as Morocco.  Regionally, MEPI has supported a program that aims to, among other  things, increase managerial and entrepreneurial skills in several countries.

According to MEPI officials, MEPI  project monitoring responsibilities generally would include participation  in project activities, regular review and assessment of implementer  performance reports, and regular feedback to implementers on project  performance. However, we found that some MEPI administrative partners,  particularly those overseas, have been confused about their roles and  responsibilities for project monitoring and that some MEPI activities have  been monitored sporadically or not at all. Officials from 9 of the 14 U.S.  embassies supporting MEPI projects stated that they were uncertain of  their roles and responsibilities for monitoring MEPI projects and that  MEPI had not yet specified their monitoring duties. USAID/Washington  officials told us that USAID mission staff were expected to assist  USAID/Washington in monitoring MEPI projects that it administers.  However, USAID mission officials in Rabat, Morocco, told us that MEPI  projects administered by USAID/Washington were not being monitored  and that they had not received instructions for monitoring these projects.  Officials at USAID/Washington acknowledged that it had not performed  many of its monitoring duties in the field and stated that  USAID/Washington is currently working to ensure better communication  and provide instructions to the missions regarding their support of project  monitoring. In addition, MEPI and USAID officials in Washington, D.C., as  well as MEPI regional office, embassy, and USAID mission office staff,  said that they were uncertain of the role that the MEPI regional offices  would play in monitoring MEPI projects.

MEPI and USAID  officials in Washington, D.C., acknowledged that confusion exists  regarding roles and responsibilities for project monitoring. MEPI officials  stated that they were still defining, and working toward agreement with  USAID and other parties regarding, MEPI and its administrative partners\u2019  respective roles and responsibilities.

According to MEPI\u2019s strategy, baseline data are necessary for measuring  future progress on its projects, and MEPI officials told us that it was  important to establish these measurements at the beginning of each  project as the basis for determining project performance. However, of the  project agreements we received from MEPI and USAID for the 25 projects  in our selected sample, only three project agreements contained a  requirement to establish a baseline, and none of the projects reported  baseline measurements. MEPI officials told us that they were aware that  they had not required baseline measurement in all of their project  agreements but said that they planned to do so in future agreements.", "Inconsistent reporting requirements: MEPI project agreements do not  consistently require that implementers report on quantitative, measurable  performance indicators. As a result, some implementing organizations  report general project information instead of the measurable indicators of  performance that MEPI has stated are needed to manage a results-based  program. According to one MEPI official, some of the reports are therefore  too vague to be useful in monitoring project performance. In our selected  sample of 25 projects, a substantial majority of the performance indicators  required in project agreements were qualitative in nature rather than the  quantitative indicators of project performance that MEPI has stated are  necessary for managing MEPI as a results-based program. Further, a  February 2005 report by USAID\u2019s OIG reported that 6 of 17  USAID/Morocco MEPI projects did not have indicators to measure project  performance. One MEPI official told us that they sometimes negotiate  requirements for additional indicators informally over the telephone and in  e-mail after signing a project agreement. However, these informally  negotiated requirements are not formally documented, readily available, or  tracked by MEPI or the implementers. MEPI officials said that they are  seeking to acquire grant-tracking software that would facilitate the  documenting of agreed-on indicators and closer monitoring of  implementers\u2019 reporting on these indicators.", "Unverified project information: MEPI\u2019s ability to verify the information  reported in implementers\u2019 quarterly reports and to provide detailed  performance feedback to implementers has been limited, because MEPI  and its administrative partners have not consistently observed project  activities. In the sample we analyzed, only 8 of the 19 implementers we  interviewed said that MEPI and its administrative partners had made on- site visits to discuss and observe project activities. According to embassy,  MEPI, and USAID mission staff, they often do not have time to monitor  MEPI projects, including visiting or observing project activities, because of  conflicting demands on staff time. USAID OIG\u2019s February 2005 report  stated that, primarily because of limited resources, the USAID/Morocco  mission had not validated the performance data reported by implementers.", "Inconsistent communication of project information: MEPI has  inconsistently communicated project information, particularly to  embassies and USAID missions overseas. Overseas embassy and USAID  officials stated that MEPI had not always informed them of important  project information, including when new projects were to begin in their  country of operation. USAID\u2019S OIG February 2005 report noted that MEPI  and USAID/Washington had not always notified USAID/Morocco when  they awarded regional activities taking place within the country. As a  result, in some cases, embassy officials have had little or no knowledge of  some of the implementer\u2019s activities. Officials from two embassies and one  USAID mission told us that MEPI project implementers had arrived in  country expecting embassy and USAID assistance, although the embassies  and USAID missions had received little or no prior notice of the projects\u2019  start or the implementers\u2019 needs. In another example, in one country we  visited, we arrived expecting to meet with a particular project  implementer but found that embassy officials there were unaware of the  project or the implementer\u2019s operations in country. Further, when  embassies have communicated with MEPI, MEPI has not always been  responsive. Three embassies stated that, since MEPI\u2019s inception, MEPI had  provided no response or guidance in response to their regular reports on  MEPI activities. However, according to MEPI officials, embassies have not  always responded to MEPI\u2019s communications. For example, according to  one senior MEPI official, after the summer 2003 awarding of small grants  through the embassies, the majority of embassies administering MEPI  projects did not respond to December 2003 requests from MEPI for basic  evaluative descriptions of the projects the embassies were administering.  According to this senior official, the embassies\u2019 failure to respond to MEPI  resulted, in some cases, in MEPI\u2019s lacking records of actual activities  conducted and descriptions of successes and lessons learned.", "Incomplete project records: MEPI and USAID have not maintained  complete records for all of the projects that they administer, which has  limited their ability to monitor project performance. We found gaps in  records that the MEPI office in Washington, D.C., maintained for the  projects that it administered. For example, in our selected sample of 25  projects, MEPI\u2019s files for fiscal year 2003 projects that it administered  directly contained 44 percent of quarterly reports that project  implementers were to have submitted. MEPI officials said that the grant- tracking software they sought to acquire would enable them to track the  submission of implementers\u2019 quarterly reports. Without such software, the  MEPI office has managed project data on Excel spreadsheets and office  calendars, using the incomplete copies of quarterly reports that it has  maintained since the program\u2019s inception. MEPI officials in the past have  asked implementers to provide copies of records missing from their files.  In addition, we found that USAID had incomplete records for the projects  that it administers for MEPI. For example, in our selected sample, USAID\u2019s  files for the fiscal year 2003 projects that it administered contained 63  percent of MEPI project agreements with implementers and 62 percent of  the quarterly reports that project implementers were to have submitted.  USAID officials stated that their records were scattered in many  locations\u2014in the various bureaus in Washington, D.C., that administer  MEPI projects and at USAID missions in the Middle East and North  Africa. In other cases, USAID has had to obtain copies of the records from  the implementing organizations themselves.", "Lack of access to project information: MEPI has lacked ready access to  information on USAID-administered MEPI projects, which has limited its  ability to monitor those projects\u2019 performance. According to MEPI\u2019s  strategy and officials, MEPI is responsible for ensuring the performance of  all projects that it funds, including those administered by USAID.  However, MEPI and USAID have maintained separate performance and  financial records, and MEPI and USAID officials stated that prior to the  July 2005 signing of the MOA addendum regarding monitoring roles and  responsibilities, they had not reached agreement on the sharing of these  records. Further, USAID officials stated that USAID has not maintained  records for MEPI projects separately from its records for non-MEPI- funded projects. Some USAID implementers responsible for implementing  MEPI projects have included MEPI performance reporting in their general  reporting on the region, making USAID\u2019s extraction of information on  MEPI projects more difficult and time consuming.

This documentation included information on funding  levels and project administration for fiscal year 2002 and 2003 projects. We  also interviewed State and USAID officials familiar with MEPI budget and  project administration, in particular for fiscal years 2002 and 2003.  Although our audit generally covered MEPI activities from December 2002  through May 2005, in reviewing MEPI\u2019s budget information and project  monitoring, we focused on data for fiscal years 2002-2003, because they  were the most complete data that MEPI could provide.", "To describe MEPI\u2019s uses of the 2002-2004 reviews of U.S. bilateral  economic assistance to the region, we examined (1) State\u2019s and USAID\u2019s  joint reviews of programs in Egypt and West Bank and Gaza; (2) USAID\u2019s  reviews of democracy and governance for Algeria, Bahrain, Jordan,  Morocco, Tunisia, and Yemen; and (3) other supplemental information  provided by U.S. embassies and USAID missions in the region, including  mission performance plans and USAID country strategies. We also  conducted interviews with officials at State and USAID headquarters in  Washington, D.C.; officials representing embassies and USAID missions in  9 of the 14 MEPI countries; and officials administering MEPI programs in  the territories of West Bank and Gaza.", "To assess MEPI\u2019s mechanisms for monitoring its activities, we obtained  information from MEPI on all of its fiscal year 2003 projects, including  information on each project\u2019s pillar, MEPI partner, implementing  organization, funding level, project location, and project type (country- specific or regionwide). From this information, we selected a  nonprobability sample of 25, or approximately 34 percent, of the 73 MEPI  projects funded in fiscal year 2003. This sample also represented about 63  percent of MEPI\u2019s $100 million in fiscal year 2003 project funding. We used  the sample to examine project monitoring performed by MEPI and its  administrative partners and reports provided by project implementers. Our  sample included regionwide projects and projects from the countries we  would be visiting, projects with the highest funding levels for fiscal year  2003, projects administered both by MEPI and USAID, and projects from  each of the four MEPI pillars.", "The documentation that we reviewed included project proposals, project  agreements, scopes of work and work plans, and quarterly reports for the  25 projects. Our analysis of these documents clarified the nature of MEPI\u2019s  monitoring and reporting requirements and supplemented and validated  information that we obtained through interviews. We developed a  structured interview instrument to systematically collect data on the 25  projects, which included questions on implementer reporting  requirements, the use of performance baselines and indicators, and  feedback and verification by MEPI and its administrative partners. We  analyzed the interview data by developing categories for each relevant  response, using the categories to code the data, and tallying the codes to  obtain the number of projects to which each response was applicable. We  also interviewed officials from MEPI, USAID, U.S. embassies, and  implementing organizations in the United States, Bahrain, Egypt, and  Morocco regarding MEPI project monitoring. We selected these MEPI- participating countries because (1) Bahrain is a high-income country and  does not have a traditional U.S. bilateral assistance program; (2) Egypt, a  lower-middle-income country, is one of the largest recipients of U.S.  bilateral development funding; and (3) Morocco, a lower-middle-income  country, was the largest recipient of fiscal year 2003 MEPI funding. We  also traveled to Germany during a MEPI regional conference, where we  met with embassy and USAID officials responsible for project monitoring  in 8 of the 14 MEPI countries and in the West Bank and Gaza. In addition,  we used U.S. government internal control standards to assess relevant  areas of MEPI\u2019s management control system that affected project  monitoring, including (1) roles and responsibilities of MEPI staff and  administrative partners in Washington, D.C., and overseas and (2)  information flow.", "We conducted our fieldwork in Washington, D.C., and in Bahrain, Egypt,  Germany, and Morocco from July 2004 to May 2005 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: The Office of Middle East Partnership Initiative\u2019s Organizational Structure", "paragraphs": ["Manager (Grants)", "Manager (Grants)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of State", "paragraphs": ["The following are our comments on the Department of State\u2019s letter dated  July 22, 2005."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  State commented that it agreed with GAO\u2019s conclusion that the  Department of State has effectively launched MEPI reform programs.  However, GAO did not audit the effectiveness of MEPI projects and  did not present such a conclusion in this report.  2.  State commented that our report recognized that MEPI had established  effective partnerships with other bureaus at State, with other U.S.  government agencies, and with a wide range of nongovernmental  organizations (NGOs), including the private sector. However, our  report did not present such a conclusion. Our report describes rather  than assesses the relationships between MEPI and other U.S.  government and nongovernment entities.  3.  State said that it disagreed with the extent of our finding that MEPI  cannot with certainty evaluate its projects\u2019 performance, but it did not  specify aspects of that finding with which it disagreed. State\u2019s  comments acknowledged our recommendations regarding bolstering  its ability to monitor and evaluate project performance and laid out  general steps that, if taken, would help ensure more comprehensive  project monitoring. For example, State said that it would ensure the  completion of every project\u2019s files, to allow for periodic reviews of  activity status and project outcomes and shortcomings; engage outside  consultants to provide project monitoring and evaluation support,  where necessary; and implement an integrated grants and program  management database system. In addition, State pointed out that,  subsequent to receiving our preliminary findings in May, it finalized, on  July 14, 2005, an addendum to an October 2004 memorandum of  agreement (MOA) with USAID on USAID\u2019s administration of MEPI  projects. This MOA addendum establishes a framework for roles and  responsibilities and coordination between State and USAID.
