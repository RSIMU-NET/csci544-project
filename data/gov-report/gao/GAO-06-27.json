The types of service jobs  covered by the act include, for example, security guard services, food  service, maintenance, janitorial services, clerical workers, and certain  health and technical occupations.", "Until recently, DOL regulations required that federal contracting agencies  complete and submit a form to DOL indicating their intention to offer a  service contract and requesting current wage and benefit determinations  for the occupational class(es) and geographic area(s) involved in the  contract. Since the mid-1990s, however, some contracting agencies have  been able to obtain wage determinations through a DOL online wage  determination database, rather than requesting one from DOL. Many of  their covered service contracts were renewals and the applicable SCA  wage determinations for these contracts were already well established and  posted online for information purposes. For these reasons, DOL entered  into memoranda of understanding with several agencies to allow them to  use posted standard wage determinations without first formally requesting  a new one. On August 26, 2005, DOL issued regulations that allow all  federal contracting agencies to use its www.wdol.gov Web site to meet  their obligation to obtain SCA wage determinations from DOL. This final  rule eliminates the required paper form when requesting a wage  determination.", "Under SCA, WHD establishes wage rates that apply to the United States,  including the District of Columbia, and certain territories.

WHD strives to update its list of consolidated wage  determinations annually, issuing 410 consolidated wage determinations  covering almost 300 standard occupations in 205 geographic locations.  These consolidated wage determinations altogether, contain  approximately 61,500 individual wage determinations. In addition,  between August 1, 2004, and July 31, 2005, WHD issued at least 15,786  other wage determinations upon request, including those for non-standard  occupations and conformance requests.

The directory is not just an information document\u2013it is a critical part of  the wage determination process throughout the federal contracting  system. However, the process that WHD uses to update its SCA directory  of occupations is not written down and is essentially ad hoc. There are  neither written procedures that describe how or when WHD updates the  directory, nor a required or standard time interval for how often the  directory should be updated.", "DOL has no systematic process for updating its SCA directory of  occupations, but instead, updates it periodically. The current edition of the  directory was issued in 1993. Since then, there have been three  supplements to the directory. According to WHD officials, when there is a  sufficient volume of smaller-scale changes proposed by stakeholders, they  will issue a supplement to the directory. Stakeholders usually bring the  need for supplements to WHD\u2019s attention. Supplements can involve adding  some classes of jobs as well as editing or removing others. WHD can make  these changes to job classes either with or without getting stakeholder  approval. A recent effort to update and release a new edition of the  directory, begun in 2002, was initiated after federal contracting agencies,  contractors, trade associations, and unions raised concerns that the  existing directory did not meet their needs. In fact, stakeholders  independently drafted an update to the directory and presented it to WHD.  While WHD is not legally required to include outside parties in the update  process, WHD has encouraged stakeholders to participate, allowing them  to review all suggested changes. According to WHD officials, the update  has been long in the making, due in part to the number of suggested  changes received from and deliberated by the stakeholders.", "Some stakeholders, however, have expressed frustration with the length of  time the update has taken. In response, one senior WHD official we spoke  to explained that, in some cases, directory changes could have significant  cost implications for both wages and fringe benefits at the local level and  that careful consideration is necessary to make proper adjustments.  Stakeholders, the official contended, may not realize the implications of  the changes or additions that have been proposed. For example, an issue  was raised of whether it was more appropriate to classify the occupation  \u201ctruck dispatcher\u201d as an administrative, clerical, technical, or professional  position, when each category brings with it a different level of wages and  benefits.", "Throughout the update process, several job categories and occupational  classes have been added to, or deleted from, the directory. WHD analysts  responded to stakeholder needs for job classifications that were not  available in the directory. For example, WHD added a job classification in  response to a DOD need for an \u201cunexploded ordnance technician.\u201d WHD  worked with DOD to develop an accurate description for placement in the  directory. Similarly, the job category of \u201cdetention officer\u201d was added at  the request of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services because of the  volume of hiring and the uniqueness of the duties performed. In these  cases, WHD did not involve additional agencies in the process of changing  the directory. Ultimately, WHD has the authority to decide which jobs are  included in the directory.", "Despite recent efforts to update the directory, some common service  occupations are still missing. Specifically, the directory does not contain  the occupations \u201ccustomer service representative\u201d or \u201ctelemarketer.\u201d  Contracting agencies that need such services performed cannot acquire  the wage rate from DOL\u2019s online wage determination system and must  request a separate wage determination from a WHD analyst. In addition,  WHD officials told us that analysts sometimes receive multiple wage  determination requests for the same unlisted occupations, thereby  increasing their workload. The directory also does not list an occupational  title for \u201ccall center representative.\u201d A contractor told us that as a result,  wage determinations for call center contracts with federal agencies  generally listed these occupations as \u201cgeneral clerk I, II, and III.\u201d  According to this contractor, the wage determination for a general clerk is  usually lower than the market rate for a call center representative. The  contractor pointed out that federal agencies will likely have an increased  need for call center representatives in the years ahead. Some contractors  told us that, while they often must pay additional amounts to meet the  market rate to be able to recruit qualified workers, they cannot submit the  higher rates in their bid without risking the loss of the contract to a  competitor. Contractors warned that, in cases like these where they lose a  contract to a lower bidder, federal agencies may be at risk of contracting  with employers who will provide a lower quality of services. According to  these contractors, the difference in wage rates paid to workers on SCA- covered contracts and those not working on SCA-covered contracts can  lead to some workers feeling demoralized. WHD officials told us that after  the current update is issued, which is expected to occur in October 2005,  no plans are underway for the next update."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Process for Determining Wages", "paragraphs": ["WHD analysts rely on professional judgment when calculating wage rates.  WHD provides analysts with methodology worksheets that assist them in  determining a wage. These worksheets provide an outline of how an  analyst should proceed when certain conditions exist (such as, when  survey data are not available for a specific occupation). The worksheets  are intended to guide analysts without dictating the exact determination  process.", "More specifically, to determine a wage rate, analysts review the available  wage data sources as well as previously issued wage determinations.  Analysts base most wage determinations on nationwide survey data  collected by BLS under the National Compensation Survey (NCS) and the  Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey, or other data showing  the rates that prevail in a specific locality. Analysts also take into account  previously issued wage determinations when setting a new or revised  wage rate. For example, to maintain general consistency from year to year,  WHD instructs its analysts to not issue a rate lower than or more than   10 percent above the previously issued wage rate. In addition, when wages  have been set by a collective bargaining agreement, analysts are required  by SCA to carry over those negotiated wages to contractors who take over  ongoing contracts. Finally, analysts use the union dominant rate, when  applicable.", "After selecting a data source, analysts review the wage information for  different classes of the same occupation (e.g., the different classes, I, II,  and III, of the occupation \u201csecretary\u201d require successively more advanced  skills) and the pay relationships that exist between these job classes (i.e.,  the different classes of secretary are paid successively more for their  advanced skills), and make adjustments as needed to address data  abnormalities or inconsistencies. For example, an analyst would make an  adjustment if the data showed lower wages for a secretary III than for a  secretary I or II. Analysts also review occupations in the same broad job  category (e.g., administrative support and clerical occupations) to ensure  that different occupations performing commensurate duties receive  similar pay.", "When data for an occupation are not included in existing wage surveys,  analysts can establish a prevailing wage rate through a procedure called  \u201cslotting,\u201d which involves comparing equivalent or similar job duties and  skills between surveyed classifications and other classifications for which  no survey data are available. For example, analysts may adopt the rate for  a \u201ccomputer operator\u201d and use it for a \u201cperipheral equipment operator\u201d  (whose duties include taking corrective actions to return equipment that  directly supports computer operations, such as printers, to proper working  order) because the job duties and skills required for both classifications  are rated at the same level under the grading system for federal  employees. Further, when the survey lists varying wage rates for several  similar occupations, such as the \u201cgeneral maintenance trades,\u201d analysts  will determine the average wage and use that rate as the prevailing wage  for the entire group of occupations. See figure 2 for a graphic illustration  of some of the factors an analyst may consider when determining a wage  rate.", "An additional reason why analysts must rely on professional judgment  when determining wage rates is that BLS\u2019s wage surveys were not  designed for the purpose of determining wages and fringe benefit rates.  While the BLS surveys may provide the most comprehensive wage data  available, WHD analysts must perform some manipulation of BLS\u2019s data  when calculating wage rates. As a result, WHD\u2019s reliance upon these data  may not ensure that the wage rates it sets reflect labor market conditions.  For example, because the survey responses may include the wage rates for  some SCA service contract workers whose rates are set by a wage  determination, analysts may not be using data that fully reflect the local  labor market conditions. In other words, WHD, in trying to determine the  market rate for certain occupations, may be referencing survey responses  of its own derived rates. However, we did not attempt to determine the  extent to which BLS data includes such information. In addition, one BLS  survey used by WHD excludes smaller employers with fewer than   50 employees from its sample population. As a result, the survey results  could inflate or deflate actual wages for the types of occupations typically  employed by smaller employers. Another reason that BLS survey data may  affect WHD\u2019s ability to set rates that reflect market conditions is that the  occupational classifications in DOL\u2019s SCA directory of occupations do not  always match OES occupational classifications, making it difficult for  WHD analysts to match the OES wage data to the SCA occupation without  significant analysis. Because OES does not collect data for each  classification for every locality surveyed, WHD must sometimes use the  \u201cslotting\u201d procedure to derive a wage determination."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Process for Determining Fringe Benefit Rates", "paragraphs": ["In addition to a wage rate, each SCA wage determination also includes the  fringe benefit rate for the specific locality. Analysts generally set a  universal fringe benefit rate that employers must pay to all workers in a  specific geographic area regardless of their occupational class. The fringe  benefit amount typically includes health and life insurance coverage, sick  leave, retirement plans\u2014items that are typically referred to as health and  welfare (H&W) benefits\u2014as well as vacations and holidays. WHD  analysts arrive at the H&W rate used in wage determinations by consulting  nationwide data from BLS\u2019s Employer Cost for Employee Compensation  (ECEC) survey. In contracts awarded since new regulations became  effective in June 1997, the fringe benefit rate has most often been  calculated on a \u201cfixed cost per employee\u201d basis, where each employee  receives the same benefit amount. Employers may meet their fringe  benefit obligations by paying the employee the cash equivalent of the  specified fringe benefits. In June 2005, the \u201cfixed cost per employee\u201d SCA  health and welfare benefit rate was increased to $2.87 per hour, which  equates to about $497 per month."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Lack of Transparency Leaves Wage Determinations Prone to Criticism", "paragraphs": ["The wage determination process requires analysts to apply professional  judgment in selecting both the appropriate source and method for  calculating the prevailing wage rate.

According to WHD officials, analysts received  about 23,000 telephone inquiries in a recent 12-month period, mostly from  service contract employees who want to know how their wage rate was  calculated or why their rate differed from a similar rate in a neighboring  locality.

Instead, the poster  directs inquiries for information to the Wage and Hour Division offices  located in \u201cprincipal cities.\u201d The poster also directs potential complainants  to check their telephone directory under U.S. Government, Department of  Labor, Wage and Hour Division. WHD last revised the poster in 1996.", "A workplace poster that does not provide service contract employees and  others with a clear and easy-to-access method of filing a complaint may  hamper their reporting of such complaints. In the absence of a telephone  point of contact at WHD, service contract employees may not have the  opportunity to report possible or suspected violations of the act and  therefore may not receive the full benefit of protection authorized under  the act.", "We reported in 2004 that DOL\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health  Administration (OSHA) relies heavily on complaints to enforce the  Occupational Safety and Health Act. OSHA, in general, responds to  complaints according to the seriousness of alleged hazards, a policy that  OSHA credits with conserving agency resources. Like WHD, OSHA uses  workplace posters as part of its overall compliance assistance  enforcement efforts. OSHA\u2019s workplace posters display a universal  national telephone number, telephone numbers for each of OSHA\u2019s 10  regional offices, a national number accessible to the hearing impaired, and  instructions on how to file a complaint online through OSHA\u2019s Web site."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Determining locally prevailing wages for service employees working in  hundreds of occupations throughout the nation is a tremendous  undertaking and one that WHD is committed to performing with diligence.  It is the only organization producing such a vast number of locally  prevailing wage rates on a national scale. For their part, WHD analysts  have the support of their agency in applying their professional judgment  when setting the wage and benefit rates. However, WHD could benefit  from greater transparency of its wage determination process. WHD  provides limited information on the methodology used to determine SCA  wage rates, resulting in analysts receiving numerous inquiries about how  they determined wages. Responding to individual requests for explanation  diverts analysts from their primary duties of revising and issuing new wage  determinations. WHD expressed concerns that providing additional  information on its methodology may trigger additional inquiries. However,  we believe that additional information could inform some stakeholders,  especially those that represent contractors and employees, who could in  turn educate their members. As a result, some individuals who otherwise  would contact WHD for an explanation on how wages are determined  might not see the need to contact WHD. A general description of the  methods used in the wage determination process could give SCA  stakeholders greater confidence in the determined wage rates and possibly  improve the quality of service that WHD provides to those who do inquire.", "WHD strives to update its list of consolidated wage determinations on an  annual basis and provides this information online for the convenience of  the contracting agencies. However, the job titles and descriptions included  in its SCA directory of occupations have not been regularly updated to  include emerging service occupations. WHD has been working closely  with various stakeholders over the past 3 years to make changes to the  directory, although its ad hoc process of updating the directory calls into  question the ongoing currency of the occupations listed in the directory  used for wage determinations.", "WHD\u2019s reliance on complaints as the primary means to identify potential  SCA violations is a reasonable strategy to pursue, given WHD\u2019s multiple  enforcement responsibilities under numerous federal labor laws. However,  that strategy currently does not examine the extent to which other  information could be used to improve enforcement nationwide. Without  further analysis of prior SCA violation data, WHD cannot ensure that it is  using the most effective mix of compliance assistance, complaint-driven  investigations, and directed investigations. WHD has readily available data  on repeat SCA violators, the analysis of which we believe could be  performed with minimal investment of additional resources. Furthermore,  by taking extra steps to review prior SCA violation data, WHD may find  that its existing complaint-driven approach to SCA enforcement is sound.", "Finally, because the SCA workplace poster does not provide an easy  method for employees to report complaints, WHD may be missing  opportunities to get the most use from its complaint process. Improving  the workplace poster would reinforce WHD\u2019s complaint-based strategy  and would help further protect the wages and benefits of service contract  workers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In an effort to provide stakeholders with a general understanding of how  WHD determines wage rates, we recommend that the Secretary of Labor:    direct WHD to make publicly available the basic methodology WHD uses  to issue wage determinations.", "To better support WHD and federal contracting agencies in their  implementation of SCA, we recommend that the Secretary of Labor:    direct WHD to develop a procedure for updating the SCA directory of  occupations at regular intervals and include criteria for listing and  removing occupations as the need emerges.", "To further WHD\u2019s efforts to obtain better information concerning the  presence of and potential for violations involving SCA contracts, we  recommend that the Secretary of Labor:    direct WHD to analyze its historical SCA contractor violation data in  WHISARD, as well as debarment information not included in WHISARD,  and to the extent appropriate, use this information to help plan its  compliance assistance and investigative efforts, and to identify additional  industries, if any, that WHD should establish enforcement goals similar to  those it currently has for repeat violators and industries with chronic  violations.", "To facilitate the reporting of SCA complaints, we recommend that the  Secretary of Labor:    direct WHD to update and revise the 1996 Service Contract Act/Walsh- Healey worksite poster, to include national and regional office telephone  numbers and a Web site address that complainants may use to report  alleged SCA violations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["DOL\u2019s ESA provided us with written comments on a draft of this report,  which are reproduced in appendix III.
