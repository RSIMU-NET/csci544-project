Recognizing this concern, the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2003 required the Department of Defense (DOD) to designate an official or organization to oversee and coordinate efforts to prevent and mitigate corrosion. Recently, the National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2006 directed GAO to examine the effectiveness of DOD's corrosion prevention and mitigation programs.

While it has created a Corrosion Policy and Oversight Office, that office lacks the ability to oversee and coordinate its efforts throughout DOD, as envisioned by Congress. For example, DOD's office does not review all of the services' proposed funding requests for corrosion programs, even though it is required to do so, because DOD has not directed the services to provide such information and none of the services has a designated official or office to oversee and coordinate servicewide corrosion activities. Without comprehensive reviews of the services' corrosion-related programs and proposed funding requests, the office cannot fulfill its oversight and coordination role. DOD has made some progress in identifying corrosion cost impacts, but it has not identified readiness and safety impacts. It recently completed corrosion cost impact studies for Army ground vehicles and Navy ships, identifying an estimated $4.5 billion in annual corrosion costs. Although the studies provided potentially useful data for reducing these costs, DOD has not developed an action plan to apply these data to developing corrosion prevention and mitigation strategies. Without an action plan, it could miss opportunities to achieve long-term cost savings. DOD has not yet developed results-oriented metrics, although GAO has previously recommended that it do so. Without top DOD and service leadership commitment to address these issues, corrosion prevention and mitigation will remain elusive goals and opportunities to reduce costs, enhance readiness, and avoid safety problems will be lost. Most of the weapon system acquisition programs GAO reviewed had not incorporated key elements of DOD corrosion prevention guidance. GAO found that only 14 of the 51 programs reviewed had both corrosion prevention plans and advisory teams, as encouraged in the DOD guidance. The primary reason most programs did not have these two elements is that they are not mandatory. As a result, these programs may be missing opportunities to prevent and mitigate corrosion."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) spends an estimated $10 billion to     $20 billion each year on corrosion-related maintenance on weapon  systems and infrastructure. Corrosion can affect mission readiness by  taking critical systems out of action. It also affects safety. For example,  since 1985, the Army has reported over 50 aircraft accidents, including 12  fatalities, caused by corrosion. Incorporating corrosion prevention  planning early in the acquisition process is the most effective way to  reduce and perhaps avoid corrosion impacts in terms of costs, readiness  and safety.", "In recognition of the harm that corrosion can cause, Congress enacted, as  part of the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year  2003, legislation that requires DOD to designate a senior official or  organization responsible for preventing and mitigating the corrosion of  military equipment and infrastructure. The authorization act requires the  designated official or organization to oversee and coordinate efforts  throughout the department, recommend policy guidance, and review the  corrosion prevention and mitigation programs and funding levels  proposed by each military service that will enable them to make  recommendations to the Secretary of Defense. The authorization act also  requires the official to provide oversight and coordination of the efforts  within the Department to prevent or mitigate corrosion throughout the life  cycle of military equipment and infrastructure and to monitor DOD  acquisition practices to ensure that corrosion prevention technologies and  treatments are fully considered during research and development phases  of the acquisition process and are incorporated in each acquisition  program to the extent deemed appropriate. In addition, the authorization  act directs the Secretary of Defense to develop and implement a long-term  strategy to reduce corrosion and the effects of corrosion on DOD\u2019s  military equipment and infrastructure. In response to this act, DOD  created the Corrosion Policy and Oversight Office (Corrosion Office)  within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology, and Logistics and in December 2003 developed a long-term  strategy to reduce corrosion of military equipment and infrastructure. As  part of the strategy, DOD is developing a corrosion baseline to identify the  effects of corrosion on cost, readiness, and safety.", "Since the passage of the Defense Authorization Act of 2003, we have  issued several reports on corrosion. Among other things, we have found  that DOD and the services do not have an effective approach to prevent  and mitigate corrosion, DOD\u2019s long-term strategy falls short of a  comprehensive strategic plan, and the Army is not adequately storing land- based pre-positioned equipment to protect it from corrosion. In 2003, we  recommended that DOD develop a strategic plan for corrosion prevention  and mitigation that included standardized methodologies for collecting  and analyzing corrosion cost, readiness, and safety data; clearly defined  goals, outcome-oriented objectives, and performance measures;  identification of the level of resources needed to accomplish goals and  objectives; and mechanisms to coordinate and oversee prevention and  mitigation projects across the department. In 2004 we further  recommended that DOD accelerate completion of its corrosion baseline,  establish a funding mechanism to implement the corrosion strategy, and  submit to Congress a report identifying the long-term funding and  personnel resources needed to implement the strategy. DOD concurred  with all of these recommendations.", "In response to a request of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology, and Logistics, the Defense Science Board issued a report in  October 2004 on DOD\u2019s efforts for corrosion control, referring to \u201cthe  importance of leadership commitment and proper incentives for ensuring  corrosion is considered early and often in decisions\u201d and calling for an  increased commitment on the part of DOD to prevent and mitigate  corrosion. This report found that corrosion prevention has not been a  priority across DOD, and it made 17 recommendations, most of which  DOD concurred with. Specifically, DOD concurred on 11, partially  concurred on 4, and did not concur on 2. Appendix I contains a complete  list of Defense Science Board recommendations and DOD\u2019s responses. Of  the recommendations with which DOD concurred, it has taken actions to  incorporate some into its strategy document and to begin implementing  some of those.

In  addition, as agreed with your offices, we evaluated the extent to which  DOD has incorporated corrosion prevention planning in the acquisition of  major weapon systems.", "In performing our work, we used the requirements for the DOD corrosion  strategy set forth in the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act of  Fiscal Year 2003, along with our previous recommendations, as a baseline  for evaluating DOD\u2019s corrosion prevention efforts. We reviewed DOD and  service guidance relating to corrosion prevention, and we interviewed  officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), the Army, the  Air Force, and the Navy. We also gathered and reviewed information about  corrosion prevention planning from a nonprobability sample of 51 major  defense acquisition programs. The sample was based on the programs  contained in DOD\u2019s Fiscal Year 2006 Major Defense Acquisition Program  List.

In 2004, the Corrosion Office was formally  assigned to the Defense Systems Directorate. The direct chain of  command went through the Defense Systems Directorate, which provided  management and administrative support. Following a reorganization of the  Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics organization in 2006, the Corrosion  Office was moved to the Systems and Software Engineering Directorate.

The Corrosion Office does not review comprehensive corrosion data from  the services on their programs and funding requests because (1) DOD has  not required the services to provide budget information to the Corrosion  Office and (2) the services lack an effective mechanism for coordinating  with the Corrosion Office with respect to their corrosion funding requests.  None of the four services has a designated official or office to oversee and  coordinate corrosion activities, including identifying annual servicewide  funding requirements. Without a requirement or mechanism for reporting  service funding information, the Corrosion Office officials said they are  unable to review the services\u2019 complete corrosion-related funding  information, and thus DOD is hampered in its ability to provide oversight  of the services\u2019 funding requests.", "The Corrosion Office currently has oversight over only a small portion of  departmentwide corrosion spending that is provided through a separate  appropriations account. The Corrosion Office reviews and selects for  funding the projects that are proposed by the services based on a  combination of criteria, including: whether a project would benefit more  than one service, whether it is projected to be completed within 2 years of  its initial funding, the availability of matching funds; and the return on  investment that it offers. For fiscal year 2006, DOD and the military  services funded about $24 million for corrosion strategy efforts. Of this  amount, $19 million was spent on 29 corrosion-related projects and about  $5 million on contractor support, training, outreach, and other  administrative activities. The DOD Corrosion Office projects a combined  average return on investment of 42.5 to 1 for the $19 million, or a projected  savings of $809 million over the life of the projects.", "The services frequently bypass the Corrosion Office to obtain their funding  for corrosion-related efforts. We reviewed the President\u2019s budget  justification for fiscal year 2006 and identified more than $97 million for  service-specific corrosion mitigation-related projects in addition to those  reviewed by the Corrosion Office. These projects had not been submitted  to the Corrosion Office for review, and Corrosion Office officials told us  that they lacked any information about the $97 million and the status of  the associated efforts. Because corrosion-related projects may be included  under other maintenance projects or budget accounts, it is likely that there  is more funding that we have not identified. According to recent corrosion  cost studies conducted by DOD, the annual corrosion costs for Army  ground vehicles and Navy ships alone were identified to be $2.019 billion  and $2.438 billion, respectively.

Currently, multiple offices in the services  are responsible for corrosion programs and related budgets. For example,  several Air Force offices are responsible for corrosion-related matters:  maintenance issues belong to the Air Force Corrosion Prevention and  Control Office, corrosion policy for weapon systems is managed by an  office within the Air Force Maintenance Directorate, and corrosion policy  for infrastructure is handled by the Air Force Civil Engineering  Directorate.

According to DOD, the purpose of the study is to  document where corrosion problems exist, identify their causes, and  prioritize them for funding according to their relative severity in terms of  their impact on DOD costs, readiness, and safety.", "In August 2004, after developing a cost-estimating methodology, a DOD  contractor began a study to determine the total cost of corrosion for  military equipment and facilities across the services. DOD currently plans  to complete this cost study by 2009, 2 years earlier than originally planned.  The study uses fiscal year 2004 costs as a measurement baseline and  consists of several segments, to be completed sequentially. To date, it has  made some progress in identifying corrosion cost impacts. For example, in  April 2006, DOD completed the Army ground vehicle and Navy ship  corrosion segments of this study. Several segments remain to be  completed, including Army and Marine Corps aviation. Corrosion Office  officials told us that progress has been slower than expected, primarily  because of a lack of corrosion data. Table 1 shows the corrosion cost  segments included in the study and their planned completion dates.", "The two completed studies generated data that could be potentially useful  for developing initiatives aimed at reducing long-term corrosion costs, but  DOD lacks an action plan for using these data. For example, the studies  estimate the annual corrosion costs for Army ground vehicles and Navy  ships at $2.019 billion and $2.438 billion, respectively. Costs are segregated  in multiple ways, such as costs incurred at the depot, organizational, and  intermediate maintenance levels; costs incurred while addressing a  corrosion problem (corrective); costs incurred while addressing a  potential problem (preventive); and direct costs incurred on end items or  removable parts. However, the Corrosion Office has not developed an  action plan on how it will use these data, or the data expected from future  cost studies, to develop corrosion prevention and mitigation strategies.  Without an action plan, DOD could miss opportunities for achieving long- term corrosion cost savings.", "Finally, although it acknowledges the importance of identifying corrosion  impacts related to readiness and safety, DOD has made virtually no  progress in assessing these impacts. DOD officials told us that they  decided to identify cost impacts before they identify readiness and safety  impacts because more information is available regarding costs, and  identifying cost impacts is an important step towards identifying readiness  and safety impacts.

For example, the degree to  which corrosion prevention planning is performed depends on the  initiative of the respective acquisition program offices. The Air Force\u2019s C- 17A Globemaster program had a corrosion prevention plan and corrosion  prevention team in place early in the acquisition process, several months  before it obtained approval to proceed with full-scale development.

While these efforts may have merit, we still believe  that an action plan would provide additional benefits as we recommend.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation to require every major  defense acquisition program to prepare a corrosion prevention plan and  establish a corrosion prevention advisory team as early as possible in the  acquisition process. DOD stated that a corrosion prevention control plan  will be developed for all ACAT I programs before preliminary design  review and implementation will be reviewed at each milestone. DOD noted  that the establishment of a separate, formal Corrosion Prevention  Advisory Team may not be necessary for all program levels, though such a  team will be established for all ACAT I programs. DOD\u2019s response is  essentially responsive to our recommendation if carried out. In subsequent  discussions DOD officials told us that they partially concurred because the  response in some respects goes beyond our recommendation by requiring  that all ACAT I programs have a corrosion prevention control plan and  corrosion prevention advisory team.", "In addition to providing comments to our recommendations, DOD  commented about our statement that the development of metrics for  readiness and safety will likely take several additional years to complete  because DOD officials have placed a higher priority on completing the cost  impact studies. DOD commented that this is an inaccurate and dangerous  assertion and implies that the department holds safety and readiness, the  two linchpins of the operation military mind-set, in lower esteem than  cost. In subsequent discussions, DOD officials told us that they decided to  identify cost impacts before they identify readiness and safety impacts  because more information is available regarding costs, and identifying cost  impacts is an important step towards identifying readiness and safety  impacts. We have modified our report by incorporating this statement.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense and  interested congressional committees.

We reviewed the President\u2019s budget justification for fiscal  year 2006 for corrosion-related efforts and met with DOD officials within  the Comptroller\u2019s Office regarding their oversight of the Corrosion Policy  and Oversight Office\u2019s budget. We also met with DOD officials within the  Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and  Logistics to assess their oversight of programs and funding levels of the  military services during the annual budget reviews as well as their  monitoring of the services\u2019 acquisition practices. In particular, we met with  officials with the Corrosion Policy and Oversight Office responsible for  managing, directing, and reviewing corrosion prevention and mitigation  initiatives. We met with DOD officials involved with developing DOD\u2019s  long-term strategy to prevent and control corrosion. We obtained their  assessments and perspectives on corrosion prevention and mitigation  programs and strategies; obtained and reviewed DOD policies, procedures,  guidelines, and draft instructions for prevention and mitigation of  corrosion on DOD military equipment and infrastructure; and discussed  additional actions that could be taken to further prevent and mitigate  corrosion. We reviewed DOD\u2019s funding requirements for fiscal years 2005  through 2007 and future year projections.", "To assess the extent to which the military services\u2019 have incorporated  corrosion prevention planning in the acquisition of major weapon systems,  we conducted a review of 51 major defense acquisition programs from the  Army, Navy, and Air Force. These 51 programs were selected based on a  nonprobability sample of acquisition programs from the Fiscal Year 2006  Major Defense Acquisition Program List approved by the Under Secretary  of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. Navy programs  were about half of the programs on the list. A program is designated a  major acquisition program either by the Secretary of Defense, or because  it is estimated to require a total expenditure of more than $365 million in  research, development, test, and evaluation funds or require a total  expenditure of more than $2.19 billion in procurement funds. Our program  selection represented the functional capability areas for battle space  awareness, focused logistics, force application, force protection, and joint  training and included air, ground, and sea weapon systems. In particular,  we selected and reviewed 13 Army programs, 25 Navy programs, and 13  Air Force programs. We met with officials responsible for managing the  acquisition programs and with officials having primary responsibility for  overseeing corrosion prevention and mitigation within the respective  services. We obtained and reviewed military service policies and  instructions that establish corrosion prevention and control program  requirements. For the acquisition programs we selected, we obtained and  reviewed documents, including the acquisition strategy, acquisition plan,  and corrosion prevention and control plans, as well as related information  establishing corrosion prevention advisory teams and other reports used  for tracking and monitoring corrosion-related design initiatives and  corrections. In particular, we discussed the barriers that exist to more  effectively employing corrosion control at program initiation and  acquisition.", "We also reviewed the recommendations of the Defense Science Board  report on corrosion control issued in October 2004, and obtained DOD\u2019s  related responses and actions taken to better address its strategy for  corrosion prevention and mitigation. We met with Corrosion Policy and  Oversight Office officials regarding their concurrence and the related  actions taken to date.", "We conducted our work from April 2006 through January 2007 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We  did not validate the data provided by DOD. However, we reviewed  available data for inconsistencies and discussed the data with DOD.
