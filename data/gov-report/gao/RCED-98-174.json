In a report on fiscal year 1998 appropriations\u2014Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Bill (Senate Report 105-53)\u2014the Senate Committee on Appropriations requested that we study the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s (HUD) Performance Funding System (PFS) for allocating appropriated funds to housing agencies as operating subsidies.

However, it was not until 1975 that HUD established a permanent system known as the Performance Funding System (PFS) for subsidizing public housing. For years, the public housing program was self-sufficient because it was open only to residents whose incomes were high enough for them to be able to pay rents that would cover operating costs. The program began to move toward serving poorer households with the Housing Act of 1949, which required incomes of eligible households to be 20 percent below the income necessary to rent decent private housing. Also, during the 1950s and 1960s, the average income of public housing tenants began to fall as the more upwardly mobile households found affordable housing elsewhere. By 1969, public housing had shifted to serving the poorest households, those who had difficulty paying rents that were high enough to cover the full costs of public housing operations.", "As a result, the Congress passed the Brooke Amendments, beginning in 1969, which limited the rent that tenants could be charged to 25 percent of their incomes and authorized a program of federal subsidies to pay for the operating costs that public housing agencies could no longer meet with rental income alone. By the mid-1970s, rising subsidy costs, along with concern in the Office of Management and Budget and the Congress that the system did not provide an incentive for good management, led to the 1974 Housing Act mandating that the Secretary of HUD establish a mechanism for subsidizing the cost of providing public housing. As a result, HUD developed PFS in 1975; since then, PFS has come under almost constant review in efforts by HUD and others to find a more effective mechanism for allocating congressional appropriations to housing agencies. Provisions in pending housing reform legislation would require HUD to create a block grant to cover operating expenses and to develop a new formula for allocating that grant."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD Bases Subsidies on 1975 Operating Costs and Used Cost Modeling to Establish Upper and Lower Limits", "paragraphs": ["After implementing PFS in 1975, HUD began allotting operating subsidies to housing agencies on the basis of their costs in the base year 1975. Since then, HUD has adjusted the base year costs annually for inflation and other factors to update the allowable costs of operating public housing. The subsidy that HUD provides is the difference between a housing agency\u2019s income and these allowable costs. Although HUD did not base housing agencies\u2019 allowable expenses on what it should cost to provide a standard set of housing services, twice over the program\u2019s life the Department has used quantitative cost models, based on two different sets of cost data, to better define subsidy levels: once at the outset to establish an upper limit for allowable costs and again in 1992 to adjust some agencies\u2019 costs that, according to the second cost model, were less than 85 percent of their predicted levels. HUD and its contractors did not believe that the results of the statistical analysis provided a standard of what agency expenses should be or need to be to efficiently provide a commonly understood standard of service in public housing."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "HUD Allocates Subsidies on the Basis of 1975 Expenditures", "paragraphs": ["HUD implemented its system for subsidizing public housing agencies in 1975, basing it on the HUD-approved operating expense level incurred by housing agencies that year. HUD also developed a cost model, called the \u201cprototype equation,\u201d that was based on the costs of a group of well-managed agencies. The equation was used to predict housing agencies\u2019 operating costs and to thereby establish a limited range of costs within which HUD expected housing agencies to operate. HUD and the Urban Institute, which developed the model for HUD, reported that the model did not produce an estimate of what housing agencies should or need to spend for housing services. Instead, based on a set of five cost-related factors, the model produced for every agency a predicted, or prototype, expense level that could then be compared with the actual expenditures that formed the subsidy\u2019s basis. HUD believed that this comparison showed which agencies had spending that significantly exceeded the comparable expenses derived from a group of well-managed agencies, after controlling for their differences in the five factors.", "Without a method to establish what operating expenses are necessary to provide some standard level of services\u2014nor a method to define what that standard level of services would consist of\u2014HUD chose to use each agency\u2019s actual operating expenses in 1975 as its standard baseline amount, not including utility and audit expenses. Since then, the subsidy a housing agency receives each year is its prior year\u2019s allowable expenses\u2014adjusted for (1) additions or deletions to its housing stock, (2) inflation, and (3) an additional 0.5 percent to allow for higher costs associated with an aging housing stock\u2014less the amount of rental and other income the housing agency receives. Thus, the PFS subsidy is the shortfall between an agency\u2019s allowable expenses and its income. In years when the congressional appropriation has not been sufficient to cover the shortfall, HUD has proportionally reduced each agency\u2019s subsidy to conform to the amount appropriated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD Developed Cost Models to Limit Allowable Costs and Later to Adjust Some Agencies\u2019 Allowable Cost Levels", "paragraphs": ["To develop the prototype equation, a 1975 study by the Urban Institute identified certain operating characteristics of housing agencies that were related to the agencies\u2019 operating expenditures. On the basis of operating performance and responses to questionnaires, the study identified a group of local agencies considered to be well managed at the time. The Urban Institute used these agencies\u2019 costs to identify five characteristics of a local agency\u2019s housing operations that were directly related to operating expenditures per housing unit, per month, called per unit-month costs, and determined the relative impact of the characteristics on the overall cost of operations. On the basis of the Urban Institute\u2019s study, HUD established an upper limit for expenses and beginning in 1975 limited the growth in allowable expenses for housing agencies that had expenses that significantly exceeded the level predicted for them by the prototype equation.", "In 1992, HUD implemented the results of a second study in a subsidy review process mandated by the 1987 Housing and Community Development Act. This study\u2019s approach was similar to the Urban Institute\u2019s approach. It also identified five cost factors that were related to local agencies\u2019 operating costs, but it used different factors and drew on the past expense levels of a much larger sample of housing agencies. The act required this study, in part, to correct inequities in the base year expense level, to accurately reflect changes in operating circumstances, and to reflect the higher cost of operating in an economically distressed unit of local government. If an agency\u2019s allowable expense level was less than 85 percent of the amount calculated by the new PFS formula developed in the 1992 study, the allowable expense level would be increased to the 85-percent level. At that time, this adjustment was expected to effect 868 housing agencies, most of which were small. HUD believed that its PFS formula was not sufficiently accurate to change agencies\u2019 allowable costs that differed by less than 15 percent from the value predicted by the formula. A lower percentage would have been more costly because it would have permitted more housing agencies to increase their allowable costs. Because the agencies that qualified for the increase in allowable expenses were comparatively small, this review added only 1.4 percent to the total federal subsidy for that year.", "Although HUD\u2019s 1992 study related operating costs to certain characteristics of a housing agency, HUD did not use the new formula to establish specific allowable expense levels for all housing agencies. Instead, for most agencies, the allowable expense level continued to be based on past actual costs. HUD officials believed that the 1992 cost model improved on the prototype equation in several respects, but they still had concerns about whether the model reflected all the important circumstances and conditions affecting housing agencies\u2019 costs. For example, none of the cost factors accounted for the condition and quality of the housing stock. In addition, neither the Urban Institute\u2019s nor HUD\u2019s analysis controlled for differences in the effect that varying maintenance practices would have had on expenditures and on the varying physical condition of agencies\u2019 housing stock. Consequently, the studies\u2019 statistical analyses simply reflect historical spending patterns rather than differences in the cost conditions at different locations. Moreover, the spending patterns analyzed in 1992 might not have accurately reflected the true costs of operating public housing because spending had been limited since 1975 by housing agencies\u2019 available revenue\u2014the sum of the PFS subsidy and rental and other income."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "HUD\u2019s Subsidies May Not Reflect Housing Agencies\u2019 Current Needs", "paragraphs": ["The operating subsidies that HUD provides through PFS are not sufficient to adequately supplement some housing agencies\u2019 operations budgets. Although these agencies\u2019 base year costs were limited by the prototype formula where necessary, adjusted for inflation and other effects, and converted into their current allowable expense levels, the expense levels still reflect housing conditions, management policies, and, most importantly, the spending patterns that existed almost a quarter of a century ago. PFS has not adapted to the housing agencies\u2019 changing needs, residents, or operating circumstances. Therefore, the housing agencies that either had inadequate resources in 1975 because they were serving extremely poor residents or had changes in their operating circumstances over the years that had a substantial impact on their costs may not be receiving adequate subsidies today to operate effectively. For example, each of the four large housing agencies we visited had experienced changes in its circumstances since PFS was implemented in 1975. The significant actions taken by the housing agencies\u2019 managers to address these changes demonstrate that the operating subsidies they receive from HUD may not be sufficient to meet their agencies\u2019 needs. These agencies have deferred maintenance expenses, reduced staffing in critical areas, and supplemented their operating budgets with funding from other federal grants. The four agencies took these and other actions, despite being reasonably well managed according to HUD\u2019s management assessment program. Finally, we found that 17 percent of the housing agencies had had declining operating reserves during their fiscal years ending in 1992 through 1996. In particular, 4 of the 21 extra large housing agencies (those operating 6,600 or more housing units) had declining reserve levels in 3 of the last 4 years. One of the uses that housing agencies make of operating reserves is to pay for operating expenses. For example, officials at the Miami-Dade Housing Agency stated that they use reserves to pay for maintenance when their operating income\u2014primarily comprising rent receipts and the PFS subsidy\u2014is insufficient."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Base Year Cost Variation and the Inflation Adjustment Method Contribute to the Inadequacy of the Subsidy", "paragraphs": ["When HUD adopted PFS, housing agencies\u2019 expenditure levels varied significantly according to the rental income they could collect from their tenants and other factors such as the quality of their housing stock and neighborhood characteristics. Annual expenditures were driven by the level of maintenance needed to keep the housing stock in good condition, neighborhood and tenant characteristics that affected both security expenses and the residents\u2019 need for social services, local agencies\u2019 policies regarding the volume and types of social services they made available to residents, and agencies\u2019 criteria for selecting and evicting tenants. A 1980 Urban Institute study of 17 large housing agencies reported that comparatively wide differences existed among housing agencies in expenditures for operating activities in 1975. The expenditures ranged from a low of $45.18 per unit-month in Columbus, Ohio, to $95.49 per unit-month in Los Angeles. The variations that existed in 1975 have been perpetuated by PFS until today, even though the operating circumstances for many agencies are likely to have changed significantly.", "Although HUD adjusts agencies\u2019 allowable costs each year for inflation, the adjustment may not cover the agencies\u2019 total cost growth. In determining the inflation adjustment to housing agencies\u2019 allowable cost levels, one of the factors that PFS uses is the Wages and Salaries Index of the Employer Cost Index published by the Department of Labor. However, a similar index, the Total Compensation Index, also tracked and published by the Labor Department, may be more comprehensive because it includes the value of employee benefits, such as health insurance premiums. Using the Total Compensation Index instead of the Wages and Salaries Index would mean a higher subsidy because over the period 1980 through 1997, the Total Compensation Index increased by 6 percent more than did the Wages and Salaries Index. Because labor costs are approximately 60 percent of housing agencies\u2019 expenses, estimated annual funding needs for PFS would more accurately reflect housing agencies\u2019 costs each year if HUD calculated inflation on the basis of the Total Compensation Index rather than the Wages and Salaries Index. However, using the Total Compensation Index would also raise the annual subsidy by 3 to 4 percent, or approximately $100 million."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conditions at Four Large Housing Agencies Indicate That Changing Circumstances Make PFS Subsidies Inadequate at Some Agencies", "paragraphs": ["At each of the four large housing agencies we visited, we found conditions similar to those described by HUD in its annual performance plan submitted to the Congress in early 1998. The Department noted decades of mistakes in public housing, including flawed site plans and architecture, buildings that have outlived their useful lives, and neighborhoods that have changed from healthy residential settings to isolated pockets of poverty and despair. We found that because of these conditions, housing agency managers believed that PFS significantly underfunds their need for subsidy. They attributed inadequate subsidies primarily to PFS\u2019 inability to recognize that changing circumstances over the past 23 years have increased housing agencies\u2019 costs in areas such as crime deterrence, management information systems, and maintenance. We observed housing conditions and spoke with housing managers at many of the agencies\u2019 developments, who were nearly unanimous in their belief that crime, aging physical stock, and the poor design and layout of the housing itself were the primary factors causing their costs to rise today. They told us that their operating costs are significantly higher now\u2014even taking inflation into account\u2014than they were when PFS set their agencies\u2019 allowable expense levels in 1975. Table 1 summarizes the information we obtained at the four housing agencies.", "Although all the housing agency managers we spoke with believed that PFS was insufficient to meet their agencies\u2019 needs, this belief was not always shared by officials at the local HUD field offices. For example, the director of public housing in HUD\u2019s Maryland State Office said that the Housing Authority of Baltimore\u2019s allowable expense levels seemed to be sufficient to operate the agency\u2019s developments; however, he also said that these expense levels would not be adequate to protect the investment Baltimore is making in its newly rehabilitated developments. He added that although other HUD-assisted properties not owned by the housing agency receive less revenue to operate than the Baltimore City agency receives, the housing agency has specific circumstances\u2014such as high-cost family high-rises, large aged developments, very-low-income tenants, and higher crime rates\u2014that raise its operating costs above those of privately owned properties. In Florida, HUD\u2019s director of public housing said that PFS does not provide housing agencies with sufficient subsidy, even in years when the Congress funds it at 100 percent of HUD\u2019s request. She said that despite the insufficiency of the subsidy, housing agencies generally perform satisfactorily and often add a small amount to their operating reserves at the end of the year. She also said, however, that most supplement their operating budgets with funds from other sources, including HUD\u2019s Comprehensive Grant Program for major housing repairs and modernization; HUD\u2019s Public Housing Drug Elimination Program; and other federal, state, and local grant programs.

For example, abating lead-based paint has become a significant cost at some agencies. And the cost of protective services\u2014while always necessary\u2014has increased along with the cost of maintaining ever-aging buildings and the cost over time of poor geographic locations or physical layouts that facilitate increased crime.

Claremont\u2019s per unit-month expenses (before utilities) are about $383, 24 percent more than the average for the housing agency. Claremont\u2019s housing manager said that renovating vacant units to abate lead hazards and replace almost all of the original plumbing fixtures and cabinetry has had the most impact on maintenance costs. Claremont\u2019s low-rise units are very costly because they have the original steam-heated radiators and plaster walls that are damp because of poor ventilation and need constant repainting and replastering. This maintenance must be done frequently because the paint in the units is lead-based and poses a health hazard if it is allowed to peel and crack.", "These maintenance costs have grown until they have become a significant portion of the development\u2019s total operating costs. Housing agency officials are concerned about the potential for incurring additional costs from litigation if they cannot keep up with the lead abatement needed as the paint continues to chip and peel.", "Chouteau Courts in Kansas City. At this development, both residential sewage and rain water feed into the same sewerage transfer system. Heavy rains cause the sewers to back up into the basement of one of the buildings, causing damage, creating significant health hazards, and resulting in additional costs for the housing agency.", "Dana Strand in Los Angeles. Housing managers cited increasing maintenance as having the greatest impact on their operating costs, and they attributed the increase to the age of Dana Strand\u2019s buildings. Officials cited corroding water and gas lines, rotting window sashes, and old electrical conduits as not only maintenance problems but also contributing to hazardous living conditions. For example, water leaking from corroded plumbing accelerated the corrosion of gas pipes, resulting in a gas explosion that injured several tenants and blew off a portion of the building\u2019s roof and walls. Housing agency officials told us that similar plumbing problems exist at other developments.", "Scott Homes in Miami. Increasing crime and vandalism, the age of the development, and the need for grounds keeping and waste management all contribute to the increased operating costs at Scott Homes. Crime in the development and its surrounding community gives Scott Homes a bad reputation that makes it difficult to attract residents, especially working families. Vandals steal copper pipes and security windows from vacant units, shoot out lights, and steal street signs. Physical deterioration of the housing is evident in rotting door frames, water pipes that break and leak into units, and appliances that have outlived their usefulness. Since fiscal year 1995, grounds-keeping costs have nearly tripled because of the extensive tree trimming needed to prevent damage to buildings and sidewalks.

Some agencies also supplement their public housing operating budgets with a portion of the administrative fee they receive from HUD in return for operating Section 8 tenant-based assisted housing programs.", "We found that a frequently used source of additional funding was the Comprehensive Grant Program for modernizing and rehabilitating deteriorated housing stock. Federal statutes and regulations have provided two ways for housing agencies to use up to 30 percent of the grants from this program to address operations needs. First, provisions in the HUD appropriations acts for fiscal years 1996 and 1997 permitted housing agencies to use 10 percent of their Comprehensive Grant Program funding for activities related to operations. The Congress did not include this provision in the fiscal year 1998 act, however. Second, HUD allows a housing agency to use up to 20 percent of its Comprehensive Grant for \u201cmanagement improvements.\u201d HUD\u2019s regulations state that eligible costs under general management improvement include those incurred for operating activities like management and accounting systems, security, rent collection, and maintenance. In a survey of over 800 housing agencies done by the Public Housing Authority Directors Association, 20 percent responded that they use modernization funds to cover operating expenses. The Council of Large Public Housing Authorities, which represents over 100 of the larger agencies, believes that many of its member agencies use Comprehensive Grant funding to cover operating expenses, but the extent of the practice is unknown. Having maintenance costs eligible under the Comprehensive Grant is important to housing agencies because maintenance is generally the single largest expense in their operating budgets.", "The impact on a housing agency\u2019s operating budget of using a significant portion of its Comprehensive Grant to cover the management and administration of the agency can be substantial. For example, officials at the Housing Authority of Baltimore City said that the agency generally uses the full 20 percent of modernization funding that it is allowed to cover management improvement costs. In fiscal year 1997, this amounted to about $6 million of the agency\u2019s $75 million operating budget.", "An additional source of funding for operations is the Public Housing Drug Elimination Program that was authorized in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 and implemented by HUD the following year to help housing agencies combat drug use and drug-related crime. The program authorizes many activities, including security and drug education. However, because the grants are competitive, agencies that receive a grant one year are not guaranteed to receive a grant the next year. Moreover, the funding has become more of a necessity in recent years. A 1994 HUD study of the program noted that all of the agencies included in the study had suffered from \u201cthe upsurge of drug activity during the 1980s as well as the increasing impoverishment of public housing resident populations.\u201d", "Deferred maintenance and staffing cuts also rank high among housing agencies\u2019 tools for coping with funding shortfalls. In Kansas City, officials said they reduced administrative and maintenance staff and deferred maintenance to fund the new or increased operating expenses. Deferred maintenance can be costly, however. For example, although the Miami-Dade Housing Agency has in the past replaced roofs before leaks occur, its current practice is to defer replacement until after leaks are detected. This practice leads to other costs, including damaged walls, floors, and electrical systems.", "According to housing agency officials, the long-term consequences of their coping strategies will be to undermine the viability of the housing stock and to place an unjustified dependence on grants, such as the drug elimination and HOPE VI grants, that may not continue indefinitely. Housing officials in Baltimore told us that deferring maintenance items means that they eventually become \u201cextraordinary maintenance\u201d or emergency items that must be addressed. The comptroller of the Baltimore agency said that although he requested modernization funds for extraordinary maintenance at the O\u2019Donnell Heights development, so many other demands for this funding exist that O\u2019Donnell\u2019s needs are not yet a priority. Agency officials in Baltimore said that in general, the potential result of long-term underfunding is that many of their units eventually will become uninhabitable and need to be demolished. They said that HOPE VI program grants will help to deal with some of these problems, but accomplishing adequate maintenance before excessive deterioration becomes evident is more cost-effective.

HUD bases this estimate on expense data from a stratified sample of housing agencies; factors from the PFS formula; and several assumptions, including forecasts of tenant income, inflation, and energy costs. However, because agencies\u2019 expense data may not accurately reflect their need for subsidy, the budget estimate likewise does not accurately reflect the costs of adequately providing public housing.

The 146 large agencies in the sample account for about 74 percent of total expenditures by public housing agencies to cover operating costs. To prepare the budget estimate for fiscal year 1999, HUD obtained data from fiscal years 1996 (the last completed fiscal year of the housing agencies in the sample) and 1997 (to the extent that data were available). HUD then adjusted the allowable expense level for each housing agency in the sample to reflect major changes in circumstances\u2014such as significant additions or deletions to the housing stock\u2014from fiscal year 1996 to fiscal year 1999. For agencies that reported changes in the PFS formula\u2019s predictive cost factors, such as the number of units built before 1940 and the local government employee wage rate, HUD used the formula to adjust these agencies\u2019 expense levels.", "After making these adjustments to individual expense levels on the basis of the most recent changes, HUD computed an overall weighted average for the sample of 213 housing agencies. HUD then determined the percentage change in the sample\u2019s new expense level from the prior year\u2019s level. HUD assumed that the expense levels of all housing agencies increase in the same proportion as the expense levels of the agencies in the sample. Finally, HUD increased the projected allowable expense levels according to the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s estimate of inflation in fiscal year 1999.", "Other assumptions that HUD makes in preparing its budget estimates involve utility costs and residents\u2019 incomes. To estimate utility costs, HUD obtains the value of utility costs in the last year for which data are complete and adjusts the value for projected changes in utility prices, using forecasts from the Department of Energy\u2019s Energy Information Administration. HUD does not attempt to adjust utility costs for changes in weather or the aging or rehabilitation of buildings in specific markets or nationwide. HUD also makes projections of residents\u2019 income. For several years in the early 1990s, HUD assumed that the income of public housing residents\u2014and therefore the rental income available to housing agencies\u2014remained unchanged. However, budget estimates for fiscal years 1998 and 1999 have assumed a small increase in incomes, based on recent income trends and the presumed effect of welfare reform.", "For several reasons, HUD\u2019s budget estimate for PFS may differ from actual expenses in the budget year. As shown in figure 1, to develop projections for fiscal year 1999, HUD began in mid-1997 and based the projections on fiscal year 1996 data and some fiscal year 1997 data, when available. (The time line represents a typical budget cycle; specific dates may vary from year to year.) Thus, the data used for the 1999 budget estimate were generated 2 to 3 years before the budget year. Furthermore, because of the time lag between when housing agencies\u2019 expenditures occur and when HUD obtains these data and uses them in the budget estimate, some estimating inaccuracy is introduced into this budget estimate. The inaccuracy could be further magnified because of the 2-year period between the time HUD completes its budget estimate and the time the housing agencies spend their allocations.", "Similar estimating errors are made in other agencies\u2019 budget estimates across the federal government; however, housing agencies are particularly affected by errors that result in underfunding because they spend almost all their subsidies on salaries for their staff during the year that they receive the funds, rather than using the funds for capital expenses, contracting, and other spending over several years. Shortages, therefore, generally mean staff layoffs or other unplanned and immediate cost reductions.", "Because of the large number of housing agencies and the difficulty of obtaining current data for each agency, the potential inaccuracy in HUD\u2019s budget estimate for PFS may be unavoidable. Instead of reducing the inaccuracy, therefore, accommodating it through a central supplemental or reserve fund might offer a funding cushion to absorb the effect of inadequate subsidies. In addition, encouraging housing agencies to maintain larger operating reserve funds at the local level could have a similar effect. To justify a central reserve fund, HUD may need to collect data to document the extent of any estimating inaccuracies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD\u2019s Method for Reducing Agencies\u2019 Subsidies to Match Available Appropriations May Be Inequitable", "paragraphs": ["HUD\u2019s procedure for reducing subsidy payments when the budget appropriation does not fully fund its budget request for PFS operating subsidies may be inequitable because it does not affect all housing agencies equally. When the appropriation is not sufficient to fully fund agencies\u2019 operating subsidies, HUD reduces the amount of each agency\u2019s subsidy by the same percentage. Although this represents an evenhanded reduction in the federal PFS subsidy amount across all housing agencies, it produces unequal reductions in local agencies\u2019 operating budgets because some agencies depend to a higher degree than others on the PFS subsidy to supplement their operating budgets. For example, in response to the fiscal year 1996 appropriation for PFS being below HUD\u2019s request by 11 percent, HUD reduced each agency\u2019s subsidy by 11 percent. At an agency where the subsidy constituted 20 percent of the total revenues, that reduction in the subsidy would result in a more than 2-percent decline in total operating funds. At an agency where the subsidy constituted 60 percent of the total revenues, however, the same reduction would result in a more than 6-percent decline in total operating funds.", "As table 2 shows, HUD funding makes up between 20 and 60 percent of the operating income of 2,176 housing agencies (over 70 percent of all agencies). For 360 agencies (or 12 percent of all agencies), at least 60 percent of their operating income comes from HUD\u2019s PFS subsidy.", "In addition, the larger the housing agency, the greater the reliance on HUD funding. For instance, while about 24 percent of the extra small and small housing agencies received more than half of their operating income from HUD, almost 41 percent of the medium-size agencies and nearly 68 percent of large agencies received more than half of their operating income from HUD. HUD funding represented more than half of the operating income for all 17 of the extra large agencies, which managed 31 percent of all public housing units in the country."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Several Options and Other Opportunities Are Available for Redesigning PFS", "paragraphs": ["To make PFS a system that more effectively supplements housing agencies\u2019 operating budgets, HUD has several design options, including basing subsidies on fair market rents, comparing private and public housing costs to determine a reasonable cost and set of services, and using the five-factor cost model it developed in 1992. In redesigning PFS, HUD also will have the opportunity to better address questions of whether PFS is adequate to fund public housing and whether it provides an equitable subsidy to specific housing agencies, given the varying circumstances that exist across agencies. For example, HUD will be able to revisit its policy of not allowing housing agencies to appeal the subsidy provided to them through PFS. Under HUD\u2019s Management 2020 Reform initiative, the Department plans to reorganize its field staff by creating centralized centers for payments and oversight that may be better able to administer an appeals process than the current network of field offices. HUD also is developing new data on the physical conditions in public housing that should assist the Department in understanding the magnitude of the current need for maintenance, which, in turn, should shed light on the adequacy of the operating subsidy and the Comprehensive Grant Program to meet that need. Finally, pending legislation in the Congress (H.R. 2 and S. 462 have passed the House and Senate, respectively, and are awaiting the results of a House-Senate conference expected later this year) would give public housing agencies greater flexibility in whom they house and greater certainty in their annual funding through block grants covering capital and operating expenses.

Equity is concerned with distributing the subsidy fairly by accounting for operating circumstances unique to individual housing agencies. To achieve funding adequacy, HUD could define the standard housing services it expects of a housing agency operating a housing stock with average characteristics in terms of its age, size, design, and construction and serving a tenant population with average demographic characteristics, such as family size and income. Funding equity would, in principle, account for the number of units an agency manages and the unique operating circumstances it faces. In this way, PFS could adjust agencies\u2019 standard expense levels to account for differences in housing stock, tenant population, and income received from rent and other sources.", "This model of funding adequacy and equity is represented schematically in figure 2. Funding adequacy is represented by a national standard expense level and equity by the factors associated with cost, the number of housing units, and the income of the agency.", "Defining funding adequacy and equity is relatively simple compared with the task of implementing these concepts in designing a new PFS.

In addition to issuing reports on Medicaid, the Older Americans Block Grant, the Law Enforcement Block Grant, and the Highway Grant Formulas, we recently worked closely with congressional staff to develop options for targeting HUD\u2019s Community Development Block Grant. Thus, we believe that to develop a national standard for operating public housing, HUD could take several approaches, including the following:", "HUD could base a national standard on the operating expenses necessary to deliver an allowable and expected \u201cbasket of services\u201d at a \u201cwell-managed\u201d housing authority and use data from a selected sample to estimate the national average cost of providing that mix of services. Some of these \u201cshould-cost\u201d data could be based on the cost per unit of services in the private market. HUD considered this option during its formal review process in 1992 and decided against it partly because of difficulties in reaching a consensus as to what standards to use and what type of non-housing agency projects to select for  comparisons.Although this approach would provide a comprehensive cost basis for determining funding adequacy, HUD officials believe that it would require a relatively large commitment of time and resources to develop consensus on the standard service basket and its costs. It would, however, preclude the need to determine actual housing needs and their costs for each individual housing agency.", "A second approach would be to base a standard on the cost of operating private low-income housing by using HUD\u2019s data on fair market rents across the country. The advantage of this approach is that it would employ existing data that reflect rents in the private rental market. However, because the private rental market does not provide tenant social services but does consider replacement costs, depreciation, and taxes, it accounts for its costs much differently from those in public housing. This means that some research would be needed to effectively compare private and public housing environments and costs.", "Regardless of the approach chosen to resolve the adequacy issue, in redesigning PFS HUD would have the opportunity to revisit the way it adjusts housing agencies\u2019 allowable costs for the aging of the housing stock and for inflation. For most agencies, HUD\u2019s application of an 0.5-percent adjustment across the board for aging stock is appropriate. The inflation adjustment, however, captures only the growth in wages and not the cost of employee benefits such as health care coverage. But as we have discussed earlier and as housing agency officials have told us, the cost of employee benefits has grown more rapidly than wages in general, and this added cost has not been fully reflected in inflation adjustments for PFS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Options Also Are Available That Address Equity Issues", "paragraphs": ["To improve equity by distributing subsidies according to the unique circumstances of individual housing agencies, HUD has several options, including the following:", "As an expansion of the option of costing out a standard basket of housing services to address the adequacy issue\u2014if HUD were to choose to adopt such an option\u2014HUD could collect the information relevant to address equity issues and develop an appropriate cost adjustment factor for each housing agency. This effort could be excessively time-consuming, expensive, and administratively burdensome for both HUD and housing agencies, especially where information on relevant factors affecting costs is not readily available or of comparable quality. Limiting the types of data collected and the types of agencies that must report would help to lessen the burden, though it would also lessen the accuracy of funding decisions.", "Another option for developing an adjustment factor based on local circumstances would be to apply to every housing agency the five-factor cost model from HUD\u2019s 1992 review of allowable expense levels. Currently, its use is triggered only when an agency gains or loses 5 percent or more of it units or when it gains or loses 1,000 or more units. Use of this model would, on average, yield allowable expense levels that more systematically reflect circumstances affecting operating costs. The cost model also has the advantage of being readily available and therefore would not require additional time and effort to implement. The model is based, however, on housing agencies\u2019 expenditures that have been constrained by the total of PFS subsidies and tenants\u2019 rent since 1975, and, therefore, it may not portray an accurate picture of operating needs. Also, the model may not apply equally well to all agencies because it may not adequately reflect the full range of housing agencies\u2019 circumstances and may overestimate or underestimate costs for agencies with unusual characteristics such as very high security costs or other circumstances not reflected in the data.", "Another approach would be to determine whether additional cost indicators besides those identified in the 1992 review might also be effective in developing a cost-adjustment factor. For example, under the recently implemented Indian Housing Block Grant Formula, a combination of historical allowable expense levels and geographic differences in fair market rents (FMR) is used to adjust a national standard expense level. Such an approach would allow housing agencies with comparatively high past expense levels to continue to have those levels reflected in the formula, while also allowing agencies that are predicted to have costs that exceed their past levels to have those costs reflected. Thus, under this approach, both the FMR in a housing agency\u2019s metropolitan area and HUD\u2019s cost model could be considered the basis for estimating an agency\u2019s relative allowable costs. The Indian Housing Block Grant program also has developed a geographic cost index that reflects labor and materials costs associated with developing new housing units.

Consequently, a process to allow housing agencies to appeal their formula-calculated or allowable expense levels on the basis of their unique circumstances would enhance the equity of the overall process. When multiple factors affect the cost of delivering housing services, a thorough analysis of detailed information from all housing projects offers the possibility of accurately gauging the need for financial assistance. Similar attention to detail may aid the transition to a new system. The immediate budgetary impact of losses in funding, if any, could be tempered by phasing in changes. If a housing agency has few supplementary resources and minimal reserves, the impact of a loss of funds could swiftly result in consequences such as deferred maintenance, decreased services, and layoffs. As a result, changes to PFS would be more effective if implemented gradually, either by establishing a limit on the magnitude of any reductions in funding for individual housing agencies or by guaranteeing that funding for housing agencies does not fall below the amounts they received in the year prior to implementing the changes to the system.", "HUD considered an appeals mechanism in the past when it responded to the mandate in the Housing Act of 1987 that offered HUD a choice between establishing an appeals process or giving housing agencies a one-time opportunity to raise their allowable expense levels. At that time, HUD chose not to allow agencies to appeal their expense levels because it could not treat agencies in accordance with an objective standard and such a standard would not be as administratively feasible as using the existing approach to establishing subsidies. However, an objective standard may exist in the near future because several of HUD\u2019s options for redesigning PFS would involve establishing an objective standard of expected housing services.

In doing so, HUD will have the opportunity to address questions about both the overall adequacy of PFS to fund public housing and the equity with which it funds individual housing agencies. Since HUD implemented PFS in 1975, public housing agencies\u2019 subsidies have been based for the most part on the actual costs those agencies incurred in the base year 1975, with annual adjustments\u2013primarily for inflation. In many cases, these annually adjusted actual costs do not fully reflect housing agencies\u2019 current need for resources to adequately house and serve low-income families because these agencies\u2019 true funding needs have never been determined. However, these cost levels are part of HUD\u2019s basis for developing its annual budget estimate for PFS and for determining subsidies each year for the nearly 3,200 housing agencies.", "Over the life of PFS, housing agencies have had only one opportunity to receive an overall correction to their adjusted base year costs to account for either unduly low initial cost levels or for gradual but costly changes in operating circumstances, such as the increase in crime and maintenance costs. Although we do not know how many housing agencies\u2019 allowable costs are currently insufficient or excessive to meet their needs, housing conditions at the agencies that we visited and management actions at these agencies taken to supplement operating expenses indicate that PFS may be underfunding these and other agencies. We recognize that a process to allow housing agencies to appeal their allowable cost levels would be administratively burdensome and probably would increase the level of PFS funding. However, we believe that this subsidy cost increase could be mitigated in the near term by the increase in tenant income projected by HUD in fiscal year 1999 and in the long term by the gradual influx of more working families to public housing as a result of the assisted housing reform legislation now pending in the Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["In response to pending legislation, HUD is likely to begin efforts in the near future to revise the way it provides subsidies to public housing agencies.

HUD stated that the Performance Funding System is a formula and is not intended to reconcile funding with housing agencies\u2019 actual expenditures. We disagree that our analysis confused the issues. We concluded that the adequacy of the Performance Funding System and the accuracy of HUD\u2019s budget estimates for PFS are necessarily interrelated. Determining allowable expense levels is not only an integral part of allocating the PFS subsidy to housing agencies, but as we describe in our report, expense levels also play a significant role in HUD\u2019s process of developing its annual budget estimate for the Performance Funding System because the estimate is based on a large sample of these expense levels.", "HUD also said that the draft report relied heavily on four case studies and that it did not contain sufficient data to draw conclusions about the overall adequacy of the Performance Funding System\u2019s funding. We agree and therefore drew no specific conclusions about the Performance Funding System\u2019s adequacy. On the basis of our case studies, we conclude that some housing agencies are underfunded, but we cannot project to the universe of all housing agencies. Therefore, we did not draw any overall conclusions about the adequacy of subsidies nationwide. Instead, our case studies, a survey of 800 housing agencies, and discussions with trade group and HUD officials enabled us to conclude that operating subsidies may not be adequate for housing agencies that had low base year expenditures or that had operating circumstances or costs that have undergone significant changes since 1975. On this basis, therefore, we do question the adequacy of the Performance Funding System and believe that options exist for improving its methodology for allocating congressional appropriations.", "HUD stated that the draft report did not define what costs subsidies should be covering. We assume HUD is referring to the costs of managing the housing agency and providing housing and other services to the residents that could be legitimately covered by an operating subsidy. The Congress did not ask us, nor did we intend, to define what specific costs the operating subsidies should be covering. Rather, we believe that HUD is responsible for defining the scope of costs that the Performance Funding System should cover, and one of the options that we suggest for redesigning the system includes developing such a definition of covered costs.", "Finally, HUD stated that much of the discussion in the report about the level of funding dealt with housing agencies\u2019 funding needs that are more appropriately met through capital and grant funding.

The inflation adjustments over the last 23 years have not been sufficient to account for increasing maintenance costs, they said. These costs include those to repair the aging housing stock and infrastructure, such as broken water distribution lines or leaking gas distribution lines. According to HACLA officials, the allowable expense levels under PFS also do not adequately cover expenses for administration or for additional activities that did not exist when HUD set HACLA\u2019s expense levels in 1975. To supplement its operating subsidy, the agency has reduced staff, deferred maintenance, and drawn on funding from other federal grants.", "HACLA\u2019s allowable costs under PFS were based on maintaining buildings that were then 30 years old and had systems that were approaching the end of their useful lives and needed modernizing in 1975, HACLA officials said. However, even in 1975, the operating subsidy was not high enough to cover the modernization needs. Those same buildings are now 50 years old, and many years of inadequate PFS funding have caused an intractable amount of deferred routine maintenance that must now be funded utilizing modernization funds from HUD\u2019s Comprehensive Grant Program that should be used instead for major repairs.", "Aging housing stock requires increased routine maintenance and is more prone to require extra maintenance, HACLA officials said. Adding to the expense are the replacement costs of fixtures that become irreparable when materials in the fixtures exceed their useful life or fixtures simply become obsolete and go out of production. For example, many units in older developments have wooden window sashes that have dry-rotted or metal windows that require repair parts made from \u201cscratch\u201d because the manufacturer is no longer in business or does not make the part.

In addition, wooden window frames have rotted over time, and cracks in walls from the settling of the foundation cause water leaks that lead to leaking and rusty pipes in the walls.

Dana Strand officials cite deteriorating plumbing, rotting window sashes, and old underground electrical lines as problems at the development. For example, the plumbing in the walls of the units is corroding and, in one recent instance, leaking water from corroded plumbing accelerated the corrosion of gas pipes, resulting in an explosion in one unit.

Officials attributed the development\u2019s increasing expenses for routine maintenance to its age. Environmental regulations have also contributed to increasing maintenance costs. Because of the new city requirements for waste management, for example, HACLA had to install a clarifying pit at each of its developments to separate caustic agents\u2014used for cleaning stoves and appliances\u2014from waste water before the water is discharged into the city\u2019s sewer system.

For example, HACLA has a large Section 8 assisted housing program and receives an administrative fee of over $25 million for administering it. In 1997, HACLA allocated $2 million of its Section 8 administrative fee to its public housing program. HACLA also used the largest part of its funding from HUD\u2019s drug elimination program to pay for its security force in fiscal year 1996 and, as allowed under appropriation law provisions, used 10 percent of the funds it received for modernization to supplement its public housing program\u2019s operating fund.", "Also, HACLA used funds from its Comprehensive Grant Program grants to pay for management improvements in its public housing program, such as the acquisition of its management information system.

Thus, the agency\u2019s allowable costs under PFS do not include the costs of developing and maintaining an information system. No process exists under PFS to change the allowable expense levels to cover new technology. Hence, HACLA used the Comprehensive Grant Program\u2019s Management Improvement Program to fund the initial development of its system.

HABC\u2019s deputy executive director said that HUD\u2019s Public Housing Drug Elimination Program helps to defray the costs of this force (funding 30 to 40 of the officer positions at any one time) but that the costs of the force generally fall under other budgets, such as the Management Improvement Program portion of the Comprehensive Grant Program, which normally funds capital expenses for modernizing the housing stock and improving its management. By using these funds for security, HABC has less for modernization and risks continued deterioration and vacancies. In years when no drug elimination funding is available, HABC must find other funds to cover the security costs. The payment in lieu of taxes that HABC makes to Baltimore City is generally in the range of $300,000 to $400,000, which does not fund many City of Baltimore policemen to patrol and deter crime in HABC\u2019s housing developments.", "Another cost that HABC\u2019s allowable expense level does not adequately cover is that of health insurance benefits for employees. Although the agency\u2019s operating budget now covers the costs of the benefits, these costs increased more since 1975 than the inflation rate HUD allows under PFS. To pay the higher benefit costs today, HABC must forgo some other expenditures such as routine maintenance.

Because of the high rate of crime\u2014worse than in the surrounding neighborhood\u2014residents often request transfers, relocate, or move completely out of O\u2019Donnell.

For example, hardwood floors, sheet-rock walls, and separate hot water heaters and furnaces for each unit increase costs. Each unit has two doors, front and back, and two screen doors, the maintenance of which increases costs; and the aluminum siding has been hard to maintain because of the wear and tear from the children living in the development. The many gutters and downspouts on O\u2019Donnell\u2019s units are also difficult to maintain, and officials described instances of water in the ground-floor units, flooding and drainage problems, and foundation leaks.", "At Claremont Homes, the most significant cost factors are the development\u2019s architectural design, lead-based paint, and its 46-year-old buildings. Claremont\u2019s low-rise units are very costly because they have the original steam-heated radiators that, in combination with the old plaster walls that are damp because of poor ventilation, create an almost constant need to repaint and replaster. The paint in all of the units is lead-based and needs frequent attention to keep it from being hazardous. The cost of addressing the problems caused by the steam heating system, damp walls, and lead-based paint has gradually grown over time so that it is now a significant portion of the development\u2019s total operating costs.", "Because of Claremont\u2019s generally stable, older population of tenants, its strong resident council, and its effective layout, crime\u2014except for some minor vandalism\u2014is not a serious problem and does not contribute significantly to the operating costs.

At HABC, approximately 150 units (out of nearly 14,000 under lease) are vacated each month (slightly more than a 1-percent turnover per month). However, with limited maintenance staff, only about 120 to 130 can be reconditioned for leasing to new tenants each month.

Eventually, if the housing agencies do not adequately fund maintenance, the quality of their housing stock declines. He also said that several disincentives are inherent in the current formula. For example, an automatic annual inflation adjustment creates a disincentive for efficiency. In addition, a housing agency has little incentive to maximize its rental income over a several-year period because if income declines, the subsidy will rise the next year to compensate. On the other hand, if rental income increases unexpectedly during the current year, the housing agency can keep the rental windfall for that year.

MDHA officials also said that insurers are reluctant to insure MDHA properties, partly because of their deteriorating condition.", "In 1975, when MDHA\u2019s allowable expense levels were set by under PFS, the housing agency was not incurring significant security costs. Since then, however, MDHA has had to hire Dade County police officers to provide additional protection to its developments outside municipalities and to hire security guards for its housing developments for the elderly. MDHA initially used part of a subsidy it received from the county government to cover these costs. When the county discontinued the subsidy in fiscal year 1996, the housing agency used its grants from HUD\u2019s drug elimination program to pay for security services at its developments for the elderly instead of at developments in other parts of the county. MDHA also used the county funds to provide some resident services and to help pay for employee benefits. In fiscal year 1995, for example, MDHA supplemented each development\u2019s budget by $6 per unit-month to help pay for employee benefits.

The officials said that crime was a very serious problem, with drug-related crimes occurring most frequently. Replacing the lights that are shot out by drug dealers and practically anything of value that vandals can steal from vacant units raises the development\u2019s costs.

Because appliances have gone past their useful life, the staff receives approximately 20 calls a day from tenants asking to have refrigerators repaired. Design features of the buildings contribute to higher costs because the buildings are not insulated and the front doors have mail slots that criminals use to break into units and through which vandals insert water hoses and flood the units.", "The Scott Homes Housing Development was constructed in 1954 and consists of 754 units in two-story buildings.

They attributed other increasing operating costs to the age of the development, its architectural design, and the residents. Crime is a serious problem at Scott Homes with drug-related crimes being the most serious. Because of the crime, the development and its surrounding community have a bad reputation that makes it difficult for the development to generate rental income, especially by attracting higher-income residents. Vandalism is also costly. Vandals rip out copper pipes from vacant units, steal security windows and street signs, and shoot out lights. The units\u2019 age contributes to the cost of their maintenance because door frames are deteriorating, water pipes break and leak into units, and screen doors and appliances have outlived their useful life and are constantly in need of repair. Housing management officials attributed other increasing costs to the development\u2019s architectural design: Porches and sidewalks have no underlying support, and the building pilings are sinking or leaning, becoming safety hazards to residents. Finally, officials at Scott Homes told us that residents contribute to higher operating costs because families with children cause a great deal of wear and tear on units and also use more utilities.", "Scott Homes officials also pointed to increased costs for such activities as grounds keeping and waste management, noting that since fiscal year 1995, grounds-keeping costs at Scott Homes have increased nearly 300 percent because staff have to trim tree limbs and roots to keep them from damaging the buildings and sidewalks. In addition, ground erosion has become a major problem at Scott Homes, and Miami\u2019s strict dumping requirements have caused waste management costs to nearly double since fiscal year 1995.", "Officials at Scott Homes said the increased costs and inadequate operating subsidy have resulted in seven maintenance staff and one administrative person being laid off, primarily because of a reduction in the operating subsidy of $400,000 in 1996.

For example, although MDHA previously replaced roofs before leaks occurred, the current practice is to defer replacement until after leaks are noticed. This results in damaged walls, floors, and electrical systems and other problems. MDHA officials also said that they have reduced the level of the operating reserve to maintain operations. For example, in fiscal year 1993, MDHA maintained 57 percent of the maximum amount that HUD allows in its operating reserve; in 1997, MDHA reduced that level to 39 percent.", "The other funding sources that MDHA uses include the Comprehensive Grant Program for modernization projects and the Public Housing Drug Elimination Program grant. An MDHA official estimated that the agency will use approximately $1.6 million, or 13 percent of $12.5 million in Comprehensive Grant Program funds for fiscal year 1998, to help pay the salaries of agency staff involved in resident services, accounting, housing operations, and the reinspection of units to ensure they meet HUD\u2019s Housing Quality Standards. MDHA also uses the drug elimination grants to cover its security costs. This funding strategy is risky, however, because a housing agency cannot always count on receiving these competitive grants. Because MDHA did not receive a drug elimination grant in fiscal year 1998, and if an appeal does not result in an award of a grant, MDHA might be forced to discontinue its security services.", "Figure IV.1 shows that MDHA\u2019s ordinary maintenance expenditures initially rose after 1993, but by fiscal year 1997, they had decreased 10 percent below the fiscal year 1993 level. It also shows that administrative expenditures increased 48 percent and general expenses increased 11 percent, while tenant services expenditures decreased 75 percent and protective services expenses decreased 89 percent. Protective services as a component of operating costs decreased because MDHA has begun using drug elimination funding to pay for this activity. In fiscal year 1996, MDHA used $1.1 million of its drug elimination funding and $312,000 of its operating funds to pay for security. In contrast, in fiscal year 1993, MDHA used $1.2 million of its operating funds for security.", "Although MDHA officials provided little information about incentives that they believed exist under PFS or that should be added, they did have some opinions about other regulatory incentives or changes that could be made that would permit more efficient operations:", "Housing agencies should be allowed to evict residents under state eviction guidelines rather than federal eviction requirements. Operating under state guidelines would greatly reduce the time needed to remove residents. Judges are familiar with state eviction guidelines because they continually review them for private landlords seeking to evict residents. Judges are much less knowledgeable about federal eviction guidelines and, therefore, take much longer and are more reluctant to evict public housing residents. Accelerating the eviction process would allow MDHA to more quickly house residents on its waiting list.", "MDHA needs a great deal more flexibility in the rents that are set for residents. The current HUD allowance to set minimum rents needs to be made permanent. MDHA also needs more discretion in the amount of the minimum rent and in the selection criteria for residents. More flexibility in rent-setting and resident selection would allow MDHA to increase its rental income and become less dependent on the PFS subsidy.", "HUD needs to change the regulations on project-based waiting lists.", "Currently, the household at the top of the list has to accept the first apartment that is available regardless of location. If the household does not want the available housing unit, the household is placed at the bottom of the waiting list and can decline only twice. Because MDHA\u2019s housing developments are up to 69 miles apart, the first apartment available to a household on the waiting list is often not where they want to live. For working families, the regulation creates even more of an inconvenience and an added burden for MDHA because the agency is attempting to encourage residents to work. If residents accept units they truly do not want, they then can develop justification to transfer to other units. For example, a doctor\u2019s opinion that a resident is not in good enough physical condition for a long commute is enough justification for a resident to receive a transfer. Every transfer increases MDHA\u2019s maintenance costs.", "Finally, MDHA officials stated that although they have had excellent working relationships with the four private management companies that manage 1,772 of the agency\u2019s housing units, they have seen no direct cost savings from the private management companies operating their properties. The officials did say, however, that they have learned a great deal from these companies and that they are operating their other developments more efficiently as a result.", "MDHA officials also told us that basing the operating subsidy on HUD\u2019s fair market rent (FMR) would be the most efficient way of distributing the funds. A system based on FMR would more accurately reflect what the rents should be for public housing in a given municipality, they said. Even if the subsidy was based only on a percentage of FMR, at least the measuring would be based on a market-generated indicator that is independent and is based on current information.

During that period, HUD could reduce the amount of a housing agency\u2019s operating subsidy if the housing agency\u2019s estimated year-end operating reserve balance exceeded its established maximum allowable operating reserve. In February 1995, HUD removed this requirement and replaced it with the operating reserve measure used in its Public Housing Management Assessment Program.

Although we report the statements of officials at four housing agencies and the conditions we found there, we have not drawn any overall conclusions about the adequacy of PFS funding nationwide. Instead, on the basis of our case studies, a survey of 800 housing agencies done by a trade group representing housing agencies, discussions with officials of trade groups and HUD, we conclude that operating subsidies may not be adequate for housing agencies whose base year expenditures were low or whose operating circumstances or costs have undergone significant change since 1975.", "We provide income and expense trends in an appendix to our report. Our analyses focused on HUD\u2019s database of housing agencies\u2019 statements of operating receipts and expenses. The analyses are limited and we draw few conclusions because the underlying data do not fully reflect housing agencies\u2019 incomes and because their expenditures are limited by the income available to cover them. We were unable to obtain complete information on housing agencies\u2019 incomes\u2014including income from states and other federal grants\u2014even from the four agencies we visited. Nevertheless, we believe that the analyses we present will provide other analysts with insights not available previously.", "The Congress did not ask us nor did we intend to define what costs the operating subsidies should be covering. Rather, it is HUD\u2019s responsibility to define the scope of costs that the PFS subsidies should cover, and one of the options that we suggest HUD might consider for redesigning PFS includes developing such a definition of covered costs.", "Finally, we disagree that much of the discussion in the report deals with needs that are more appropriately met through capital and grant funding instead of operating subsidies. Our analysis shows that just the opposite is true. We report that some housing agencies are using substantial amounts of funding from capital and other grants to fund their operating expenses. This indicates that these agencies are not receiving enough funding through PFS and rental income alone to cover these expenses. 2. We disagree that we confuse the issues of PFS adequacy and the accuracy of HUD\u2019s budget estimate. In fact, we conclude that the adequacy of PFS for individual housing agencies, which is determined by their HUD-approved allowable expense levels, and the accuracy of HUD\u2019s budget estimates for PFS are interrelated. We show that determining allowable expense levels is an integral part of the PFS methodology, and we explain that these expense levels also play a large role in developing the annual PFS budget estimate. We conclude that to the extent that expense levels are too low for agencies whose base year expenditures were low or whose operating circumstances or costs have undergone significant change since 1975, HUD\u2019s budget estimate may also be too low. 3. We agree with HUD\u2019s comment on our recommendation for revising the way HUD estimates its PFS budget request. It is premature for HUD to change its budget estimating methodology until the Department revises the way it provides subsidies to public housing agencies, as would be required under pending legislation. We also believe that given the data and timing constraints under which HUD must prepare its budget estimate, the estimate is reasonably accurate. We have, therefore, withdrawn our recommendation that the Secretary consider revising the way HUD makes its PFS estimate, and we have made changes to our report accordingly. 4. HUD raises several concerns about the draft report\u2019s recommendation that the Department consider an appeals process. In recommending such an appeals process, we intended that HUD could address both overfunded and underfunded housing agencies, and our recommendation now reflects this intent. Whether HUD designs a process that entails a labor-intensive, subjective review of all housing agencies or an analysis-based, formula-driven review would be HUD\u2019s decision. 5. We agree with HUD that the best way of knowing whether housing agencies are adequately funded is to establish a set of core services that should be provided and to determine what the cost of those services should be in each case. In our report, we offer this as one of the options available to HUD as it plans to revise PFS. However, we believe that HUD should be able to recognize whether some agencies are underfunded even if it does not precisely know the best composition of the set of core services. Our report shows that symptoms of inadequate funding are clear at certain housing agencies, and that if left to worsen, the condition of the housing stock is threatened. 6. HUD states that its approach to dealing with housing stock deterioration and social problems in public housing is to address the root causes of such problems with supplementary and competitive grants to provide protective services, maintenance, and resident services rather than to increase the subsidy. However, these activities are also covered under long-standing public housing operating expense categories that are designed to be funded with rental income or, if necessary, the operating subsidy. We conclude, therefore, that the supplementary grants are necessary because the operating subsidy has been insufficient to adequately fund these activities. 7. Our draft report noted examples of housing agencies\u2019 using funding from their operating budgets to temporarily repair their housing stock\u2014as in painting over peeling lead-based paint\u2014instead of performing necessary modernization work. However, this practice results in unexpected uses of the operating subsidy and inadequate funding in other areas. 8. HUD\u2019s letter to us lists several changes adopted by the PFS, including add-ons for legislative changes to social security, unemployment compensation, and flood insurance. HUD states that the draft report did not recognize these and other changes showing that PFS has adapted to housing agencies\u2019 changing needs. We recognize that over the years, several changes have been adopted by PFS for application across the board. However, the changes that HUD notes in its comments have little relation to the cost increases\u2014including the costs of deteriorating housing stock and increasing crime and poverty\u2014that agencies told us accounted for most of the increases in their operating costs. 9. HUD\u2019s letter disagrees with our conclusion that employee benefits have not been adequately factored into the PFS wage inflation factor increases. HUD states that we incorrectly assumed that the cost of employee benefits has grown more rapidly than the increases in the PFS wage inflation factor. In response, we contacted HUD to obtain further elaboration on HUD\u2019s inflation adjustment factor. A HUD official in its Policy Development and Research office explained that HUD\u2019s methodology for adjusting its budget estimate from 1975 to 1988 used wage survey data but excluded observations which showed a decrease in wages. As a result, HUD\u2019s inflation adjustments were too high. On this basis, we agree with HUD\u2019s comment that its wage inflation methodology kept up with actual changes in wages and benefits, albeit for the wrong reasons. Although HUD no longer adjusts the wage data in this manner, it still uses wages as its measure of labor cost change. Because housing agencies pay both wages and benefits, we still believe that a broader measure of compensation would provide a more accurate basis for making adjustments for inflation. 10. We chose not to include the issue of utilities in our report because utility expenses are relatively straightforward compared to other issues we report on. Changes in utility rates are covered by HUD, and the utility expense level is adjusted at the end of the year to reflect changes in estimated consumption. Housing agencies and HUD share on a 50-50 basis the savings or additional costs because of reductions or increases in energy consumption. 11. We have changed the text of our report accordingly. 12. We disagree with HUD and believe that at some housing agencies the overall level of income in the base year and earlier did have an impact on the initial allowable expense level and, therefore, on whether the housing agency is currently adequately funded. HUD states that before PFS was implemented, operating subsidies were based on a HUD-approved operating budget that was subsidized to cover the gap between rental income and approved expenditures. However, during the interim period from 1972 to 1974, HUD placed a cap on operating expenditures, which meant that even these HUD-approved and subsidized budgets could have been inadequate. Moreover, the amount of HUD\u2019s subsidy was based on what was available from the Congress in the first few years of subsidizing public housing\u2014an amount that grew quickly from $233 million in 1972 to over $700 million by 1979. 13. We have reconciled these points with the relevant housing agencies and made changes to our report where necessary. 14. We stand by our conclusion that for a housing agency to make extensive use of modernization and other supplementary funding to cover operating expenses is evidence of an inadequate operating subsidy. In addition, we neither state nor imply that housing agencies were using their operating subsidies for capital replacement needs, and we disagree with HUD\u2019s statement that the operating subsidy should not accommodate increases in an established operating cost category such as protective services. Moreover, by using significant portions of their modernization funding to cover operating costs, housing agencies are jeopardizing the viability of the housing stock that is in need of major repair.", "We also disagree with HUD\u2019s conclusion that housing agencies that use their supplementary funding to maintain or increase their operating reserves are doing very well. Some housing agencies might add to their operating reserves in order to score better in HUD\u2019s Public Housing Management Assessment Program, and increasing operating reserves might reflect this motivation and mask underfunding. 15. HUD correctly points out that we have reported in the past that wide differences in costs exist among public housing developments. Within a single housing agency, in fact, high-cost and low-cost developments can exist. However, cost differences among developments do not mean that housing agencies themselves are receiving sufficient subsidies. Furthermore, knowing whether public housing costs are higher or lower than the cost to house families under the Section 8 Certificate and Voucher Program does not in itself determine whether housing agencies are receiving enough subsidy to cover their expenses. Therefore, we conclude that those housing agencies with operating circumstances that have changed significantly or whose initial base year expenses might have been too low might be currently underfunded. 16. We are aware of both of the studies mentioned by HUD and reviewed them closely as part of our background research. These studies for the most part compare expenditures of public housing with those of alternative housing programs or funding options and do not draw conclusions regarding the adequacy of PFS funding to meet public housing needs. As a result, we believe that these studies do not provide data showing that housing agencies are adequately funded."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Objectives", "paragraphs": ["In Senate Report 105-53 in support of the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Bill, 1998, the Senate Committee on Appropriations requested that we study HUD\u2019s Performance Funding System (PFS) for allocating appropriated funds to housing agencies as operating subsidies.
