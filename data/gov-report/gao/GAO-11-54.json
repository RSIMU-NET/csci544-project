To do so, GAO analyzed legislation, federal documents, and literature; interviewed federal officials and transit experts; and conducted semistructured interviews with selected transit agencies using criteria that, for U.S. agencies, covered a variety of regions and population sizes and, for foreign agencies, multiple transit modes and English language capability."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Some federal transit programs distribute funds based partly on performance, but opportunities to improve grant recipients' performance accountability remain. Of the eight transit programs GAO reviewed--which represent 97 percent of total federal transit grants in fiscal year 2010 (excluding funds provided under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act)--two are generally funded by congressional direction, while the remaining six are funded through legislatively defined grant formulas. Federal funding for the two nonformula programs GAO reviewed--the New Starts Program and the Bus and Bus Related Equipment and Facilities Program--is awarded in part according to performance. A small percentage of federal transit funding for the six formula programs is apportioned based on performance--according to GAO's analysis, about 5 percent, on average, of fiscal year 2010 funding. FTA does not, in general, analyze fully or use the performance data it collects from transit agencies to evaluate the effectiveness of its transit grant programs; thus, FTA is missing a valuable opportunity to evaluate the end results of its program activities and programs' funding formulas. GAO identified three performance accountability mechanisms for making federal transit programs more performance based, including providing financial rewards or penalties/sanctions, increasing or decreasing program flexibility as a performance incentive, and recognizing entities that achieve certain performance goals. These mechanisms have both potential advantages--most notably, they can encourage improved performance and help agencies make sound decisions when allocating limited funds--and potential disadvantages that can produce inequitable results or burden transit agencies with requirements to gather, maintain, and analyze data. GAO also identified several key strategies that can support the use of these mechanisms and mitigate their disadvantages, such as ensuring that mechanisms are of sufficient value and that appropriate measures are selected, among others. However, without FTA analysis of the appropriateness, feasibility, and potential impact of using various transit performance mechanisms, Congress may lack information to determine whether and how these mechanisms could be used to make transit funding more performance based as it prepares for the upcoming surface transportation reauthorization. Transit agencies that GAO interviewed use performance measurement to varying degrees, but they face challenges in linking performance with planning and decision making. All of these agencies measure performance in certain categories, such as ridership and on-time performance, but the extent to which they measure it in others--such as environmental impact, energy usage, and economic development--varies widely. Transit agency officials reported that measuring performance presents challenges, in part because it can be difficult to obtain relevant data and develop a sound methodology. They also said that linking performance to planning and decision making is challenging because of either limited funding or political priorities. These transit agencies and other experts suggested a variety of changes to the federal role in transit, including increasing investment in existing transit infrastructure; developing federal transit program goals that generally address broader issues, such as encouraging a shift from automobiles to public transit; and promoting livable communities around transit systems. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) should (1) report to Congress on options for adding performance accountability mechanisms to transit programs to ensure efficient and effective federal transit programs and (2) further analyze and use transit agency data, when applicable, for evaluating federal transit program performance. DOT reviewed a draft of this report, provided technical clarifications, and said it would consider our recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Public transit systems provide an important source of mobility for many  Americans while also helping to alleviate traffic congestion and provide  environmental benefits. From 1999 to 2009, ridership on transit systems in  the United States grew nearly 16 percent to reach about 10.25 billion, and  despite the recent economic recession, demand for public transit has  remained near record levels, reaching a peak of 10.4 billion passenger trips  in 2008. Recent economic pressures have, however, contributed to flat or  reduced funding for many transit agencies, as well as service cuts and  higher fares. With demand for transit service near record levels, the  federal investment in transit needs to be accompanied by strong  performance accountability to ensure that funds are being used efficiently  and effectively. We have previously raised concerns about the lack of  performance accountability in federal transportation programs, including  transit, and have called for steps to enhance the accountability of federal  investments in transportation infrastructure.", "The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A  Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), enacted in August 2005, authorized over  $286 billion for federal surface transportation programs from fiscal years  2005 through 2009, including more than $52 billion for federal transit  programs, a 46 percent increase over the previous funding authorization  for transit programs. The Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2010  extended the funding authorization for SAFETEA-LU programs through  December 31, 2010. Congress and the administration are currently  debating reauthorization of the entire surface transportation program,  including transit programs. In preparation for this reauthorization, the  Department of Transportation (DOT) recently conducted a series of  \u201clistening sessions\u201d with key stakeholders and interested citizens to obtain  their views. DOT plans to issue a detailed proposal for a surface  transportation reauthorization bill in February 2011.", "While federal funding for transit has increased significantly in recent  years, most of this spending is not explicitly linked to performance. In  light of this, you asked us to examine ways to make federal transit  programs more performance based. Accordingly, this report addresses the  following questions: (1) To what extent do federal transit programs use  performance information in making decisions about distributing funds and  in evaluating the effectiveness of transit programs? (2) What mechanisms  exist for making federal transit programs more performance based,  including their potential advantages and disadvantages, and what  strategies exist for supporting their successful implementation? (3) How  have selected U.S. and foreign transit agencies incorporated performance  measurement into their planning and decision making, and what are these  agencies\u2019 views on the federal role in transit?", "To address the first objective, we reviewed 8 of the 18 federal transit  programs. These 8 programs account for nearly 97 percent of all Federal  Transit Administration (FTA) grant funds, excluding funds provided under  the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. We analyzed pertinent  federal legislation and reports, including SAFETEA-LU, the Government  Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA),  and FTA documents on  grants programs that distribute transit funds. We interviewed FTA officials  to determine the extent to which performance measurement/outcomes are  factors in funding formulas and decisions. We also compared FTA\u2019s  practices with performance system criteria found in GPRA, Transportation  Research Board (TRB) reports, and other sources. To simulate incentive  tier apportionments for formula programs, we analyzed FTA  apportionment documents and National Transit Database (NTD) data. To  address the second objective, we reviewed and synthesized literature\u2014 including GAO, FTA, TRB, and other transportation reports\u2014and  interviewed transit agency officials and industry experts to describe what  mechanisms exist for making federal transit programs more performance  based, the advantages and disadvantages of those mechanisms, and the  strategies that exist for overcoming disadvantages. Finally, to describe  how selected U.S. and foreign transit agencies incorporate performance  measurement into their planning and decision making and their views on  the federal role in transit, we conducted semistructured interviews with 10  U.S. transit agencies, selected to ensure geographic distribution and  variation in the size of the population served, as well as 2 foreign transit  agencies, selected, in part, based on the number of transportation modes  offered by their system. The information we gathered from these agencies,  however, cannot be generalized across all U.S. or foreign transit agencies.  We also conducted interviews with industry experts to obtain their views  on how transit agencies incorporate performance measurement into  funding and strategic decisions.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2009 through  November 2010 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.

The remaining grant funding distribution is based on  infrastructure-related factors, such as total route miles and revenue  vehicle miles, or demographic factors, as shown in table 1. Performance  measures include measures of costs per passenger mile or vehicle revenue  miles per capita because they measure agencies\u2019 activities against  capacity, demand, or costs. To illustrate this, using the example of costs  per passenger mile, an agency with low costs that is also providing a low  level of service (i.e., a low number of passenger miles) is not performing as  well as an agency with comparable population and population density that  is able to provide a high number of passenger miles while keeping costs  per passenger mile low.", "One of the six formula grant programs we reviewed\u2014the Urbanized Area  Formula Grant\u2014bases funding, in part, on performance, per statutory  requirements, while the other five formula programs we reviewed are  funded entirely based on demographic and infrastructure-related factors  as shown in table 1. Under the Urbanized Area Formula Grant Program,  approximately 8 percent of the funding, on average, is apportioned based  on transit agency performance, although the actual percentage of an  individual transit agency\u2019s funding based on performance varies. This  program apportions funds to two groups of agencies, as follows:    For transit agencies in urbanized areas with populations under 200,000,  (small cities), funding is apportioned based mostly on demographic data.  However, urbanized areas may be eligible for additional incentive funding,  which is apportioned in the following way: For each of six performance  measures for which the urbanized area performs above the average  performance of larger urbanized areas, small city urbanized areas may  receive additional funding in the apportionment. In the end, only 1  percent of total funding for this grant program is apportioned in this way.", "For urbanized areas with populations of 200,000 or greater, funding is  apportioned in part based on infrastructure-related measures and in part  through an incentive tier measuring passenger miles per dollar of  operating costs. The remaining 7 percent of performance-based funding  for this program is apportioned in this way. However, the incentive for an  agency to change its behavior to increase its grant apportionment is small  compared with its operating costs. GAO\u2019s simulations of the incentive tier  apportionment show that a 10 percent increase in an urbanized area\u2019s  passenger miles (while holding the area\u2019s operating costs and data for all  other urbanized areas constant) typically results in additional funding of  less than 0.5 percent of operating costs for the area. Several aspects of the  design of the transit formula incentive tier contribute to the relatively  small size of the incentive available to a transit agency. First, the overall  level of funding apportioned under the incentive tier is relatively small,  both as a fraction of total federal aid for the Urbanized Area Formula  Grant Program and also as a fraction of current operating expenses.  Second, because all the transit agencies within an urbanized area are  included in the passenger miles and operating costs of the urbanized area,  the incentive apportionment to a single transit agency may be affected by  changes in the behavior of other agencies within the urbanized area.  Additionally, even if a transit agency\u2019s increased performance results in an  increased apportionment amount for the urbanized area, there is no  guarantee that that transit agency will benefit from the increased  apportionment, as the designated recipient is responsible for allocating the  apportioned funds among area agencies. As we discuss later in this  report, when an incentive is not of sufficient value, the expected return  does not outweigh the expected risk or costs, and recipients are not  motivated to pursue the performance improvement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Once Grants Are Awarded, FTA Collects Performance Information on the Programs as Required, but Generally Does Not Use Performance Data to Evaluate the Effectiveness of FTA\u2019s Grant Programs", "paragraphs": ["FTA has developed some performance measures and targets related to  DOT\u2019s strategic goals. Some of these strategic goals and performance  measures are related to internal DOT and FTA performance (e.g.,  organizational excellence); others relate to how well DOT and FTA  programs are performing. FTA tracks performance against a set target. For  example, in DOT\u2019s Performance and Accountability Report and FTA\u2019s  budget documents, FTA provides information on the following goals and  measures:    Related to DOT\u2019s safety goal, FTA measures transit fatalities and injuries  per 100 million passenger-miles traveled.", "Related to DOT\u2019s reduced congestion goal, FTA measures the average  percentage change in ridership for the 150 largest transit agencies, as well  as the percentage of bus fleets and rail stations compliant with the  Americans with Disability Act of 1990.", "Also related to DOT\u2019s reduced congestion goal, FTA measures the number  of jobs made accessible by the JARC program.", "In addition to measuring and reporting performance in these areas, FTA has  implemented several initiatives aimed at improving grantee performance.  For instance, FTA\u2019s Transit State of Good Repair program, which focuses on  ensuring that local transit systems are maintained in a state of good repair,  initiated a national discussion about the condition of the nation\u2019s  infrastructure as an issue posing pressing challenges for most of the nation\u2019s  transit systems. The goals of this initiative are to raise awareness of state of  good repair issues throughout the industry, bring stakeholders together to  assess and measure the scope of maintenance problems, and explore  creative approaches to financing necessary repairs and upgrades for aging  transportation assets. Additionally, FTA recognizes high-performing transit  agencies with nonfinancial awards through various programs. For example,  through 2008, FTA recognized transit agencies that experienced significant  increases in public transportation ridership. The program was suspended in  2009 in response to the overall trend of decreasing ridership.", "FTA also collects performance data from about 2,000 transit agencies through  the National Transit Database (NTD) and other reporting requirements.  The reporting requirements vary somewhat by program, as follows:    Recipients of Urbanized Area Formula Grants and Nonurbanized Area  Formula Grants are required to submit information on performance and  other information to the National Transit Database. This includes  information on ridership, vehicle revenue miles, vehicle information (such  as the age and type of the vehicle), and financial information, among other  categories.", "Recipients of several other transit grants are required to report  performance information specific to the goals of the program to help FTA  fulfill its obligations under GPRA.

JARC recipients are required to report information on the number of jobs  made accessible and the number of rides provided as a result of JARC  funding. Recipients of the New Freedom grant program are required to  report on services and rides provided to individuals with disabilities and  changes made to infrastructure, technology, or vehicles that affect the  availability of transportation services as a result of the New Freedom  projects implemented in the current reporting year.", "FTA has set targets for some broad goals and has some initiatives aimed at  increasing grantee performance, but does not, in general, use the  performance data it collects to evaluate the effectiveness of its grant  programs. FTA officials stated that FTA\u2019s strategic goals and objectives  are generally determined based on their relationship to DOT\u2019s strategic  goals as well as the priorities of senior FTA officials. We have previously  reported that agencies can use performance information to, among other  things, identify problems or weaknesses in programs, to try to identify  factors causing the problems, and to modify a service or process to try to  address problems. FTA officials use collected performance data to track  overall program trends and performance on a national level, but not to  determine the link between specific FTA program activities and changes in  performance. For example, FTA reports performance statistics to  Congress through its biennial report, Status of the Nation\u2019s Highways,  Bridges, and Transit: Conditions and Performance. This report  includes the change over time for statistics such as average operating  speed, vehicle use statistics, frequency and reliability of services,  condition of transit assets and infrastructure, and safety, among others.  However, FTA does not explore the potential reasons for a change in  performance over time. Similarly, FTA officials stated that FTA does not  conduct analysis of changes in transit agency performance or set targets  for the measures that are incentivized in grant formulas to determine what  effect incentives have on transit agency performance (i.e., the extent to  which the incentive funding is having the desired outcome). As a result,  FTA is missing a valuable opportunity to evaluate the end results of its  program activities and SAFETEA-LU funding formulas.

However, the extent to which a reward or penalty motivates  performance depends on its importance to the agency\u2014if a financial  reward or penalty is too small, for example, it may not affect behavior. At  the same time, a reward that is too small to influence a large agency may  be significant to a smaller agency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Disadvantages to Using Performance Mechanisms Are That They Can Burden Transit Agencies, Produce Inequitable Results, and Raise Other Concerns", "paragraphs": ["Our literature review found not only advantages associated with  performance accountability mechanisms but some potential downsides  and concerns as well.", "Most notably, to demonstrate that an incentive has been achieved or that a  penalty is not warranted, agencies have to gather, maintain, and  analyze data, and these tasks require resources. Therefore, to the  extent possible, the measure on which an incentive or penalty is awarded  or assessed should be based on readily available information, or  information that could be readily obtained. If not, it could place a burden  on the agency\u2019s resources.", "Additionally, when penalizing organizations for not meeting requirements,  there are concerns that (1) an organization may be penalized before  it has a chance to address its performance problems, and (2) a  punitive approach to performance accountability may be taken  rather than a constructive approach. For example, even if penalties  are employed to promote performance accountability, there should be a  constructive, collaborative approach to performance improvement that  both precedes and follows the penalty.", "Our literature review also identified other disadvantages that relate  specifically to implementing financial performance accountability  mechanisms. These include the following:    The zero-sum nature of performance-based allocations, particularly  under constrained resources, can cause inequity, as programs can  improve and still receive nothing. For example, all recipients might  improve their performance, so that those improving the least might not be  rewarded. Also, under resource constraints, performance-based  allocations are not likely to provide a meaningful incentive to improve  performance or may not be possible. For instance, a basic reason behind  tying the allocation of funding to performance is that this will provide an  incentive for funding recipients to perform better (to either generate  additional funds or avoid financial penalties). However, according to a  2004 study on the use of performance standards and measures for public  transportation systems, there is not much evidence that the various  formulas used to fund transit agencies actually produce this result. One  reason is that even if a single transit system were to make significant  performance improvements, the current apportionment formulas do not  result in much of a funding change from year to year (in part because of  the fact that the change in one system is but a small fraction of the  statewide or nationwide numbers that feed into the formulas).", "Well-funded grant recipients, with the staff and resources to  implement more sweeping changes, may be rewarded at the  expense of poorly funded ones that may have more pressing  operational concerns. Moreover, for poorly funded recipients, the  amount of improvements required may not be realistically attainable  through changes within the recipients\u2019 control. For example, according to  the previously mentioned study done in 2004, some transit agencies would  like to see an increase in the funding provided from local, as opposed to  state and federal, sources. However, a funding stream that includes a  requirement for contribution of local dollars could be particularly difficult  to accomplish for rural systems with limited revenue or for systems where  local leaders do not support a contribution of local dollars. This could  result in a transit system being penalized financially for a decision made  outside its control, with an ensuing decline in service quality. To be fair,  factors well beyond the control of the transit agency are often drivers of  performance (e.g., local economic problems leading to a drop in  employment that in turn leads to a drop in ridership).", "Grant recipients may be charged with meeting conflicting goals. For  example, if an important local goal for a transit agency is to increase  geographic service coverage, the achievement of this goal might have  negative impacts on performance as commonly defined\u2014efficiency and/or  effectiveness. For a transit system that wants to develop new evening or  weekend service, generally such service will be less productive than  weekday service. Performance-based funding is likely to provide a  disincentive for providing such service.", "If not designed correctly, performance mechanisms can introduce  perverse incentives. For example, regarding a federal employment  program that has used incentive awards\u2014the Workforce Investment Act\u2019s  Title I-B Program for Dislocated Workers\u2014we reported in 2009 that local  agency officials receiving grants under the program may be reluctant to  provide services to job seekers that are less likely to find and maintain a  job, because the incentive award is tied to achieving performance levels in  placement and retention. This is contrary to the program\u2019s objective,  which is to assist all job seekers in obtaining employment.", "Finally, when considering the use of performance accountability  mechanisms for transit agencies, DOT officials noted that transit grant  recipients operate within the context of their local, state, and regional  government structures and funding sources. Therefore, some changes may  need to be enacted by other organizations to improve transit service, and it  may be appropriate to provide incentives to these other government  structures as well."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Strategies Can Help Overcome Some Disadvantages of Performance Accountability Mechanisms and Help Ensure Successful Implementation of Those Mechanisms", "paragraphs": ["Our earlier work discusses how five key strategies collectively facilitate  the effective selection, design, and implementation of performance  accountability mechanisms.

Measures should represent  performance that is within the grantee\u2019s sphere of influence, and can  reasonably be achieved and evaluated within the specified time frame,  and should be tested over time to minimize the potential for  unintended consequences and perverse incentives. Additionally,  performance data should be tested and validated to make sure they are  credible, reliable, and valid. Absent these attributes, organizations lack  the basis for sound decisions about rewards and penalties.  4.  Ensure grantor and grantee technical capacity. Grantors and grantees  should have the necessary knowledge about performance  accountability mechanisms and the ability to effectively implement  them.  5.  Ensure phased implementation. Allow time to design, test, and revise  measurement systems before linking them to accountability  mechanisms.", "These five key strategies can help mitigate the disadvantages we have  previously discussed related to using performance accountability  mechanisms, as shown in table 4.", "Some of these strategies address multiple disadvantages. For example,  table 4 shows that ensuring appropriate measures are selected could  mitigate four of the six disadvantages. In addition, we found in our  literature review that to ensure financial stability, many sources advocated  for providing transit agencies with a baseline funding amount that would  enable grantees to know the minimum (or a baseline amount) that they  would receive each year, and then providing additional funds that would  be based on performance. Although not a key strategy, this more specific  option would help address the following three disadvantages: the zero-sum  nature of performance-based allocations, well-funded grant recipients  being rewarded at the expense of poorly funded ones, and grant recipients  being charged with meeting conflicting goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appropriateness of and Success in Using Performance Accountability Mechanisms Depend on Program Goals, but Little Is Known about Using These Mechanisms in Transit Programs", "paragraphs": ["Although performance mechanisms can provide advantages, and the  disadvantages can be mitigated, they are still not suitable for all programs.  As previously discussed, the eight federal transit programs that we  reviewed are designed to accomplish different goals, and the use of  performance accountability mechanisms is better suited to some than to  others. For example, discretionary grant programs such as New Starts,  which are designed to award funds to the best potential performers, may  be better suited to the use of performance accountability mechanisms,  while formula programs, such as the Urbanized Area Formula Grant  Program and Fixed-Guideway Modernization Program, which are intended  to support the financial stability of transit agencies or distributional equity,  may be less well suited. We have found that performance accountability  mechanisms need to be tailored to specific situations, since not all  mechanisms are appropriate to all situations, and there is no \u201cone-size-fits- all\u201d solution to performance accountability. Furthermore, according to  FTA, transit systems vary in size, resources, and community needs, making  it less productive to judge all systems on a common set of performance  measures or performance accountability mechanisms.", "Even though mechanisms are not all appropriate for all situations,  performance accountability mechanisms still hold promise. As we have  described in the previous section of this report, DOT is requiring some  transportation grants to be based on performance, with good results in  some departments. For example, NHTSA used performance information  on alcohol-related injuries and fatalities to target grant funding and  specific program strategies to states with the highest impaired driver rates.  However, DOT has only required transit grants to be minimally based on  performance. Expanding the use of performance accountability  mechanisms in the area of transit could help make transit grants more  performance based. The performance accountability mechanisms  described in this report suggest opportunities for FTA to study their  impact and potentially use them to make transit grants more performance  based\u2014i.e., to identify grantee performance problems, look for solutions,  and make other important management decisions, per leading practices.", "Congress also has a role to play in increasing the use of performance  mechanisms in transit, as part of its process of setting national priorities  and allocating the resources to achieve them. Congress has a number of  opportunities to initiate the use of performance mechanisms, such as  when it establishes or reauthorizes a program, during the annual  appropriations process, and during hearings focused on program and  agency operations. Moreover, our 2006 report on performance  accountability mechanisms recommended that the federal Office of  Management and Budget encourage and assist federal agencies in working  with Congress to expand the effective use of performance accountability  mechanisms when federal grant programs are being created or  reauthorized. As noted earlier in this report, Congress and the  administration are currently debating reauthorization of the entire surface  transportation program, including transit programs.", "However, without FTA analysis of the appropriateness, feasibility, and  potential impact of using various transit performance mechanisms,  Congress may lack the information needed to identify and implement the  most effective mechanisms and better help transit agencies maximize their  potential.

In particular, officials from 1 agency  added that measuring the agency\u2019s impact on employment generation is  challenging because it is difficult to isolate the agency\u2019s effect on  employment. Similarly, officials from 5 of the transit agencies said it was  challenging to measure environmental impact generally because it was  difficult to determine a method for measuring it or to obtain relevant data.  For example, an official from 1 agency said that it is difficult to measure  how much pollution a bus generates compared with the pollution from  passenger vehicles that the bus is displacing, in part because emissions  from these passenger vehicles can vary widely and relevant data are  difficult to obtain. Moreover, we were told by officials from 7 of the transit  agencies that it is challenging to measure performance because  performance is affected by numerous factors that are out of a transit  agency\u2019s control, like economic conditions or weather. For example, an  official from 1 agency noted that ridership is affected by economic  conditions, such as employment. Officials from another agency also said  that ridership data can be influenced by the elimination of funding for a  route because, according to the officials, the elimination of routes makes it  difficult to measure annual changes in overall ridership. Additionally,  officials from 1 agency told us that some transit systems operate in  environments that an agency has less control over, particularly bus  systems, which can make measuring performance on these systems more  difficult than for dedicated systems like subways.

Officials from 2 transit agencies said that information on  customer satisfaction helped them understand customer perceptions  about their system, which informed decisions and planning regarding  issues like funding allocations and setting of strategic goals. For example,  officials from 1 of these agencies said customer perceptions about the  transit system\u2019s security led the agency to make decisions and plans that  included allocating more funding toward transit police, developing a  customer security performance measure, and setting a strategic goal of  increasing customer security.

Because of  the lack of incentives of sufficient value to grantees in formula programs,  the federal transit grant system has limited ability to influence the  activities and priorities of local grantees and to ensure that the goals and  priorities of the federal transit program are achieved. Further decreasing  the federal government\u2019s ability to positively affect the performance of  local transit agencies is FTA\u2019s limited analysis of the extent to which  transit grants, current formula incentives, and FTA program activities have  had an effect on transit agency performance. The Government  Performance and Results Act of 1993, as amended, emphasized managing  results and identifying opportunities to improve performance and increase  accountability.

Concerning the extent to which  performance information is incorporated into efforts to evaluate the  effectiveness of transit programs, we also analyzed FTA documents and  interviewed FTA officials. We relied on criteria found in the Government  Performance and Results Act, Transportation Research Board reports, and  other sources, which indicate, among other things, that performance- based systems should have defined goals and objectives, link performance  measures and program activities, have steps to monitor and report on  performance, integrate performance results into decision making, and  review and update performance systems periodically.
