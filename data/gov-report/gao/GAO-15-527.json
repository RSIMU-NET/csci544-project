To do this, GAO surveyed the 50 states and the District of Columbia, reviewed relevant documentation from the states and CMS, and interviewed CMS officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["States reported to the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) that they spent about $1.45 billion in federal marketplace grant funding on information technology (IT) projects supporting health insurance marketplaces, as of March 2015. The majority of this spending was for state-based marketplaces (i.e., marketplaces established and operated by the states). These marketplaces reported spending nearly 89 percent of the funds on IT contracts, and CMS has ongoing efforts to track states' IT spending in more detailed categories. States also reported spending, as of December 2014, $2.78 billion in combined federal and state funds designated for Medicaid eligibility and enrollment systems\u2014a portion of which was used for marketplace IT projects. However, the specific amount spent on marketplace-related projects was uncertain, as only a selected number of states reported to GAO that they tracked or estimated this information. Regarding the status of states' marketplace IT projects, 14 states with state-based marketplaces had developed and were operating IT systems to support their marketplaces, but, as of February 2015, not all system functions were complete. In addition, as of November 2014, 7 of 37 states using the federal marketplace system could not transfer health insurance applications between their state Medicaid systems and a key component of the federal marketplace or had not completed testing or certification of these functions. According to CMS officials, states operating their own IT systems and states using the federal marketplace system were continuing to improve the development and operation of their marketplaces in the enrollment period that began in November 2014.", "CMS tasked various offices with responsibilities for overseeing states' marketplace IT projects. However, the agency did not always clearly document, define, or communicate its oversight roles and responsibilities to states as called for by best practices for project management. According to some states, this resulted in instances of poor communication with CMS, which adversely affected states' deadlines, increased uncertainty, and required additional work. CMS also did not involve all relevant senior executives in decisions to approve federal funding for states' IT marketplace projects; such involvement, according to leading practices for investment management, can increase accountability for decision making. Further, while CMS established a process that required the testing of state marketplace systems to determine whether they were ready to be made operational, these systems were not always fully tested, increasing the risk that they would not operate as intended. For their part, states oversaw their IT projects through state agencies or quasi-governmental entities, depending on marketplace type, as well as using other oversight mechanisms.", "States reported a number of challenges in establishing the systems supporting their marketplaces. These fell into several categories, including project management and oversight, system design and development, resource allocation and distribution, and marketplace implementation and operation. States also identified lessons learned from dealing with such challenges, including the need for strong project management and clear requirements development. CMS has taken various actions to respond to state challenges, identify lessons learned, and share best practices with states; continuing these efforts will be important as states work to complete their marketplace systems."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that CMS define and communicate its oversight roles and responsibilities, ensure senior executives are involved in funding decisions for state IT projects, and ensure that states complete testing of their systems before they are put into operation.

We  also reviewed CMS\u2019s Enterprise Life Cycle guidance for systems  development reviews, and reports documenting states\u2019 operational  readiness reviews to assess the extent to which CMS followed its  processes. We also reviewed the survey responses and supporting  documentation to determine states\u2019 marketplace oversight roles and how  the states viewed CMS\u2019s oversight and guidance in regard to their  marketplace-related projects. Lastly, we interviewed CMS officials  responsible for overseeing implementation of the state marketplaces to  obtain their perspectives on their marketplace roles.", "To describe IT challenges encountered in developing and operating the  marketplaces and connected systems and lessons learned from these  efforts, we analyzed the survey responses related to challenges and  lessons learned. Specifically, in administering the survey, we asked the  states to rate their experiences with each of various challenges  presented, based on the type of marketplace they used (i.e., one  established by the state or the federally facilitated marketplace). The  challenges to be considered by states that developed their own  marketplaces were divided into five areas in the survey (project  management and oversight, marketplace IT solution design, marketplace  IT solution development, resource allocation and distribution, and  marketplace implementation and operation). The challenges to be  considered by states that used the federally facilitated marketplace were  divided into two areas (project management and oversight and system  design and development) based on the IT work each marketplace  performs.", "We asked states to rate their experiences with each of these challenge  areas using a 5-point scale with the following response options: very  great challenge, great challenge, moderate challenge, somewhat of a  challenge, or little or no challenge.

For hub services, the official noted that the Washington  Healthplanfinder successfully used multiple services offered by the  federal hub to verify Social Security numbers, citizenship, lawful  presence, income, and other eligibility factors and that the  marketplace has tested these services. However, CMS\u2019s February  2015 operational status report noted that it had only partially  completed certain hub services for verifying eligibility.

We  developed two versions of this survey: one for states with state-based  marketplaces, including those using the federal marketplace IT solution,  and one for states with a federally facilitated marketplace or federally  facilitated partnership. Seventeen states received the state-based  version of the survey, and 34 states received the federally facilitated  version. Generally, the survey asked state program officials about  federal and state funding for developing and operating state  marketplace-related IT projects,  state marketplace and project types,", "CMS\u2019s and state\u2019s marketplace oversight roles and tools, and  challenges and lessons learned with state marketplace IT  development and operations.", "Out of the original population of state health marketplaces in the 50 states  and the District of Columbia, 46 states and the District of Columbia  submitted survey responses; however, not all respondents provided  answers to every question. We did not independently verify the data the  states provided in each case, but we did, in selected cases, compare  them to equivalent CMS data. We also relied on CMS-provided data,  rather than survey data, in most cases because we received more up-to- date and complete information from CMS. The survey was administered  between September 30, 2014, and November 19, 2014. The status of  state marketplace types is as of the end of the second enrollment  period\u2014which ended on February 15, 2015.", "Several weeks before the survey period began, we notified recipients that  they would be receiving it and confirmed that they were the appropriate  state contacts. We also followed up with non-respondents several times  before the survey period ended.", "In developing the surveys, we took steps to ensure the accuracy and  reliability of responses. We pre-tested the survey with marketplace and  Medicaid officials from seven states to ensure that the questions were  clear, comprehensive, and unbiased, and to minimize the burden the  questionnaire placed on respondents.", "To determine how states have used federal funds to establish, support,  and connect to health insurance marketplaces and the overall status of  their development and operation, we reviewed CMS guidance regarding  federal funding and development for marketplaces such as the  marketplace grant funding opportunity announcement, instructions for  marketplace reporting, guidance for marketplace and Medicaid IT  systems, and blueprint guidance for approval of state marketplace types.  We also reviewed best practices for IT investment management and  managing program costs. We then reviewed CMS funding and status  documentation, including notices of grant awards and state IT spending  and status summaries. We also analyzed state survey responses on  costs and development status, including state documentation on federal  grant and Medicaid costs.", "To assess the reliability of CMS\u2019s data on state-reported IT spending to  establish, support, and connect to marketplaces, we assessed the  reliability of the systems used to collect the information. We asked  officials responsible for entering and reviewing the grants information a  series of questions about the accuracy and reliability of the data. Among  the sources of data used for our study, we reviewed a spreadsheet  compiled by CMS Center for Consumer Information and Insurance  Oversight officials that contained state-reported grant funding data and  marketplace IT project status information drawn from three separate  information systems: CMS\u2019s On-Line Data Collection System, Grant  Solutions, and the Payment Management System. The spreadsheet  was a consistent source of information that reflected the same cost  factors for all states as of March 2015. Specifically, the spreadsheet  tracked, among other things, the type and total amount of grant funding  provided and available to each state, as well as the time period for  expending those funds. We also reviewed the data to determine if there  were any outliers and other obvious errors in the data. For any anomalies  in the data, we followed up with CMS to either understand or correct  those anomalies.  We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable  for our purposes and noted any limitations in our report. While our report  discusses state-reported IT spending based on CMS data, we did not  verify the accuracy of the data states reported to CMS.", "We also reviewed our recent report on Medicaid funding for eligibility IT  system changes, which addressed state-reported Medicaid expenditure  data from CMS-64\u2014a form that states complete quarterly to obtain  federal reimbursement for services provided or administrative costs  incurred. We updated our review of states\u2019 reported expenditures,  beginning with the quarter ending June 30, 2011, the first quarter for  which 90/10 funds were available to states, through the quarter ending  December 31, 2014. To determine the reliability of the CMS-64 data, we  reviewed related documentation and our prior records of interviews with  CMS officials describing how these data are collected and processed; we  also examined other research that has used these data to report state  expenditures. We determined that the data we used in this report were  sufficiently reliable and noted any limitations in our report.", "In addition, we reviewed and analyzed CMS documentation of states\u2019  marketplace status and operation progress and challenges to summarize  the status of marketplaces. We reviewed states\u2019 survey responses  regarding changes in and the status of developing and operating their  marketplace IT solutions. We also reviewed CMS state marketplace  operational status reports as of February 2015 and the CMS State  Exchange Resource Tracking System as of April 2015. We did not  independently verify the accuracy of CMS\u2019s data on states\u2019 operational  status. We also obtained input from CMS regarding funding and status of  marketplaces through interviews with knowledgeable officials.", "To determine CMS\u2019s and states\u2019 roles in overseeing these state IT  projects, we analyzed applicable federal laws and regulations, CMS  marketplace policies and guidance, documentation on applicable CMS  marketplace roles and responsibilities and state marketplace governance  structures, state survey responses regarding their governance structures,  and state survey responses and ratings regarding the effectiveness of  CMS guidance, oversight, and related systems.", "We also compared CMS\u2019s policies and procedures to best practices  included in GAO\u2019s IT investment management framework and to the  Project Management Institute\u2019s A Guide to the Project Management Body  of Knowledge (PMBOK\u00ae Guide) to determine whether CMS had roles  and responsibilities clearly documented and communicated in its policies  and procedures. Further, we reviewed CMS\u2019s funding oversight  processes and compared them to relevant sections of GAO\u2019s IT  investment management framework to determine if CMS followed best  practices for overseeing IT investments. We used our survey results to  describe how the states viewed CMS\u2019s oversight and guidance in regard  to the marketplace-related IT projects.", "We also reviewed CMS\u2019s Enterprise Life Cycle guidance for systems  development reviews and reports from states\u2019 operational readiness  reviews from August and September 2013 to assess the extent to which  CMS followed its process. In addition, we reviewed state survey  responses and other state-provided documents to determine states\u2019  marketplace oversight roles. Further, we interviewed CMS officials  responsible for the oversight and implementation of the state  marketplaces to obtain their perspective on their marketplace roles.", "To describe IT challenges encountered in developing and operating the  marketplace and connected systems as well as lessons learned from  these efforts, we analyzed state survey responses related to challenges,  lessons learned, and best practices identified by state officials and  documentation such as CMS meeting presentations. For the state  surveys, we identified a variety of marketplace-related IT challenges  based on our analysis of CMS and state documentation and interviews,  and grouped these challenges according to several broad areas. State- based marketplace challenges were divided into five areas in the survey  (project management and oversight, marketplace IT solution design,  marketplace IT solution development, resource allocation and distribution,  and marketplace implementation and operation), while federally facilitated  challenges were divided into two areas (project management and  oversight and system design and development) based on the IT work  each marketplace performs. For the purposes of our report, we  consolidated the marketplace IT solution design and marketplace IT  solution development challenge areas for the state-based marketplaces.", "In both the state-based and federally facilitated versions of our survey, we  asked states to rate their experience with each of these identified  challenges using a 5-point scale with the following response options: very  great challenge, great challenge, moderate challenge, somewhat of a  challenge, or little or no challenge. In our report, we combined the very  great and great state ratings. We then analyzed states\u2019 ratings of  challenges and using counts of the \u201cvery great\u201d and \u201cgreat\u201d responses, we  selected the greatest (i.e., the top two) challenges from each area for  discussion in this report. If a challenge area applied to both states using a  state-based marketplace and states with a federally facilitated  marketplace, the greatest challenges from each marketplace type were  selected.", "Further, we asked each state to identify whether they had identified best  practices or lessons learned within each challenge area of our survey,  and to include specific examples of those best practices and lessons. We  reviewed all written survey responses regarding states\u2019 lessons learned to  ensure these lessons were appropriately categorized into each identified  challenge area. Based on our qualitative analysis of the states\u2019 survey  responses, we identified the number of states that provided lessons  learned and then provided examples of the best practices or lessons  learned that related to the greatest challenges in each area, if there were  any. We also interviewed CMS and state officials responsible for the  oversight and implementation of the state marketplaces to determine  what the agency did to identify and share states\u2019 challenges, best  practices, and lessons learned.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2014 to September 2015  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
