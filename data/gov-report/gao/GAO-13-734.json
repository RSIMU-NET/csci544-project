In 2002, DHS was created from 22 legacy agencies. The geographic overlap of these agencies' legacy field office structures was extensive, underscoring the importance of collaboration among them when conducting missions that crossed across boundaries. As a follow-on to GAO's September 2012 report on DHS's efforts to integrate field operations, GAO was asked to review DHS and key operational components' use of collaborative mechanisms. This report (1) assesses DHS's visibility over collaborative field mechanisms established by component agencies, and (2) describes factors that enhance or impede collaboration within these mechanisms, and the extent to which DHS has collected and disseminated successful collaborative practices.", "GAO analyzed selected mechanisms' guidance; conducted 10 mechanism site visits based on their geographic diversity, among other factors; and compared their practices with collaboration practices identified in previous GAO work. GAO also interviewed DHS and component officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Opportunities exist for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to enhance its visibility over collaborative field mechanisms (i.e., multiagency groups such as task forces, committees, and teams that enhance stakeholder collaboration to more effectively and efficiently achieve their missions) established by component agencies. DHS, at the departmental level, has limited visibility over the universe and operation of these mechanisms and does not identify information from them that could further enhance collaboration across DHS and inform future DHS decisions. In the absence of a single DHS regional/field structure, DHS components have created collaborative mechanisms to better integrate field operations by better coordinating their missions and sharing information. However, when GAO sought to identify these mechanisms, in conjunction with DHS, senior DHS officials stated that while they maintain regular visibility over component activities--which may involve these collaborative mechanisms--DHS does not collect information on the types of mechanisms and collaborative practices these mechanisms employ because the mechanisms operate under the components, and thus this information was not readily available at the departmental level. DHS officials stated that primary oversight over the mechanisms is the responsibility of the operational components or mechanism participants. However, DHS's own strategic goals emphasize the importance of cross-departmental integration and coordination to enhance DHS's mission, and DHS could benefit--on a strategic level--from greater awareness of these mechanisms and the collaborative practices they employ. DHS is ultimately accountable for the resources that support these mechanisms, and is responsible for decision making about its overall field structure and for moving the department closer to its goal of greater component unification and integration. By collecting additional information on collaborative mechanisms, DHS could achieve better visibility over the universe of existing mechanisms, and thus be better positioned to analyze or implement any future changes to DHS's regional/field structure.", "Participants from each of the collaborative mechanisms GAO reviewed identified several common factors that enhanced their collaboration, which DHS could benefit from collecting and disseminating on a broader scale. For example, participants identified the value of sharing resources, information, and recognition of successful missions as examples of successful collaboration practices they employed. Officials also cited collaboration challenges, including resource constraints, rotation of key personnel, and lack of leadership commitment. As GAO's fieldwork indicated, similar collaboration issues are relevant to multiple components, thus, DHS leadership could benefit from undertaking a review of collaborative mechanisms to solicit and identify promising practices, and then sharing this information among all components. In addition, given DHS's more strategic perspective, a more centralized DHS clearinghouse of collaborative practices information could be more efficient to collect and more easily accessed by a wider range of DHS components than under the current structure, where such information may not be readily shared outside of individual components or mechanisms. Collecting and disseminating information on collaborative practices would allow DHS to inform components about promising practices and lessons learned from which they could benefit."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DHS (1) collect information on existing collaborative mechanisms for better visibility over them, and (2) collect promising practices from the mechanisms and distribute them to components. DHS concurred with the recommendations and identified planned actions to address them."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is the third-largest cabinet- level department in the federal government, with an annual budget of  about $60 billion, 200,000 staff, and a broad range of missions, including  aviation, maritime, and border security, as well as emergency  management and infrastructure protection, among others. In 2002, when  DHS was created from 22 separate agencies, among other actions, it had  to integrate many disparate agencies\u2014some with long histories of  independent or autonomous operations, and all with distinct operational  cultures\u2014while maintaining their unique strengths and capabilities. This  merger presented significant public policy and management challenges  for DHS. With its establishment, DHS also inherited the legacy field office  structures and authorities of its component agencies, which resulted in an  environment where components were conducting their respective  missions in overlapping geographic regions. These overlapping  component boundaries were especially relevant to DHS\u2019s seven key  operational components\u2014U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP),  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Federal  Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the U.S. Coast Guard  (USCG), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the  Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and the U.S. Secret  Service (USSS)\u2014and each component was accustomed to carrying out  its missions within its identified set of geographic regions and system of  field offices.", "Further, in November 2010, we reported on the overlap in mission and  operational boundaries that exists among agencies at the northern and  southern borders\u2014a condition that requires coordination and  collaboration for efficient and effective law enforcement. In some cases,  agencies have separate responsibility for investigating crimes that are  committed by the same criminals or organizations in the same geographic  region, making agency collaboration and coordination important to their  mission success. The overlap in geographic and operational boundaries  among DHS components that continues to exist underscores the  importance of collaboration and coordination among these components  when conducting their missions 10 years after beginning operations under  DHS. Agencies not sharing information or coordinating their operations  can lead to competition, interference, and operational inflexibility, as the  DHS Inspector General reported in 2005 and 2007. However,  interagency mechanisms or strategies to coordinate programs that  address crosscutting issues may reduce potentially duplicative,  overlapping, and fragmented efforts. Figure 1 provides an example of the  extent to which geographic boundaries overlap in the southwestern  United States for four of the seven DHS key operational components  discussed in this report\u2014FEMA, CBP, ICE, and USCG.", "Recognizing the overlapping geographic and operational boundaries of its  components and the potential coordination and other benefits to be  gained by better aligning its field organizational structure, DHS has  considered potential organizational changes to its field structure twice  since its inception in 2003. These efforts included a recommendation in  DHS\u2019s 2010 Bottom-Up Review Report (BUR) that the department create  a single unified field structure for its key operational components to  improve intra-agency coordination, among other things. However, we  reported in September 2012 that creating a single unified field structure  was no longer DHS\u2019s preferred approach because of operational and  budgetary constraints. We also reported that DHS could have better  documented its examination of the potential costs and benefits of a single  unified field structure. The department agreed with our findings and  acknowledged that its efforts to assess regionalization, colocation,  consolidation, and operational integration options could have been better  documented.", "Even without a single unified field structure, increasing regional  collaboration across DHS components may help facilitate more effective  and efficient mission execution. For example, increasing collaboration  across components could facilitate information sharing and allow  agencies to coordinate their patrols within a common geographic region,  allowing them to more effectively and efficiently conduct their missions.  Increasing collaboration within DHS also aligns with both congressional  and executive branch recognition of the need for improved collaboration  across the federal government as indicated by the Government  Performance and Results Act Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA),  which, among other things, establishes a new framework aimed at taking  a more crosscutting and integrated approach to focusing on results and  improving government performance. Moreover, DHS reported in its fiscal  years 2012-2016 strategic plan that while effective mechanisms exist for  interagency and intradepartmental operational and intelligence  coordination, the department must learn from the successes of the Joint  Interagency Task Force-South (JIATF-South) and other similar constructs  to further integrate and enhance domain awareness across its efforts to  secure the border and expedite lawful travel and trade.", "This report is a follow-on to our September 2012 report on DHS\u2019s efforts  to improve collaboration and integrate its field operations. It responds to  your request that we review the extent to which DHS and key operational  components are using collaborative field mechanisms\u2014that is,  multiagency groups such as task forces, committees, and teams that  enhance stakeholder collaboration across the participating agencies in  order to more effectively and efficiently achieve their missions. This  report (1) assesses the extent to which DHS has identified the  collaborative field mechanisms of its key operational components, and (2)  describes factors that participants of selected mechanisms identified that  enhance or are challenges to their collaboration, and assesses the extent  to which DHS has collected and disseminated successful collaborative  practices.", "To address the first objective, we contacted DHS officials to identify a list  of collaborative mechanisms that they deemed to be successful examples  of field component collaboration while we also independently identified  such mechanisms. Of the 13 mechanism types ultimately identified, 11  mechanisms focused on law enforcement activities. For these 13  mechanisms, we examined organizational documents related to  mechanism mission, objectives, stakeholder composition, locations, and  date organized, among other things. We also interviewed officials from  the DHS Office of Operations Coordination and Planning about the  establishment and operation of these 13 mechanism types. We analyzed  documentation (i.e., component daily activity reports) obtained from  senior DHS headquarters officials to identify the extent to which the  department has visibility over the collaborative field mechanism  activities\u2014including any plans to increase visibility over the mechanisms  in the future.", "To address the second objective, we selected 4 types of collaborative  field mechanisms from the list of 13, including the Regional Coordinating  Mechanism (ReCoM), the Border Enforcement Security Task Force  (BEST), the South Texas Campaign Joint Targeting Team (JTT), and the  Regional Interagency Steering Committee (RISC). We based our  selection of these 4 types of mechanisms on the following factors:  geographic location, continuity of the mechanism (established for at least  16 months), participation of multiple DHS component agencies, and  variation in the lead component agency. Except for JTT, we selected  mechanism types that existed in more than one location to allow for  geographic comparison\u2014such as BEST, with 35 locations throughout the  United States. Appendix I describes each of the selected mechanisms in  detail. Among these 4 different mechanism types, we then selected 10  individual mechanism sites\u20143 ReCoMs, 4 BESTs, 1 JTT, and 2 RISCs\u2014 for more in-depth review. For each of the selected mechanisms, we  interviewed senior headquarters officials to discuss their views on the  successes and challenges experienced with collaboration, including how  the successes are replicated and communicated across the mechanisms  and how challenges are addressed. At each of the 10 mechanisms we  visited, we gathered information from participants on what they believed  to be promising practices that helped them to succeed as collaborative  mechanisms, as well as the factors they viewed as challenges to their  collaboration. We also discussed their efforts to establish performance  measures to assess mechanism effectiveness. We reviewed planning,  operations, and management integration documents such as strategic  plans, annual performance reports, and memorandums of understanding  or agreements among the participating agencies. We compared these  documents and their responses with the information-sharing and  collaboration practices identified in our past work on this subject. We  interviewed responsible senior DHS headquarters officials to determine  the extent to which the department has collected and reported on the  collaborative practices identified by the mechanisms. We also interviewed  component officials at the selected mechanisms to identify the extent to  which information, such as information about performance, successes,  challenges, and collaborative practices used are provided to DHS  headquarters officials who have departmental-level oversight of these  mechanisms. Appendix II provides a listing and description of the  remaining 9 mechanisms not selected for a more in-depth review.

As we reported in September  2012, according to senior DHS officials, the fragmentation associated with  each operational component having different boundaries for its area of  responsibility prompted some in DHS and other stakeholders to promote  the idea of a single unified DHS field structure, sometimes referred to as  regionalization. Proponents believed that a more unified structure of  DHS regional offices could foster better collaboration and integration of  multiple components\u2019 operations, making DHS as a whole more  responsive and better prepared to counter man-made or natural threats.  In addition to improving operational effectiveness, proponents of a single  DHS field structure envisioned opportunities for long-term cost savings  through the sharing of assets, including office space.", "For example, in 2005 and 2006, DHS considered implementing an  overarching plan to unify its components under a single unified field  structure, but then opted not to pursue this vision because of component  resistance to the concept and significant up-front costs associated with  colocating components. Again, in 2010, DHS chose not to realign its  component regional configurations into a single DHS regional structure,  as recommended in its BUR. In 2012, DHS and component officials  stated that transforming the existing structure into a single unified DHS  system would be a huge undertaking, and those not in favor of large- scale regionalization cited numerous challenges, including budgetary  constraints, and other drawbacks to such a plan. As we reported in  September 2012, while DHS\u2019s intention of improving collaboration among  its agencies is a sound goal\u2014whether through regionalization or other  means\u2014its approach has lacked the systematic analyses and  documentation needed to support its proposals for change. The  department agreed with our findings and acknowledged that its efforts  could have been better documented.", "In lieu of a single unified field structure, DHS has proposed other  alternatives for enhancing collaboration among its components in the  field, but has not implemented these proposals. For example, the  department reported plans to harmonize operations and intelligence\u2014 utilizing concepts and structures modeled after JIATF-South. In 2012,  DHS identified a new approach for enhancing regional collaboration  among its components through virtual integration\u2014that is, by improving  component agencies\u2019 coordination of mission activities and  communication through the use of technology. According to a senior DHS  official, virtual integration would allow for coordination of component  functions without actually consolidating or merging the functions. DHS\u2019s  intention toward virtual integration was communicated in its fiscal years  2012-2016 strategic plan and reported to us in September 2012.  However, in 2013, DHS officials stated that the department was not  specifically pursuing virtual approaches to regional coordination. DHS  officials also reported that although DHS no longer planned to pursue  virtual collaboration on a larger scale, it was occurring on a more limited  scale, within the department and components, for certain efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Component Efforts to Integrate Field Operations through Collaborative Mechanisms", "paragraphs": ["In the absence of a unified field structure, DHS\u2019s operational components  have established and utilized collaborative mechanisms, including virtual  approaches, to better integrate their field operations.

These  mechanisms have both similarities and differences in how they are  structured, which missions or threats they focus on, and which agencies  participate in them, among other things. All of the mechanisms identified  in this report involve multiple DHS components, as well as other federal,  state, and local agency participants, and their purpose is to improve  operational integration, coordination, and efficiency among DHS  components. These mechanisms focus on a range of missions and are  located throughout the United States.

The Maritime Operations  Coordination Plan directs these agencies to utilize the fusion of  intelligence, planning, and operations to target the threat of  transnational terrorist and criminal acts along the coastal border.

As a result of its limited visibility over these  mechanisms, DHS headquarters is not well positioned to routinely identify  valuable information obtained from the mechanisms that could inform  decisions about DHS field structures or further enhance collaboration  across components.", "According to senior DHS Office of Operations Coordination and Planning  (OPS) officials, DHS headquarters does not actively catalog or routinely  monitor the universe of collaborative field mechanisms because they are  organized and monitored by their respective lead operational components  or participants. However, although the collaborative mechanisms may be  monitored by individual components, the components do not have the  same high-level perspective\u2014or accountability\u2014as the department as a  whole, to look across all components and assess the state of  collaboration occurring in the field. Moreover, according to senior OPS  officials, their departmental-level office is focused on the specific  outcomes of operational activities and not whether the activities are  carried out by a certain collaborative mechanism, as the collaborative  mechanisms employed to accomplish tasks are not as important as the  end results. Therefore, these DHS headquarters officials believe they  have visibility\u2014primarily through the components\u2014over activities carried  out by collaborative mechanisms, but stated that they have little or no  visibility over the nature of the collaboration itself, since they do not  collect this type of information. OPS officials also noted that the Program  Analysis & Evaluation Division (PA&E), within the Office of the Chief  Financial Officer, which is involved with performance measurement,  monitors whether the operational components are meeting their  performance requirements or goals, but does not track performance or  other information on cross-component field mechanisms. PA&E officials  stated that their division is responsible for strategic-level management  and oversight, not operational-level, and per various laws and policy  frameworks, their division measures performance of higher-level DHS  programs.", "DHS\u2019s limited visibility at the departmental level of the number and type of  existing collaborative field mechanisms was demonstrated in part by the  challenges DHS headquarters experienced in providing us with a list of  mechanisms. Specifically, when we asked for a list of formalized  mechanisms that DHS headquarters considered to be successful  examples of field collaboration, this information was not readily available  at the departmental level, according to senior DHS officials. After  consulting with operational component officials, DHS headquarters  provided 6 of the 13 examples that constituted our final list of  mechanisms. We acknowledge that identifying a universe of successful  collaborative field mechanisms can be difficult, in part because of the  relatively large size of DHS and the breadth of activities involving  component agencies. However, systematically collecting information  (e.g., related to operational mission, capabilities, performance, etc.) about  the mechanisms from the component agencies that sponsor them would  yield important information about which mechanisms are effective.", "Senior DHS headquarters officials stated that although they have limited  visibility over the universe of collaborative mechanisms and the specific  collaborative practices utilized by the groups, the department does obtain  regular knowledge of component operational activities and results. For  example, senior OPS officials said that they receive situation reports  about daily operational actions broken out by lead component, regardless  of whether the operation is affiliated with a particular collaborative  mechanism. They also noted their DHS Common Operational Picture  (COP), which provides an unclassified consolidated information hub for  homeland security partners to ensure critical terrorism- and disaster- related information is available. However, senior DHS officials agreed  that having increased visibility and additional mechanism information at  the headquarters level could benefit departmental and component efforts  to improve collaboration in the field and better integrate operations. For  example, obtaining and analyzing this information, which DHS has lacked  in recent deliberations about revamping its field structure, could provide  DHS with a stronger basis for decision making regarding the  establishment of new mechanisms, the effective allocation of scarce  resources, or other changes to its field structure. Having some access to  this information gains importance because the potential increase in  mission effectiveness and efficiencies that may have been realized from  earlier regionalization plans that were not adopted could be accomplished  through other means\u2014including through collaborative field mechanisms.", "DHS\u2019s limited ability to monitor the collaborative mechanisms operating  under the DHS umbrella is inconsistent with its own departmental-level  strategic goals. Specifically, several key DHS initiatives and documents,  including the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review (QHSR), BUR, and  the DHS fiscal years 2012-2016 strategic plan, contain strategic goals  aimed at greater unification and integration of efforts across individual  DHS components. In particular, DHS\u2019s strategic plan specifically  outlines objectives related to the goals of \u201cimproving cross-departmental  management, policy, and functional integration,\u201d as well as \u201cenhancing  intelligence, information sharing, and integrated operations.\u201d DHS\u2019s  limited departmental visibility over these mechanisms is also inconsistent  with elements of the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, which calls for the establishment of control activities, such  as a mechanism to identify and monitor the activities of components  within an organization, to help ensure achievement of the organization\u2019s  objectives. The internal control objective pertaining to effectiveness and  efficiency of operations is of particular relevance to DHS\u2019s oversight of the  collaborative mechanisms and relates more to the assessment of the  efficiency of the mechanisms themselves in addition to the operational- level visibility that we discuss above. Collecting information on the  existing collaborative mechanisms will enable the department to better  monitor these mechanisms. Doing so could also better position DHS to  judge at a more strategic level which mechanisms offer potential for  replication in other geographic or mission areas. Given current budget  constraints, it is important for DHS to identify and promote the most  effective and efficient collaborative field mechanisms as possible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Participants Identified Practices That Enhanced or Served as Challenges to Collaboration; DHS Could Benefit from Collecting and Disseminating Promising Practices", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Participants Identified Common Practices That Enhanced Collaboration, Which DHS Could Benefit from Collecting and Disseminating on a Broader Scale", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Common Practices That Enhanced Collaboration", "paragraphs": ["During the course of our review, participants from the four selected DHS  collaborative mechanism types provided information on successful  practices that enhanced their collaboration that could be useful for DHS to  collect and disseminate on a broader scale. At each of our 10 site visits,  we asked cognizant participants to identify and provide examples of  collaborative practices or other factors that they considered particularly  important to the success of their group\u2019s collaboration and operations. We  evaluated their responses and summarized them into seven broad  categories, as shown in figure 3, based upon the practices that were  reported most frequently. This summary information provides valuable  insights on approaches for enhancing collaboration among the DHS  component agencies\u2014information that could also be beneficial for DHS  to collect from a larger group of component mechanisms.", "Among participants that we interviewed, there was consensus that certain  practices facilitated more effective collaboration, which, according to  participants, contributed to the groups\u2019 overall successes. In many cases,  the same or similar successful collaborative practices were reported by  participants of different mechanism types as well as by participants of the  same mechanism type in different geographic regions. For example,  despite having a different mission focus or operating in different  geographic regions, participants we interviewed from all three ReCoMs,  all four BESTs, the JTT, and both RISCs\u2014the total sample population  that we met with with\u2014identified three of the seven categories of  practices as keys to success: (1) positive working  relationships/communication, (2) sharing resources, and (3) sharing  information.", "Furthermore, participants from most mechanisms also drew connections  among the successful collaborative factors. For example, participants  from all 10 mechanisms stated that forming positive working relationships  was tied to better information sharing among them. Specifically, in our  interviews, BEST mechanism officials stated that developing trust and  building relationships helps participants respond quickly to a crisis, and  communicating frequently helps participants eliminate duplication of  efforts. Participants from the ReCoMs, BESTs, and JTT also reported that  having positive working relationships built on strong trust among  participants was a key factor in their law enforcement partnerships  because of the sensitive nature of law enforcement information, and the  risks posed if it is not protected appropriately. In turn, building positive  working relationships was facilitated by another collaborative factor  identified as important by 6 of the 10 mechanisms: physical colocation of  participants. Specifically, participants from the mechanisms focused on  law enforcement investigations, such as the BESTs and JTT, reported  that being physically colocated with members from other agencies was  important for increasing the groups\u2019 effectiveness. Participants from one  of the three ReCoMs we visited also stated that colocation enables  operations planning and database/information sharing. It also helps build  trust and overcome cultural barriers among agency participants.", "Successful collaboration practices can help the participating components  mitigate a variety of challenges, and they are generally consistent with the  seven key issues to consider when implementing collaborative  mechanisms that we identified in our 2012 report on interagency  collaboration. DHS leadership could benefit from engaging the  mechanisms\u2014soliciting promising collaboration practices information and  organizing it through the lens of our seven key collaborative issues. As  noted earlier in this report, DHS does not collect this type of information at  the departmental level primarily because the mechanisms operate under  the components. However, collecting promising practices information  from the collaborative mechanisms at the departmental level and  disseminating it to components throughout DHS would inform  components about specific practices from which they could also benefit.  Senior DHS officials agreed with this assessment. In addition, it may be  more efficient for a single DHS departmental-level office to collect and  disseminate this type of information than all the components individually,  especially given DHS\u2019s higher-level, strategic perspective across the  department. Also, given that our fieldwork indicated similar collaboration  issues are relevant to multiple components, a more centralized DHS  clearinghouse of collaborative promising practices information could be  more easily accessed by a wide range of DHS component stakeholders  than under the current structure, where such information is now  stovepiped and may not be readily shared outside of individual  components or mechanisms.", "Key features of interagency collaboration include agencies establishing or  clarifying guidelines, agreements, or procedures for sharing information.  Among other things, these guidelines, agreements, and procedures  should identify and disseminate practices to facilitate more effective  communication and collaboration among federal, state, and local  agencies. The benefit of sharing promising practices includes the ability  to replicate positive program outcomes by leveraging the experiences of  different stakeholders with the same or similar goals. Key features of  interagency collaboration also identify the sharing of promising practices  as an example of government agencies building capacity for improved  efficiency. Accordingly, DHS component agencies could benefit from  better access to collaborative promising practices, as this would help  them in their own efforts to leverage the experiences of many  collaborative mechanisms."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Officials Identified Common Barriers to Successful Collaboration", "paragraphs": ["Participants from the 10 collaborative field mechanisms we visited also  identified challenges or barriers that affected their collaboration across  components and made it more difficult. Using the same approach as that  for eliciting successful collaborative practices, at each of the 10 locations  we visited, we asked cognizant participants to identify challenges to  collaboration that they believed had impeded their groups\u2019 operations or  effectiveness. We evaluated their responses and created three broad  categories, as shown in figure 4, based on the challenges that they  reported most frequently.", "Our discussions with participants representing the 10 mechanisms  identified three barriers that participants most frequently believed  hindered effective collaboration within their mechanisms: (1) resource  constraints, (2) rotation of key personnel, and (3) lack of leadership buy- in. For example, when discussing resource issues, participants from 9 of  the 10 collaborative mechanisms said that funding for their group\u2019s  operation was critical and identified resource constraints as a challenge to  sustaining their collaborative efforts. These participants also reported that  since none of the mechanisms receive dedicated funding, the  participating federal agencies provide support for their respective  representatives assigned to the selected mechanisms. This support  included such things as funding for employee salaries, office space, and  law enforcement equipment (e.g., night vision capability and surveillance  vehicles), among other things. A lack of resources also affected state and  local law enforcement participation in some of these collaborative  mechanisms, and mechanism participants explained that ensuring state  and local participation has been challenging because of resource  constraints, which, in some cases, have led to a mechanism missing key  participants. For example, participating agencies fund ReCoM positions  out of their respective operating budgets\u2014no dedicated ReCoM funding  has been provided. As a result, some agencies are not able to participate  (such as state and local law enforcement) because of resource  constraints. Also, there was a majority opinion among mechanism  participants we visited that rotation of key personnel and lack of  leadership buy-in hindered effective collaboration within their  mechanisms. For example, JTT participants stated that the rotation of key  personnel hinders the JTT\u2019s ability to develop and retain more seasoned  personnel with expertise in investigations and surveillance techniques. In  addition to collecting promising practices information from the  collaborative mechanisms and disseminating it to components throughout  DHS, collecting and disseminating information on any ways to address  identified challenges or barriers to collaboration would similarly help  leverage the experiences of other collaborative mechanisms.", "Collaborative field mechanism participants could also benefit from DHS  sharing information related to performance measurement. While sharing  such information is not a challenge to collaboration itself, officials from all  mechanisms agreed that establishing metrics that could measure the  impact of their collaboration, including whether the benefits of the  collaborative mechanisms outweigh the costs, were difficult to establish or  did not yet exist. Nonetheless, officials reported that the ReCoMs, BESTs,  and JTT have all undertaken efforts to develop output or outcome  performance measures to track the accomplishments of their  collaborative mechanisms. For example, the fiscal years 2012-2016  BEST Strategic Plan states that BESTs are to be evaluated annually on  their overall performance, which is quantified by output enforcement  metrics (e.g., number of arrests, indictments, convictions, and seizures).  The JTT\u2019s efforts to develop performance measures include identifying  emerging threats, risks, and vulnerabilities in the South Texas corridor  where it operates. Developing output and outcome measures can provide  insight into the performance of each mechanism; however, ReCoM,  BEST, JTT, and RISC officials all stated that is very difficult to develop a  metric that isolates the benefits of their collaboration from the benefits  that they may have achieved operating separately under their respective  agencies. Despite these measurement challenges, ReCoM, BEST, JTT,  and RISC officials were able to provide anecdotal examples of the  positive benefits of their collaboration and coordination. For example,  ReCoM officials in one location told us that they were able to make  significant progress toward meeting their goal of \u201cpersistent presence\u201d  along a coastal ship channel because they had coordinated the  schedules of the USCG and CBP Office of Air and Marine resources that  conducted these patrols. BEST and JTT officials stressed the value of  leveraging their participating agencies\u2019 legal authorities to develop more  robust cases, which increased the likelihood that their cases would be  successfully prosecuted, and that convicted criminals would receive  longer sentences. RISC participants in both locations cited their  collaborative mechanisms as important to identifying emergency  response capability gaps across different levels of government and  integrating courses of action to take in response to disasters. Leveraging  mechanism participants\u2019 experiences and insights regarding the  development of performance metrics to quantify their accomplishments  and the impacts of their collaboration, and disseminating promising  practices that they have identified could provide benefits to other DHS  collaborative efforts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Effective collaboration within and among federal agencies is important for  improving operational success, especially in a resource-constrained  environment. DHS component agencies have made progress in  developing and evolving collaborative field mechanisms that have allowed  them to better coordinate mission activities in the field, and these  collaborative efforts are even more important in light of DHS\u2019s decision in  2012 to not pursue a single unified field structure to integrate component  field operations. Given the overlapping geographic areas of responsibility  and authorities, and the many operational activities that DHS components  are conducting, component efforts to collaborate are important. However,  DHS\u2019s limited visibility over the universe of collaborative field mechanisms  operating under its purview reduces its ability to maximize the  effectiveness and efficiency of these mechanisms to enhance cross- departmental management and integrated operations. DHS senior  officials believe the components, not the department, are responsible for  the mechanisms\u2019 oversight because the department is more focused on  strategic rather than operational-level management activities. We agree  that the components are capable of operating and monitoring their  collaborative field mechanisms. However, consistent with its own  departmental-level strategic goals, we believe that DHS could benefit  from greater awareness of the mechanisms themselves and the  collaborative practices that they employ. Not only is the department  ultimately accountable for the resources that support these mechanisms,  it is also responsible for making important decisions about the overall field  structure of its components, and for moving the department closer to its  goal of greater component integration.

Our past work on interagency collaboration has  highlighted the importance of agencies establishing or clarifying  guidelines, agreements, or procedures for sharing information. These  guidelines, agreements, and procedures should identify and disseminate  practices to facilitate more effective communication and collaboration  among federal, state, and local agencies. In addition, our prior work has  demonstrated the benefits of sharing promising practices as a means to  replicate positive program outcomes by leveraging the experiences of  different stakeholders with the same or similar goals.
