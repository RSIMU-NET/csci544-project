In general, DOD has taken some steps to meet the intent of each of the safeguards, and it has implemented some of the recommendations from GAO's September 2008 report. However, opportunities exist for DOD to improve implementation of some safeguards. For example, DOD has not yet evaluated the effectiveness of the training employees receive, although doing so could help DOD measure the impact of its training and its progress toward achieving agency goals. In addition, DOD has not specified in its guidance what process the components should follow to investigate and eliminate potential barriers to fair and equitable ratings. Consequently, the components may not follow a consistent approach when investigating potential barriers, which could hinder their efforts to eliminate them. Further, GAO previously noted that continued monitoring of the safeguards was needed to ensure that DOD's actions were effective. While DOD monitors some aspects of the system's implementation, it does not monitor how or the extent to which the safeguards specifically are implemented across the department. As a result, decision makers lack information that could be used to determine whether the department's actions are effective and whether the system is being implemented in a fair, equitable, and credible manner. DOD civilian personnel have mixed perceptions about NSPS, and while the department has taken some steps toward addressing employee concerns, it has not yet developed and implemented an action plan to address areas where employees express negative perceptions of the system, as GAO recommended in 2008. DOD's survey data from 2008 revealed that overall, NSPS employees responded positively about some aspects of performance management, such as connecting pay to performance, and negatively about others, such as the performance appraisal process. According to the most recent survey data, the negative perceptions of employees who worked under NSPS the longest remain largely unchanged from what was reported by GAO in 2008. Further, as GAO reported in 2008, employees and supervisors continue to express negative perceptions in discussion groups about NSPS--for example, voicing concerns about the negative impact of NSPS on employees' motivation and morale, and about the excessive amount of time spent navigating the performance management process. Such negative perceptions are not surprising given that large-scale organizational transformations often require an adjustment period to gain employees' trust and acceptance. DOD has taken some steps to address employees' perceptions of NSPS--for example, by issuing a memorandum with suggested actions the components could take to address employee concerns. However, DOD has not yet developed and implemented an action plan that fully meets the intent of GAO's 2008 recommendation. Specifically, DOD has not yet specified such things as its intended actions, who will be responsible, and the time frames for these actions. GAO continues to believe that implementing such a plan has merit."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2004, the Department of Defense (DOD) began implementing the  National Security Personnel System (NSPS)\u2014a human capital system for  DOD civilian employees. NSPS significantly redesigned the rules,  regulations, and processes that govern the way in which civilian  employees are hired, compensated, and promoted within the department.  DOD began converting employees to NSPS in 2006 and, according to the  department, by early 2009 had converted more than 200,000 employees to  the system. However, a series of events transpired in 2009 leaving the  system\u2019s future uncertain. Specifically, in February 2009, the Chairman of  the House Committee on Armed Services and the Chairman of the  committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Readiness urged DOD to halt conversions  to NSPS, highlighting concerns over a lack of transparency and  widespread discontent with the system. Subsequently, in March 2009, DOD  and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) announced that they  would suspend any further conversions of organizations to NSPS pending  the outcome of a review of the system led by the Defense Business Board.  In July 2009, the Defense Business Board presented the Secretary of  Defense with the report of its review of NSPS, which included  recommendations to initiate a reconstruction of the system and to  continue the moratorium on conversions to NSPS until reconstruction is  complete. Most recently, in October 2009, the proposed National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, which passed both Houses of  Congress, contains provisions that would terminate NSPS and convert  DOD civilian employees currently under the system to previously existing  civilian personnel systems no later than January 1, 2012.", "Before the enactment of the legislation that authorized NSPS, we raised a  number of critical issues about the proposed regulations for NSPS in a  series of testimonies in 2003. Since then, we have provided congressional  decision makers with insight into DOD\u2019s processes to design and  implement NSPS and the most significant challenges the department faces  in implementing the system. While GAO supports human capital reform in  the federal government, a key challenge is ensuring sustained and  committed leadership for such a major transformation effort. Further,  moving too quickly or prematurely to implement such systems, whether at  DOD or elsewhere, can significantly raise the risk of problems  implementing them. We have also reported that DOD and other federal  agencies must ensure that their performance management systems contain  appropriate accountability mechanisms and internal safeguards to ensure  that the systems are fair, effective, and credible.", "To help inform congressional deliberations on the implementation of  NSPS, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008  mandated that GAO conduct reviews of NSPS in calendar years 2008, 2009,  and 2010 to determine the extent to which DOD has effectively  incorporated certain accountability mechanisms and internal safeguards  into the system and to assess employee attitudes toward the system. In  September 2008, we issued our first review of NSPS, and in April 2009 we  testified on that assessment before the House Committee on Armed  Services\u2019 Subcommittee on Readiness. We used the following safeguards  to assess NSPS:  Involve employees, their representatives, and other stakeholders in the  design of the system, to include employees directly involved in  validating any related implementation of the system.", "Assure that the agency\u2019s performance management system links  employee objectives to the agency\u2019s strategic plan, related goals, and  desired outcomes.", "Implement a pay-for-performance evaluation system to better link  individual pay to performance, and provide an equitable method for  appraising and compensating employees.", "Provide adequate training and retraining for supervisors, managers,  and employees in the implementation and operation of the  performance management system.", "Institute a process for ensuring ongoing performance feedback and  dialogue between supervisors, managers, and employees throughout  the appraisal period, and setting timetables for review.", "Assure that certain predecisional internal safeguards exist to help  achieve consistency, equity, nondiscrimination, and nonpoliticization  of the performance management process (e.g., independent  reasonableness reviews by a third party or reviews of performance  rating decisions, pay determinations, and promotions before they are  finalized to ensure that they are merit-based, as well as pay panels who  consider the results of the performance appraisal process and other  information in connection with final pay decisions).", "Assure that there are reasonable transparency and appropriate  accountability mechanisms in connection with the results of the  performance management process, including periodic reports on  internal assessments and employee survey results relating to  performance management and individual pay decisions while  protecting individual confidentiality.", "Assure that the agency\u2019s performance management system results in  meaningful distinctions in individual employee performance.", "Provide a means for ensuring that adequate agency resources are  allocated for the design, implementation, and administration of the  performance management system.", "We initially developed a list of safeguards based on our extensive body of  work looking at the performance management practices used by leading  public sector organizations both in the United States and in other  countries. These safeguards were then merged with the list of safeguards  specified in section 9902(b)(7) of Title 5, U.S. Code, to develop the  aforementioned safeguards. It is important to keep in mind that the list of  safeguards we are using to assess DOD\u2019s efforts is not intended to cover  all attributes of a modern, results-oriented performance management  system; therefore, other safeguards may exist. Rather, as we previously  reported, the items on the list cover possible safeguards that help ensure  those systems are fair, effective, and credible.", "In responding to the congressional mandate for the 2008 review of NSPS,  we reported, in September 2008, that while DOD has taken some steps to  ensure that NSPS is fair, effective, and credible, implementation of certain  safeguards could be improved. We further reported that although DOD  civilian employees under NSPS responded positively regarding some  aspects of performance management, the department does not have an  action plan to address employees\u2019 negative perceptions of NSPS. To  address our findings, we recommended that DOD improve the  implementation of certain safeguards and develop and implement an  action plan to address employees\u2019 concerns about NSPS. DOD generally  concurred with our recommendations, with the exception of one\u2014 requiring a predecisional analysis of its rating results. We discuss the steps  DOD has taken to address our previous recommendations later in this  report.", "To address the congressional mandate for the 2009 review of NSPS, we  established the following objectives: (1) To what extent has DOD  implemented safeguards to ensure the fairness, effectiveness, and  credibility of the NSPS performance management system and monitored  the implementation of the safeguards? (2) How do DOD civilian personnel  perceive NSPS, and what actions has DOD taken to address these  perceptions?", "For our first objective, we reviewed the safeguards specified in section  9902(b)(7) of Title 5, U.S. Code, for the NSPS performance management  system, as well as other safeguards we have previously identified as key  for performance management systems. We also obtained and analyzed  regulations, guidance, and other documentation provided by officials in  DOD and the NSPS program offices of the four components\u2014the Army,  the Air Force, the Navy, and the Fourth Estate\u2014and interviewed  knowledgeable officials in all of these offices to obtain a comprehensive  understanding of their efforts to implement the NSPS performance  management system and the safeguards as well as the processes,  procedures, and controls used for monitoring and overseeing  implementation of the system. In addition, we visited eight DOD  organizations\u2014two for each component\u2014located outside the continental  United States to assess the extent to which the department has  implemented safeguards for NSPS. Because our 2008 review focused on  assessing implementation of NSPS and the safeguards at locations that  were geographically distributed throughout the United States, we focused  our efforts for this review on visiting locations outside the continental  United States. During our site visits we reviewed documents, such as pay  pool business rules, and met with the performance review authority, pay  pool managers, pay pool panel members, rating officials, the NSPS  program manager or transition team, and DOD civilian employees under  NSPS to obtain their perspectives on the extent to which the safeguards  had been implemented. The organizations we visited were selected based  on a number of factors, such as the presence of a large number or  concentrated group of civilian employees under NSPS. For our second  objective, we obtained and analyzed the results of DOD\u2019s May 2006,  November 2006, May 2007, and February 2008 Status of Forces Survey of  Civilian Employees, which gauge employee attitudes toward NSPS, among  other things. We used these data to identify indications of movement or  trends in employee perceptions. As we reported in our first assessment of  NSPS, we reviewed the results of prior administrations of DOD\u2019s Status of  Forces Survey of Civilian Employees and found the results to be  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our report. For our current  assessment, we found no substantial changes in the methodology for the  2008 Status of Forces Survey of Civilian Employees. In addition, we  obtained the perspectives of DOD civilian personnel at the eight locations  we visited by conducting small group discussions with nonsupervisory and  supervisory employees under NSPS and administering a short  questionnaire. Because the locations we visited are not representative of  all DOD locations, the results from our discussions and the comments  provided are not generalizable to the entire NSPS civilian population.  However, the composition of our discussion groups was designed to  ensure that we spoke with employees from each of the four DOD  components at locations outside the continental United States. Further  details about our scope and methodology can be found in appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2008 through  September 2009 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Under this system,  federal employees are paid according to governmentwide rules and  procedures, and federal positions are classified according to the difficulty  and responsibility of the work performed. The GS system was created in  1949, when most federal positions involved clerical work or revolved  around the execution of established, stable processes\u2014for example,  posting census figures in ledgers or retrieving taxpayer records from vast  file rooms. Over time, however, federal positions have become  increasingly specialized and more highly skilled. In light of this change, a  number of federal agencies have attempted to provide managers with  greater flexibility in hiring and awarding pay raises to employees by  implementing human capital initiatives, such as performance management  systems, that reward employees\u2019 performance and contribution to the  agency\u2019s mission. The need for human capital reform regarding these  systems has been the subject of a number of previous GAO reviews.  These reviews have noted, for example, that federal agencies must have  modern, effective, credible, and validated performance management  systems that are capable of supporting pay and other personnel decisions,  and that pay for performance works only with adequate safeguards and  appropriate accountability mechanisms in place to ensure that the  safeguards are implemented in a fair, effective, and credible manner.", "In November 2003, the Congress included a provision in the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 providing DOD with the  authority to establish a pay-for-performance management system as part  of NSPS. In April 2004, the Secretary of Defense appointed an NSPS  Senior Executive to, among other things, design, develop, and implement  NSPS. Under the Senior Executive\u2019s authority, the PEO was established as  the central policy and program office for NSPS. The PEO\u2019s responsibilities  include designing the human resource/pay-for-performance systems,  developing communication and training strategies, modifying personnel  information technology, and preparing joint enabling regulations and  internal DOD implementing regulations, called implementing issuances. As  the central DOD-wide program office, the PEO also directs and oversees  the four components\u2019 NSPS program managers, who report to their parent  components and the PEO. These program managers serve as their  components\u2019 NSPS action officers and also participate in the development,  planning, implementation, and deployment of NSPS.", "Beginning in April 2006, DOD began phasing (or spiraling) civilian  employees into NSPS; however, in January 2008 the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 prohibited the Secretary of Defense  from converting more than 100,000 employees to NSPS in any calendar  year and excluded Federal Wage System employees from coverage under  NSPS. Further, in March 2009, DOD announced that it would delay the  conversion of additional organizations to NSPS pending the outcome of a  joint review of the system by DOD and OPM. According to DOD, this  decision affected roughly 2,000 employees in organizations scheduled to  convert to NSPS during the spring of 2009. As a result of these and other  legislative changes that resulted in revisions to the NSPS regulations, the  PEO has not developed new timelines for phasing any additional civilian  employees into NSPS. As table 1 shows, according to DOD, almost 220,000  civilian employees have been phased into NSPS as of September 2009.", "The NSPS performance management process is ongoing and consists of  several phases that are repeated during each annual performance cycle.  The process begins with a planning phase that involves supervisors (or  rating officials) and employees working together to establish performance  plans. This includes developing job objectives\u2014the critical work  employees perform that is aligned with their organizational goals and  focused on results\u2014and identifying contributing factors\u2014the attributes  and behaviors that identify how the critical work established in the job  objectives is going to be accomplished (e.g., cooperation and teamwork).  After the planning phase comes the monitoring and developing phase,  during which ongoing communication between supervisors and employees  occurs to ensure that work is accomplished; attention is given to areas  that need to be addressed; and managers, supervisors, and employees have  a continued and shared understanding of expectations and results. In the  rating phase, the supervisor prepares a written assessment that captures  the employee\u2019s accomplishments during the appraisal period. In the  final\u2014or reward\u2014phase, employees should be appropriately rewarded or  compensated for their performance with performance payouts. During this  phase, employee assessments are reviewed by multiple parties to  determine employees\u2019 ratings and, ultimately, performance payouts.", "The performance management process under NSPS is organized by pay  pools. A pay pool is a group of employees who share in the distribution of  a common pay-for-performance fund. The key participants that make up  pay pools are the employee, supervisor, higher-level reviewer, pay pool  panel, pay pool manager, performance review authority, and, in some  instances, the sub-pay pool, as shown in figure 1.", "Within a pay pool, each participant has defined responsibilities under the  performance management process:    Employees are encouraged to be involved throughout the performance  management cycle. This includes initially working with their  supervisors to develop job objectives and identify associated  contributing factors; identifying and recording accomplishments and  results throughout the appraisal period; and participating in interim  reviews and end-of-year assessments, for example, by preparing a self- assessment of their performance during the annual appraisal period.", "Supervisors (or rating officials) are responsible for effectively  managing the performance of their employees. This includes clearly  communicating performance expectations; aligning performance  expectations and employee development with organization mission  and goals; working with employees to develop written job objectives  that reflect expected accomplishments and contributions for the  appraisal period and identifying applicable contributing factors;  providing employees meaningful, constructive, and candid feedback  relative to performance expectations, including at least one  documented interim review; making meaningful distinctions among  employees based on performance and contribution; and providing  recommended ratings of record, share assignments, and payout  distributions to the pay pool.", "The higher-level reviewer, typically the rating official\u2019s supervisor, is  responsible for reviewing and approving job objectives and  recommended employee assessments.

These meetings allowed the department to  gather requirements for the next version of the NSPS automated tools  based on lessons learned and user input. Subsequently, DOD  established six separate working groups to develop and evaluate the  requirements for each of its automated tools. In addition, DOD  initiated separate efforts to enhance the usability of the Performance  Appraisal Application\u2014the DOD-wide tool for employee self- assessments and appraisals. Specifically, the contractor that developed  the Performance Appraisal Application enlisted the assistance of  software usability experts to evaluate the tool and recommend  changes that would enhance users\u2019 experience with it. As a part of this  effort, the contractor observed and worked with employees and rating  officials to identify changes that could be made to the Performance  Appraisal Application to make it more user-friendly.

For example, officials at each of the eight  locations reported that organizations identified lessons learned that were  generally based upon employee feedback gathered following the mock pay  pool. According to these officials, lessons learned were used to make  changes to, among other things, training materials, business rules, and the  use of job objectives and contributing factors. For example, two locations  limited the number of contributing factors employees should use in their  performance plans based upon lessons learned, while one location  responded to employee feedback regarding a lack of time to devote to  NSPS by mandating that employees be allowed to take time to complete  NSPS training.", "While DOD has taken a number of steps to involve employees in the design  and implementation of NSPS thus far, as stated above, we note that one  way the department could continue to involve employees as  implementation of the system proceeds is to develop and implement an  action plan to address employees\u2019 perceptions of NSPS, as we  recommended in our first assessment of NSPS.

In May 2009, DOD published its evaluation of NSPS for 2008,  entitled National Security Personnel System (NSPS) \u2013 2008 Evaluation  Report, which included an evaluation of employee performance plans to  determine the extent to which employee job objectives are aligned with  higher-level organizational goals and thus ensure that employee  performance contributes to the achievement of organizational success.  The evaluation included 240 employee performance plans encompassing a  range of job series, pay schedules, pay bands, and organizations within  each of the four components.

In our September 2008 report, we noted that DOD  encouraged employees who were transitioning to NSPS to receive training  that covered skills and behaviors necessary to implement and sustain  NSPS; foster support and confidence in the system; and facilitate the  transition to a performance-based, results-oriented culture. DOD and each  of the components continue to take such steps to provide employees with  required and other training on the system, including introductory training  for employees converting to NSPS and sustainment training for employees  already under the system. While the components are responsible for  providing employees with training on the NSPS performance management  system, the PEO supports their efforts by offering a variety of  departmentwide training courses and other materials. For example, Web- based training modules that the PEO has developed, such as its NSPS 101  and iSuccess courses (see fig. 2 for sample screen shots), provide  employees with basic knowledge about NSPS and performance  management principles in general, and are used by employees to develop  their job objectives. As another example, the PEO developed training  guides to educate employees on changes to the NSPS classroom materials  resulting from the revised NSPS regulations and implementing issuances.  The PEO also developed a Web site for accessing NSPS learning materials,  resources, and other tools. In addition, we found that the Air Force has  begun incorporating training on NSPS as a normal part of its operations  and is working to embed NSPS topics in the regular training provided to  Air Force civilians and servicemembers.", "Although DOD and the components continue to take steps to provide  employees with training on NSPS, the department has not yet evaluated  the effectiveness of the training provided. We previously reported that it is  increasingly important for agencies to measure the real impact of training  and thus evaluate their training\u2014for example, by establishing clear goals  about what the training is expected to achieve along with agreed-upon  measures or performance indicators to ascertain progress toward  achieving those goals. DOD has outlined the fundamental requirements,  or goals, of the training that it provides to employees on NSPS.  Specifically, DOD has noted that for NSPS, a training program must be  implemented that enables employees to understand better how to succeed,  and enables supervisors to communicate performance expectations to  their employees, provide feedback to them on their performance against  these expectations, and tell them what steps they can take to improve  their performance and competencies and manage their careers. However,  while DOD has undertaken efforts to understand employees\u2019 perceptions  of its training, the department has not yet evaluated the effectiveness of  the training that it provides. For example, in early 2009 the PEO conducted  what PEO officials describe as an ad hoc study of training needs. The  PEO\u2019s study consisted of conducting sensing sessions with 120 human  resource practitioners at 11 locations across the department. According  to the PEO, the purpose of these sessions included obtaining feedback on  existing NSPS learning products and support and exploring options for  next generation products. While the PEO\u2019s study identified some needed  improvements, it does not constitute an evaluation of the department\u2019s  training\u2014for example, because it did not assess the department\u2019s progress  toward achieving the goals specified for the training.", "As another example, DOD\u2019s 2008 evaluation report also highlighted  deficiencies with the department\u2019s training on NSPS. Specifically, the  report notes that without effective communication and training, NSPS  cannot achieve its goal of being a credible and trusted system. Further,  three of the report\u2019s six key recommendations focus on the need to  enhance the effectiveness of the training provided to employees on NSPS:  (1) provide more training on the performance management system; (2)  provide high-level training for employees and supervisors that explains the  pay pool process; and (3) hold mock pay pool panels, which serve as  refreshers for continuing panel members and as training for new members.  However, like the PEO\u2019s study, DOD\u2019s 2008 evaluation report does not  constitute an evaluation of the department\u2019s training\u2014for example,  because it did not include an in-depth assessment of DOD\u2019s training and  also did not assess the department\u2019s progress toward achieving the goals  for the training, per agreed-upon measures or performance indicators. Of  the components, we found that only the Army has taken some steps to  evaluate the training it provides to employees on the system.

For example, we found that following the 2007  performance management cycle, the PEO analyzed the rating results for  more than 100,000 employees by select demographic groups, such as race,  gender, ethnicity, age, veteran status, and targeted disability, but limited  its analysis to the aggregate data from its pay pools.

Further, in  May 2009, the PEO issued guidance, entitled Guidance for Conducting  Annual Analysis of NSPS Performance Ratings and Payouts, in order to  provide the components with a framework and suggested approaches for  conducting their annual analysis and to serve as a starting point for  identifying and examining barriers. For example, the guidance notes that  the NSPS performance management system\u2019s rating and payout process  has four main outcomes\u2014the rating of record, number of shares awarded,  payout, and the distribution of the payout\u2014and that each outcome should  be reviewed. The guidance also notes that analysis is best done at the level  where decisions are made\u2014in the case of NSPS ratings and payouts, the  pay pool level.

The Equal Employment  Opportunity Commission\u2019s Instructions to Federal Agencies for EEO  Management Directive 715 provides guidance that agencies can use in  identifying and addressing potential barriers. The instructions state that  \u201cbarrier identification and elimination is the process by which agencies  uncover, examine, and remove barriers to equal participation at all levels  of the workforce.\u201d Management Directive 715 further states that \u201cwhere it  is determined that an identified barrier serves no legitimate purpose with  respect to the operation of an agency, this Directive requires that agencies  take immediate steps to eliminate the barrier.\u201d In conducting their  analysis, the components\u2019 data may uncover barriers or other potential  problems. However, understanding why the barrier or problem exists, or  what to do to address it, may require that the components take additional  steps. To identify and eliminate potential barriers, the directive outlines a  four-step process: (1) analyzing workforce data to identify potential  barriers; (2) investigating actual barriers and their causes; (3) eliminating  barriers, which includes devising a plan for improvement and developing  overall objectives for barrier elimination, with corresponding action items,  responsible personnel, and target dates; and (4) assessing the success of  the plan. The PEO\u2019s guidance aims to promote a degree of uniformity and  standardization in conducting postdecisional analyses. However, the  PEO\u2019s guidance does not specify what process the components should  follow to investigate potential barriers and their causes, nor does it specify  a process for eliminating barriers that are found.

Further, at one location we found that  management stressed the importance of maintaining employee share value  at above 2.0, which would result in a higher payout, regardless of the  employee\u2019s rating. According to the PEO, any effort to limit share value is  a roundabout way to establish preset limits on ratings and would  constitute forced distribution, which the NSPS regulations prohibit.  However, in response to concerns about the potential for the forced  distribution of performance ratings under NSPS, in April 2009 the  department posted to its NSPS Web site a fact sheet emphasizing that the  forced distribution of ratings is prohibited under NSPS and describing how  meaningful distinctions in performance are made under the system. DOD\u2019s  fact sheet provides guidance specifying what constitutes the forced  distribution of ratings, why the forced distribution of ratings is prohibited,  how use of standard performance indicators minimizes the potential for  individual bias or favoritism, and how organizations can best apply this  information when rating and rewarding employee performance under  NSPS.

According to PEO officials, organizations might elect to  supplement their pay pool funds for a variety of reasons\u2014for example,  to recruit or retain employees or to compete with other organizations  for talent. However, because they do not understand the reasons why  pay pools supplement their pay pool funding\u2014which could help DOD  and the components understand the extent to which adequate  resources have been allocated to the system\u2014decision makers cannot  identify or assess any trends in these practices.

At five of those locations, discussion group participants told us  that they continue to believe that a rating of \u201c3\u201d means only \u201caverage,\u201d in  contrast to \u201cvalued performer,\u201d as it was initially defined to the workforce  by DOD.", "Discussion group participants at five locations also discussed how  achieving a rating higher than a \u201c3\u201d seemed to be an unattainable goal. For  example, employees at four locations told us that they felt NSPS either  does not provide incentives for high performance or encourages only  mediocre performance from employees under the system because of the  high number of employees receiving \u201c3\u201d-level ratings each year. As another  example, supervisors at one location noted that across the installation  there is a general feeling that everyone receives a rating of \u201c3,\u201d and  therefore such a rating is considered average, no matter how DOD defines  it. Similarly, discussion group participants at seven locations told us that  they felt it was difficult for employees in certain positions to receive a  rating of \u201c5\u201d because of the nature of their work or the perceived value  their management placed on those positions. At one of those locations,  supervisors told us that they felt such things as how the pay pool\u2019s  business rules were structured affected whether an employee could  receive a high rating. At that location, the pay pool\u2019s business rules  specified that an employee must receive a higher-level award, such as a  command or agencywide award, to receive a rating of \u201c5.\u201d However,  discussion group participants told us that they felt some employees were  not in a position to receive such awards because of their positions or the  type of work they did.", "In addition, discussion group participants at all eight locations we visited  expressed frustration over the amount of the annual performance payout  provided under NSPS. For example, discussion group participants noted  that they felt the payout was not significant enough to encourage anything  other than average performance. Discussion group participants at six of  the eight locations also told us that they felt NSPS discourages employees  from seeking additional responsibilities and opportunities that fall outside  the scope of their objectives because their payout may not reflect their  additional work. In addition, discussion group participants at six locations  told us that because supervisory positions under NSPS require such a  significant increase in responsibility and effort, and because the maximum  allowable pay increase for reassignments is capped at 5 percent, some  employees may not seek promotion opportunities. Similarly, a discussion  group participant at another location expressed frustration that some  employees only received their payout in the form of a bonus and not an  increase in salary. Discussion group participants at three of the eight  locations also expressed concerns that they felt performance payouts  under NSPS tended to benefit higher-paid employees at the expense of  lower-paid employees. For example, employees at one location expressed  concerns that in their pay pool, the higher payouts under NSPS seemed to  go to employees at the top of the pay bands."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concerns about an Excessive Amount of Time Spent Navigating the NSPS Performance Management Process", "paragraphs": ["Another prevalent theme at seven of the eight locations and also  highlighted in our first assessment was that employees spend an excessive  amount of time navigating the performance management process. While  the discussion group participants\u2019 complaints about the time- and labor- intensive nature of the system were not limited to any one part of the  process, discussion group participants at seven locations pointed out that  the time and effort required to complete the steps of the NSPS  performance management process were significantly greater than what  was required of them under previous systems. For example, one  supervisor we spoke with speculated that his supervisory duties under  NSPS took him six times as long to perform as they had under the GS  system, while another supervisor told us that he may have spent from 45 to  50 hours assessing the performance of three employees, a task he could  have completed in 10 hours under the GS system.", "At five of the locations we visited, employees expressed concerns about  NSPS potentially affecting their ability to complete their jobs or affecting  the mission because of what they perceived as an excessive amount of  time required of employees and supervisors in navigating the NSPS  performance management process. In some instances, employees spoke of  impacts NSPS was having on their supervisors, while others spoke of their  own experiences navigating the NSPS performance management process.  At three locations, discussion group participants described how what they  perceived as an excessive amount of time navigating the NSPS  performance management process affected their ability to complete their  job-related duties, requiring completion of some NSPS tasks, such as self- assessments and employee ratings, after work hours or on weekends. One  employee described feeling inundated with information on NSPS and that  it was difficult to stay on top of things while simultaneously performing his  job, while another employee estimated that she spent about 2 hours per  week on NSPS-related tasks. In some instances, discussion group  participants told us that they saw the potential for the excessive time  commitment required by NSPS to affect the missions of their  organizations. According to one supervisor, any task that takes employees  away from their daily work affects the mission, and any task that takes the  time and patience of the command\u2019s leadership detracts from the mission.  Further, in discussing during a site visit the potential for NSPS to impact  the organization\u2019s mission, one general officer we spoke with described  NSPS as \u201cmission ineffective.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concerns about Challenges with Job Objectives under NSPS", "paragraphs": ["Another prevalent theme that emerged from our discussions with both  supervisors and employees at all eight locations was that there are  challenges with employee job objectives under NSPS. According to DOD,  the NSPS performance management system is designed to provide a fair  and equitable method for appraising and evaluating performance. As part  of the system, DOD established the concept of \u201cjob objectives,\u201d which are  the required tasks of a given job as determined by managers and  supervisors, and directed that job objectives be developed and used as the  standards for evaluating employee performance. However, supervisors  and employees at each of the eight locations discussed challenges they  experienced developing their job objectives under NSPS. Specifically:    Although DOD guidance encourages employees to develop job  objectives that are specific, measurable, aligned, realistic, and timed\u2014 an approach summarized by the acronym S.M.A.R.T.\u2014employees and  supervisors we met at six of eight locations discussed how they found  it challenging to develop job objectives that are measurable or that  follow the S.M.A.R.T. approach. Supervisors at one location objected  to the S.M.A.R.T. approach, particularly the \u201cspecific\u201d portion, because  they felt that job objectives needed to be broad enough to allow  employees to discuss any accomplishments they make if they complete  additional job activities or other tasks that might arise during the year.  Supervisors at two locations discussed how the work they did was  nebulous and unpredictable, which made it challenging to develop job  objectives that not only reflected the nature of their work but that they  could exceed. Similarly, supervisors at another location expressed  concerns that employees\u2019 job objectives may not reflect the work they  do by the end of the performance management cycle because of  constant changes within their organization.", "According to discussion group participants at four locations, guidance  for developing job objectives is either limited or nonexistent, which  may result in different approaches to developing job objectives across  an organization. At one of these locations, employees told us that their  management had not established consistent ground rules for  developing job objectives and that as a result some employees\u2019 job  objectives were based on out-of-date position descriptions. One  organization we visited used a mixture of mandatory and employee- specific job objectives; but, according to one employee, little guidance  exists to help employees and supervisors when they need to develop  personalized job objectives. Employees at another location told us that  there were significant differences in the amount of involvement they  had in developing their job objectives. For example, one individual told  us that employees in her office develop their own objectives, while  another said employees in her office are assigned mandatory  objectives and were thus unable to provide input into their objectives.", "Discussion group participants at six locations expressed concerns that  it can be difficult to achieve a high rating for some job objectives.  Some locations we visited used mandatory job objectives, which left  employees concerned that their job objectives did not accurately  capture the full responsibilities of the work they performed. For  example, at one location, a uniform, mandatory supervisory objective  accounted for half of supervisors\u2019 ratings, which, according to one  supervisor, diminished the value of the other responsibilities they had.  The supervisor expressed further concern that some mandatory job  objectives, such as those assigned to government purchase card  holders, require a pass-fail evaluation, making it difficult, if not  impossible, for the employee to receive a high rating. In one instance, a  location we visited required all employees to be rated against a  mandatory safety objective. However, according to some supervisors,  it did not make sense for everyone to have the mandatory safety  objective because for many employees, safety issues were out of their  control."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concerns about Factors That Undermine Employee Confidence in the System", "paragraphs": ["During our discussion groups, participants at all eight locations also  discussed how various factors undermine employees\u2019 confidence in the  system and its implementation thus far. For example, discussion group  participants at six locations commented that they do not believe that the  NSPS performance management system has the ability to rate employees  fairly. At the locations we visited, discussion of these concerns centered  on such things as the perception of subjectivity and the potential for  favoritism under NSPS; a lack of transparency surrounding the pay pool  panel process, including a lack of understanding of what employees  needed to do to receive higher ratings; and the perception of  inconsistencies in interpretations of the standards used to determine  employee ratings.", "One prevalent theme at all eight locations involved perceptions of  subjectivity, such as the potential for favoritism under NSPS during the  rating and pay pool panel processes. At five locations, participants  discussed their frustration with how NSPS takes the responsibility for  rating employees out of the hands of supervisors and places it in the hands  of the pay pool panel members, who may or may not have any direct  knowledge of individual employees\u2019 performance. One supervisor told us  that NSPS may inadvertently favor employees who work closely or are in  direct contact with members of the pay pool panel because those  individuals have direct knowledge of the employees and, sometimes, their  performance. Similarly, supervisors at another location told us that they  did not feel that their pay pool panel understood their jobs and what they  do and expressed frustration that the pay pool panel did not seem to be  reaching out to their supervisors and higher-level reviewers for additional  input on their performance. At five of the eight locations, discussion group  participants also told us that they saw the potential for the employee- supervisor relationship to affect an employee\u2019s rating\u2014either to the  benefit or detriment of the employee.", "Another prevalent theme at six of the eight locations\u2014a theme also  highlighted in our first assessment of NSPS\u2014was a lack of transparency  and understanding of the pay pool panel process. Specifically, supervisors  at two locations commented that their organizations\u2019 pay pool panel  processes were not transparent. A supervisor at one location commented  that everything \u201cgoes into a black vacuum,\u201d while another likened the  process to a \u201cblack box.\u201d Employees at that same location referred to the  organization\u2019s pay pool panel process as a \u201cstar chamber,\u201d where decisions  are made but are not explained to employees. Employees and supervisors  at five locations expressed concerns about the amount of information they  received from their pay pools and about the process itself; some desired  further information to help them better understand the pay pool panel  process. In addition, at six of the eight locations, discussion group  participants told us that they did not understand what they needed to do to  receive a higher rating. For example, an employee at one location told us  that she was told by her supervisor that all employees had to receive a  rating of \u201c3\u201d because they would have had to \u201cwalk on water\u201d to receive a  higher rating. Discussion group participants at two other locations also  discussed how \u201cwalking on water\u201d was a perceived standard for receiving  a high rating under NSPS. At three locations, supervisors commented that  they were unclear about what they could do to help their employees  receive better ratings, while employees at four locations were unclear  about what they could do to achieve higher ratings.", "Discussion group participants at six locations also raised concerns about  inconsistent interpretation of the standards used when evaluating civilian  employees under NSPS. Discussion group participants reported concerns  that military supervisors may rate employees using more stringent  standards than their civilian counterparts. Discussion group participants  also reported concerns that some military supervisors may not value the  NSPS performance management process and sometimes devote less time  and effort to the process, which could affect employees\u2019 ratings. One  civilian supervisor told us that some military supervisors with whom he  attended NSPS training had a much harsher perspective of employee  performance than their civilian counterparts. For example, he noted that  the military supervisors indicated that giving a rating of \u201c1\u201d or \u201c2\u201d was  acceptable, whereas he believed civilian supervisors would be more  inclined to give an employee a rating of \u201c3.\u201d Employees also told us that  they do not believe some military supervisors value the work of employees  who perform certain job functions, such as providing child care on an  installation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concerns about Factors Unrelated to Performance Affecting Final Ratings", "paragraphs": ["A prevalent theme expressed by discussion group participants at all eight  locations we visited is that factors unrelated to performance may affect  employees\u2019 final performance ratings. Such factors include the existence  of a forced distribution or quota of ratings, the writing ability of employees  and supervisors, and pay pool panel members\u2019 knowledge of employees.  For example:    Discussion group participants at all eight locations expressed concerns  that their pay pool panels used a forced distribution or quota for  ratings, which dictated the number of ratings in each category that  could be awarded. Employees at one location told us that they were  aware of their management\u2019s attempts to artificially preserve a higher  share value for employees by primarily awarding ratings of \u201c3,\u201d  regardless of the employees\u2019 performance. Further, at three locations  discussion group participants told us that their management told them  that all employees should expect to receive a rating of \u201c3.\u201d Moreover,  some discussion group participants told us that they doubted that their  actual performance had the bearing it was supposed to have on their  final ratings, while others felt the use of a forced distribution or quotas  was in direct conflict with the principles of pay for performance under  NSPS. While no discussion group participants we met with were aware  of any explicit guidance provided to pay pool panels or supervisors  that limited the number of certain ratings they assigned employees,  employees and supervisors from at least three locations believed that  informal guidelines existed or that pay pool panels or supervisors were  encouraged to limit the number of certain ratings they could assign.", "Discussion group participants at all eight locations also expressed  concerns that the writing ability of employees and supervisors may  affect ratings\u2014a theme also highlighted in our first assessment of  NSPS. Supervisors at one location likened the process of developing  employees\u2019 assessments under NSPS to a writing contest. Moreover,  supervisors told us that they felt their writing ability could  unintentionally affect their employees\u2019 ratings, noting, for example,  that a supervisor\u2019s ability to articulate an employee\u2019s achievements in  writing plays a significant role in supporting a higher rating for that  employee. Employees shared the supervisors\u2019 concerns, noting that  they believed that succeeding under NSPS depended on the quality of  their written assessments, rather than their job performance, and that  their ratings could suffer if their supervisors did not provide the pay  pool panel with well-written assessments. In discussing the potential  influence that employees\u2019 and supervisors\u2019 writing skills may have on a  pay pool panel\u2019s assessment of an employee, officials at seven of the  eight locations acknowledged that in some instances writing skills had  affected employees\u2019 ratings and could overshadow employees\u2019  performance.", "Discussion group participants at seven locations also expressed  frustration that employee ratings were potentially affected by the  extent to which pay pool panel members have personal knowledge of  employees or understand the nature of their work in general. Some  discussion group participants felt that pay pool panel members\u2019  personal knowledge of employees helped some employees receive  higher ratings, while others told us that they felt that members of the  pay pool panel were too far removed from them and lacked direct  knowledge of the work they performed. One employee believed that  individuals who were involved in implementing NSPS worked closely  with pay pool panel members, or were senior managers who were  more likely to receive higher ratings under NSPS than others. Other  employees told us that they were concerned about the potential for  pay pool panel members to advocate in some way for employees they  personally know\u2014for example, by encouraging the pay pool panel to  contact a specific employee\u2019s supervisor to seek additional  information or justification for a rating. As a result, they felt that pay  pool panel members\u2019 personal knowledge of employees could benefit  some employees, but not others."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Not Yet Developed a Comprehensive Action Plan to Address Employees\u2019 Perceptions of the System", "paragraphs": ["In our first assessment of NSPS, we recommended that DOD develop and  implement a specific action plan to address employees\u2019 perceptions of  NSPS, based on guidance published by OPM for conducting annual  employee surveys and providing feedback to employees on the results.  The guidance suggests that after an agency\u2019s survey results have been  reviewed, the agency has a responsibility to provide feedback to  employees on the results of the survey, as well as to let employees know  the intended actions to address the results and the progress made on these  actions. Further, the guidance suggests that agencies consider the  following when developing action plans:    who will be responsible for taking action;    who will be responsible for providing oversight;  if the individuals taking the action have the necessary authority to  make things happen;    what coordination, if any, is required, and how it will be accomplished;    how agencies will adjust given any changes or delays in their actions.", "Since then, in June 2009, the PEO issued a departmentwide memorandum  entitled \u201cAddressing Key NSPS Workforce Concerns\u201d; however, issuance  of this memorandum does not fully meet the intent of our 2008  recommendation. Specifically, the PEO\u2019s June 2009 memorandum  summarizes key concerns from the department\u2019s 2008 evaluation of NSPS,  summarizes departmentwide actions that had been taken to date to  address employees\u2019 concerns about the system, and suggests approaches  to enhance local efforts to address workforce concerns. The PEO  identified five key areas of concern, which are similar to those identified in  our own discussion group sessions with DOD employees and supervisors:  (1) performance communication and feedback, (2) understanding of  performance management and the pay pool process, (3) trust in the system  and its processes, (4) training and information, and (5) the amount of time  needed to fulfill performance management responsibilities. The PEO\u2019s  memorandum urged the components to leverage information from the  department\u2019s 2008 evaluation of NSPS and focus on the five areas  discussed above as they plan their own actions. Further, the PEO\u2019s  memorandum noted that DOD has taken some steps to address employees\u2019  concerns about NSPS\u2014for example, developing and fielding a pay pool  training course for employees and rating officials, modifying its  implementing issuances to require all performance review authorities to  review pay pool panel results on an annual basis, and providing guidance  to employees on the prohibition against the forced distribution of ratings.  Issuance of the PEO\u2019s memorandum represents an important first step.  However, because the memorandum does not specify actions the  department intends to take, who will be responsible for taking the action,  and timelines for addressing areas where employees express negative  perceptions of the system, it does not fully meet the intent of our 2008  recommendation. In developing an action plan, we note that OPM recently  issued guidance that agencies can use in developing action plans for  improving employee satisfaction. According to OPM, action plans should  clearly (1) state the objectives, (2) identify actions to be taken, (3) provide  outcome measures and improvement targets, and (4) describe how  progress will be tracked. In addition to identifying the specific actions that  will be taken to achieve improvements, OPM\u2019s guidance also suggests that  agencies specify  time frames for accomplishing the actions,    who will be responsible for implementing the actions,    who will be affected by the actions,   the resources required, and   a plan to communicate these actions to managers and employees.", "We continue to believe that developing and implementing a plan to  address employees\u2019 perceptions of NSPS could help DOD make changes to  the system that could lead to greater employee acceptance and, ultimately,  the system\u2019s successful implementation.

However, toward the end of this review, the future of  NSPS became uncertain, given the proposed legislation that, if enacted,  would terminate the system and require any future system created by DOD  to use safeguards similar to those discussed in our report, including  ensuring employee involvement in the system and providing adequate  training and retraining. In light of the contingent nature surrounding NSPS  and the possibility of implementing a different system, sustained and  committed leadership will be imperative to provide focused attention  necessary to implement any pay-for-performance system within DOD. Key  to implementing a fair, effective, and credible system is including  safeguards early on in the design of the system. Since we issued our first  assessment of NSPS in 2008, we note that DOD has continued to take steps  to meet the intent of each of the safeguards. However, with this latest  assessment, we note that the department has not implemented the  safeguards systematically; for example, it has not ensured that the training  provided to employees on the system\u2019s operations is effective. Further,  DOD has not monitored how the safeguards specifically are implemented  by lower-level organizations across the department. As a result, decision  makers in DOD lack information that could be used to determine whether  the department\u2019s actions are effective and whether the system is being  implemented in a fair, equitable, and credible manner. Additionally, while  DOD has gained experience operating under NSPS, at the time of our  review it had not yet developed an action plan for addressing employees\u2019  perceptions of the system, as we recommended in 2008. As DOD moves  forward with implementing a pay-for-performance system\u2014whether NSPS  or another\u2014we believe that it is important for the department to improve  upon its implementation of the safeguards and address employees\u2019  concerns.

DOD  further stated that it would consider acting on our recommendations to  the extent they are relevant as the department moves forward with any  future performance management system. We believe that this is a  reasonable approach. As discussed above, we recognize the contingent  nature surrounding NSPS as a result of provisions in the proposed  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, which recently  passed both Houses of Congress. Accordingly, we revised our  recommendations to apply to any future performance management system  for the department\u2019s civilian employees\u2014whether NSPS or another  system.

However, to  understand the nature of any changes that were made to its survey  methods for administering the survey for 2008 as compared with previous  administrations, we also received responses to written questions from and  discussed these data with officials at DMDC. Based on these responses  and discussions, we determined that DMDC\u2019s survey data remain  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of our reports on DOD civilian  employees\u2019 perceptions of NSPS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Discussion Groups with DOD Civilian Employees under NSPS", "paragraphs": ["We also conducted small group discussions with DOD civilian employees  and administered a short questionnaire during site visits in February and  March 2009. Specifically, we conducted two discussion groups\u2014one with  nonsupervisory employees and another with supervisory employees\u2014at  each of the eight locations we visited, for a total of 16 discussion groups.  As with our first assessment of NSPS in 2008, our objective in using this  approach was to obtain employees\u2019 perceptions about NSPS and its  implementation thus far because discussion groups are intended to  provide in-depth information about participants\u2019 reasons for holding  certain attitudes about specific topics and to offer insights into the range  of concerns about and support for an issue. Further, in conducting our  discussion groups, our intent was to achieve saturation\u2014the point at  which we were no longer hearing new information.", "As we previously reported, our discussion groups were not designed to   (1) demonstrate the extent of a problem or to generalize the results to a  larger population, (2) develop a consensus to arrive at an agreed-upon  plan or make decisions about what actions to take, or (3) provide  statistically representative samples or reliable quantitative estimates.  Instead, our discussion groups provide in-depth information about  participants\u2019 reasons for holding certain attitudes about specific topics and  offer insights into the range of concerns about and support for an issue.  Although the results of our discussion sessions are not generalizable to the  entire NSPS civilian population, the composition of our discussion groups  was designed to ensure that we spoke with employees from each of the  four components at locations outside the continental United States.  Because supervisory and nonsupervisory employees have distinct roles  with respect to NSPS, we held separate discussion sessions for these  groups.", "To select the discussion group participants, we requested that the  organizations we visited provide us with lists of employees who had  converted to NSPS. From the lists provided, we selected participants  based on their supervisory and nonsupervisory status. To ensure  maximum participation of the selected employees, we randomly selected  up to 20 participants from each group with the goal of meeting with 8 to 12  individuals in each discussion group and provided the employee names  and a standard invitation to GAO\u2019s points of contact to disseminate to the  employees. At the majority of locations, we reached our goal of meeting  with 8 to 12 individuals in each discussion group; however, since  participation was not compulsory, in two instances we did not reach our  goal of 8 participants per discussion group. Table 6 provides information  on the composition of our discussion groups.", "To facilitate our discussion groups, we developed a discussion guide to  help the moderator in addressing several topics related to employees\u2019  perceptions of the NSPS performance management system. These topics  include employees\u2019 overall perception of NSPS and the rating process, the  training they received on NSPS, the communication they have had with  their supervisors, positive aspects they perceive of NSPS, and any changes  they would make to the system, among others. Each discussion group was  scheduled for a 2-hour period and began with the GAO moderator greeting  the participants, describing the purpose of the study, and explaining the  procedures for the discussion group. Participants were assured that all of  their comments would be discussed in the aggregate or as part of larger  themes that emerged. The GAO moderator asked participants open-ended  questions related to NSPS, while at least one other GAO analyst observed  the discussion group and took notes. Following the conclusion of all our  discussion group sessions, we performed content analysis of the sessions  in order to identify the themes that emerged and to summarize the  participants\u2019 perceptions of NSPS. We reviewed responses from several of  the discussion groups and created a list of themes and subtheme  categories. We then reviewed the comments from each of the 16  discussion groups and assigned each comment to the appropriate  category, which was agreed upon by two analysts. If agreement was not  reached on a comment\u2019s placement in a category, another analyst  reconciled the issue by placing the comment in either one or more of the  categories. The responses in each category were then used in our  evaluation and discussion of how civilian employees perceive NSPS.", "Following each discussion group we administered a questionnaire to the  participants to obtain further information on their background, tenure  with the federal government and DOD, and attitudes toward NSPS. We  received questionnaires from 164 discussion group participants. In  addition to collecting demographic data from participants for the purpose  of reporting with whom we spoke (see table 7), the purpose of our  questionnaire was to (1) collect information from participants that could  not easily be obtained through discussion, for example, information  participants may have been uncomfortable sharing in a group setting, and  (2) collect some of the same data found in past DOD surveys. Specifically,  the questionnaire included questions designed to obtain employees\u2019  perceptions of NSPS as compared to their previous personnel system, the  accuracy with which they felt their ratings reflected their performance,  and management\u2019s methods for conveying overall rating information.  Since the questionnaire was used to collect supplemental information and  was administered solely to the participants of our discussion groups, the  results represent the opinions of only those employees and cannot be  projected across DOD, a component, or any single pay pool we visited."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Department of the Army", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Department of the Air Force", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Department of the Navy", "paragraphs": ["Commander, Navy Region Hawaii, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii    Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Hawaii, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii    NSPS Program Office, Navy Yard, Washington, D.C.
