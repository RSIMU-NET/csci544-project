However, from fiscal year 2016 through 2018, both foreign and domestic inspections decreased\u2014by about 10 percent and 13 percent, respectively. FDA officials attributed the decline, in part, to vacancies among investigators available to conduct inspections. In March 2020, FDA announced that, due to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), it was postponing almost all inspections of foreign manufacturing establishments. While FDA has indicated it has other tools to ensure the safety of the U.S. drug supply, the lack of foreign inspections removes a critical source of information about the quality of drugs manufactured for the U.S. market.", "GAO also found that FDA had vacancies among each of the groups of investigators who conduct foreign inspections. FDA had 190 investigators in the United States who conduct the majority of foreign inspections, but an additional 58 positions were vacant. At the time of GAO's December 2019 testimony, FDA was in the process filling 26 of these vacancies, with 32 remaining. However, according to FDA officials, it could be 2 to 3 years before new staff are experienced enough to conduct foreign inspections. FDA also faced persistent vacancies among investigators in its foreign offices.", "GAO further found in December 2019 that FDA investigators identified persistent challenges conducting foreign inspections, raising questions about the equivalence of foreign to domestic inspections. Specifically, GAO found:", "While FDA inspections performed in the United States were almost always unannounced, FDA's practice of preannouncing foreign inspections up to 12 weeks in advance may have given manufacturers the opportunity to fix problems ahead of the inspection. Investigators from FDA's China and India offices had conducted some unannounced inspections, but these staff do not perform most of the inspections in these countries (27 percent and 10 percent, respectively).", "FDA was not generally providing translators on foreign inspections. Rather, FDA continued to rely on translators provided by the foreign establishments being inspected, which investigators said raised questions about the accuracy of information FDA investigators collected. For example, one investigator said there was more risk of conflict of interest if the establishment used its own employees to translate. In addition, the establishment representative providing the translation may be someone who does not have the technical language needed, which can make it harder to communicate with establishment staff and facilitate the inspection.", "The overseas travel schedule can present challenges for FDA's domestically based investigators, who conduct the majority of foreign inspections. Domestically based investigators told us there is little flexibility for them to extend foreign inspections during an overseas trip. The inspections they conduct on an overseas trip are scheduled back-to-back in 3-week trips and may involve three different countries. Therefore, extending one inspection would limit the amount of time the investigator has to complete their other scheduled inspections. FDA officials said that inspections conducted by investigators based in China or India (and domestic inspections in the United States) are generally scheduled one at a time and can thus more easily be extended if the investigator needs additional time to pursue potential deficiencies. However, these in-country investigators are not involved in the majority of FDA inspections conducted in China or India."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our work on the Food and Drug  Administration\u2019s (FDA) oversight of drugs manufactured overseas.

For example,  FDA announced that it was evaluating additional ways to conduct its  inspectional work that would not jeopardize public safety and would  protect both the establishments and the FDA staff. Such ways, according  to FDA, could include reviewing the compliance histories of  establishments, using information shared by foreign regulatory partners,  and evaluating establishment records in lieu of an onsite inspection.

Officials also said that a reorganization within ORA led to a reduced  number of investigators who conduct drug manufacturing establishment  inspections.

In our 2010 report, we recommended that FDA develop a  strategic workforce plan to help recruit and retain foreign office staff.  FDA agreed with our recommendation and released such a plan in March  2016, but the long-standing vacancies in the foreign offices raise  questions about its implementation. FDA officials told us that one  challenge in recruiting investigators for the foreign offices is that well- qualified investigators for those positions need foreign inspection  experience. For example, an official in FDA\u2019s India office told us that  foreign inspections can be challenging, and the India office does not have  the resources to develop or train new investigators. Therefore, it is  important to recruit investigators who have experience conducting foreign  inspections, and such investigators are recruited from ORA. Thus,  vacancies in the other two groups of investigators can influence the  number of staff available to apply for positions in the foreign offices.", "Further, according to FDA officials, after employees have accepted an in- country position, the agency can experience significant delays before they  are staffed in the office due to delays in processing assignments. For  example, an official in FDA\u2019s India office said that investigators need to  complete a week-long security training program and must obtain the  security clearance needed to work at the U.S. Embassy, which is where  FDA\u2019s foreign office is located. However, the official told us that there are  limited availabilities for that training, and background checks for security  clearances can take time. According to this official, FDA investigators  did not usually receive first priority for the training. FDA estimated that it  can take as little as 1 month to over 2 years for an investigator to clear  background and medical checks and arrive at a foreign office. For  example, an investigator in FDA\u2019s China office told us that as a result of  these requirements and other issues, it took nearly 2 years for the  investigator to arrive at the office after FDA had accepted the  investigator\u2019s application.

Drug  establishment inspections performed in the United States are almost  always unannounced, whereas foreign establishments generally receive advance notice of an FDA inspection. According to FDA officials, FDA is  not required to preannounce foreign inspections. However, they said the  agency generally does so to avoid wasting agency resources, obtain the  establishment\u2019s assistance to make travel arrangements, and ensure the  safety of investigators when traveling in country.", "In our December 2019 testimony, we found that FDA does conduct some  unannounced foreign inspections, particularly if the investigators  conducting the inspection are based in FDA\u2019s foreign offices. However,  FDA officials told us that FDA does not have data on the frequency with  which foreign drug inspections are unannounced, nor the extent to which  the amount of notice provided to foreign establishments varies. According  to FDA officials, this is because FDA does not have a data field in its  database to systematically track this information. However, the officials  estimated that the agency generally gives 12 weeks of notice to  establishments that investigators are coming when investigators are  traveling from the United States. While investigators in FDA\u2019s China and  India offices do conduct unannounced or short-notice inspections, these  staff do not perform most of the inspections in these countries. (See table  3.)", "Our work indicated that preannouncing foreign inspections can create  challenges and raises questions about the equivalence to domestic  inspections. Of the 18 investigators we interviewed, 14 said that there are  downsides to preannouncing foreign inspections, particularly that  providing advance notice gives foreign establishments the opportunity to  fix problems before the investigator arrives. For example, when an  inspection is preannounced, it gives establishments time to clean up their  facility and update or generate new operating procedures ahead of the  inspection. However, establishments are expected to be in a constant  state of compliance and always ready for an FDA inspection, and several  investigators told us seeing the true day-to-day operating environment for  an establishment is more likely during an unannounced inspection.", "Of the 18 investigators we interviewed for our December 2019 testimony,  12 said that unannounced inspections are generally preferable to  preannounced inspections. One investigator told us that, although they  believed the best way to ensure industry compliance to CGMPs was for  establishments to not know when FDA is coming for an inspection, there  was no data that would allow the agency to evaluate whether  unannounced inspections were better than preannounced inspections. In  addition, some investigators told us that it was still possible to identify  serious deficiencies during preannounced inspections. For example,  investigators could still identify issues by looking at the firm\u2019s electronic  records, including time-stamped data relating to the creation,  modification, or deletion of a record. Three investigators also told us that  in some cases there could be benefits to announcing inspections in  advance. For example, for preapproval inspections, announcing the  inspection in advance gives the establishment time to organize the  documentation and staff needed to conduct the inspection.", "Language Barriers. Work for our December 2019 testimony indicated  that language barriers\u2014which we first reported as a challenge to  conducting foreign inspections in our 2008 report\u2014can add time to  inspections and raise questions about the accuracy of information FDA  investigators collect and thus about the equivalence to domestic  inspections. FDA generally does not send translators on inspections in  foreign countries. Rather, investigators rely on the drug establishment to  provide translation services, which can be an English-speaking employee  of the establishment being inspected, an external translator hired by the  establishment, or an English-speaking consultant hired by the  establishment.", "Of the 18 investigators that we interviewed, 14 said that language barriers  can be a challenge to conducting foreign inspections and were especially  challenging in parts of Asia, including China and Japan. Seven  investigators told us this issue was less of a challenge for inspections  conducted in other foreign countries, including India and countries in  Europe, because workers at establishments in these countries were more  likely to speak English, and documentation was also more likely to be in  English. Investigators told us that compared to domestic inspections, it  can be more challenging and take longer to complete typical inspection- related activities, such as reviewing documentation or interviewing  employees, if the investigator needed to rely on translation.", "Fourteen of the 18 investigators we interviewed said that there can be  concerns related to relying on establishment staff and independent  translators. Specifically, 11 investigators told us there can be  uncertainties regarding the accuracy of the information being translated,  particularly when investigators rely on the translation provided by an  employee of the establishment being inspected. For instance, one  investigator said that there was more risk of conflict of interest if the  establishment used its own employees to translate. Another investigator  said that they went to a drug establishment in China that told FDA it had  English-speaking employees to translate the inspection, but that was not  the case, and the investigator had to use an application on their phone to  translate the interviews. In addition, the firm representative providing the  translation may be someone who does not have the technical language  needed, which can make it harder to communicate with firm staff and  facilitate the inspection. One investigator told us that the independent  translators hired by firms were sometimes consultants and, in those  instances, it can seem like the consultants are coaching the firm during  the inspection.", "FDA officials told us that when they conduct unannounced for-cause  inspections in China, investigators bring locally employed staff who work  in FDA\u2019s China office to act as translators. The investigators we  interviewed said that in such instances, they valued knowing that the  translation they were getting was accurate. However, FDA does not have  the resources to provide locally employed staff on every inspection,  according to an FDA official.", "Lack of Flexibility. Work for our December 2019 testimony indicated  that, as we first reported in 2008, the overseas travel schedule can  present unique challenges for FDA\u2019s domestically based investigators\u2014 including both ORA investigators and members of the dedicated foreign  dug cadre\u2014who conduct the majority of foreign inspections. Eight of the  12 dedicated foreign drug cadre investigators that we interviewed for our  December 2019 testimony told us that there is little flexibility to extend  foreign inspections conducted by domestically based investigators,  because the inspections they conduct on an overseas trip are scheduled  back-to-back in 3-week trips that may involve three different countries.  This raises questions about their equivalence to domestic inspections.  For instance, extending one inspection would limit the amount of time the  investigator has to complete their other scheduled inspections, some  investigators told us.", "In addition, eight investigators told us that domestically based staff are  generally unable to extend the total amount of time spent on an overseas  trip\u2014one investigator told us that an investigator would have to find  something really bad to justify an extension. In contrast, FDA officials told  us that inspections conducted by in-country investigators in China or  India, and domestic inspections in the United States, are generally  scheduled one at a time and can thus more easily be extended if the  investigator needs additional time to pursue potential deficiencies.  However, in-country investigators are not involved in the majority of  inspections conducted in China or India.", "Three investigators from the dedicated foreign drug cadre told us that  when they travel overseas, they adjust their inspection approach to help  ensure they finish foreign inspections on time. For example, one  investigator told us that an investigator may start the inspection in an area  of the establishment that was noted as having issues during the last  inspection. However, one investigator said that sometimes it is not  possible to cover everything in depth during a foreign inspection. Another  investigator told us that they focus on identifying the most serious issues  during a foreign inspection, and that less serious issues can be identified  in the establishment inspection report for reference in the next inspection.  Five investigators also noted that they work long hours during their  inspection to ensure they can complete the needed work. While FDA  may assign more than one investigator to an inspection to complete  needed work, one investigator said that FDA does not usually assign  more than one person to an inspection because investigators are  expected to have the experience to conduct inspections by themselves.", "FDA data show that from fiscal years 2012 through 2018, the majority of  both foreign and domestic inspections were conducted by one person\u2014 77 percent and 66 percent, respectively.", "Post-Inspection Classification Process. According to FDA officials,  starting in fiscal year 2018, FDA implemented a new post-inspection  classification process: when an ORA investigator recommends an OAI  classification following an inspection, ORA compliance is required to send  that inspection report to CDER for review within 45 calendar days from  the inspection closeout. Among other things, the process was intended to  help ensure FDA can communicate inspection results to domestic and  foreign establishments within 90 days of the inspection closeout, as  committed to under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of  2017(GDUFA II). FDA officials told us that the changes also required an  additional ORA review for foreign inspection reports to align that process  with the process for domestic inspection reports. Although the 45-day  reporting time frame for potential OAI classifications is a requirement for  both domestic and foreign inspections, adding the additional level of  review within ORA effectively shortened the amount of time investigators  have to document findings for foreign inspections.", "Our work indicated that the post-inspection reporting time frames can  create challenges for domestic investigators who conduct foreign  inspections and raise questions about the equivalence to domestic  inspections. Eight of the 18 investigators we interviewed for our  December 2019 testimony said shortening the time for completing reports  and adding a level of review has made it more challenging to meet  reporting requirements, especially if serious deficiencies are identified  during the inspection. Investigators told us that for a potential OAI  inspection, they now need to send the inspection report to their supervisor  for endorsement within 10 days of the closeout of a foreign inspection,  regardless of when the investigator\u2019s next inspection is scheduled for, or  whether the investigator has to travel from overseas back to the United  States after the inspection. For example, if a domestic investigator finds  serious deficiencies on the first inspection of an overseas trip\u2014thus  indicating an initial OAI classification\u2014the investigator needs to write and  send the related inspection report to the ORA supervisor for endorsement  before returning home from the 3-week overseas trip to meet the required  time frame. One investigator told us that, as a result of the time  pressures, post-inspection reports may be less thorough, and that some  inspection observations could be better supported if investigators had  more time to write the reports.", "In conclusion, foreign manufacturing establishments continue to be a  critical source of drugs for millions of Americans, and FDA inspections are  a key tool to ensure the quality of these drugs. Over the years since we  first examined this issue, FDA has made significant changes to adapt to  the globalization of the pharmaceutical supply chain and has greatly  increased the number of inspections it conducts of foreign  establishments. However, we found in December 2019 that the agency  faced many of the same challenges overseeing foreign establishments  that we identified over the last two decades. These included inspector  vacancies and unique challenges when inspecting foreign drug  establishments that raised questions about the equivalence of those  inspections to domestic inspections. Since then, the outbreak of COVID- 19 has added a layer of complexity. It also further highlights the global  nature of our pharmaceutical supply chain.", "Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Wyden, and Members of the  Committee, this completes my prepared statement.
