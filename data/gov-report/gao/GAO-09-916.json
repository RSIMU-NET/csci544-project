Recognizing this interplay, GAO's panel of experts and key informants gave greatest priority to options they believed provide long-term investors with predictability of benefits and encourage regional commitments relative to other developing countries. Such options included: (1) Extending the duration of the third-country fabric provision for least developed AGOA countries beyond 2012, and (2) Extending the duration of overall AGOA benefits beyond 2015. The panel similarly gave greatest priority to the options for other development measures that focused on supporting investment through trade capacity building. Many experts considered trade capacity building to be a key component of improving the competitiveness of African textile and apparel inputs production, and in developing the physical and market infrastructure needed for a vibrant export sector.

AGOA allows  eligible sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries to export qualifying goods to  the United States without import duties. Benefiting from these duty-free  provisions, U.S. textile and apparel imports from SSA countries are  currently 52-percent higher than before AGOA implementation in 2000 and  account for a significant proportion of non-oil imports from AGOA  countries. However, despite the tariff advantage, AGOA textile and apparel  imports still represent only 1.3 percent of total U.S. imports of these  goods. Overall, the African textile and apparel industry has not achieved  the growth in production or trade anticipated by U.S. supporters and  AGOA beneficiaries. Production of AGOA textile inputs (such as yarn,  fabric, zippers, and trim) was supposed to deepen the African industrial  base and contribute to a more competitive African apparel industry.", "However, U.S. apparel imports from AGOA countries have declined since  2005. In addition, U.S. yarn and fabric imports from SSA have declined  from about $24.2 million in 1998 to $15.6 million in 2008. Over the past few  years, Congress has sought ways to enhance AGOA benefits to improve  the competitiveness of SSA textile and apparel inputs production.", "This report responds to a mandate in the 2008 Andean Trade Preference  Extension legislation requiring us to submit a report with  recommendations for changes to U.S. trade preference programs \u201cto  provide incentives to increase investment and other measures necessary  to improve the competitiveness of beneficiary sub-Saharan African  countries in the production of yarns, fabrics, and other textile and apparel  inputs\u2026.\u201d We were required to base the report, in part, on the findings of  a study prepared by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), under  the same mandate, to \u201cidentify yarns, fabrics, and other textile and apparel  inputs that through new or increased investment or other measures can be  produced competitively in beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries.\u201d At  the request of staff from the House Committee on Ways and Means, we  expanded our study objectives to include a review of measures that are  beyond the scope of traditional U.S. trade preference legislation, such as  incentives for investment and trade capacity building. The mandate also  required us to prepare a report 90 days after the ITC study was issued.  Thus, in this report, we provide information on options experts have put  forward that Congress may wish to consider for (1) possible changes to  AGOA or other U.S. trade preference programs and (2) other measures the  U.S. government could take to help increase investment in and improve  competitiveness of textile and apparel inputs production in SSA. Some of  the options presented would require legislative action while others could  be implemented administratively.", "To prepare this report, we reviewed ITC reports on SSA, including hearing  materials and the ITC study conducted under the same mandate as our  review, and reviewed literature on issues related to the textile and apparel  industry and investment in SSA countries. We also interviewed  knowledgeable U.S. agency officials, researchers, and consultants involved  in work related to U.S.-Africa trade, private-sector representatives of the  U.S. and African textile industries and the U.S. retail and apparel import  industries, and officials from 12 African embassies in Washington, D.C.  Through these sources, we identified numerous suggestions for how the  U.S. government could support competitiveness in the African textile and  apparel industry. On June 2, 2009, we convened a panel of experts and key  informants that considered the industry challenges and potentially  competitive products described in the ITC report. We asked the panel to  consider ways to improve the competitiveness of the African textile and  apparel inputs industry and to rank these options as higher or lower  priorities for Congress to consider. As discussed with congressional staff,  to meet the 90-day deadline provided by the mandate, the options  presented in this report are based on the opinions of experts and key  informants and should not be interpreted as GAO recommendations. GAO  did not evaluate the potential impacts or the economic costs and benefits  of the options discussed. We conducted our work from January through  July 2009 in accordance with all sections of GAO\u2019s Quality Assurance  Framework that are relevant to our objectives. The framework requires  that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain sufficient and  appropriate evidence to meet our stated objectives and to discuss any  limitations in our work. We believe that the information and data obtained,  and the analysis conducted, provide a reasonable basis for any findings  and conclusions in this product.

According to the Office of the U.S.  Trade Representative (USTR), AGOA provides duty-free access to U.S.  markets for more than 6,000 dutiable items in the U.S. import tariff  schedules. All 48 countries in SSA are potentially eligible for AGOA, but  some have not met the eligibility criteria, and the program currently has  only 40 beneficiaries.  See figure 1. Most U.S. imports of textiles and  apparel from SSA countries come from no more than 10 countries  (Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mauritius, Nigeria, South Africa,  Swaziland, Tanzania, and Zambia). Together, these countries account for  97 percent of U.S. textile and apparel imports from SSA.", "A key feature of AGOA is its provisions for duty-free preferences for  specific textile and apparel goods subject to rules of origin limitations.  Eligibility for textiles and apparel benefits is based on conditions more  selective than the general AGOA conditions and is only available to select  AGOA countries. AGOA provides duty-free and quota-free treatment for  eligible apparel articles made in qualifying SSA countries through 2015.  Qualifying articles include:    Apparel made of U.S. yarns and fabrics;    Apparel made of SSA (regional) yarns and fabrics until 2015, subject to a    Apparel made in designated SSA lesser-developed countries (LDC) of  third-country yarns and fabrics originating anywhere in the world, until  2012, subject to a cap\u2014commonly referred to as the \u201cthird-country fabric  provision;\u201d", "Apparel made of yarns and fabrics not produced in commercial quantities  in the United States; and   Textile or textile articles originating entirely in one or more lesser- developed beneficiary SSA countries; certain cashmere and merino wool  sweaters; and eligible hand-loomed, handmade, or folklore articles, and  ethnic printed fabrics.", "Industrialization in many developed countries was initiated in the textiles  and apparel sectors, and some developing countries have relied on these  sectors to significantly increase and diversify exports, with positive effects  on incomes, employment, and poverty levels. Proponents of AGOA  anticipated that by providing generous preferences for imports of textiles  and apparel from AGOA-eligible countries, AGOA beneficiaries would be  able to leverage these advantages to replicate this industrialization  process. After AGOA was implemented, there was an initial surge of U.S.  textile and apparel imports from beneficiary countries. U.S. imports of  SSA products from SSA increased from $776 million in 2000 to about $1.8  billion in 2004. However, after 2004, when quotas under the Multi-Fiber  Arrangement (MFA) were removed, U.S. imports of these products from  SSA declined by about one-third, to $1.2 billion in 2008. See figure 2.", "Although AGOA provides some of the most generous preferences under  any U.S. trade program, as figure 3 shows, in 2008, SSA countries  accounted for 1.3 percent of total U.S. textile and apparel imports. In  contrast, China accounted for 35 percent of U.S. imports of textiles and  apparel, while Bangladesh and Cambodia accounted for 3.8 and 2.6  percent, respectively. In 2008, U.S. textile and apparel imports from China  were 28 times the value of those from SSA countries. In that same year,  U.S. textile and apparel imports from Bangladesh were 3 times those from  all SSA countries combined.", "Moreover, U.S. imports of textile and apparel products from SSA are  predominantly apparel. As illustrated in table 1, apparel constitutes 98  percent of this type of U.S. import from AGOA beneficiaries, while yarn,  fabrics, and made-ups represent less than 2 percent of all U.S. textile and  apparel imports from SSA. By contrast, U.S. imports of these products  from all countries make up a larger part\u201423 percent\u2014of textile and  apparel trade. The modest share of U.S. imports of textile and apparel  inputs, including yarn and fabrics, from SSA countries reflects not only  limited production of these inputs in the region, but also the fact that an  integrated apparel and textile sector with potential to serve as an engine of  economic development is not available.", "Several studies and experts have pointed out that current trends in U.S.  textile and apparel markets are less conducive to African sourcing  because low-cost Asian producers (China, India, and Bangladesh) with  relatively modern production facilities have developed a competitive  advantage, challenging SSA textile and apparel in the United States and  elsewhere. Also, the U.S. market has experienced significant consolidation  in the retail sector resulting in lean retailing methods\u2014the combination of  low inventories and frequent restocking. Lean retailing requires retailers  to closely track their sales using electronic data to facilitate fast  communication with suppliers. From the standpoint of suppliers, the  method demands great flexibility, as they must be able to adjust output,  and ship and deliver products quickly. Less flexible suppliers that can only  compete on selling cost and not on timeliness are at a disadvantage. As a  result, aspects of the lean retailing method do not favor African suppliers  that have less advanced production technology that limits their flexibility  to meet changing demands.", "Duty-free access for textile and apparel imports from SSA countries under  AGOA reduces the competitive edge of low-cost Asian producers.   However, duty-free access alone may not overcome the advantages Asian  producers enjoy due to long-standing, established trade channels.  Africa\u2019s  lack of resources to significantly improve its trade infrastructure\u2014power,  water, production facilities, etc.\u2014adds to the disadvantages of sourcing  from SSA countries. Furthermore, underdeveloped production facilities,  including aged existing plants and equipment, increase the cost of  production while reducing quality and variety.  SSA\u2019s challenging business  climate, primary corruption and political instability, adds to the difficulty  of attracting new and increased investment.  Uncertainty about AGOA\u2019s  duration and preference erosion (a weakening in the effectiveness of  preferences due to falling prices in the world market caused by general  trade liberalization) also limit the attractiveness of beneficiary countries  for foreign and domestic investors.", "The ITC study on the competitiveness of apparel and textile inputs  identified products that have the potential to be produced competitively in  SSA countries, such as cotton yarn, cotton knit fabric, cotton denim fabric,  and woven cotton shirting. Cotton is widely cultivated in the region, and is  the primary fiber currently used in the production of yarn and fabric in  SSA countries. These products can either be directly exported or used in  downstream production of apparel for export. Other items cited for  potential competitive production in the region were niche products that  supply narrow markets such as organic cotton products, woven wool  fabric, high-tech and industrial fabrics and local print fabrics. As the global  demand for organic and environmentally friendly goods increases, organic  cotton products, for example, might be competitive in the global  marketplace. Woven wool fabrics and high-tech and industrial fabrics,  which South Africa currently supplies to the United States and Europe,  also have the potential to be more competitive in these markets. Africa has  a long tradition in mostly hand-loomed local print fabrics. Although these  fabrics are mainly produced for local markets, they may have potential  export markets as home furnishings. Another promising dimension is  production for Africa\u2019s own local and regional markets. Many African  countries produce fabrics that reportedly are not of sufficient quality for  U.S. and European markets. However, local and regional marketing of  such items may be profitable and may encourage backward and forward  supply chain linkages in the long run. As a whole, the competitive  production of textile and apparel inputs in SSA countries varies, as each  beneficiary has its own factors that contribute to or inhibit production.  The ITC report notes that one of the biggest challenges affecting  production of textile and apparel inputs in SSA countries is the lack of  regional demand for these products."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Expert Panel\u2019s Options for Congressional Consideration of Possible Changes to AGOA or Other Trade Preference Programs", "paragraphs": ["Based on our review of the ITC study and other related research, and in  consultation with trade and industry experts, we identified four issue  areas where possible changes to AGOA or other U.S. trade preference  programs could be made to improve the competitiveness of the textile and  apparel inputs sector in SSA beneficiary countries. The four issue areas  include (1) extending the duration of AGOA provisions and making AGOA  permanent, (2) expanding AGOA LDC benefits to all beneficiaries and  duty-free eligibility for other textile products, (3) creating non-punitive  and voluntary incentives, and (4) preserving existing benefits under AGOA  and modifying other preference programs and trade agreements. The  panel of experts GAO convened discussed and ranked nine specific  options for congressional consideration in each area. Panelists ranked  each option on a 7-point priority scale that ran from \u201cextremely low  priority\u201d to \u201cextremely high priority.\u201d Among the specific options, the  panel ranked extending the duration of the third-country fabric provision  for LDCs beyond 2012 and extending the duration of AGOA beyond 2015  as being an extremely high and very high priority, respectively, for  congressional consideration.

According to the ITC report,  textile and apparel firms in SSA have difficulty securing much-needed  capital to cover operating expenses and finance costly infrastructure  improvements. Without adequate investment, SSA countries are unable to  capitalize on AGOA benefits. Exacerbating the situation, much foreign  direct investment fled SSA after the 2004 removal of global textile and  apparel import quotas.", "Panelists expressed the opinion that extending AGOA would encourage  investment in Africa. According to previous GAO analysis, a surge in trade  is typical upon implementation and renewal of trade preference programs.  One panelist highlighted the idea that extending AGOA would enhance  predictability for investment in the \u201cmissing middle\u201d of the supply chain,  enabling raw materials produced in Africa, such as cotton, to be used in  local fabric and other inputs production. However, some panelists noted  that there are currently other trade policy measures being developed with  non-SSA regions and countries that compete with SSA. They argued that  priority must be given to extending AGOA relative to other trade programs  because of SSA\u2019s competitive disadvantage and to prevent preference  erosion. The options to extend AGOA and its special provisions thus  garnered considerable support from the panel of experts and emerged as  very high and extremely high priorities, respectively.", "The option to make AGOA permanent arose in response to concern from  investors and trade experts that a limited extension is inadequate to  ensure long-term sustainability. Although this option would make AGOA  program benefits permanent, each country would have to maintain its  eligibility. There are currently many free trade agreements that offer duty- free benefits on a continuing basis, a significant change from when  AGOA was first implemented. As a result, one panelist emphasized that  AGOA needs more predictability for beneficiaries to compete with  countries and regions with which the United States has free trade  agreements. However, other expert testimony and previous GAO analysis  raised concerns about the trade-off between investment predictability and  the ability to leverage trade liberalization in developing countries, a  cornerstone of broader global trade policy. One panelist observed that  permanence could potentially provide a disincentive to implementing  other internal changes in countries\u2019 economies that might allow them to  become more competitive. Furthermore, AGOA permanence would not be  sufficient to overcome the fact that the overall structure of the global  textile and apparel trade has shifted, consolidating benefits enjoyed by  Southeast Asian producers. As a result of these critiques, the option to  make AGOA permanent received slightly less support than the options  extending its duration and was assigned a generally high priority by  panelists."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Issues Related to Expanding AGOA LDC Benefits to All Beneficiaries and to Improving Use of AGOA", "paragraphs": ["The options considered under this issue area were to:    Expand third-country fabric provision to Sou th Africa to improve regional  tegration in the textile and apparel sector.", "Expand AGOA LDC benefits to all AGOA ben tegration in the textile and apparel sector.", "Options to expand the scope of AGOA benefits to other SSA countries,  especially to South Africa, are intended to encourage regional integration by fostering trade between African countries, and to broaden the use of AGOA. One African country official noted that the regional benefits of  AGOA cannot be measured solely by U.S. import numbers. Countries many benefits through increased regional sourcing and integration.  Despite the fact that the textile sector is one of the most regionally  integrated, South Africa is not included in the rules of origin provision that  allows use of third-country fabric in qualifying duty-free exports. Industry  sources identified in the ITC report suggest that broadening third-country fabric benefits to South Africa would \u201clead to greater economies of sc ale  and expansion in the apparel industry\u201d by supporting backward and  forward integration and development in the textile sector. A South Afric embassy representative called for such an extension by explaining that  despite South Africa\u2019s non-LDC classification, some economic sectors are  characterized by low levels of development. According to the ITC re \u201cindustry sources stress that duty-free eligibility in the U.S. and EU  markets for South African textiles could make a substantial contributio to the industry\u2019s competitiveness and that the downward trend in the industry might be reversed if rules of origin were amended to allow  greater access to third-country fabrics for South African apparel n  exporters.\u201d As another example of an attempt to boost industry  competitiveness, the ITC report cites South Africa\u2019s creation of \u201cindustry  clusters consisting of firms from the textile, clothing, retail, and other  sectors that work cooperatively\u201d to offer world class manufacturing. ITC  officials, however, stated that this approach would be difficult to pu rsue  elsewhere in SSA due to inadequate infrastructure.

The  ITC report cited one industry source as suggesting an \u201cearned import  allowance program,\u201d similar to those in place for Haiti and the Dominican  Republic, as a possible approach to creating non-punitive incentives to  encourage use of regional inputs. Such an incentive program would allow  apparel producers to earn the right to use third-country fabric, provided  they use specified volumes of regional fabric. Some panelists, however,  pointed out that this program is intended to facilitate the exchange of U.S.  content in a specific bilateral relationship, which is not entirely relevant to  AGOA.

Panelists suggested an option for simplifying rules of origin  provisions in AGOA to grant duty-free access for partially assembled  garments that are jointly produced in other countries that are U.S. free  trade partners or benefit from U.S. trade preferences. For example, a  consultant doing business with companies producing in AGOA countries  explained that one of his clients had expressed interest in assembling high- value shirts in one AGOA beneficiary with collars and cuffs produced in a  non-AGOA country, but was unable to because of rules of origin  restrictions. According to ITC officials and the Harmonized Tariff  Schedule, such partial assembly of garments is currently allowed under  AGOA, but confusion persists among SSA manufacturers and outside  experts. Furthermore, one expert expressed concern that placing an  increased emphasis on partially assembled garments might relegate SSA  manufacturers to lower value-added production. The ITC study also refers  to African government and industry sources\u2019 recommendations for  changing the rules of origin under non-AGOA trade preference programs  and free trade agreements to allow apparel made with SSA fabric to  qualify for duty-free treatment in the United States.

There is general  agreement among experts we consulted, the ITC study, and other  literature we reviewed that inadequate infrastructure is one of the main  obstacles to doing business in Africa and one of the factors that most  affects the competitiveness of production of textile and apparel inputs in  SSA. Production of textile and apparel inputs is particularly affected by  the lack of reliable power supplies, lack of abundant clean water, and poor  transportation infrastructure. The ITC study reports that many SSA  countries have among the highest cost rates and the most unreliable  supply of electrical power in the world. According to the study,  disruptions in electricity supply reduce productivity and add to cost. For  example, a disruption in power supplies can ruin an entire production run  in yarn and fabric mills, and increase cost do to the use of back-up  generators. ITC also reported that the lack of an abundant supply of clean  water in many SSA countries affects the production of textile and apparel  inputs. Dyeing fabrics requires the use of clean water, which is  contaminated in the process. Wastewater treatment capabilities are thus  necessary to meet environmental compliance standards required in the  international market. The ITC study and other reports indicate that poor  transportation infrastructure is a major constraint to trade in SSA  countries. Textile and apparel production is particularly affected in the  region because poor transportation infrastructure inhibits the ability of  producers to meet tight delivery schedules demanded by retailers. Delays  in regional and international trade are caused by poor roads, railways, and  ports.", "Recognizing the challenges that poor infrastructure places on trade and  the textile and apparel sector in SSA countries, the panel discussed how  U.S. assistance for infrastructure is supplied to the region and provided  options that could improve its implementation.

In the same context, a panelist  representing textile and apparel producers in Africa indicated that for  infrastructure development to have an impact in making the textile, apparel, and other industries more competitive, infrastructure projects  must result in a reduction in the cost of doing business in SSA. Several  f  panelists mentioned the need to establish metrics to measure benefits o U.S.-sponsored infrastructure projects. Panelists also discussed the need  to take a regional approach for infrastructure development in Africa;  indicated that the bilateral approach that MCC takes in developing  compacts limits the impact infrastructure projects can have. For example,  one panelist said that the best way Kenya can reduce the cost of electrici tric  is to invest in Ethiopia because Ethiopia has the greatest hydroelec power potential in East Africa. Thus, Kenyan investment in a hydroelec project in neighboring Ethiopia would benefit Kenyan consumers of  electricity down the line because they would have greater access to  cheaper electricity. A panelist from the private sector said that there n to be incentives created for the private sector to invest in infrastructu and that companies must see infrastructure projects in Africa as a  business oppor sector interest in developing energy facilities in Ethiopia; however, there is  a investment.

Funding would need to be prov ided  separately through the appropriations process. A contractor who manag the West and Southern African trade hubs explained that there is no  funding earmarked for assistance to the textile and apparel inputs  industry, which makes it very difficult to implement targeted technical  assistance projects. Rather, TCB assistance for the textile and apparel  inputs sector comes out of limited discretionary assistance funding. Th contractor estimated that less than $1 million was spent by the two trade  hubs on providing assistance to the textile and apparel industry in 2008.  Nevertheless, according to the ITC study, textile and apparel industry  representatives said that TCB provided by USAID trade hubs has advance regional and international market opportunities. TCB assistance provided to the textile and apparel industry includes projects such as business-to - business events to foster trade linkages between the textile and appar el  producers throughout Africa and a cross-section of the apparel industry  doing business in the region.

It noted that  U.S.-government sponsored financing entities, such as OPIC and the Ex-Im  Bank, have typically been reluctant to participate in African textile  production because doing so could be politically controversial. For  example, OPIC officials stated that OPIC\u2019s ability to provide guarantees f U.S. investors is limited by its screening criteria, which rules out projec that could have a negative effect on U.S. employment. The Ex-Im Bank\u2019s  statutory focus is on promoting U.S. exports by supporting U.S. export or those who are importing/purchasing U.S.-made products, such as textile  machinery.

Similarly, although  limiting certain trade preference benefits to LDCs makes sense, expert argued that enhancing the competitiveness of SSA textile and apparel  inputs production necessitates regional integration; thus, extending  benefits to more advanced economies such as South Africa may be  appropriate. Furthermore, the link between trade policy and economic  development complicates potential policy responses.
