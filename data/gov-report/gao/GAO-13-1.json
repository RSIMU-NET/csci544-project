GAO was requested to provide information on BOP's costs and oversight of inmate mental health services. This report addresses: (1) BOP's costs to provide these services; (2) the extent to which BOP assesses whether its institutions comply with BOP policies for providing services; and (3) the extent to which BOP tracks the costs of providing mental health services to inmates in contract facilities, and assesses compliance with contract requirements.", "GAO analyzed obligated funds for fiscal years 2008 through 2012 for the two BOP divisions responsible for mental health services at BOP institutions, examined the most recent review reports for a random sample of 47 BOP institutions and all 15 contract facilities, examined BOP's policies, and interviewed BOP officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["During a 5-year period--fiscal years 2008 through 2012--costs for inmate mental health services in institutions run by the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) rose in absolute dollar amount, as well as on an annual per capita basis. Specifically, mental health services costs rose from $123 million in fiscal year 2008 to $146 million in fiscal year 2012, with increases generally due to three factors--inmate population increases, general inflationary increases, and increased participation rates in psychology treatment programs such as drug abuse treatment programs. Additionally, the per capita cost rose from $741 in fiscal year 2008 to $821 in fiscal year 2012. It is projected that these costs will continue to increase with an estimated per capita cost of $876 in fiscal year 2015, due, in part, to increased program funding and inflation.", "BOP conducts various internal reviews that assess institutions' compliance with its policies related to mental health services, and it also requires institutions to obtain external accreditations. BOP's internal program reviews are on-site audits of a specific program, including two that are relevant to mental health services--psychology and health services. Most institutions in GAO's sample received good or superior ratings on their psychology and health services program reviews, but these reviews did not always occur within BOP-established time frames, generally due to lack of staff availability. When reviews were postponed, delays could be lengthy, sometimes exceeding a year, even for those institutions with the lowest ratings in previous reviews. Moreover, BOP has not evaluated whether most of its psychology treatment programs are meeting their established goals and has not developed a plan to do so. BOP is developing an approach for reporting on the relative reduction in recidivism associated with major inmate programs, which may include some psychology treatment programs. Using this opportunity to develop a plan for evaluating its psychology treatment programs would help ensure that the necessary evaluation activities, as well as any needed program changes, are completed in a timely manner. Further, BOP's program statements--its formal policies--related to mental health services contain outdated information. Policy changes are instead communicated to staff through memos. By periodically updating its program statements, BOP would be better assured that staff have a consistent understanding of its policies, and that these policies reflect current mental health care practices.", "BOP collects information on the daily cost to house the 13 percent of federal inmates in contract facilities, but it does not track the specific contractor costs of providing mental health services. The performance-based, fixed-price contracts that govern the operation of BOP's contract facilities give flexibility to the contractors to decide how to provide mental health services and do not require that they report their costs for doing so to BOP. BOP uses several methods to assess the contractors' compliance with contract requirements and standards of care. BOP conducts on-site reviews to assess the services provided to inmates in contract facilities, including those for mental health. BOP uses results from these reviews, as well as reports from external accrediting organizations, the presence of on-site monitors, and internal reviews conducted by the contract facility, to assess contractor compliance and to ensure that the contractor is consistently assessing the quality of its operations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that BOP (1) take steps to prioritize the completion of postponed program reviews, (2) develop a plan to evaluate treatment programs, and (3) develop and implement updated program statements.

BOP established its internal program  review process to assess each BOP-operated institution\u2019s compliance  with applicable regulations and policies, the adequacy of their internal  controls, and the effectiveness, efficiency, and quality of their programs  and operations. BOP\u2019s Program Review Division, one of its eight  operating divisions, leads the process. BOP policy states that each  program or operation at each BOP institution, such as psychology  services and health services\u2014but also, for example, food services and  religious services\u2014is to be reviewed on at least a 3-year basis, but  potentially more often depending on the institution\u2019s prior review results.  During each review, a team of reviewers with specialized experience  visits the institution to assess the institution\u2019s programs based on a set of  Program Review Guidelines (PRG). The PRGs provide a framework for  the reviewers to test the institution\u2019s compliance with policies and  procedures, as articulated through program statements. In particular,  program reviews for psychology and health services involve assessments  of individual inmate case files, observations of treatment programs,  reviews of an institution\u2019s policies and procedures, interviews with staff,  and interviews with a small number of inmates. Following a visit to an  institution, the Program Review Division issues a report noting  deficiencies and findings. BOP defines deficiencies to include deviations  from policy or regulation, weaknesses in internal controls, or lack of  quality controls.

BOP\u2019s PRGs related to  mental health services are developed jointly by either its Psychology  Services Branch or its Health Services Division, as appropriate, and its  Program Review Division. All of the steps in the PRGs link to specific  BOP policies. For example, a psychology services PRG step that requires  reviewers to look at a sample of intake screening interviews is based on  the agency\u2019s policy that new inmates must receive an intake screening  interview within 14 days of arrival, and that inmates\u2019 identified treatment  needs receive appropriate follow-up.

The most common deficiencies cited in the  psychology services program review reports related to the care provided  in residential treatment programs, and a variety of issues related to  suicide risk assessments, suicide watch logs, and follow-up care after a  suicide watch. Examples of the deficiencies BOP reviewers found in  psychology services and health services program reviews, as well as  examples of corrective action steps to address them, are included in  appendix VI.", "We found BOP was not always in compliance with the time frames stated  in its policies for when program reviews should occur. About 65 percent of  the psychology services program reviews that we examined were not  conducted within the time frame stated in BOP policy, including about 23 percent that were more than 6 months late, based on the institution\u2019s  prior ratings.

For example, one program review for an institution that  had received an acceptable rating was delayed by 16 months, in part  because one reviewer did not complete the required training in time to  conduct the program review. Program Review officials told us that  institutions can also request to postpone a review when, for example, a  key staff position is vacant, such as the clinical director of the institution\u2019s  health services unit. According to Program Review officials, when an  institution requests a program review postponement, the Program Review  Division considers the results of the institution\u2019s annual operational  reviews to help determine whether it would be prudent to adjust the  institution\u2019s review schedule. Additionally, the Assistant Director for the  Program Review Division approves any deviation in schedule.", "Although it is important that BOP officials review and approve  postponements of program reviews, when reviews are postponed the  delays can be lengthy, even for institutions with the lowest ratings. For  example, BOP officials told us that to reduce travel costs, they delayed  the review of an institution rated acceptable by 14 months to combine its  review with that of another nearby institution\u2019s review. Of the 11  institutions in our sample with an acceptable rating in their prior  psychology services program review, 4 received their next review more  than 6 months late and 3 of those were more than a year late. In contrast,  among the 36 institutions with a prior rating of good or superior, 7 had  their next review more than 6 months late, including 2 more than a year  late. Because institutions with an acceptable rating are to be reviewed  within 24 months\u2014compared to 36 months for facilities with higher  ratings\u2014a 1-year delay is potentially more problematic . According to A  Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge, which provides  standards for project managers, agencies should place the highest  priority on oversight of facilities, programs, or operations that are most at  risk of not meeting key performance objectives; in BOP\u2019s case this would  be institutions with the lowest ratings. Therefore, when scheduling  postponed reviews, proper risk management would call for BOP to give  highest priority to those institutions with the lowest ratings. Because  delays in program reviews may hamper BOP\u2019s ability to adequately  monitor inmate care, it is important for BOP to minimize delays, especially  for the lowest-rated institutions. Furthermore, with BOP\u2019s inmate  population expected to increase through 2020,important for BOP to ensure that it conducts timely program reviews to  identify potential problems with access to care or compliance with its  treatment policies that growing institutional crowding might exacerbate.   it will be even more  Program Review Division officials take steps to share information learned  from program reviews with other relevant BOP officials.

BOP requires the contract facility to prepare a corrective  action plan within 30 days and submit it to the on-site monitors and BOP  Privatization Management Branch. BOP\u2019s on-site staff review the  corrective action plan, and if they accept the plan, they oversee its  implementation to ensure that the facility is taking action and that the  actions appropriately address the deficiency. Our conversations with the  on-site monitors indicated that this oversight is taking place at the  locations we visited. Our analysis found that of the 100 CFM reviews  conducted from 2008 through 2012 that required a contract facility to  submit a corrective action plan, 16 were not submitted within the 30 days.

According to BOP officials,  establishing a 24-month window for contract facilities to receive  accreditation is appropriate because this is consistent with the  requirements for BOP facilities. Once a contract facility is accredited, both  ACA and The Joint Commission evaluate it once every 3 years to  substantiate continued accreditation. As of April 2013, 13 of the 15 BOP  contract facilities have received ACA and Joint Commission  accreditations.

The on- site staff review the plan and verify that the corrective actions have been  implemented.

The facility  that was found not compliant with all of ACA\u2019s mental health-related  standards was as a result of the facility\u2019s failure to develop and utilize a  health care staffing plan and the reviewers\u2019 related concerns about the  mental health staffing levels at the facility. Our review of the most recent  Joint Commission accreditation reports found that 6 of the 13 contract  facilities were fully in compliance with the ambulatory care standards we  determined were related to mental health services\u2014a small subset of the  192 standards by which they are assessed. The Joint Commission found  the remaining 7 facilities to be either partially or insufficiently compliant  with these standards. The areas related to mental health in ambulatory  care accreditation standards that were most frequently cited include  medication management, such as medication labeling and storage  issues, and the lack of documentation of the competency of medical staff,  including mental health staff. In addition to the ambulatory care  accreditation that contract facilities are required to obtain, 1 of the 7  facilities specifically chose to also be accredited on behavioral health  standards, and that facility was found to be insufficiently compliant with 3  of those standards. These compliance issues related to: inmate  assessments not including information on addictions other than alcohol or  drugs; inmate treatment plans not including goals and metrics to measure  an inmate\u2019s progress; and the lack of documentation of an assessment of  clinical competence for staff being hired. For more information on the  specific ambulatory care and behavioral health standards for which the  contract facilities were not in compliance, see appendix VI.", "In addition to accreditation and its own reviews, BOP conducts oversight  of contract facilities by requiring them to conduct routine internal  assessments of their operations. BOP requires contractors to develop a  Quality Control Plan, which serves as the basis for these internal reviews,  and to share the results of their reviews with the BOP on-site monitors,  who verify in their monthly reviews that the internal reviews have  occurred. According to officials from the contractors that manage 14 of  BOP\u2019s 15 contract facilities, when they develop their Quality Control  Plans, they generally use BOP policies and accreditation standards as a  resource to ensure that the company\u2019s policies either meet or exceed  BOP\u2019s own standards. For example, one contractor noted that it requires  inmates who have just completed suicide watches to be seen by a mental  health provider daily for the first 5 days, weekly for the next 2 months, and  then monthly thereafter. This requirement is more specific than BOP\u2019s  own policies, which leave discretion to the chief psychologist to determine  how frequently an inmate needs to be seen by mental health staff.", "According to BOP officials, the contractors\u2019 Quality Control Plans are  much more detailed than BOP\u2019s Quality Assurance Plan because the  contractors are monitoring many more areas than BOP does in order to  ensure they are properly prepared for BOP\u2019s review. Our review of the  Quality Control Plans that we received from two of the three primary  contractors and the subcontractor we spoke with found that all of their  Quality Control Plans had mental health-related elements that were  aligned with those in BOP\u2019s Quality Assurance Plan, and two of the three  plans assessed additional areas beyond those established in BOP\u2019s plan.  For example, each of the Quality Control Plans contained steps to review  psychological assessments of inmates in the special housing units, which  are also included in BOP\u2019s plan.

Program reviews provide important insight into whether  these requirements are being met and inmates are being provided the  appropriate services. We found that BOP was frequently unable to  complete required monitoring within its own established time frames. To  its credit, BOP schedules program reviews with the intention that those  institutions with the lowest ratings are reviewed more frequently, and any  delays in reviews require approval by BOP officials. However, when  reviews are postponed, the delays can be lengthy\u2014sometimes over a  year\u2014even for those institutions with the lowest ratings. Because delays  in program reviews hamper BOP\u2019s ability to adequately monitor inmate  care, when scheduling postponed reviews BOP should take action to  minimize delays and give highest priority to those institutions with the  lowest ratings.", "BOP would have greater assurance that it is effectively using its  resources if it had better information on whether the programs were  meeting their intended objectives and if any program changes were  needed. While BOP has evaluated a few, but not all, of its psychology  treatment programs and is in the process of determining what information  to include in its statutorily required report related to recidivism, it would be  beneficial for BOP to develop a plan that identifies the resources  necessary and target time frames to carry out future evaluations  specifically related to psychology treatment programs, consistent with  standards for project management. With such a plan, BOP would have  greater assurance that the activities necessary to conduct the evaluations  of the psychology treatment programs, and any needed changes  identified through the evaluations, would be completed in a timely  manner.", "Finally, BOP has many outdated program statements related to mental  health services, including two which are more than 15 years old.

BOP policy states  that less formal documents, such as memos, should generally not be  used to communicate requirements or instructions, yet BOP is relying on  internal memos to implement some key policy changes. By updating and  implementing mental health care-related program statements, BOP would  better ensure that its policies reflect currently accepted treatment  practices and standards.

Because BOP does not report a comprehensive  mental health services cost, as costs are included in two BOP divisions  (the Health Services Division and the Correctional Programs Division), we  analyzed obligated funds for fiscal years 2008 through 2012 for these two  divisions. Specifically, within Health Services, we examined obligations  for psychiatry staff and for pharmaceuticals, including psychotropic  medication. Within Correctional Programs, we looked at the obligated  funds for Psychology Services, psychology staff training, drug abuse  treatment programs, and Sex Offender Management Programs. To  determine the per capita costs for the same time period, we divided the  total cost by the inmate population at the end of the fiscal year in all BOP- operated institutions. In addition, to project future costs, we discussed  with these same officials their methods for cost projections and  independently examined BOP\u2019s population projection and expected  staffing positions for fiscal years 2013 through 2015. We limited our  projections to 3 years, since the further into the future an estimate is, the  less reliable it becomes. Additionally, there could be future changes in law  or agency initiatives that may significantly impact the integrity of longer- term projections. To determine projected costs, we used the total cost of  inmate mental health services for fiscal year 2012 as the baseline, and  adjusted this by BOP\u2019s projected population and the IHS Global Insight  Outlook inflation factor. For the projected per capita costs, we divided the  projected cost by the projected population.

We assessed BOP\u2019s evaluation  planning against project management standards.", "To understand BOP\u2019s program review process, and the psychology and  health services findings from recent program reviews, we conducted  additional site visits to two institutions for the purpose of shadowing  program review staff as they performed a psychology services program  review. We chose the two institutions because they provided different  levels of care\u2014one institution was a mental health care level 4 and  another was a mental health care level 1\u2014and because the program  reviews were being conducted within the time frame of our study. While  the observations from these visits are not generalizable to all BOP  institutions or to all program reviews, the visits provided important insights  into the program review process.", "In addition, we conducted a content analysis of recent psychology and  health services program review reports. To conduct the content analyses,  we selected a simple random sample of 47 BOP institutions from the  study population of 94 BOP institutions that had been operating long  enough to undergo a program review as of August 31, 2012. Because  we followed a probability procedure based on random selections, our  sample is only one of a large number of samples that we might have  drawn. Since each sample could have provided different estimates, we  express our confidence in the precision of our particular sample\u2019s results  as a 95 percent confidence interval (e.g., plus or minus 7 percentage  points). This is the interval that would contain the actual population value  for 95 percent of the samples we could have drawn. Due to the small size  of the population, we used a hypergeometric distribution to estimate the  95 percent confidence intervals for our sample estimates.", "For each of the 47 institutions included in our sample, we received from  BOP the most recent psychology and health services program review  reports. In order to minimize the chance of nonsampling errors occurring  in our file review, we took the following steps. A GAO analyst first  reviewed each psychology and health services program review report to  capture the dates of each review to determine the timeliness of the review  in relation to the previous review, and the deficiencies identified in the  final program review report. BOP defines deficiencies as deviations from  policy or regulation, weaknesses in internal controls, or lack of quality  controls. A separate GAO analyst verified each of the data elements  collected. Our content analysis captured all deficiencies cited in  psychology services reviews and deficiencies related to pharmacy and  psychiatry in health services reviews. A GAO analyst independently  created categories for the psychology and health services deficiencies  and then sorted the deficiencies into the applicable categories. A  separate GAO analyst verified the categorization of the psychology and  health services deficiencies. For psychology services program review  reports, we also received and reviewed additional documentation from  BOP including (1) institutional responses to the program review\u2019s findings  (which include a corrective action plan to address any identified  deficiencies), (2) the Program Review Division\u2019s acceptance of the  institution\u2019s submitted corrective actions, (3) the institution\u2019s submission of  results from a follow-up audit conducted by institution staff to ensure that  deficiencies were resolved, and (4) the Program Review Division\u2019s  closure of the program review. According to this additional  documentation, we determined whether institutions were submitting their  corrective action plans and follow-up audit results in accordance with  BOP policy. We also reported illustrative examples of deficiencies and the  corrective action plans that institutions developed to address deficiencies.  We did not review this additional documentation from the health services  program review reports because most of the deficiencies cited in the  reports were unrelated to inmate mental health care.", "To understand the accreditation process for BOP institutions, we  interviewed officials and reviewed standards from the American  Correctional Association (ACA) and The Joint Commission, the two  accrediting organizations for BOP institutions. We also interviewed an  official from the National Commission on Correctional Health Care,  another organization that accredits correctional health care programs, to  understand differences in standards among the three accrediting  organizations. We conducted a content analysis of the most recent  ambulatory care accreditation reports from ACA and The Joint  Commission for the same random sample of institutions that we used for  the analysis of program reviews. We reviewed 37 Joint Commission  ambulatory care accreditation reports.care accreditation reports, we focused on findings related to psychiatry  and pharmacy care, as these were the areas covered by the review most  applicable to inmate mental health care. The Joint Commission\u2019s  accreditation is for those services provided by the institution\u2019s health  services unit and does not include psychology services. Because of the  level of detail presented in the reports, findings related to pharmacy care  are not specific to the administration of psychotropic drugs. We also  reviewed the findings from The Joint Commission\u2019s behavioral health  accreditation reports for the four BOP institutions with behavioral health  accreditations.", "For our review of the ambulatory  We interviewed officials from the union representing BOP correctional  workers who are involved in contract negotiations to gain an  understanding of the negotiation process required to institute changes to  mental health-related policies. Finally, to obtain context about correctional  mental health programs, we interviewed correctional mental health  experts, including representatives from the American Psychological  Association, academics, and practitioners who have worked in the  correctional setting. While the views of these experts are not  representative of all correctional mental health experts, they provided us  with perspectives on BOP\u2019s inmate mental health care system.", "To address the question about the extent to which BOP tracks the costs  of providing mental health services to BOP inmates in contract facilities,  and the extent to which BOP assesses whether these facilities meet  contract requirements and established accreditation standards for inmate  mental health services, we reviewed the contracts for all of the 15  contract facilities that housed BOP inmates during the course of our  review to see what cost information they included. We also reviewed  federal guidance from the Office of Management and Budget on  recommended contracting mechanisms for federal agencies. We spoke  with BOP officials responsible for procurement and the contracting  process as well as each of the three primary contractors that operate 14  of BOP\u2019s 15 contract facilities, and one of the subcontractors that  provides mental health services for one of the primary contractors to  discuss the extent to which they track the costs of providing mental health  services to inmates in contract facilities. One primary contractor that  managed 1 of BOP\u2019s 15 contract facilities declined to participate in  interviews because the contract was terminated as of May 31, 2013.", "To understand BOP\u2019s requirements for the provision of mental health  services and oversight activities for the contract facilities, we reviewed  each contract for the 15 contract facilities. We also reviewed BOP\u2019s  Quality Assurance Plan, the contractors\u2019 Quality Control Plans, and the  ACA and Joint Commission accreditation standards to identify the policies  and procedures related to mental health that guide the various reviews of  contract facility operations. We also reviewed the most recent contract  facility monitoring reports, and ACA and Joint Commission accreditation  review reports to determine the deficiencies identified that may be related  to mental health. We also met with officials from BOP\u2019s Administration  Division, Privatization Management Branch, and Program Review  Division who are responsible for overseeing contracts to understand each  unit\u2019s oversight activities, how the units communicate with each other and  with contract facility staff, and how BOP contracts are structured. In  addition, we spoke with officials from ACA and The Joint Commission to  understand their accreditation standards and oversight activities. We also  interviewed officials from each of the three primary contractors that  operate 14 of BOP\u2019s 15 contract facilities as discussed above, as well as  one subcontractor that provides mental health services for one of the  primary contractors, to discuss the types of mental health services  provided and internal and external oversight mechanisms for contract  facility operations. In addition, we conducted site visits to two contract  facility, one to observe the Contract Facility Monitoring (CFM) review  process, and another to observe operations. We chose the first facility  because the review was being conducted at the facility during the time  frame of our study. We chose the second because it was a fairly new  contract, which would provide a comparison to the first facility with a more  established contract. While the selection of these two contract facilities  does not facilitate generalizations, our observations and conversations  with staff provided important context on the operations of privately  operated prisons.", "To understand the deficiencies BOP identified in its contract facility  monitoring reports that may be related to mental health, we performed a  content analysis of all of the most recent reports from BOP\u2019s 15 contract  facilities\u2019 monitoring reviews to determine the most frequent findings  related to mental health. For our analysis, we determined that a  deficiency may be related to mental health if it is related to pharmacy,  psychiatry, or psychology services within the contract facility. We also  reported illustrative examples of deficiencies. Similarly, for each of the 15  contract facilities, we analyzed the most recent accreditation reports from  the ACA and Joint Commission reviews to determine the most prevalent  findings related to mental health services.", "To understand the types of mental health services that are being  assessed and the extent to which BOP\u2019s review differs from the contract  facility\u2019s internal reviews, we obtained the Quality Control Plan from the  subcontractor and two of the primary contractors and compared these  plans with BOP\u2019s Quality Assurance Plan, which is used to guide the  contract facility monitoring process.
