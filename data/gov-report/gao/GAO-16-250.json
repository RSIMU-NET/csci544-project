SSA first prioritizes CDRs required by law or agency policy such as those for children under 1 year old who are receiving benefits due in part to low birth weight. Then SSA uses statistical models to identify the remaining CDRs to be conducted each year. The models also determine which cases will receive an in-depth review of medical records by the Disability Determination Services\u2014the state agencies that conduct CDRs\u2014versus a lower-cost questionnaire sent directly to the beneficiary. As shown in the figure below, a growing number of cases have been set aside for future review (backlogged) over the last 10 years. Although SSA somewhat considers potential cost savings when selecting cases for in-depth reviews, its approach does not maximize potential savings for the government. For example, estimated average savings from conducting CDRs are higher for some groups of Disability Insurance (DI) beneficiaries than others, but SSA's selection process does not differentiate among these groups. As a result, it may be missing opportunities to efficiently and effectively use federal resources.", "SSA reviews a sample of CDRs for quality, but its analysis and reporting of errors is not comprehensive. Specifically, SSA randomly selects CDR decisions to check for a variety of potential errors. For example, SSA regularly monitors and reports on the frequency of errors that affect whether benefits are continued or ceased. However, contrary to federal internal control standards, SSA does not systematically analyze errors to detect and address root causes. Consequently, SSA lacks information that could help improve the quality of the reviews conducted by the Disability Determination Services. Further, in determining CDR accuracy rates, SSA does not count date errors, including incorrect cessation dates, which can affect disability benefit payments. As a result, decision makers do not have a complete picture of the CDR errors that affect disability payments."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends SSA, among other things, further consider cost savings as part of its prioritization of CDRs, analyze the root causes of CDRs with errors, and track date errors.

Specifically, we examined the statistical models SSA uses to help  prioritize CDRs, and interviewed SSA officials about these practices. To  evaluate the extent to which SSA reviews the quality of CDR decisions,  we reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and program policies and  analyzed SSA\u2019s monthly CDR accuracy data by state for June 2013  through April 2015. We also interviewed SSA officials and reviewed  documentation about how SSA conducts CDR quality reviews and uses  the results of these reviews to prevent errors. To evaluate SSA\u2019s  approach to calculating cost savings from CDRs, we interviewed SSA  actuaries and other officials about their process for estimating cost  savings and reviewed their documentation and models.

At the time beneficiaries enter the DI or SSI  programs or continue their benefits following a CDR, a DDS examiner  determines beneficiaries\u2019 due dates for a subsequent CDR based on their  potential for medical improvement. Beneficiaries classified as \u201cmedical  improvement expected\u201d are generally scheduled for a CDR within 6 to 18  months, beneficiaries classified as \u201cmedical improvement possible\u201d are  scheduled once every 3 years, and beneficiaries classified as \u201cmedical  improvement not expected\u201d are scheduled once every 5 to 7 years.", "To cost-effectively manage its CDR workload, SSA conducts CDRs in  different ways. In general, beneficiaries with a high likelihood of medical  improvement are referred for a full medical review\u2014an in-depth  assessment of a beneficiary\u2019s medical and vocational status.  Beneficiaries with a low likelihood of medical improvement are, at least  initially, sent a questionnaire known as a mailer. If beneficiaries respond  to a mailer in certain ways, SSA may refer these individuals for a full  medical review. In contrast to mailers, full medical reviews are more labor  intensive and expensive. Full medical reviews result in a decision to  either cease or continue an individual\u2019s benefits. In fiscal year 2013, the  cessation rate for CDRs involving full medical reviews was about 19  percent, whereas the cessation rate for all CDRs including mailers was  about 5 percent. Each year, SSA allocates a portion of its program  integrity budget to CDRs, which affects the number of full medical reviews  and mailers that the agency initiates during the year. When the number of  cases due for a CDR exceeds SSA\u2019s capacity to conduct full medical  reviews and mailers, the cases not initiated during the year are  considered backlogged for future review.", "The number of CDRs completed as full medical reviews, as mailers only,  or backlogged varied during fiscal years 2003 through 2013 (see fig. 1).  After the authority for special funding to process CDRs expired in fiscal  year 2002, backlogged CDRs increased from about 100,000 cases in  fiscal year 2003 to more than 1 million in fiscal year 2007, reaching a  peak of nearly 1.5 million in fiscal year 2009. At the same time, the  number of full medical reviews fell from nearly 670,000 in fiscal year 2003  to less than 190,000 in fiscal year 2007 before rebounding to nearly  429,000 in fiscal year 2013.", "SSA estimates the accuracy rate of CDRs and separately estimates the  cost savings that result from CDRs. In addition to annually reporting the  nationwide accuracy rate of all CDRs to the Congress, SSA internally  tracks CDR accuracy rates by state and generates estimates for the  accuracy of cessations and continuances, separately as well as  combined. For fiscal year 2013, SSA reported an accuracy rate of 97.2  percent for CDR decisions. For the same year, SSA reported an  estimated ratio of federal program savings to costs for performing CDRs  as $15 to $1.

To begin, SSA initiates full  medical reviews of cases that fall into two high-priority categories: first,  statutory requirements, and then SSA policies. Once full medical reviews  of all high-priority cases are initiated, SSA prioritizes the remaining cases  by using its statistical models. Full medical reviews of cases with the  highest scores (i.e., highest likelihood of medical improvement) are  initiated as resources permit, first by beneficiary group (i.e., DI, SSI  children, SSI adults) and then by the statistical scores of cases within the  group (see fig. 2). Cases with lower scores (i.e., lower likelihood of  medical improvement) receive a mailer or are backlogged for future  review.", "The extent to which the statistical models have been used to select cases  for full medical reviews has varied by year, but the models have been  consistently used for determining who receives mailers. Specifically, we  found that the extent to which SSA\u2019s statistical models were used to  select cases for full medical review was related to the combination of  budget fluctuations for CDRs, SSA\u2019s statutory requirements, and agency  policies. We estimate that the statistical models were the basis for  selecting 11 to 60 percent of full medical reviews completed annually in  fiscal years 2003 through 2013 (see fig. 3). In contrast, SSA has used the  models consistently since 1993 to determine which cases should receive  a mailer."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SSA Tests the Accuracy of Its Models but Has Not Updated Them to Reflect Changing Conditions in Recent Years", "paragraphs": ["Although SSA annually assesses its models\u2019 performance, the agency  has not updated the models since 2007. The models\u2019 effectiveness  depends on their ability to accurately predict beneficiaries\u2019 likelihood of  medical improvement. To test the accuracy of the models, SSA conducts  an annual validation process using a sample of completed cases to  evaluate how well the models predicted medical improvement.  According to SSA officials, the model validation process has shown that  the models\u2019 accuracy in predicting medical improvement has not  degraded substantially in recent years.", "In addition to model validation, in the past SSA has conducted periodic  re-estimation of its statistical models to help ensure that they are up-to- date. In re-estimating its models, SSA updates the relationship between  existing variables and medical improvement and tests whether new  variables should be included. Re-estimation is particularly important when  advances in medicine and assistive technology affect people\u2019s ability to  work. In recent years, SSA has changed its classification of certain  beneficiaries\u2019 impairments to reflect advances in medical knowledge. For  example, in 2015, SSA revised its codes for cancer in light of new  diagnoses and treatments. Because these codes can appear as variables  in the statistical models, it is possible that the models are no longer  accurately capturing the effect of cancer-related impairments on the  likelihood of medical improvement. Although SSA officials believe that  some advances would not markedly affect the accuracy of the models,  the agency has not completed a re-estimation to confirm the effect of  such changes. In addition, demographic changes in the underlying  population of disability beneficiaries, which has grown substantially in  recent years due in part to baby boomers reaching their disability-prone  years, could also affect the accuracy of the models. The contractor that  SSA hired to handle its last model re-estimation in 2007 provided SSA  with a set of programs that would allow the agency to re-estimate the  models in-house. Regular re-estimation and updating of predictive models  is a best practice, and the contractor anticipated that SSA would do so at  least every 3 years.", "Model accuracy leads to savings for SSA in two ways. First, model  accuracy is important for identifying cases that are unlikely to result in  medical improvement and can therefore be handled as mailers. According  to SSA\u2019s contractor, the models\u2019 last re-estimation in 2007 increased the  accuracy of the models while allowing SSA to process over 25,000  additional cases as mailers, potentially saving the agency over $20 million  by performing fewer full medical reviews. Second, greater model  accuracy means the models are more likely to correctly assign high  scores to cases most likely to demonstrate medical improvement,  potentially leading to more medical cessations among beneficiaries who  receive full medical reviews.", "Although SSA acknowledged the importance of re-estimating its models  again, it has yet to complete concrete actions toward doing so. In  December 2015, SSA officials indicated that they were in the process of  re-estimating the models, but the agency had not yet documented its  efforts. In addition, according to SSA officials, the agency had not yet  established plans to re-estimate the models on a regular basis. Without  re-estimating its models on a regular basis, the agency risks losing the  predictive accuracy of the models and could compromise its ability to use  CDR resources efficiently."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SSA Considers Cost Savings Information to a Limited Extent When Prioritizing CDRs", "paragraphs": ["Although SSA considers cost savings when prioritizing CDR cases, it  does not do so in a manner that will maximize potential savings.  According to federal internal control standards, federal agencies should  ensure effective stewardship of public resources. The order in which  SSA prioritizes beneficiary groups for CDRs generally aligns with the  average savings per full medical review conducted for those groups in  recent years. For example, the two highest priority groups\u2014statutorily  required reviews for age-18 redeterminations and low birth-weight  children\u2014have the highest average savings in foregone disability benefits  as a result of full medical reviews (see fig. 4).", "However, the priority ranking of beneficiary groups is not exclusively  reliant upon the average savings achieved from conducting full medical  reviews, because the agency takes other factors into consideration. For  example, the average savings per full medical review of children receiving  SSI benefits on the basis of low birth weight is higher than that of SSI  children at age 18. Although reviews of 18-year-olds are automatically  initiated 2 months before the beneficiary\u2019s 18th birthday, not all reviews of  low birth-weight children are conducted as scheduled. Specifically, in  fiscal years 2009 through 2014, approximately 3,900 to 21,700 low birth- weight reviews were backlogged annually. In addition, although the SSI  Other Children group has a higher average savings in foregone disability  benefits than DI beneficiaries, SSI Other Children are prioritized after DI  beneficiaries. In fiscal year 2013, SSA conducted more than twice as  many full medical reviews on DI beneficiaries as on SSI Other Children  beneficiaries and backlogged tens of thousands more full medical reviews  for SSI Other Children than for DI beneficiaries. DI cases have been  given priority over SSI Other Children partly to protect the Disability  Insurance Trust Fund, which is the source of benefit payments to most DI  recipients. However, recent action to address the solvency of the  Disability Insurance Trust Fund somewhat mitigates this rationale. If  SSA had switched the number of full medical reviews conducted for these  groups in 2013, it is possible that the agency would have generated over  $100 million more in savings.", "Furthermore, in focusing on beneficiary groups, SSA\u2019s prioritization  process does not capture any differences among subgroups\u2019 average  savings in foregone disability benefits as a result of full medical reviews.  For example, the DI group can be split into four subgroups, and the  average lifetime savings per full medical review among these subgroups  differed by as much as approximately $3,000 (or about 21 percent) in  recent years (see fig. 5).", "The aggregate mix of cases across different beneficiary groups reviewed  during a fiscal year directly affects the agency\u2019s total savings from  conducting CDRs. If SSA were to shift the mix of discretionary cases it  reviews among subgroups within beneficiary groups while still taking  likelihood of medical improvement into account, it could realize greater  savings. For example, shifting the mix of DI cases reviewed to better align  with historical average savings performance among different DI  subgroups would likely increase SSA\u2019s total savings. Furthermore, we  reported in 2012 that certain subgroups of SSI children beneficiaries,  such as those with speech and language disorders as well as other  mental impairments, demonstrated higher rates of initial cessation (i.e.,  prior to the appeals process) stemming from full medical review than  other SSI children beneficiaries. As a result, reviews of these subgroups  are more likely to contribute to savings for the agency than other non- required SSI children reviews. Without considering average savings at the  beneficiary subgroup level, SSA may not be maximizing the total savings  it realizes from conducting full medical reviews.", "In addition to differences in savings from shifts in the aggregate mix of  cases receiving full medical reviews, savings can also differ when  comparing individual cases. When an individual\u2019s benefits are ceased as  the result of a CDR, the foregone benefits represent savings to the  federal government. The amount of savings depends on various factors  that affect how much SSA would have paid had the individual continued  to receive disability benefits over time. These factors include the  individual\u2019s age, life expectancy, and monthly benefit payment. For  example, two individuals who are different ages but are otherwise similar  (e.g., they live in the same state, have the same benefit amount, and  have the same likelihood of medical improvement as determined by  SSA\u2019s statistical models) would generate different expected savings from  a CDR because the younger individual would likely receive benefits for a  longer period of time. Similarly, two individuals who have different benefit  amounts but are otherwise similar would generate different expected  savings from a CDR because the individual with higher monthly benefits  would likely receive greater total benefits over time. Prioritizing the CDR  for the younger individual or the individual with a higher benefit level could  result in greater savings for SSA. The simplified scenarios below illustrate  this point; however, if SSA were to further incorporate such factors for  individuals into its CDR prioritization process, a more complete set of  inputs and assumptions would be needed (see fig. 6).", "Despite the potentially substantial differences in savings among  beneficiaries, SSA lacks a mechanism for factoring expected savings  from benefit cessation into its CDR prioritization process on a case- specific basis. As a program integrity effort, CDRs are intended to assess  the continued eligibility of beneficiaries to ensure that payments are made  only to those individuals who should be receiving them, and SSA\u2019s  statistical models use an appropriate proxy of eligibility\u2014potential for  medical improvement\u2014to prioritize cases for review. However, for  beneficiaries with the same likelihood of medical improvement, SSA  officials told us the agency does not further differentiate among  individuals in the same beneficiary group on the basis of potential benefit  savings. In SSA\u2019s current prioritization process, the individuals depicted in  the hypothetical scenarios in figure 6 would be equally likely to receive a  full medical review because the agency does not consider the potential  savings from individual cessations. As demonstrated in the analysis  presented above, SSA could miss additional savings because it does not  further consider beneficiaries\u2019 potential savings when prioritizing cases for  full medical review."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "SSA Reviews a Sample of CDRs for Quality but Does Not Comprehensively Analyze and Report Errors", "paragraphs": ["To assess the ability of DDSs to correctly apply policy and fully document  CDRs, SSA performs quality reviews of a sample of continuances and  cessations. The SSA quality reviewers who perform these reviews have  guidance for checking specific elements of the decisions, and they are  guided through a step-by-step computer program for conducting and  documenting the reviews. SSA\u2019s quality reviewers check CDRs for three  types of errors: (1) decision errors, which include incorrect decisions or  incomplete evidence to support a decision; (2) date errors, including  incorrect benefit cessation dates; and (3) administrative errors. The  reviewers return CDRs with decision errors to the DDS to perform  additional work but generally correct those with date and administrative  errors themselves.", "SSA uses these quality reviews for multiple purposes.

According to SSA officials, SSA probes CDR quality  review data to uncover error trends by, for example, general  groupings of impairments such as mental disorders. However, SSA  does not analyze the data to uncover error trends for specific  impairments, beneficiary types, or other characteristics. Federal  internal control standards stipulate that management should assess  the quality of performance over time and promptly resolve findings  from audits and other reviews. According to officials, SSA does not  analyze the characteristics of CDRs with errors because CDR  accuracy rates are generally high and resources are limited. In  addition, officials stated that SSA does not have sufficient data to do  statistical modeling for such analyses. However, it is possible to  analyze the characteristics of CDRs with errors by comparing relevant  percentages without modeling, using data from multiple years if  necessary. According to SSA and DDS officials, certain types of  cases may be more error-prone than others. For example, cases  involving mental impairments are thought to be relatively error-prone  because they can be more challenging to document. In addition,  officials reported challenges in conducting CDRs of low birth-weight  children receiving SSI benefits because of the lack of documentation  of other impairments they may have. However, because SSA has not  analyzed the incidence of inaccurate CDRs by impairment, beneficiary  type, or other characteristics, it cannot efficiently identify common  types of errors and their root causes to help the DDSs take steps to  prevent them.", "Defining and reporting accuracy: In determining CDR accuracy  rates, SSA does not include date errors, including incorrect cessation  dates. As a result, decision makers do not have a complete picture of  the CDR errors that affect disability payments. We have previously  reported that to be useful, performance information must be complete,  accurate, and valid, among other factors. However, per SSA  regulation, the agency does not consider date errors when calculating  accuracy rates because date errors do not affect the decision to  cease or continue benefits, according to officials.28, 29 Nonetheless,  such errors can affect the number of payments a beneficiary receives  and thus SSA\u2019s costs. For example, cessation date errors in a CDR  can result in some beneficiaries receiving payments for longer or  shorter periods of time, and thus accruing overpayments or  underpayments for the period in question. Without including date  errors in its reported accuracy rates, SSA does not provide its  management and other decision makers and the public with complete  information about errors that can affect disability payments. In  addition, if SSA had counted date errors in CDR cessations, its  accuracy rate for cessations in fiscal year 2014 would have fallen 1.6  percentage points from 95.5 percent to 93.9 percent. For some states,  the effect of considering these errors is more pronounced. We  examined SSA\u2019s fiscal year 2014 cessation accuracy rate estimates  and found that for 13 states, the accuracy rates would have  decreased by at least 2 percentage points had SSA counted date  errors; and, in one state the accuracy rate for cessations would have  fallen 7 percentage points, from 95.4 percent to 88.4 percent.", "SSA regulations define accuracy in this context as the percentage of cases that do not  have to be returned to state DDSs for further development or correction of decisions  based on evidence in the files. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1643, 416.1043. In explaining the  accuracy standard, SSA stated that its primary purpose was to improve the initial claims  process and ensure that only properly entitled claimants receive disability benefits and  that its approach was to specify outputs (i.e., performance accuracy), rather than  specifying all inputs that could go into the standard.", "SSA conducts stewardship reviews which examine the non-medical quality of various  decisions related to benefit payments, including date designations. To do so, SSA reviews  a sample of individuals receiving payments. In conducting and reporting on these reviews,  however, SSA does not specifically focus on CDRs.", "Sampling CDRs for quality review: SSA produces accuracy rate  estimates by state DDS, but its sampling approach does not reliably  and efficiently generate accuracy rate estimates for continuances and  cessations separately in every state. According to federal guidance  for developing statistical estimates, agencies should develop a  sampling plan that is reflective of the level of detail and precision  needed of the key estimates. CDR accuracy rates vary by state, and  continuances are consistently more accurate than cessations. In fiscal  year 2014, for example, the states\u2019 estimated CDR accuracy rates  varied from 92.4 percent to 99.8 percent. In the same year, the  estimated accuracy rate for continuances was 98.3 percent  nationwide, whereas the equivalent for cessations was 95.5 percent.  Moreover, the range of accuracy rates across states is much larger for  cessations. In fiscal year 2014, state-level accuracy rates for  cessations ranged from 78.3 to 100 percent, while the accuracy rates  for continuances ranged from 92 to 100 percent. To monitor CDR  accuracy, SSA randomly selects about 70 continuances and 70  cessations for quality review each quarter from each state. Despite  this sampling approach, SSA officials stated that their sampling  design is not intended to produce precise estimates for continuations  and cessations separately by state. However, precise accuracy rate  estimates for continuations and cessations separately by state are  needed to monitor DDS performance because of the difference in  accuracy by decision type and because the state DDSs are managed  separately.", "In analyzing CDR workload and accuracy data, we found that SSA\u2019s  sampling approach produced accuracy rate estimates with margins of  error that were consistently wide in seven states and consistently  narrow in six states for either one type of CDR decision or both. A  wide margin of error occurs when there are not enough CDR  decisions in the sample to produce a reliable estimate. In these  instances, such as in Vermont and Wyoming, we found SSA could not  produce an estimate with a margin of error of plus or minus 5  percentage points using its current approach unless it sampled more  CDR decisions. When SSA does not sample enough decisions and  produces estimates with wide margins of error, decision makers may  be relying on misleading information to assess CDR accuracy.  Conversely, when SSA samples too many decisions and produces  estimates with margins of error that are narrower than necessary to  achieve reliable results, the agency may be wasting time and  resources on such quality reviews."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SSA Reasonably Estimates CDR Cost Savings but Has Conducted Limited Sensitivity Analysis and Documentation", "paragraphs": ["SSA\u2019s annual process for estimating the cost savings of CDRs\u2014the  estimated ratio of federal program savings to costs for performing  CDRs\u2014involves many steps. To calculate the federal program savings  generated by CDRs in a particular year, SSA estimates the present value  of expected future benefits over 40 years that are saved as a result of the  reviews. In forecasting these savings, SSA considers benefits from  programs administered by SSA (i.e., DI and SSI) as well as programs that  are not administered by SSA (i.e., Medicare and Medicaid). To do so,  SSA estimates the number of people whose benefits would be ceased by  CDRs and considers the effect of appeals in determining these  estimates. SSA then estimates the savings associated with the  cessations that are forecasted not to be overturned. It considers the age  of individuals whose benefits would be ceased, and uses separate  models to forecast savings from DI, SSI, Medicare, and Medicaid. SSA  also forecasts and accounts for the number and timing of beneficiaries  who would stop receiving disability benefits regardless of a CDR.  Similarly, it forecasts and excludes the number of former beneficiaries  who will successfully reapply for benefits after, for example, a new  disabling condition arises. To generate the overall CDR cost savings rate  (i.e., the amount saved for every dollar invested in CDRs) for a particular  year, SSA divides the present value of future benefit savings by SSA\u2019s  actual cost of conducting CDRs during the relevant year (see fig. 7). To  determine the cost of conducting CDRs, SSA considers its relevant  expenses as well as those of the state DDSs.", "We determined that SSA\u2019s methods and assumptions for estimating CDR  cost savings were reasonable, but, in certain respects, inconsistent with  guidance for conducting cost savings analysis of federal programs.  Specifically, we identified two areas of weakness:", "Sensitivity analysis: According to federal guidance for conducting  cost savings analysis, \u201cmajor assumptions should be varied and net  present value and other outcomes recomputed to determine how  sensitive outcomes are to changes in the assumptions.\u201d In reviewing  SSA\u2019s approach to estimating CDR cost savings for fiscal year 2012,  we determined that SSA did not conduct sensitivity analysis of the  overall cost savings rate. However, SSA separately performed some  limited sensitivity analysis on savings from DI and SSI, which  collectively represented about 82 percent of the savings that SSA  forecasted for fiscal year 2012 CDRs. SSA calculated the effect of  using inputs from fiscal year 2011, such as the average benefit  amount, on the savings estimates for fiscal year 2012. However, SSA  did not vary its assumptions (e.g., from optimistic to pessimistic) to  generate a range of estimated savings. In addition, SSA has not  reported the effect of changing its assumptions about SSI and DI  savings on the overall cost savings estimate. According to an SSA  official, doing sensitivity analysis on the reported cost savings  estimate would require additional coordination with CMS about  Medicare and Medicaid. However, SSA could conduct more complete  sensitivity analysis by, for example, estimating a combined range of  savings from DI and SSI without additional coordination. By not  including a range of estimated savings for at least SSA\u2019s programs,  decision makers lack data on the extent to which the estimates could  vary under different assumptions.", "Documentation: According to federal guidance, models used in cost  savings analysis should also be well documented and, where  possible, available to facilitate independent review. SSA uses multiple  complex models to estimate the cost savings of CDRs, but it has  limited documentation about its methods, including data sources,  assumptions, and limitations that factor into the estimates. For  example, SSA has not documented how it estimates the number and  timing of beneficiaries who stop receiving disability benefits because  of a CDR, as well as the number of former beneficiaries who will  successfully reapply for benefits. According to SSA officials, the  agency has not yet documented the assumptions and procedures  used to calculate CDR cost savings because of competing priorities  and limited resources. Consequently, knowledge of SSA\u2019s models is  limited to the few SSA actuaries who work with them, and this  information is not readily available or transferrable to others, including  external reviewers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In light of SSA\u2019s current backlog of CDRs and the long-term financial  challenges of the Disability Insurance Trust Fund, conducting timely, high- quality, and cost-effective CDRs is particularly important. In an effort to  use its resources efficiently, SSA applies several sound practices to help  prioritize CDRs. However, without further integrating comparative cost  savings information in its prioritization process, SSA is missing an  opportunity not only to focus on CDRs that are likely to save the federal  government the most money, but also to more efficiently use its resources  for program integrity work. Maximizing cost savings is not the only goal of  this work, but it is an important criterion to help SSA prioritize CDRs and  ensure that beneficiaries are being more effectively selected for review.", "Further, although SSA has an extensive process for reviewing the quality  of CDR decisions and a high overall accuracy rate, until the agency  systematically uses available data to identify error-prone cases and root  causes, it will be hard-pressed to prevent similar errors from recurring. In  addition, absent tracking all meaningful errors that it identifies, such as  date errors, the agency and other stakeholders lack an accurate sense of  the true error rate of CDRs. Similarly, SSA\u2019s current approach to sampling  state decisions means the agency may be relying on misleading  performance information for making management decisions.", "SSA has demonstrated that CDRs are cost-effective, and it applies sound  methods and assumptions for estimating cost savings. However, because  it does not vary the assumptions that it uses to estimate a range of  potential returns on investment for CDRs, the Congress and other  stakeholders do not have complete information on the precision of these  estimates and the extent to which they could vary with changes in  assumptions. Finally, SSA\u2019s limited documentation about its actuarial  models leaves the agency vulnerable in the event of turnover of the few  staff who use these models and challenges external reviewers\u2019 ability to  understand and audit the integrity of its models."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Acting Commissioner of Social Security:  1.

SSA  stated that it generally agreed with our recommendations, but noted that  the level of program integrity funding it receives has affected the number  of CDRs performed annually and, at times, the size of the CDR backlog.  SSA also noted that our report implied that SSA is not focused on the  CDRs that are most likely to save the government money and that the  report did not fully convey the accuracy of the agency\u2019s statistical models  and its treatment of CDR errors. We agree that SSA\u2019s CDR process is  generally designed to use its program integrity resources efficiently and  note in our report that SSA applies several sound practices to help  prioritize CDRs including annually assessing its statistical models\u2019  performance. However, we maintain additional steps are warranted to  ensure ongoing accuracy of the models and to maximize potential  savings. We also note that the agency has a process in place to identify  and evaluate errors, but maintain that additional steps could be taken to  systematically analyze error trends and uncover root causes of errors.  SSA agreed with four of our recommendations, partially agreed with one  recommendation, and disagreed with two recommendations. The  agency\u2019s specific concerns and our responses are described below:", "Regarding our recommendation to further consider cost savings  as part of its prioritization of full medical reviews, SSA partially  agreed. Although SSA agreed that it could look for ways to  improve its return on conducting CDRs, it also stated that its  statistical models and prioritization process already do much of  what we recommend. For example, SSA stated that age is already  a strong variable in its statistical models. However, these models  predict medical improvement and are not designed to take  expected cost savings into account. We continue to believe that to  maximize expected cost savings SSA could refine its prioritization  process by factoring in actuarial considerations. For example,  SSA could consider the effect of a beneficiary\u2019s age on expected  costs savings, in addition to its existing statistical models that  account for the effect of age on the likelihood of medical  improvement.", "Regarding our recommendation to complete a re-estimation of the  statistical models that are used to prioritize CDRs and determine a  plan for re-estimating these models on a regular basis, SSA  agreed and stated that it plans to complete its ongoing re- estimation and to document a process for determining when to re- estimate the models in the future.", "Regarding our recommendation to monitor the characteristics of  CDRs with errors to identify root causes, SSA agreed and stated  that it reports all errors to the relevant DDS for corrective action.  SSA further stated that its identification of root causes is limited by  the relatively few reviewed CDRs that have errors. However, in  fiscal year 2014 as an example, SSA identified over 600 CDRs  with errors. Although these CDRs make up a small percentage of  the CDRs reviewed by SSA that year, the agency could analyze  the characteristics of CDRs with errors by comparing relevant  percentages without modeling. In addition, SSA could combine  data from multiple years if it determined that considering more  CDRs with errors would be helpful.", "Regarding our recommendation to track the number and rate of  date errors and consider including them in its reported CDR  accuracy rates, SSA disagreed and stated that, per SSA  regulation, the agency does not consider date errors when  calculating accuracy rates because date errors do not affect the  decision to cease or continue benefits. SSA also stated its  stewardship reviews examine the non-medical quality of benefit  payment decisions. However, these reviews are not focused on  CDRs, and SSA does not report results from them for CDRs  specifically. SSA also explained that it does not track the number  and rate of date errors because they are infrequent. However,  SSA\u2019s regulations do not prevent the agency from tracking date  errors, and until it does, SSA cannot definitively determine the  frequency of these errors. In addition, we found that considering  date errors substantially reduced some states\u2019 estimated CDR  accuracy rates. Without tracking these errors, SSA cannot assess  their effect and consider whether including them in its reported  CDR accuracy rates has merit.", "Regarding our recommendation to adjust its approach to sampling  CDRs to efficiently produce reliable accuracy rate estimates for  continuances and cessations separately in each state, SSA  disagreed and stated that some states do not generate enough  CDR decisions, particularly cessations, to generate statistically  valid samples. However, for states with CDR samples that are  consistently too small to produce reliable results, SSA could, for  example, pool decisions from more months than it currently does  to generate statistically valid samples by state. Conversely, for  states with CDR samples that are consistently larger than  necessary to efficiently achieve reliable results, SSA could, for  example, reduce sample sizes. Because CDR accuracy rates vary  by state and cessations are consistently less accurate than  continuances, we maintain that SSA should adjust its approach to  sampling CDRs.", "Regarding our recommendation to conduct sensitivity analyses on  SSI and DI\u2019s contributions to CDR cost savings estimates and  report the results reflecting a range of inputs, SSA agreed and  stated that it will expand on its current sensitivity analyses as time  and resources permit.", "Regarding our recommendation to better document the methods  that factor into its estimates of CDR cost savings, SSA agreed and  stated that it will improve and expand its existing documentation  as time and resources permit.", "SSA also provided technical comments, which we incorporated into the  report as appropriate.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

We assessed the reliability of  these data by reviewing related documentation and interviewing  knowledgeable agency officials, and we found these data sufficiently  reliable for our purposes. To assist with the analysis, we obtained  information from SSA\u2019s Office of Public Service and Operations Support  on the number of SSA policy priority cases processed annually. From the  total number of full medical reviews completed during a fiscal year, we  subtracted completed full medical reviews that were prioritized because  they were statutorily required (e.g., reviews of SSI children at age 18 and  reviews of children under 1 year old who are receiving SSI benefits due in  part to low birth weight) and because of SSA policy (e.g., mailers with  certain responses and first-time reviews for beneficiaries in the \u201cmedical  improvement expected\u201d diary category). To avoid potential double- counting, we did not count the sample of approximately 60,000 cases that  SSA initiates annually to validate its statistical models among the policy  priority cases because the sample consists of cases across all beneficiary  groups, including statutorily required cases. As a result, our calculations  may underestimate the number of required priority cases and  overestimate the number of cases selected because of the statistical  models.", "To illustrate the impact of further incorporating cost savings into the  prioritization process, we obtained and analyzed data from SSA on the  average savings per full medical review by beneficiary group in each of  fiscal years 2012 and 2013. Using weighted averages of these data, we  calculated the average savings for fiscal years 2012 and 2013 separately  and combined. We also developed two hypothetical scenarios that pair  near-identical beneficiaries with different ages or monthly benefit  payments to demonstrate the effect of considering cost savings on an  individual basis. We used information from the fiscal year 2013 statistical  supplements on the DI and SSI programs to develop reasonable ages  and benefit levels for the hypothetical beneficiaries.

SSA reports accuracy rate estimates for each  state every month using the most recent 3 or 6 months of quality review  data.

We analyzed SSA\u2019s CDR workload and accuracy data, consistent with  SSA\u2019s sampling and reporting methods, from June 2013 through April  2015.

To identify states that had estimates that consistently do not  achieve the reporting goals, we compared the workload, accuracy rate  estimates, and margins of errors to those specified in SSA\u2019s sample  design and reporting goals. We calculated margins of error for estimates  in which SSA did not provide them. We used a statistical formula that  produces appropriate margins of error, including when standard formula  do not apply, to determine and examine a margin of error for all  estimates. We chose this formula because in some cases CDR accuracy  is so high or the sampling fraction is so large that the standard statistical  formula used for these purposes would compute margins of error that are  not appropriate, such as those resulting in confidence intervals above 100  percent. Since CDR accuracy cannot be greater than 100 percent, the  standard formula is not appropriate.

SSA\u2019s date error data were not broken down  by decision type (i.e., continuance or cessation), but we assigned these  errors to cessations because of input from SSA and our corroborating  analysis. According to SSA officials, the most common date error on a  CDR is a cessation date error and other date errors, such as incorrectly  inputting an onset date, can occur in a cessation or continuance but are  rare. Our analysis corroborated this information. For example, in fiscal  year 2014, of 127 date errors identified in CDRs nationally, 125 of them  were cessation date errors.
