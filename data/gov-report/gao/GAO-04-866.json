Such weaknesses impair the federal government's ability to ensure that the CFS is consistent with the underlying audited agency financial statements, properly balanced, and in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In addition to the compilation and reporting weaknesses that GAO reported in October 2003, GAO found additional weaknesses in the compilation and reporting process in the following seven areas during the fiscal year 2003 CFS audit: (1) allocation methodology for certain costs in the statement of net cost, (2) statement of changes in cash balance from unified budget and other activities, (3) reporting of criminal debt, (4) recording and disclosing contingencies, (5) directly linking audited federal agency financial statements to the CFS, (6) prior period adjustments, and (7) conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. GAO found that with respect to four required disclosure areas, information was either not included in the CFS or was not presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. As a result of this and certain other weaknesses GAO identified, GAO was unable to determine if the missing information was material to the CFS. The four disclosure areas were (1) federal employee and veteran benefits payable, (2) environmental and disposal liabilities, (3) research and development, and (4) deferred maintenance.

Most of the errors occurred  because Treasury allocated a full year of OPM costs to DHS, even though  DHS did not begin operations until March 2003.

Further, these standards require that an allowance for uncollectible  accounts be used to reduce the gross amount of the receivable and revenue  to its net realizable value. Also, in accordance with OMB Circular No. A- 129, Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Non-Tax Receivables,  agencies are to (1) service and collect debts in a manner that best protects  the value of the U.S. government\u2019s assets and (2) provide accounting and  management information for effective stewardship, including resources  entrusted to the U.S. government (e.g., for nonfederal and federal  restitution).", "Criminal debt consists primarily of fines and restitution related to a wide  range of criminal activities, including domestic and international terrorism,  drug trafficking, firearms activities, and white-collar fraud. The U.S. Courts  assess these debts, and the Department of Justice\u2019s (Justice) U.S.  Attorneys\u2019 Offices throughout the country are charged with enforcing  collection. Although Justice and the U.S. Courts develop unaudited annual  statistical data for informational purposes, neither entity is accounting for  any of these criminal debts as receivables, disclosing the debts in financial  statements, or having the information subject to audit. The U.S. Courts,  which serve as the assessor, depositor, and disburser of most of the funds  collected, are not required to prepare financial statements or disclose  criminal debt information. In addition, Justice, which enforces criminal  debt collection, prepares audited financial statements but does not record  or disclose receivables for criminal debt. Therefore, criminal debt  outstanding is not being reported to Treasury for inclusion in the CFS.  Financial statement reporting of criminal debt would increase oversight of  the debt collection process because amounts would be subject to audit.  Such audits would include assessments of internal control and compliance  with applicable laws and regulations related to the criminal debt collection  process.", "In our recently issued report on criminal debt, we reemphasized the need  for Justice, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, OMB, and Treasury  to form a joint task force to develop a strategic plan that addresses  managing, accounting for, and reporting criminal debt. We stated that the  strategy should include (1) determining an approach for assessing the  collectibility of outstanding criminal debt amounts so that a meaningful  allowance for uncollectible criminal debts can be reported and used for  measuring debt collection performance and (2) having OMB work with  Justice and certain other executive branch agencies to ensure that these  entities report and/or disclose relevant criminal debt information in their  financial statements and subject such information to audit.

Part of the problem is that Treasury has not  requested all relevant information for loss contingencies required under the  accounting standards from all applicable federal agencies. For fiscal year  2003, Treasury\u2019s primary means of compiling information for the CFS was  through its system called Federal Agencies\u2019 Centralized Trial Balance  System (FACTS). Under FACTS, federal agencies were instructed to enter  information for legal contingencies that are assessed as both \u201creasonably  possible\u201d and \u201cestimable.\u201d Treasury does not specifically request other  information for loss contingencies that is required by accounting  standards, such as loss contingencies assessed (1) to be probable, (2) as  reasonably possible with estimated loss ranges, or (3) as uncertain.", "For example, one federal agency provided Treasury with information  regarding a legal claim amount of $1.7 billion for which the agency\u2019s  lawyers were unable to provide an assessment of the likelihood of an  unfavorable outcome. Because FACTS does not allow for narrative  descriptions of amounts provided to Treasury and only classifies loss  contingencies as reasonably possible and estimable, the agency was unable  to properly report to Treasury that the assessment of the likelihood of an  unfavorable outcome was uncertain. Consequently, Treasury incorrectly  considered this amount as reasonably possible and estimable and therefore  overstated its estimated possible losses for legal contingencies in the CFS  by this federal agency\u2019s claimant amount of $1.7 billion. We notified  Treasury of this error and a correction was made in the final version of the  CFS.", "SFFAS No. 5, Accounting for Liabilities of the Federal Government, as  amended by SFFAS No. 12, Recognition of Contingent Liabilities Arising  from Litigation: An Amendment of SFFAS No. 5, contains accounting and  reporting standards for loss contingencies, including those arising from  litigation, claims, and assessments. A contingency is defined as an existing  condition, situation, or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to  possible gain or loss to an entity. The uncertainty will ultimately be  resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. When a loss  contingency exists, the likelihood that the future event or events will  confirm the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  can range from probable to remote.", "SFFAS Nos. 5 and 12 use the terms probable, reasonably possible, and  remote to identify three areas within the range of potential loss, as follows:  Probable. For contingencies, the future event or events are more likely  than not to occur.  In addition, for contingencies related to pending or  threatened litigation and unasserted claims, the future confirming event  or events are those likely to occur.", "Reasonably possible. The chance of the future confirming event or  events occurring is more than remote but less than probable.", "Remote. The chance of the future event or events occurring is slight.", "Under SFFAS Nos. 5 and 12, a liability and the related cost for an estimated  loss from a loss contingency should be recognized (accrued by a charge to  income) when (1) a past event or exchange transaction has occurred, (2) a  future outflow or other sacrifice of resources is probable, and (3) the future  outflow or sacrifice of resources is measurable.", "Disclosure of the nature of an accrued liability for loss contingencies,  including the amount accrued, may be necessary for the financial  statements not to be misleading. For example, if the amount recognized is  large or unusual, disclosure should be considered. However, if no accrual is  made for a loss because one or more of the conditions in SFFAS No. 12 are  not met, disclosure of the contingency should be made when there is at  least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. The disclosure  should include the nature of the contingency and an estimate of the  possible liability or range of possible liability, if estimable, or a statement  that such an estimate cannot be made.", "Recommendation for Executive Action. Because the limited information  requested through Treasury\u2019s FACTS does not capture all the disclosure  requirements under the accounting standards, the contingency note  disclosure for the CFS may have been inaccurate and unreliable.  For fiscal  year 2004, Treasury is completing the design of and will be implementing a  new system for compiling the CFS.  We recommend that the Secretary of  the Treasury direct the Fiscal Assistant Secretary to include in the new  system a request for federal agencies to provide the following contingency  loss information to assist Treasury in disclosing contingencies in the CFS in  accordance with GAAP:  contingency losses assessed as probable and for which possible losses  and estimated loss ranges are measurable,   contingency losses assessed as probable and for which possible losses  cannot be estimated,  contingency losses assessed as reasonably possible and for which losses  and estimated loss ranges are measurable,  contingency losses assessed as reasonably possible and for which  possible losses are not measurable, and   the nature and extent of significant contingency losses for which the  agency is unable to provide an assessment on the likelihood of an  unfavorable outcome."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Directly Linking Audited Federal Agency Financial Statements to the CFS", "paragraphs": ["As we have reported in the past, Treasury\u2019s current process for compiling  the CFS did not directly link information from federal agencies\u2019 audited  financial statements to amounts reported in the CFS, and therefore  Treasury could not fully ensure that the information in the CFS was  consistent with the underlying information in federal agencies\u2019 audited  financial statements and other financial data. For fiscal year 2004 reporting,  Treasury is planning a new process to compile the CFS. We reviewed  Treasury\u2019s plans for the new process and found that there is a plan to link  most of the agencies\u2019 audited financial statements to the consolidated  financial statements through the use of a new closing package. Treasury  will require each significant agency to prepare the closing package and to  certify its accuracy.", "However, we found that the planned closing package does not require  federal agencies to directly link their audited financial statement notes to  the closing package notes. Treasury plans to rely on note templates it  designed that call for predefined information from the federal agencies. We  found that these templates are too restrictive and that important  information reported at the agency level may not be included in the CFS  because it is not specifically called for in the closing package. The use of  such predefined templates increases the risk that Treasury will continue to  produce consolidated financial statements that are not in conformity with  GAAP.", "We also found that the planned closing package does not require the  necessary information to compile all five of the required consolidated  financial statements. For example, as noted earlier, we found that there  were significant differences between the total net outlays reported in  selected agencies\u2019 audited financial statements and the records Treasury  uses to prepare its Statement of Changes in Cash Balance from Unified  Budget and Other Activities.  Because the planned closing package does  not call for agencies to provide information to compile this statement that  is consistent with underlying information in the agencies\u2019 audited financial  statements, the risk of differences between the CFS and the underlying  agency financial statements is increased.

Treasury stated that our report identified issues  regarding certain federal financial reporting procedures and internal  controls and provided valuable advice and recommendations for  improvements. It also stated that many of the concerns we raised are in  critical areas where federal financial reporting can be improved. While  Treasury stated that it generally agreed with our concerns on most of the  major issues, in some cases it disagreed with either our finding or our  recommended approach to addressing the problem. We continue to believe  that our findings and recommendations are sound. Treasury\u2019s  disagreements involve two areas of weaknesses we identified and reported  on as part of our fiscal year 2003 audit and are discussed in this report   (1) Statement of Changes in Cash Balance from Unified Budget and Other  Activities, and (2) Treasury\u2019s allocation methodology for certain costs in  the Statement of Net Cost. In addition, Treasury disagreed with certain  matters involving three areas we identified and reported on as part of our fiscal year 2002 audit (1) unreconciled transactions affecting the change  in net position, (2) Reconciliation of Net Operating Cost and Unified  Budget Surplus/Deficit, and (3) management representation letters.

Treasury disagreed with our  position that it should determine and address the effects on the accuracy of  the CFS of differences between net outlays the federal agencies report in  their individual audited SBRs and Treasury\u2019s net outlay records used to  prepare the Statement of Changes in Cash Balance. As stated in this report,  OMB and GAAP require federal agencies to report net outlays in their  SBRs. The Statement of Changes in Cash Balance also reports actual  unified budget outlays.  Both are intended to represent the same amount  and be consistent with the information in the budget of the U.S.  government. We found material differences between these amounts for  selected federal agencies for fiscal year 2003. Until these types of  significant differences are reconciled, the effect on the CFS will be  unknown. OMB has stated that it has begun working with the federal  agencies to address this issue and we continue to believe that Treasury, in  coordination with OMB, should work with the federal agencies on this  matter as well.", "Treasury also stated that it believes it is not required to report both budget  receipts and budget outlays in the Statement of Changes in Cash Balance  but only the budget deficit or surplus, as required by SFFAS No. 24. We  understand that SFFAS No. 24 calls for a financial statement that explains  how the annual budget surplus or deficit relates to the change in the  government\u2019s cash, and does not prescribe the individual reporting of  budget receipts and outlays.  However, the budget deficit or surplus is the  simple calculation of netting the budget receipt and outlay amounts. Also,  Treasury does not maintain \u201cbudget deficit or surplus\u201d records; rather  Treasury maintains separate budget receipt and outlay records and relies  on these records to calculate the budget deficit or surplus. As such,  regardless of whether Treasury continues to separately report budget  receipts and budget outlays or elects to only report the budget deficit or  surplus, Treasury and OMB will still need to determine the effects of the  types of net outlay differences described above on the CFS.", "While Treasury agreed that the illustrative statement for the Statement of  Changes in Cash Balance provided in SFFAS No. 24 shows total cash and  the gross amounts for receipts and disbursements of cash related to direct  loans and loan guarantees, it stated that presentation of this amount of  detail is not required. As such, Treasury states that, at this time, it will not  report the gross amounts for receipts and disbursements of cash related to  direct loans and loan guarantees as we recommend. As stated in this report,  we recognize that the illustrative statement is not prescriptive. However,  we also note that the gross reporting is consistent with the reporting  encouraged in Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 95,  Statement of Cash Flows. We also stated in this report that net reporting of  direct and guaranteed loan program activity does not disclose how much  cash the government disbursed to promote the nation\u2019s welfare by making  these loans available to the general population or how much in related  repayments the government received.

We did  not take issue with Treasury modifying its methodology for the change, but  rather that Treasury had not updated its written procedures to reflect the  modification and had made errors in applying the methodology.  Specifically, as stated in our report, we found that Treasury did not update  its methodology in its written procedures for allocating OPM costs to  reflect the change caused by the USPS pension cost recognition and DHS\u2019  partial year existence.  Our review found that Treasury did modify its  methodology for allocating OPM costs based on the changes caused by  USPS; however, it was not documented in its standard operating  procedures and the spreadsheet used to apply the methodology had several  significant errors\u2014none of which were identified by Treasury. One  significant error was that the FTEs used by Treasury for some agencies did  not agree with the respective agencies\u2019 FTEs in the Analytical  Perspectives, Budget of the United States Government as prescribed by  Treasury\u2019s methodology. As such, we continue to recommend that Treasury  (1) ensure that, if FTEs are used as part of Treasury\u2019s methodology for  allocating OPM costs, the FTEs used for the agencies listed on the  Statement of Net Cost agree with the FTEs listed in the Analytical  Perspectives, Budget of the United States Government as currently stated  in Treasury\u2019s methodology; (2) document any changes to the stated  methodology for allocating OPM costs and the rationale for these changes;  and (3) require reviews by Treasury management of the accuracy of the  allocated OPM costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Unreconciled Transactions Affecting the Change in Net Position", "paragraphs": ["Treasury stated that it agreed that reconciling net position is a problem and  that eliminations of intragovernmental activity and balances are not  performed through balanced accounting entries but expressed concern  that we are over emphasizing the elimination process.

During our fiscal year 2002 audit, we  recommended that Treasury develop reconciliation procedures that will aid  in understanding and controlling the net position balance, including the  need to understand the components, including intragovernmental  transactions, that are presently causing the net unreconciled transactions.  These actions would allow the use of balanced accounting entries to  account for the change in net position rather than simple subtraction of  liabilities from assets and should narrow the amount of unexplained  differences that comprise the net unreconciled transactions. Treasury  added that it has a new process that will involve (1) use of reciprocal  categories in performing eliminations and (2) a net position tracking  methodology that will identify both the nature and source of the  unreconciled transactions \u201cplug\u201d by financial area and by agency.

The Reconciliation Statement  begins with the net operating cost amount reported in the Statement of  Operations and Changes in Net Position. The fiscal year 2003 amount  includes a net $24.5 billion labeled as \u201cunreconciled transactions,\u201d which  was needed to balance the consolidated financial statements.  The  Reconciliation Statement ends with the budget deficit amount, and is  intended to show key reconciling items between the two amounts. For  fiscal year 2003, Treasury included this $24.5 billion net unreconciled  transactions balance as part of the net operating cost, which indicated that  this amount is attributable to fiscal year 2003 activity. We maintain that the  $24.5 billion should have been included as a reconciling item in the  Reconciliation Statement because the fiscal year 2003 budget deficit, the  amount being reconciled to, did not include this $24.5 billion amount.", "While Treasury agreed that it could always improve its Reconciliation  Statement, Treasury stated that it took exception to our finding that the  amounts identified as changes in the balance sheet items are incorrect.  We  did not report such a finding. Instead, as part of the fiscal year 2002 audit,  we reported that Treasury\u2019s process for preparing the Reconciliation  Statement did not ensure completeness of reporting or ascertain the  consistency of all the amounts reported in the Reconciliation Statement  with the related balance sheet line items, related notes, or federal agencies\u2019  financial statements. We stated that we performed an analysis to determine  whether all applicable components reported in the other statements (and  related note disclosures) included in the CFS were properly reflected in the  Reconciliation Statement.  For the fiscal year 2002 audit, we found about  $21 billion of net changes in various line item account balances on the  balance sheet between fiscal year 2002 and 2001 that were not explained on  either the Reconciliation Statement or the Statement of Changes in Cash  Balance.  For example, the Reconciliation Statement reported annual  depreciation expense ($20.5 billion) and total capitalized fixed assets  ($40.9 billion) as the components of the net change in property, plant, and  equipment from fiscal year 2001. Although these activities accounted for a  net increase of $20.4 billion, the balance sheet reflected a smaller net  increase, $18 billion; Treasury was unable to explain the remaining   $2.4 billion of the net change.", "Treasury stated that our preference for more detail flow information in the  statements is not something that it plans to do. We did not state this as a  preference. Instead, as part of our fiscal year 2002 audit, we reported that  Treasury did not establish a reporting materiality threshold for purposes of  collecting and reporting information in the Reconciliation Statement. For  example, some items were reported simply as a net \u201cincrease/decrease\u201d  without considering how material, both quantitatively and qualitatively, the  gross changes were.

As we stated last year as part of our fiscal year 2002 audit, we were not  calling for Treasury to use federal agencies\u2019 financial statements to  prepare the Statement of Changes in Cash Balance.  Instead, we  recommended that Treasury collect certain information already  reported in federal agencies\u2019 audited financial statements and develop  procedures that ensure consistency of the significant line items on the  Statement of Changes in Cash Balance with the agency-reported  information.  As we stated in our fiscal year 2002 report, Treasury has  expressed the belief that the information it maintains in its system is  materially reliable.  However, federal agencies also believe their  amounts are materially reliable and are supported by unqualified audit  opinions on their financial statements.   4. Our example is appropriate. As stated in this report, we found that the  total operating cash amount reported in the Statement of Changes in  Cash Balance did not link to the underlying agencies\u2019 operating cash  reported in their financial statements. Our analysis showed that  Treasury reported operating cash in its own financial statements of   $51 billion but reported only $35 billion of operating cash in the  Statement of Changes in Cash Balance in the CFS. Treasury attributes  the difference to time deposits and other cash items which are included  in Treasury\u2019s department wide financial statements as components of  operating cash, but are reported in the CFS separately from operating  cash.  In that Treasury is the preparer of the CFS, we see this  inconsistency as a relevant example. 5. As part of our audit of the fiscal year 2002 CFS, we found that 2 of the  30 federal agencies\u2019 management representation letters we had  reviewed had discrepancies between what the auditor found and what  the agency represented in its management representation letter.  Treasury needs to be aware of these types of discrepancies and their  resolution in order to determine the effects, if any, on the  representations made in the management representation letter for the  CFS. 6. As part of our audit of the fiscal year 2002 CFS, we found that 8 of the  30 federal agencies\u2019 management representation letters we had  reviewed were not signed by the appropriate level of management.  Treasury has a responsibility to determine that the agency management  representation letters are signed by the highest-level agency officials  that are responsible for and knowledgeable about the matters included  in the agency management representation letter because Treasury is  relying on federal agencies\u2019 representations in the management  representations letter for the CFS. 7. As part of our audit of the fiscal year 2002 CFS, we found that 25 of the  30 federal agencies\u2019 management representation letters we had  reviewed did not disclose the materiality thresholds used by  management in determining items to be included in the letter.  Treasury  stated that the audit standards do not require these amounts to be  included in the management representation letter. While we agree that  the standards do not require the materiality amounts to be included, we  require Treasury and OMB to include a materiality threshold in the  management representation letter for the CFS. Therefore, without  assessing the materiality thresholds used by federal agencies in their  management representation letters, we are unsure as to how Treasury  and OMB can ensure that the representations made to GAO at the  governmentwide level are within the materiality thresholds they state  in the management representation letter for the CFS. 8. Materiality is one of several tools the auditor uses to determine that the  nature, timing, and extent of procedures are appropriate. Materiality is  a matter of the auditors\u2019 professional judgment, influenced by the needs  of the reasonable person relying on the financial statements, and is not  negotiated between the auditors and their clients. The management  representation letter findings we reported as part of our fiscal year 2002  audit have also been communicated to agency auditors and we will  continue to work with them to resolve these issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Mission", "paragraphs": ["The Government Accountability Office, the audit, evaluation and  investigative arm of Congress, exists to support Congress in meeting its  constitutional responsibilities and to help improve the performance and  accountability of the federal government for the American people.
