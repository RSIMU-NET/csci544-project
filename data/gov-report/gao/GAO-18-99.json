For example, a lithium program manager has not yet been assigned, and all the other programs have identified the need for additional staff beyond the one or two staff currently assigned to each. According to officials, competing agency priorities and perceived staffing limits are the primary impediments to assigning more staff to these programs. However, GAO also found that NNSA has not determined the critical skills and competencies needed for these programs. GAO's prior work has identified certain activities or practices that can help an agency strategically manage its human capital. These activities include determining the critical skills and competencies that will be needed to achieve the program's mission and developing strategies to address gaps in the number, deployment, and alignment of staff needed.

These missions include ensuring a safe, secure, and reliable  nuclear deterrent; achieving designated reductions in the nuclear  weapons stockpile; and supporting the nation\u2019s nuclear nonproliferation  efforts. Managing these missions is the responsibility of the National  Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a separately organized agency  within DOE. To carry out this responsibility, NNSA must ensure a  sustainable supply of these materials, which NNSA calls strategic  materials. For example, NNSA is seeking to establish a new capability to  enrich uranium\u2014a capability that it lost with the 2013 closure of the aging  Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Paducah, Kentucky\u2014to sustain the production  of tritium.", "NNSA has established programs for ensuring the supply of each of these  four strategic materials, as well as a separate strategic materials program  specifically to develop the new domestic uranium enrichment capability.  NNSA\u2019s Office of Defense Programs, responsible for implementing  NNSA\u2019s stockpile mission, in 2014 and 2015 named federal program  managers to oversee the uranium, domestic uranium enrichment,  plutonium, and tritium programs and has designated a lead point of  contact for the lithium program. As we reported in November 2016,  program managers play key roles in the federal government, including  overseeing contracts to help agencies get what they need at the right time  and at a reasonable price.", "The strategic materials program managers and lithium lead point of  contact are responsible for complex programs that may take decades and  cost billions of dollars to execute and that often include the design and  construction of major projects (i.e., those with an estimated cost of $750  million or greater). Such projects include the Uranium Processing Facility  (UPF), which is under construction in Tennessee to replace and  modernize a portion of NNSA\u2019s enriched uranium capabilities, and a  variety of activities to replace the capabilities of the Chemistry and  Metallurgy Research Facility\u2014built in the 1950s\u2014in New Mexico for  conducting plutonium analysis.

To review NNSA\u2019s definition of strategic materials program manager roles  and responsibilities, we reviewed the NNSA memorandums that created  and described strategic materials program manager positions, where  applicable, as well as NNSA\u2019s 2017 Program Management Policy for  Weapons and Strategic Materials Programs. To examine NNSA\u2019s  progress toward implementing program requirements for its strategic  materials programs, we obtained and reviewed all of the documents that  NNSA programs had completed as of June 2017 in response to  requirements contained in NNSA\u2019s 2017 Program Management Policy for  Weapons and Strategic Materials Programs. In addition, we obtained and  reviewed documents for a nonprobability sample of 22 of the 65 total  requirements that strategic materials programs must implement based on  NNSA\u2019s 2016 Program Execution Instruction. This sample included key  documents such as program plans and the work breakdown structures for  all of the strategic materials programs. The results of our review of this  sample of requirements are not generalizable but represent illustrative  examples of NNSA\u2019s progress. NNSA also identified a number of  documents that were still being developed in response to both sets of  requirements. We interviewed all four of NNSA\u2019s appointed strategic  materials managers and the lithium lead point of contact, as well as other  NNSA officials to better understand the steps NNSA had taken as of  September 2017 to implement these requirements. We also reviewed  NNSA\u2019s budget requests for fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018 and other  relevant agency documents, such as strategies and implementation plans  for the strategic materials programs.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2016 to November 2017  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The programs often include (1) building unique new facilities, (2)  modifying and repairing existing facilities and equipment, and (3)  developing and deploying new technologies for processing and producing  strategic nuclear materials. The programs may involve multiple NNSA  and DOE sites and multiple facilities at a given site. For example, since  the days of the Manhattan Project, a large portion of the nation\u2019s uranium  mission has been executed at the Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak  Ridge, Tennessee, with uranium production and associated operations  housed in several nuclear facilities within the complex. These facilities are  in some cases more than 60 years old. NNSA\u2019s uranium program is  coordinating efforts to build the UPF, invest in the infrastructure of  existing facilities to extend their lives, and develop and deploy several  new technologies that are expected to increase the efficiency and  effectiveness of uranium processing. Collectively, these uranium program  activities may take more than 2 decades to implement and cost several  billion dollars.", "NNSA\u2019s 2017 future-years nuclear security program estimate projected  that NNSA would need about $1.4 billion in fiscal year 2018 to carry out  its annual activities associated with the management of these strategic  materials programs (see table 1). NNSA documents indicate that the  agency expects to spend about $7.7 billion over the next 5 years on  activities related to managing its strategic materials. This spending, which  would represent about 12 percent of the approximately $63 billion NNSA  expects to spend on all weapons activities over this same time period,  includes: $4.8 billion for costs related to construction of facilities and other  capital equipment purchases that will be used to support the strategic  materials mission; and $2.9 billion for program costs related to general activities such as  reducing risk and ensuring sufficient supply, as well as the  consolidation, disposition, tracking, and accounting of nuclear  materials.", "Program managers are an important part of the federal government\u2019s  workforce. They interact with the managers of individual projects to  provide support and guidance on those projects but also must take a  broad view of the overall objectives of programs and an agency\u2019s  organizational culture. According to leading practices outlined by the  Project Management Institute, organizations develop program plans,  capture and understand stakeholder needs, and establish processes for  maintaining program management oversight, among other activities.  Recognizing the importance of improving program management, in  December 2016 the President signed the \u2018\u2018Program Management  Improvement Accountability Act\u201d that required the Office of Management  and Budget to, among other things, adopt and oversee implementation of  government-wide standards, policies, and guidelines for program and  project management for executive agencies and assess the quality and  effectiveness of program management for these agencies. We have  previously reported on DOE\u2019s and NNSA\u2019s program management  challenges.", "In March 2009, we found that NNSA and the Department of Defense  (DOD) established unrealistic schedules, did not establish consistent  cost baselines, and did not effectively manage technical risks in some  of their nuclear weapon life extension programs. These problems  resulted in delays, additional expenditures, difficulties tracking the  cost of the programs, and difficulties in meeting all of NNSA\u2019s and  DOD\u2019s technical objectives. We recommended that NNSA develop  and use consistent budget assumptions and criteria for the baseline to  track costs over time, among other actions. NNSA agreed with our  recommendations and made changes to its cost estimating  procedures.", "In November 2014, we found that the lack of requirements for  programs meant that DOE could not ensure that it was developing  fully credible cost estimates for programs. We recommended that  DOE revise its program management directives to require that  programs develop life-cycle cost estimates in accordance with our 12  cost-estimating best practice steps. DOE agreed with our  recommendation but has not yet incorporated the best practice steps  into its program management directives.", "In February 2016, we found that the B61-12 life extension program,  the most complex such program NNSA has undertaken to date, faces  ongoing management challenges in some areas, including staff  shortfalls and an earned value management system that has yet to be  tested. We did not make any recommendations but reiterated  previous recommendations such as those already mentioned.", "In November 2016, we found that DOE and NNSA had not  established organization-wide policies or practices addressing leading  practices related to program management, and we recommended that  DOE do so. DOE did not agree or disagree with this  recommendation. NNSA, however, in late 2016 instituted a training  program for program management.", "NNSA\u2019s stockpile stewardship program has established strategic  materials as one of the major elements to sustain the nation\u2019s nuclear  weapons stockpile. According to NNSA budget documents, the strategic  materials programs help ensure the sustainment of nuclear material  processing capabilities and fund the stabilization, consolidation,  disposition, tracking, and accounting of nuclear materials. Strategic  materials are generally not available, or are available only in limited  quantities, from commercial suppliers because of their specific properties  and use in nuclear weapons or for other national security purposes.  NNSA named strategic material program managers in 2014 and 2015 to  integrate, oversee, plan, and execute material strategies for uranium  (including domestic uranium enrichment), plutonium, and tritium.", "In addition to the general program management challenges highlighted  above, we have also reported previously on challenges facing NNSA\u2019s  strategic materials programs:  In July 2015, we found that NNSA had identified various challenges in  its lithium production strategy that may impact its ability to meet  demand for lithium in the future. These challenges included  insufficient supply of lithium material and constraints facing NNSA\u2019s  efforts to replace the aging lithium production facility. We  recommended that NNSA objectively consider all alternatives, without  preference for a particular solution, as it proceeds with its analysis of  alternatives process. NNSA neither agreed nor disagreed with our  recommendation but did undertake a formal analysis of alternatives in  2017, according to NNSA officials.", "In August 2016, we found that NNSA had not documented important  requirements for its plutonium program at Los Alamos National  Laboratory in New Mexico.

Collectively  these documents set documentation requirements as well as established  the roles and responsibilities of the strategic materials program  managers. According to NNSA officials, these requirements apply to each  of the programs, including the lithium program. These requirements are  outlined below.", "Program Execution Instruction (2016) \u2013 In January 2016, NNSA  approved a Program Execution Instruction that defines requirements  for carrying out NNSA defense programs, such as the strategic  materials programs. This instruction outlines a series of  requirements that vary based on the categorization\u2014and therefore  the rigor\u2014of management applied to a program. Of the four  categories outlined in the instruction\u2014Standard Management,  Enhanced Management A, Enhanced Management B, and Capital  Acquisition Management\u2014NNSA has generally designated the  strategic materials programs as \u201cEnhanced Management B,\u201d the most  rigorous designation applicable to this type of program, according to  NNSA officials. The \u201cEnhanced Management B\u201d programs are  required to have the following elements documented: a program plan,  a work breakdown structure that details the work elements necessary  to organize the total work scope with cost estimates, a decision  analysis, an integrated master schedule that includes the entire scope  of work required for the program\u2019s successful execution, a  performance management approach, and a lessons learned/best  practices review. According to the instruction, if the scope, cost, and  schedule of a program are more complex, moving to a more rigorous  program management category is often required. According to the  instruction, when enhanced complexity and risk are associated with a  program, among other things, \u201cEnhanced Management B\u201d is the  appropriate designation. The instruction also allows for programs to  \u201ctailor,\u201d or modify, the application of certain requirements depending  on risk and other factors.", "Program Management Policy for Weapons and Strategic  Materials Programs (2017) \u2013 NNSA issued a program management  policy in January 2017 that defines general roles and responsibilities  for all four strategic materials program managers. This policy  broadly outlines the managers\u2019 authority and responsibilities for  managing the strategic materials; these responsibilities include  developing program documentation and managing risk. According to  NNSA officials we interviewed, the policy is based on NNSA\u2019s  experience in implementing the uranium program in 2014. The policy  requires each of the strategic materials programs to develop a  number of guidance documents, including a mission strategy, mission  requirements, and a technology development plan.

NNSA officials identified documents for each program, including mission  strategy, mission requirements, program plan, and work breakdown  structure. For the other programs, according to agency officials, NNSA is  still working to meet these requirements, though the tritium program met  all requirements during the course of this review. More specifically,  according to agency officials:", "The plutonium sustainment program has met some of the Program  Execution Instruction requirements to date, including having in place a  program plan, work breakdown structure, and decision analysis, but  not an integrated master schedule (although one is being developed,  according to agency officials). The plutonium program also has a  mission strategy in place, as called for by the Program Management  Policy for Weapons and Strategic Materials, but has not yet met the  other strategic materials program management requirements.

According to  NNSA officials, all of the strategic materials programs have been  assigned relatively few federal staff to implement the programs. The  officials also said that while they plan to have all five strategic materials  programs fully meet the requirements and operate as cohesive programs,  the lack of staff has hampered their efforts to do so. For example, the  plutonium manager said more staff were needed to successfully  implement the program, and the lithium lead point of contact said that at  least two full-time staff members would be required to accomplish the  work needed to make the lithium program meet program requirements.  Specifically, according to agency officials as of October 2017, in addition  to contractor support:  the uranium program had the program manager and two federal  staff assigned;  the domestic uranium enrichment program had the program  manager and one federal staff assigned;  the plutonium program had the program manager and one federal  staff member;  the tritium program had the program manager and no dedicated  staff, relying instead on staff in other programs such as a federal  program manager from a different program who acts as staff for this  program; and  the lithium program had the lead point of contact and no dedicated  staff, although a contracted senior technical advisor provides some  support.", "NNSA officials cited competing agency priorities and current perceived  staffing limits as the primary impediments to assigning more staff to these  programs. First, according to agency officials, the relative newness of the  strategic materials programs and competing agency priorities to  modernize the nuclear weapons infrastructure and modernize and extend  the lives of current nuclear weapons have meant that federal staff are in  high demand across the agency. This concern is consistent with issues  we have identified in our past work as well. For example, in April 2017,  we noted NNSA\u2019s ambitious, costly, decades-long effort to modernize the  nation\u2019s nuclear security enterprise. In addition to ongoing and planned  infrastructure modernization, some of which is associated with the  strategic materials programs, this modernization includes four ongoing  expensive weapons refurbishments and efforts to improve the agency\u2019s  research, development, testing, and evaluation capabilities by, for  example, continuing efforts in advanced modeling, simulation, and  computing. Similarly, we found in September 2016 that the competing  agency priorities for infrastructure modernization and weapons  refurbishments had negatively affected another NNSA program: the  Enhanced Surveillance Program.", "Second, NNSA officials said that they have limited flexibility when it  comes to increasing federal staff levels. Specifically, in each year that the  total number of federal employees at NNSA exceeds 1,690, the  Administrator is required by law to submit to the congressional defense  committees a report justifying such excess. In the NNSA Administrator\u2019s  testimony before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and  Water Development in June 2017, he stated that since 2010, NNSA\u2019s  program funding had increased 28 percent, while its federal staffing levels  had decreased by 17 percent. He said that initial results from a yet-to-be- completed study by the Office of Personnel Management in support of the  Reform of Government Initiative indicate the need for a 20 percent  increase in federal staff at NNSA.", "We have also previously reported that staffing shortages have affected  NNSA\u2019s efforts to improve management capability. For example, we  reported in October 2014 that NNSA determined that inadequate levels of  federal staff had contributed to management problems with the UPF  project. As a result, NNSA increased staffing levels for the UPF project  office from 9 full-time equivalents in 2012 to more than 50 as of January  2014. According to NNSA officials, the additional staff enabled NNSA to  conduct more robust oversight of the contractor\u2019s design efforts than was  previously possible. Similarly, in 2016, we found that the B61-12 life  extension program, the most costly and complex such program  undertaken to date, successfully requested that NNSA enlarge its  program office staff from 3 to 8 full-time equivalent staff to provide more  management capability. However, we found that even with this increase  in federal staff, some NNSA and DOD officials said that they believe that  NNSA needs two to three times more personnel in the federal program  manager\u2019s office to ensure sufficient federal management and oversight.", "One area that we noted in this review is that with regard to the strategic  materials programs, NNSA has not conducted a workforce needs  assessment. Strategic materials program officials acknowledged that they  had neither specifically assessed the number or skills of staff needed to  manage the strategic materials programs, nor did they have current plans  to do such an assessment. Our prior work on strategic human capital  management has identified certain activities or practices that can help an  agency strategically manage its human capital. These activities include  determining the critical skills and competencies that will be needed to  achieve the programs\u2019 missions and developing strategies to address  gaps in the number, deployment, and alignment of staff needed. NNSA  officials said that individual offices have attempted over time to assess  resource and skill needs but that these efforts have been hampered by,  among other things, a lack of staff. By determining the critical skills and  competencies needed to achieve each strategic material program\u2019s  mission and using this determination to develop strategies to address any  gaps in the number, deployment, and alignment of staff needed, NNSA  may find it has better information to justify increased staffing levels for its  strategic materials programs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Since 2014, NNSA has taken steps to establish programs to maintain and  modernize the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons stockpile, including appointing  federal program managers for four of the five strategic materials  programs, as well as steps to establish and organize the programs  according to internal program management requirements.

Although NNSA  has estimated that stocks are sufficient for projected needs, existing  uranium needs to be purified, machined, and recovered from existing  operations. The Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge,  Tennessee, is the NNSA site for conducting enriched uranium  activities, producing uranium-related components for nuclear  warheads and bombs, and processing feedstock for nuclear fuel for  the U.S. Navy. In 2004, NNSA decided to construct a new Uranium  Processing Facility (UPF) that consolidated the functions of four  separate uranium facilities into a single building. In 2014, NNSA, on  the advice of a peer review team, decided to pursue a uranium  program that includes a smaller UPF and, among other program  elements, modifications to existing uranium buildings and capabilities  to include several new uranium processing technologies. Construction  on the UPF continues at the Y-12 site, and NNSA continues to  request funds for that project. Fiscal year 2018 funds are to be used  for construction of some related subprojects. According to NNSA  officials, the UPF is expected to be complete by 2025 and cost no  more than $6.5 billion.

NNSA estimated that the CMRR project would cost from $2.4 billion to  $2.9 billion and be completed by 2024. In addition, in November 2015,  DOE approved the mission need for the implementation of the second  part of the strategy: building modular nuclear facilities to add high- hazard, high-security laboratory space at Los Alamos (the Plutonium  Modular Approach) to meet plutonium pit production requirements.  NNSA estimated that the Plutonium Modular Approach could cost  from $1.3 billion to $3.0 billion and be completed by the end of 2027.", "Tritium \u2013 NNSA has relied on tritium produced many years ago;  recycling and recovery of existing tritium is currently the source of  most of the tritium in the stockpile, according to NNSA officials.  However, tritium decays relatively rapidly, and in 2015 NNSA  identified a need to produce additional tritium. To produce tritium,  lithium target rods\u2014called tritium-producing burnable absorber rods\u2014 are irradiated in TVA\u2019s reactors. The irradiated rods are transported to  DOE\u2019s Tritium Extraction Facility at the Savannah River Site in South  Carolina, where they are processed in a specialized facility to extract  and then prepare the tritium for nuclear warheads. NNSA requested  $9.8 million in design funds in fiscal year 2018 for construction of a  new tritium production capability. In its fiscal year 2018 budget  request, NNSA estimated that this facility would cost about $425  million and be approved for operations in 2027.", "Lithium \u2013 Lithium is a key component of nuclear weapons and is  essential for their refurbishment. NNSA has a sufficient supply of  enriched lithium-6 (the isotope used in refurbishments and for tritium  production), but that lithium is stored in another form and must  undergo complex processing before it can be used for these  purposes. NNSA halted certain aspects of its lithium processing  operation\u2014conducted at its Y-12 site in Oak Ridge, Tennessee\u2014in  May 2013 due to the condition of the site\u2019s 72-year-old lithium  production facility. Currently, NNSA is relying on a less complex but  also less efficient process that results in a loss of approximately 50  percent of material. In 2013, NNSA developed a lithium production  strategy that proposed a new lithium production facility, which the  agency estimated would cost more than $500 million. NNSA plans to  request $30.4 million in fiscal year 2019 for construction of this facility.  This strategy includes sustaining current infrastructure and deploying  new technologies to sustain lithium production."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the National Nuclear Security Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact above, Jonathan Gill (Assistant Director), Alisa  Beyninson, Antoinette Capaccio, Jeff Larson, Cynthia Norris, and Kiki  Theodoropoulos made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Modernizing the Nuclear Security Enterprise: A Complete Scope of Work  Is Needed to Develop Timely Cost and Schedule Information for the  Uranium Program.
