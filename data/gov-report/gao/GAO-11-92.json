In fiscal year 2009, 9 federal agencies spent approximately $18 billion to administer 47 programs--an increase of 3 programs and roughly $5 billion since our 2003 report. This increase is due to temporary Recovery Act funding. Nearly all programs track multiple outcome measures, but only five programs have had an impact study completed since 2004 to assess whether outcomes resulted from the program and not some other cause. Almost all federal employment and training programs, including those with broader missions such as multipurpose block grants, overlap with at least one other program in that they provide similar services to similar populations. These programs most commonly target Native Americans, veterans, and youth, and some require participants to be economically disadvantaged. Although the extent to which individuals receive the same employment and training services from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Employment Service (ES), and Workforce Investment Act Adult (WIA Adult) programs is unknown, the programs maintain separate administrative structures to provide some of the same services, such as job search assistance, to low-income individuals. Agency officials acknowledged that greater administrative efficiencies could be achieved in delivering these services, but said factors, such as the number of clients that any one-stop center can serve and one-stops' proximity to clients, particularly in rural areas, could warrant having multiple entities provide the same services. Options that may increase efficiencies include colocating services and consolidating administrative structures, but implementation may pose challenges. While WIA Adult and ES services are generally colocated in one-stop centers, TANF employment services are colocated in one-stops to a lesser extent. Florida, Texas, and Utah have consolidated their welfare and workforce agencies, and state officials said this reduced costs and improved services, but they could not provide a dollar figure for cost savings. An obstacle to further progress in achieving greater administrative efficiencies is that little information is available about the strategies and results of such initiatives. In addition, little is known about the incentives states and localities have to undertake such initiatives and whether additional incentives may be needed. Labor and HHS should disseminate information about state efforts to consolidate administrative structures and colocate services and, as warranted, identify options for increasing incentives to undertake these initiatives. In their comments, Labor and HHS agreed that they should disseminate this information."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Federally funded employment and training programs serve an important  role in our society by helping job seekers enhance their job skills, identify  job opportunities, and obtain employment. Many federal agencies  administer these programs, including the Departments of Labor,  Education, and Health and Human Services (HHS). In the 1990s, we issued  a series of reports that raised questions about the efficiency and  effectiveness of the federally funded employment and training system and  concluded that a structural overhaul and consolidation of these programs  were needed. In 1998, partly in response to concerns regarding the  fragmented employment and training system, Congress passed the  Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA). One of WIA\u2019s primary features is  to foster closer coordination of employment and training programs by  requiring a centralized service delivery system through one-stop centers;  however, only a few employment and training programs have been  consolidated. In 2000 and 2003, we issued reports that focused on those  programs whose primary purpose was employment and training, and we  provided information on the size of these programs and overlap among  them. Because of higher unemployment rates during these challenging  economic times and the potential reauthorization of WIA, you asked us to  update the 2003 study, examine changes to these programs under the  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act), and  report on what is known about the programs\u2019 performance.", "Our objectives were to determine: (1) whether the number of federal  employment and training programs and funding for them have changed  since our 2003 report, (2) what kinds of outcome measures the programs  use and what is known about program effectiveness, (3) the extent to  which the programs provide similar services to similar populations, (4) the  extent to which duplication may exist among selected large programs, and  (5) what options exist for increasing efficiencies among these programs.", "To address the first three objectives, we identified employment and  training programs by consulting with federal agency officials, searching  the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA), and reviewing the  Recovery Act. In searching for programs, we used the same definition of  an employment and training program as used in the two most recent GAO  reports\u2014a program that is specifically designed to enhance the specific  job skills of individuals in order to increase their employability, identify  job opportunities, and/or help job seekers obtain employment. We  excluded certain programs that did not meet this definition, did not  provide employment and training services, or were components of other  employment and training programs. We included programs with broader  missions if a primary purpose of the program was to provide employment  and training assistance, including multipurpose block grants and career  and technical education programs. Once we developed the list of  programs, we vetted it with officials in each agency. We then surveyed  agency officials to gather detailed information about the programs. Our  survey questions asked officials to identify the programs\u2019 appropriations,  the amount of funds used to provide employment and training services,  whether the programs were modified by the Recovery Act, how many  individuals were served by the programs, and the target populations and  services associated with each program. Our questionnaire also asked  program officials to identify program outcome measures and any studies  of program performance published since 2004, characterize the type of  study, and provide a copy of the study or a citation. We then reviewed the  studies\u2019 methodologies to determine whether they met the definition of an  impact study.", "To address objectives four and five, we used findings from our prior work  to identify programs that had the potential for duplication based on a high  degree of overlap and were among the largest in terms of funding  employment and training activities. Using this approach, we selected the  Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Employment  Service/Wagner-Peyser Funded Activities (ES), and Workforce Investment  Act Adult (WIA Adult) programs for further review. We reviewed financial  information and conducted interviews with federal agency officials to  determine the extent to which the programs duplicate efforts with respect  to their employment and training activities. We reviewed relevant reports  and interviewed officials from other organizations familiar with these  programs: the Center for Law and Social Policy, the American Public  Human Services Association, and the National Governors Association and  reviewed relevant reports. We also reviewed documentation and  conducted interviews with officials in Florida, Texas, and Utah, three of  the states that are considered to be the furthest along in their efforts to  consolidate the administrative structures for these and other programs.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2009 through  January 2011 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

WIA repealed  the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), effective July 1, 2000, and  replaced JTPA programs for economically disadvantaged adults and  youths and dislocated workers with three new programs\u2014WIA Adult, WIA  Dislocated Worker, and WIA Youth. In an effort that coordinated service  delivery for employment and training programs, WIA established one-stop  centers in all states and mandated that numerous programs provide their  services through the centers. Unlike the JTPA adult program, WIA  imposes no income eligibility requirements for adult applicants receiving  any of its \u201ccore\u201d services, such as job search assistance and employment  counseling and assessment. Any person visiting a one-stop center may  look for a job, receive career development services, and gain access to a  range of vocational education programs. While WIA consolidated the JTPA  youth programs and strengthened the service delivery of key workforce  development programs, most employment and training programs remain  separately funded and continue to be operated by various agencies.", "We have previously issued reports on overlap in multiple employment and  training programs. During the 1990s, we issued a series of reports that  documented program overlap among federally funded employment and  training programs and identified areas where inefficiencies might result.  We reported that overlap among federally funded employment and training  programs raised questions about the efficient and effective use of  resources. We also reported that program overlap might hinder people  from seeking assistance and frustrate employers and program  administrators. In 2000 and 2003, we reviewed the workforce development  system and identified federally funded employment and training programs  for which a key program goal was providing employment and training  assistance. Our 2003 report identified 44 programs administered by nine  federal agencies that provided a range of employment and training  services. While many of the programs were the same as those included in  the 2000 report, 10 programs were newly identified and 6 previously  identified programs had been discontinued since 2000."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Since Our 2003 Report, the Number of Federal Employment and Training Programs and Funding for Them Have Increased Due to the Recovery Act", "paragraphs": ["The number of employment and training programs and their funding have  increased since our 2003 report when we last reported on them. For  fiscal year 2009, we identified 47 employment and training programs  administered across nine agencies (see figure 1). Together, these programs  spent approximately $18 billion on employment and training services in  fiscal year 2009, according to our survey data. This is an increase of 3  programs and about $5 billion from our 2003 report. Adjusting for  inflation, the amount of the increase is about $2 billion. We estimate based  on survey responses that this increase is likely due to temporary funding  from the Recovery Act for 14 of the 47 programs we identified (see figure  2). In addition to increasing funding for existing programs, the Recovery  Act also created 3 new programs and modified several existing programs\u2019  target population groups and eligibility requirements, according to agency  officials. For example, the Recovery Act modified the Trade Adjustment  Assistance program by expanding group eligibility to include certain  dislocated service workers who were impacted by foreign trade.", "Officials from most programs reported using almost all their funds for  employment and training, although some programs with broader goals,  including multipurpose block grants, used lesser amounts. Twenty-seven  programs estimated that they used 90 percent or more of their fiscal year  2009 appropriation on employment and training services. Fifteen of these  programs reported that they used 100 percent of their funds on  employment and training services. Some programs that used less than 90  percent of their fiscal year 2009 appropriations on employment and  training services may have broader goals (see table 1). For example,  across all programs, the TANF program used the lowest percentage of its  appropriations on employment and training activities, about 8 percent.  This is not surprising, given that employment is only one aspect of the  TANF program, which has several broad social service goals, including  providing cash assistance to low-income families with children. However,  the amount TANF spends on employment and training activities is among  the largest of the programs we surveyed. In addition, Education officials  stated that their career and technical education programs emphasize  education, as opposed to employment and training.", "Our survey data showed that 7 programs accounted for about three- fourths of the $18 billion spent on employment and training services in  fiscal year 2009 (see figure 3). The largest of the 7, Rehabilitation  Services\u2014Vocational Rehabilitation Grants to States, operated by  Education, used about $3 billion in fiscal year 2009 to fund employment  and training services for individuals with disabilities. The other 6 programs  from this group are administered by Labor and HHS. The remaining one- fourth of the amount spent on employment and training in fiscal year 2009  was spent by the remaining programs.", "WIA Youth Activities (Labor)", "TANF (HHS)", "Job Corps (Labor)", "WIA Adult Program (Labor)", "Employment Service/Wagner-Peyser Funded Activities (Labor)", "Our survey data showed that most participants received employment and  training services through one of two programs: Employment  Service/Wagner-Peyser Funded Activities and the WIA Adult Program.  These programs accounted for about 77 percent of the total number of  participants served across all programs. Each of these programs reported  serving more than 1 million individuals. In contrast to these larger  programs, 7 programs each reported serving fewer than 5,000 individuals.", "See appendix IV for a detailed list of the number of individuals served by  each employment and training program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Nearly All Programs Track Multiple Outcome Measures, but Little is Known about Program Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["Almost all programs tracked multiple outcome measures related to  employment and training, and many programs tracked similar measures.  Forty-one of the 47 programs tracked at least three outcome measures in  fiscal year 2009, according to officials. The most frequently tracked  outcome measure was \u201centered employment\u201d\u2014the number of program  participants who found jobs (see table 2). Many programs also tracked  \u201cemployment retention\u201d and \u201cwage gain or change.\u201d These are the types of  measures developed under the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB)  common measures initiative, which sought to unify definitions for  performance across programs with similar goals. Three programs did not  track any outcome measures at the federal level in fiscal year 2009. For a  detailed list of outcome measures tracked by federal employment and  training programs, see appendix V.", "In addition, officials from 4 of the 14 programs that received Recovery Act  funding in fiscal year 2009 reported that the Act modified the outcome  measures tracked by their programs. However, these modifications  generally applied only to the outcomes for participants in activities funded  by the Act. For example, a Job Corps official noted that the program is  required to track the number of \u201cgreen graduates\u201d who complete Recovery  Act-funded \u201cgreen training\u201d for jobs in industries such as renewable  resources and green construction.", "Little is known about the effectiveness of the employment and training  programs we identified because only 5 reported demonstrating whether  outcomes can be attributed to the program through an impact study, and  about half of all the programs have not had a performance review since  2004. Impact studies, which many researchers consider to be the best  method for determining the extent to which a program is causing  participant outcomes, can be difficult and expensive to conduct, as they  take steps to examine what would have happened in the absence of a  program to isolate its impact from other factors. Based on our survey of  agency officials, we determined that only 5 of the 47 programs have had  impact studies that assess whether the program is responsible for  improved employment outcomes (see appendix VI). The five impact  studies generally found that the effects of participation were not  consistent across programs, with only some demonstrating positive  impacts that tended to be small, inconclusive, or restricted to short-term  impacts. For example, while we have previously reported that a  considerable body of research has suggested that welfare-to-work  programs can effectively increase employment entry and reduce welfare  receipt, a more recent study cited by a TANF program official found  services targeted at TANF recipients to be largely ineffective in producing  positive employment retention and advancement outcomes and, where  impacts were found, they tended to be substantively small, with many  families remaining in poverty. A study of the WIA Adult program found  the program to have shown positive impacts up to 4 years after participant  entry, but noted that the magnitude of this effect could have been due to  the selection of applicants with greater income prior to participation and  better job prospects.", "Officials from the remaining 42 programs cited other types of studies or no  studies at all. Officials from 19 of these programs reported that, since 2004,  some other type of review or study had been conducted to evaluate their  program\u2019s performance with respect to employment and training activities.  These evaluations included assessments by OMB\u2019s Program Assessment  Rating Tool (PART) and nonimpact studies. Officials from 23 of the 47  programs did not identify a study of any kind that assessed program  performance since 2004. However, agencies may have impact studies  currently under way.

Some of these overlapping programs serve multiple  population groups, while others target specific populations. For the  population groups served by these programs and the services they provide,  see appendixes VII, VIII, and IX. In addition, some overlapping programs  require participants to be economically disadvantaged. Even when  programs overlap, the services they provide and the populations they  serve may differ in meaningful ways.", "All 10 programs that serve multiple groups overlap with another program.  For example, a variety of groups\u2014including both employed and  unemployed individuals\u2014can receive employment counseling and  assessment, job readiness skills training, and occupational or vocational  training from three different programs: the Career and Technical  Education\u2014Basic Grants to States program, the Community-Based Job  Training Grants program, and the H-1B Job Training Grants program. In  addition, 3 of the programs that serve multiple groups require participants  to be economically disadvantaged.", "Thirty-four of the 37 programs that serve a primary target population  overlap with another program. In addition, nine of these require  participants to be economically disadvantaged. The target populations  being served by the most programs are Native Americans, veterans, and  youth. For example, all 8 programs that target Native Americans provide  seven similar types of employment and training services (see figure 4).  According to agency officials, 4 of these programs for Native Americans  spent a total of about $93 million on employment and training services in  fiscal year 2009, and 5 of them served a total of about 55,000 participants  in the most recent year for which data were available.", "Similarly, five of the six programs that target veterans provide seven  similar types of employment and training services (see figure 5).  According to agency officials, these six programs spent nearly $1.1 billion  on employment and training services in fiscal year 2009, and served about  823,000 participants in the most recent year for which data were available.", "The five programs that target youth provide seven similar types of  employment and training services (see figure 6). According to agency  officials, four of these programs spent nearly $4.1 billion on employment  and training services in fiscal year 2009, and all five programs served about  360,000 participants in the most recent year for which data were  available.", "Despite this overlap, some individuals within a population group may be  eligible for one program, but not another because program eligibility  criteria differ. For example, one of the programs targeting Native  Americans serves only disabled Native Americans residing on or near a  federal or state reservation, and another program serves only Native  Hawaiians. Similarly, one of the veterans programs serves only homeless  veterans, and another is specifically targeted to servicemembers (and their  spouses) who are near to retirement or separation from the military.", "Some overlapping programs also have slightly different objectives. For  example, while the Community-Based Job Training Grants and H-1B Job  Training Grants programs aim to prepare workers for careers in high- growth industries, the Career and Technical Education\u2014Basic Grants to  States program has as its purpose to more fully develop the academic,  career, and technical skills of secondary and postsecondary students who  enroll in career and technical education programs. Programs that overlap  may also provide similar types of services in different ways. The Job Corps  program, for example, provides academic instruction and job training in a  variety of fields to at-risk youth who live at federally funded campuses,  while the YouthBuild program provides academic instruction and job  training in construction to disadvantaged youth in their own communities.", "Officials from 27 of the 47 programs reported that their agencies have  coordinated efforts with other federal agencies that provide similar  services to similar populations. For example, the Departments of Labor  and Health and Human Services issued a joint letter encouraging state- administered youth programs to partner together using Recovery Act  funds to promote subsidized employment opportunities. In addition, an  official from the Department of the Interior reported that the agency  works with Labor and HHS to coordinate programs for Native Americans.  Under law, Native American tribes are allowed significant flexibility to  combine funding from multiple programs. An official from an Education  program that serves incarcerated individuals noted that representatives  from the Departments of Education, Labor, and Justice participate in a  federal work group on offender workforce development, and have jointly  sponsored a national conference on this topic.

Labor and HHS officials  acknowledged that greater efficiencies could be achieved in delivering  employment and training services through these programs, but said they  do not believe that these programs are duplicative.", "The TANF, ES, and WIA Adult programs provide some of the same  employment and training services to low-income individuals, despite  differences in the programs\u2019 overall goals and the range of services they  provide. In our interviews with Labor and HHS officials, they  acknowledged that low-income individuals are eligible to receive some of  the same employment and training services\u2014including skills assessment,  job search, and job referral\u2014from both the TANF and WIA Adult  programs. In addition, any individual, including low-income individuals,  can receive job search and job referral services from the ES program. Our  survey results also indicate that these three programs provide some of the  same services (see figure 7). While the TANF program serves low-income  families with children, the ES and WIA Adult programs serve all adults,  including low-income individuals. Specifically, the WIA Adult program  gives priority for intensive and training services to recipients of public  assistance and other low-income individuals when program funds are  limited. All three programs share a common goal of helping individuals  secure employment, and the TANF and WIA Adult programs also aim to  reduce welfare dependency. However, employment is only one aspect of  the TANF program, which also has three other broad social service goals:  to assist needy families so that children can generally be cared for in their  own homes, to reduce and prevent out-of-wedlock pregnancies, and to  encourage the formation and maintenance of two-parent families. As a  result, TANF provides a wide range of other services beyond employment  and training, including cash assistance. To reduce dependency, TANF  requires many cash assistance recipients to participate in work activities  such as subsidized employment, on-the-job training, or community  service.", "Recent PART reviews of these programs had similar findings regarding the  programs\u2019 commonalities. The most recent PART reviews of the ES and  WIA Adult programs\u2014conducted in 2004 and 2005, respectively\u2014also  found that these programs provide some of the same services, and the WIA  Adult review found that the program duplicates some job training services  offered by TANF. The most recent PART review of the TANF program,  conducted in 2005, similarly noted that states may choose to spend TANF  funds on employment services that mirror those provided under WIA.", "However, the extent to which individuals receive the same employment  and training services from more than one of these programs is unknown.  Labor officials estimated that in program year 2008 approximately 4.5  percent of all WIA Adult participants who received training\u2014about 4,500  of the nearly 100,000 participants who exited the program\u2014were also  receiving TANF. However, this likely underestimated the number of TANF  recipients served by the WIA Adult program, as the program collects  information on TANF receipt only if participants receive intensive or  training services. In addition, according to Labor officials, WIA Adult  participants may choose not to identify themselves as TANF recipients. It  is also unclear whether the WIA Adult participants who self-identify as  TANF recipients have received TANF employment and training services or  other TANF services. Further, HHS officials told us that data are not  available at the federal level on the total number of individuals who  receive TANF employment and training services because HHS lacks the  legal authority to require such reporting. The TANF program requires  states to report data on recipients of TANF assistance who participate in  work activities as defined by program regulations, but HHS lacks the legal  authority to require states to report data on individuals who participate in  work activities but do not receive such assistance. Officials noted that  laws including the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity  Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA)\u2014the legislation that created the  TANF program\u2014limits the information that states must report to HHS.", "The TANF, ES, and WIA Adult programs maintain separate administrative  structures to provide some of the same services to low-income individuals.  At the federal level, the TANF program is administered by the Department  of Health and Human Services, and the ES and WIA Adult programs are  administered by the Department of Labor. At the state level, the TANF  program is typically administered by the state human services or welfare  agency, and the ES and WIA Adult programs are typically administered by  the state workforce agency. By regulation, ES services must be provided  by state employees. At the local level, WIA regulations require at least  one comprehensive one-stop center to be located in every local workforce  investment area. These areas may have the same boundaries as counties,  may be multicounty, or may be within and across county lines. Similarly,  every county typically has a TANF office. TANF employment and training  services may be delivered at TANF offices, in one-stop centers, or through  contracts with for-profit or nonprofit organizations, according to HHS  officials. In one-stop centers, ES staff provide job search and other  services to ES customers, while WIA staff provide job search and other  services to WIA Adult customers.", "Labor and HHS officials acknowledged that greater efficiencies could be  achieved in delivering employment and training services through the  TANF, ES, and WIA Adult programs. A 2005 Labor-commissioned study  stated that operating separate workforce programs under WIA and TANF  duplicates efforts. In interviews, Labor officials acknowledged that  simplifying programs\u2019 administrative structures, while not without  challenges, may allow some states and localities to administer programs  more efficiently. Even so, officials from both agencies emphasized that  under current law states and localities decide how best to deliver services.  For example, since TANF is a block grant program, states have discretion  to deliver services under the type of administrative structure they choose,  and some states may choose more efficient structures than others.", "Nonetheless, HHS and Labor officials said they do not believe that these  programs are duplicative. HHS officials said that capacity, geography, and  the unique needs of TANF clients could warrant having multiple entities  providing the same services, even if they are separately administered. They  noted that one-stop centers may not have the staff, space, or desire to  serve TANF clients; they may be inconveniently located, especially in  predominantly rural states; and they may not be able to address TANF  clients\u2019 multiple needs. HHS officials added that although some of the  employment and training services delivered by the TANF, ES, and WIA  Adult programs at the local level to eligible clients are the same, the ways  services are delivered and the services themselves can vary subtly with  each locality. Labor officials said they have focused on integrating services  to meet clients\u2019 needs and affording states flexibility to respond to local  needs rather than only on program efficiency. Labor officials also noted  that the ES and WIA Adult programs are specific funding streams and as a  result, they are unlikely to fund the same services for the same individuals.  For example, one-stop centers typically use ES funding to provide core  services, such as job search and job referrals, while they typically use WIA  Adult funding to provide intensive and training services. States are  required by WIA to attest in plans they provide to Labor that their ES and  WIA programs have agreements in place to coordinate service delivery  across the two programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Options for Increasing Efficiencies Include Colocating Services and Consolidating Administrative Structures, but Implementation Can Be Challenging", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Colocating Services", "paragraphs": ["Colocating the employment and training services provided by the TANF,  ES, and WIA Adult programs may increase administrative efficiencies.

While WIA does  not require TANF employment and training services to be provided  through one-stop centers, states and localities have the option to include  TANF as a partner in their one-stop systems. We have previously  reported that colocating services\u2014specifically, providing services from  different programs in the same physical location\u2014can result in improved  communication among programs, improved delivery of services for clients,  and elimination of duplication. While colocating services does not  guarantee efficiency improvements, it affords the potential for sharing  resources and cross-training staff, and may lead, in some cases, to the  consolidation of administrative systems, such as information technology  systems. A 2004 study commissioned by HHS found that successful  coordination between WIA programs and the TANF program is promoted  when WIA and TANF staffs are colocated or communicate regularly to  discuss specific cases and policies, and when program management  functions, case management functions, and administrative systems are  shared across agencies.", "Labor and HHS officials told us that they encourage states to consider  colocating TANF employment and training services with ES and WIA  Adult services in one-stop centers, but said that they leave these decisions  up to states. While Labor\u2019s policy is that all mandatory one-stop partner  programs\u2014including the ES and WIA Adult programs\u2014should be  physically colocated in one-stop centers to the extent possible, neither  Labor nor HHS currently has a policy in place that specifically promotes  the colocation of TANF employment and training services in one-stop  centers. According to officials, Labor\u2019s policy is that colocation is one of  multiple means for achieving service integration.", "While ES and WIA Adult services are generally colocated in one-stop  centers, the colocation of TANF employment and training services in one- stop centers is not as widespread. We reported in 2007 that nearly all  states provided ES and WIA Adult services on site in the majority of their  one-stop centers, although nine states also operated at least one  standalone ES office that was unaffiliated with the one-stop system. In  the same 2007 report, we found that 30 states provided the TANF program  on site at a typical comprehensive one-stop center. These states  accounted for 57 percent of the comprehensive one-stop centers  nationwide (see table 3). The remaining 20 states, where the TANF  program was not available on site at a typical comprehensive one-stop  center, accounted for 43 percent of comprehensive one-stop centers. This  is the most recent available data, as Labor and HHS officials told us that  they do not routinely collect data on the extent to which TANF services  are colocated in one-stop centers nationwide, and HHS lacks the authority  to require states to routinely report this information.", "Labor and HHS officials said that states and localities may face challenges  to colocating TANF employment and training services in one-stop centers.  Obstacles to colocation may include those raised earlier, such as capacity  and geography, but may also include leases, differing program cultures,  the need for partner programs to help fund the operating costs of one-stop  centers, and trade-offs regarding the services with which TANF is  colocated. Specifically, HHS officials told us that states and localities may  have multiyear rental contracts for office space and may not have room to  house additional staff. In addition, Labor and HHS officials said that  differences between the client service philosophies of the TANF program  and the ES and WIA Adult programs may present challenges to colocation.  HHS officials noted that the TANF program takes a more holistic approach  to helping individuals become self-sufficient by addressing the variety of  needs that may affect their ability to obtain employment, such as child  care and transportation. The need for partner programs to fund one-stop  center operating costs may also be a challenge to colocation. When TANF  employment and training services are colocated in one-stop centers, TANF  may be expected to contribute to these operating costs, in addition to  paying operating costs associated with providing other TANF services in  other locations.", "Finally, HHS officials noted that when TANF employment and training  services are not colocated in one-stop centers, they are typically colocated  with other services for low-income families, such as SNAP, formerly  known as the Food Stamp Program, and Medicaid. Officials acknowledged  that colocating TANF employment and training services in one-stop  centers may mean that they are no longer colocated with these other  services, although Florida, Texas, and Utah provide SNAP services  through one-stops along with TANF services, and Utah also provides  Medicaid through one-stops. Officials said that in states where this is not  the case, the potential trade-off would need to be considered.", "Legislative proposals to make TANF a mandatory partner in the one-stop  system have been introduced but have not been made into law. In the  109th Congress, the WIA reauthorization bills passed by the House and the  Senate included provisions to make TANF a mandatory partner, which  would have required TANF employment and training services to be  provided through one-stop centers nationwide. However, WIA has not yet  been reauthorized, and according to Labor officials, the Administration  has not taken a position on whether TANF should be a mandatory partner.  Nevertheless, officials told us that about half of states have made TANF a  partner in their one-stop systems. In addition, about half of states used  TANF funds to pay for a portion of their one-stop center infrastructure  costs in program year 2005."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consolidating Administrative Structures", "paragraphs": ["Consolidating the administrative structures of the TANF, ES, and WIA  Adult programs may increase efficiencies and reduce costs. However, we  found that data on the cost savings associated with such consolidation  initiatives are not readily available. Florida, Texas, and Utah have  consolidated the state workforce and welfare agencies that administer the  TANF, ES, and WIA Adult programs, among other programs. In Utah, the  workforce agency administers the TANF program in its entirety. In Florida  and Texas, the workforce agencies administer only that part of TANF  related to employment and training services.", "In all three states, the one-stop centers serve as portals to a range of social  services, including TANF. Officials from these three states told us that  consolidating agencies led to cost savings through the reduction of staff  and facilities. For example, a Utah official said that the state reduced the  number of buildings in which employment and training services were  provided from 104 to 34. According to a Texas official, Texas also  privatized 3,000 full-time staff equivalents (FTE) at the local level, which  reduced the pension, retirement, and insurance costs that had previously  been associated with these state positions. Officials in the three states,  however, could not provide a dollar figure for the cost savings that  resulted from consolidation. Additionally, Labor and HHS officials told us  that reliable data are not available to compare the states\u2019 costs for serving  TANF, ES, and WIA Adult participants with average costs nationwide.  These three programs do not require states to report data on costs per  participant, and the state officials we spoke with said that the data they  could provide would not be comparable with other states.", "State officials also told us that consolidation improved the quality of  services for participants in the WIA Adult and TANF programs. An official  in Utah noted the consolidation allowed job seekers to apply for  assistance they had not considered in the past; allowed employment  counselors to cluster services that made sense for the client; and allowed  clients to experience seamless service delivery. These benefits reflected  what the official said was one of the visions of consolidation: having one  employment plan per client, rather than multiple employment plans for  clients served by multiple programs. While Florida officials acknowledged  that a subset of TANF clients have significant barriers to employment\u2014 such as mental health issues\u2014that one-stop centers may not be well  equipped to address, officials said that the one-stops in their state are able  to address the employment and training needs of the majority of TANF  clients. When asked about the quality of the TANF and workforce  programs in Florida, Texas, and Utah, Labor officials were not aware of  any performance problems in these programs and added that they view all  three states as forerunners in program improvement efforts. That said,  they noted that Utah may not be representative of other states, due to its  relatively small and homogenous population. According to HHS officials,  the three states all met federal work participation rate requirements in  2008, but there is no established means for comparing the employment  performance of state TANF programs, so it is not possible to determine  whether these states are more or less effective than other states in  accomplishing the employment goals of TANF. In addition, officials from  the Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP) said that Texas and Florida  may place more of an emphasis on quickly finding work for TANF clients  than other states.", "Even with the benefits identified by state officials, consolidation may have  its challenges. An official in Utah noted that the reorganization of state  agencies and staff was time-consuming and costly, and it took several  years before any cost savings were realized. For example, developing a  shared database across programs increased costs temporarily. In addition,  when states consolidate their agencies, they must still follow separate  requirements for TANF and WIA. A 2004 article on service integration by  authors from CLASP and the Hudson Institute concluded that states can  take significant steps under current law to integrate TANF and WIA  services, but it also noted the difficulty in administering separate programs  with different requirements. The article specifically noted differences in  work requirements, program performance measures, and reporting  requirements, among others. A Utah official said that it was important for  program administrators to be knowledgeable about these separate  reporting requirements and processes across the multiple federal agencies  that oversee these programs. Similarly, this official said that direct service  staff needed to be knowledgeable about multiple programs and how to  allocate costs across these programs. For states that have not  consolidated their workforce and welfare agencies, not knowing what  actions are allowable under the law may present a challenge to  consolidation. According to the article on service integration, states face  some legal barriers to fully integrating TANF and WIA services, but if they  do not know what is allowable under the law, they may not always  exercise the full range of options available to them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Greater Efficiency Could Mean More People Served", "paragraphs": ["To the extent that colocation and consolidation would reduce  administrative costs, funds could potentially be available to serve more  clients or for other purposes. States spend a part of each program\u2019s federal  appropriation on administration. For the TANF program, we estimate that  states spent about $160 million to administer employment and training  services in fiscal year 2009. As defined in regulation, TANF  administrative costs include costs for general program administration and  coordination, such as salaries and benefits for staff performing  administrative and coordination activities, and indirect administrative  costs that support these activities. Administrative costs do not include  salaries and benefits for staff providing program services or the direct  administrative costs associated with providing these services, such as  supplies, equipment, travel, postage, utilities, and rental and maintena of office space.

This administrative flexibility allows programs to deliver services  in a way that best meets local needs.", "Program year 2009 ran from July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010.  These costs do not  include Recovery Act funds, which also could have been used for administrative costs.", "However, in the face of increasingly constrained budgets at both the  federal and state levels, this is an opportune time to explore options for  administrative cost savings. Our work on the WIA Adult, ES, and TANF  programs has shown that there is some duplication with regard to their  administrative structures\u2014they maintain the means to provide some of  the same services to the same population. However, the flexibility afforded  these programs under the law allows them to take steps to integrate  services that may increase administrative efficiencies. In taking such  steps, it is important to recognize that improvements in administrative  efficiency may not necessarily result in improvements in program  effectiveness.", "Given that the ES and WIA Adult programs are already colocated in most  one-stop centers, colocating TANF employment and training services with  these programs provides the most immediate opportunity for efficiency  improvements. However, achieving the potential benefits of colocation  may require states and localities to address a variety of challenges: how to  serve additional clients given the limited capacity of one-stop centers and  potential lease restrictions; how to navigate philosophical differences  between programs and address the multiple needs of TANF clients in the  one-stop center setting; how to ensure that services are geographically  accessible; whether the potential benefits of colocating TANF in one-stop  centers outweigh the potential costs of no longer colocating these services  with other services for low-income families, in some cases; and whether,  and to what extent, TANF will contribute to one-stop center operating  costs. However, these challenges are not insurmountable, given that over  half of the states offer TANF services on site at a typical one-stop center.", "Similarly, consolidating the administrative structures of these programs  would potentially conserve resources and better serve customers by  providing the one-stop convenience established by WIA. Florida, Texas,  and Utah have taken the initiative to consolidate their state workforce and  welfare agencies, and report that they reduced administrative costs and  improved services for job seekers. However, consolidation is not without  challenges. In particular, states that have not yet consolidated their  workforce and welfare agencies may not know how to integrate services  in a way that is allowable under the law.", "While states and localities have undertaken some potentially promising  initiatives to achieve greater administrative efficiencies, a major obstacle  to further progress on this front is that little information is available about  the strategies and results of these initiatives, including improvements to  services and reductions in costs.

To  clarify the report, we modified it to say that multipurpose block grants  with broader missions are included in our list of programs. HHS also  recommended that the report provide data on total spending for  employment and training for a set of years, rather than only comparing  2002 to 2009, because Recovery Act spending in 2009 was a year with  exceptional circumstances in terms of funding.
