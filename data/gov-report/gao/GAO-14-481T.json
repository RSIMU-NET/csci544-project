The agency gained important knowledge for its Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) by successfully conducting several important tests, including the first missile defense system-level operational flight test. Additionally, key programs successfully conducted developmental flight tests that demonstrated key capabilities and modifications made to resolve prior issues. MDA also made some improvements to transparency and accountability. For example, MDA improved the management of its acquisition-related efforts to deploy a missile defense system in Europe and MDA continued to improve the clarity of its resource and schedule baselines, which are reported to Congress for oversight.", "Although some progress has been made, MDA acquisitions are still high risk, due to inherent technical and integration challenges, tight timeframes, strategies that overlap development and production activities, and incomplete management tools. More specifically:", "MDA faces challenges stemming from higher-risk acquisition strategies that overlap production activities with development activities. While some concurrency is understandable, committing to production and fielding before development is complete often results in performance shortfalls, unexpected cost increases, schedule delays, and test problems. GAO found that the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense SM-3 Block IB and Ground-based Midcourse Defense programs, which have already produced some of their assets before completing testing, discovered issues during testing that have affected or continue to affect production.", "Testing continues to fall short of goals. For example, the first ever system-level operational flight test failed to demonstrate true integration. MDA also combined, delayed, and deleted some tests, and eliminated test objectives in other tests. These challenges reduced the knowledge they had planned to obtain in order to understand the capabilities and limitations of the BMDS.", "MDA has not yet fully developed or implemented a complete management strategy for synchronizing its efforts to deploy missile defense in Europe. As a result, it remains unclear how different European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA) efforts are aligned together and what constitutes success in delivering capabilities in Europe.", "Issues with the content and presentation of resource and schedule baselines continue to limit their usefulness as management tools. For the fourth year, GAO has found that MDA's cost estimates are unreliable for some BMDS elements and do not include certain costs for military services which may significantly understate total costs. Recently, Congress took steps to require that improvements be made to MDA's cost estimates, so GAO did not make any new cost recommendations. MDA's schedule baselines continue to be presented in a way that makes it difficult to assess progress. For instance, MDA's schedule baselines identify numerous events, but provide little information on the events and why they are important."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In April 2014, GAO recommended that MDA verify any changes needed for the SM-3 Block IB missile through flight testing before approving full production; retest the fielded GMD interceptor to demonstrate performance and the effectiveness of changes; and take actions to improve the clarity of its schedule baselines. DOD partially concurred with the recommendation on the SM-3, stating that MDA will verify the efficacy of any modifications by testing and that the production decision will be vetted through the DOD process. DOD did not agree with the recommendation on GMD, stating that the decision to flight test the interceptor will be made by the Director, MDA, based on the judgment of other stakeholders. GAO previously made recommendations on EPAA and testing. DOD generally concurred with them. GAO continues to believe all recommendations are valid."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the acquisition progress  achieved and challenges that remain for the Department of Defense\u2019s  (DOD) Missile Defense Agency (MDA). Since 2002, MDA has been  charged with developing and fielding the Ballistic Missile Defense System  (BMDS), which is expected to be capable of defending the United States,  deployed troops, friends, and allies against ballistic missiles of all ranges  and in all phases of flight. It has spent over $98 billion to develop and  deploy a diverse collection of land-, sea-, and space-based assets, and  has requested an additional $38 billion for fiscal years 2014 through 2018  to continue its efforts. Since its inception, MDA has been operating in an  environment of tight time frames for delivering capabilities\u2014first with a  presidential directive in 2002 to field a limited capability by 2004 and then  with a presidential announcement in 2009 to deploy U.S. missile defense  in Europe. Looking forward, it will also have to operate in an environment  of budgetary constraints, which necessitate tough trade-off decisions. As  a result, MDA will require additional steps to reduce acquisition risk to  ensure it provides warfighters with systems whose performance and  capability is understood, and which are delivered on time and on budget.", "This year, we continue to report that missile defense acquisitions are high  risk. MDA has made tangible progress in increasing the complexity and  sophistication of missile defense tests, enhancing plans and processes  for deploying U.S. missile defense in Europe, and increasing the  completeness and clarity of cost and schedule reporting to the Congress.  However, two key programs face challenges stemming from higher \u2013risk  acquisition strategies that overlap production activities and development  activities; testing overall continues to provide less knowledge than initially  planned and considerably more improvements are needed in both  reporting to the Congress and in planning for deployment of missile  defense in Europe. Many of the challenges MDA faces are tied to the  technical and integration risks that are inherent in the capabilities MDA is  seeking to deliver, while others are tied to tight time frames placed on  MDA as well as changing demands. Nevertheless, MDA still has  opportunities to take steps to reduce acquisition risk, increase  transparency, and enhance oversight. MDA\u2019s new Director is focused on  doing so, though it may take time for his efforts to affect the MDA\u2019s broad  portfolio of acquisitions, particularly older programs that began without  sound foundations for success.", "Since 2002, we have been mandated to prepare annual assessments of  MDA\u2019s progress toward its acquisition goals. Our report in response to  this mandate was issued on Tuesday, April 1, 2014. This testimony  highlights the findings from that report as well as relevant findings from  other recent related reports. To assess MDA\u2019s progress and related  challenges, we examined the acquisition accomplishments of individual  missile defense programs and supporting efforts that MDA is currently  developing and fielding. We conducted this work in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained  provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on  our audit objectives. Additional information on our scope and  methodology is available in our issued reports."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["MDA\u2019s BMDS is being designed to counter ballistic missiles of all  ranges\u2014short, medium, intermediate, and intercontinental. Because  ballistic missiles have different ranges, speeds, sizes, and performance  characteristics, MDA is developing multiple systems that, when  integrated, provide multiple opportunities to destroy ballistic missiles in  flight for the strategic defense of the United States and regional defense  of its deployed forces and allies. The BMDS architecture includes space- based sensors, ground- and sea-based radars, ground- and sea-based  interceptor missiles, and a command and control, battle management,  and communications system to provide the warfighter with the necessary  communication links to the sensors and interceptor missiles.", "Table 1 provides a brief description of some of the BMDS systems, which  MDA refers to as elements, and programs included in this year\u2019s  assessment. More details can be found in our report.", "When MDA was established in 2002, the Secretary of Defense granted it  exceptional flexibility to set requirements and manage the acquisition of  the BMDS in order to quickly deliver protection against ballistic missiles.  This decision enabled MDA to rapidly deliver assets, but we have  reported that it has come at the expense of transparency and  accountability. Examples of key problems we have cited in reports in  recent years and which continue to affect MDA\u2019s acquisitions are  highlighted below.", "MDA\u2019s highly concurrent acquisition approach has led to significant  cost growth, schedule delays, and in some cases, performance  shortfalls. Concurrency is broadly defined as the overlap between  technology development and product development or between  product development and production. While some concurrency is  understandable, committing to product development before  requirements are understood and technologies are mature or  committing to production and fielding before development is complete  is a high-risk strategy that often results in performance shortfalls,  unexpected cost increases, schedule delays, and test problems. At  the very least, a highly concurrent strategy forces decision makers to  make key decisions without adequate information about the weapon\u2019s  demonstrated operational effectiveness, reliability, and readiness for  production. According to MDA officials, they have taken some steps  to identify and track concurrency in their programs. However, high  levels of concurrency adopted earlier for some programs persist  today.", "Testing disruptions have reduced the knowledge planned to be  available to inform acquisition decisions and understand performance.  For example, flight test failures disrupted MDA\u2019s acquisitions of  several components and forced MDA to suspend or slow production  of three out of four interceptors, including the GMD interceptor and the  Aegis BMD Standard Missile-3 Block IB (SM-3 Bock IB). In the  Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) case, because MDA moved  forward years ago with CE-I and CE-II interceptor production before  completing its flight testing program, test failures have exacerbated  disruptions to the program. Specifically, because the program has  delivered approximately three-fourths of the interceptors for fielding, it  faces difficult and costly decisions on how it will implement corrections  from prior test failures. Additionally, after fielding these assets, the  program has had to add tests that were previously not planned, in  order to assess the extent to which prior issues were resolved. It also  had to delay tests that were needed to understand the system\u2019s  capabilities and limitations.", "MDA has been challenged to meet some of its goals for the European  Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA). During the past several years,  MDA has been responding to a mandate from the President to  develop and deploy new missile defense systems in Europe. This  four-phase effort was designed to rely on increasingly capable  missiles, sensors, and command and control systems to defend  Europe and the United States. Each successive phase is expected to  defend larger areas against more numerous and more capable threat  missiles. DOD delivered the first phase, for short and medium range  defense of Europe, in December 2011, and has been making  progress in developing some systems to support future phases.  However, in March 2013, the Secretary of Defense canceled two  programs, planned for the fourth phase, thus eliminating the fourth  phase, which was intended to provide additional layer for defense of  the United States against intercontinental ballistic missiles. The  cancelations were driven in part by affordability concerns, schedule  delays and technical risks associated with these programs. Our  previous work found similar issues with other EPAA efforts. We also  found that MDA has lacked a comprehensive management approach  to synchronize key EPAA activities.", "Finally, MDA\u2019s acquisition baseline reporting has provided limited  insight into the cost and schedule progress of the BMDS. Due to the  acquisition flexibilities it has been granted, BMDS\u2019s entrance into  DOD\u2019s acquisition process is deferred, and laws and policies that  generally require major defense acquisition programs to take certain  steps at certain phases in the acquisition process will not apply until  the program enters this process. For example, major defense  acquisition programs are generally required to document key  performance, cost, and schedule goals in an acquisition baseline at  certain phases in the acquisition process; because BMDS has not  progressed through threshold phases of the DOD acquisition process,  this requirement is not yet applicable. To improve the transparency  and accountability of BMDS development efforts, Congress has  enacted legislation requiring MDA to establish some baselines. MDA  reported baselines for several BMDS programs to Congress for the  first time in its June 2010 BMDS Accountability Report (BAR).  Specifically, MDA\u2019s baselines, including resource and schedule  baselines, are reported in the BAR and are updated annually. Since  2011, although progress has been made to improve the reporting, we  have found issues affecting the usefulness of MDA\u2019s acquisition  baselines for oversight due to (1) a lack of clarity, consistency, and  completeness; (2) a lack of high-quality supporting cost estimates and  schedules; and (3) instability in the content of the baselines.", "Our work has recommended a number of actions that can be taken to  address the problems we identified. Generally, we have recommended  that DOD reduce concurrency and more closely follow knowledge based  acquisition practices. We also made recommendations designed to  reduce testing risk, and to improve schedule and cost reporting.

The test involved warfighters  from several combatant commands, and according to independent testing  officials, recreated a potentially realistic scenario. During this test, MDA  launched two medium-range ballistic missile targets, including its newly  developed air-launched extended-medium range ballistic missile  (eMRBM). Both the Aegis SM-3 Block IA and THAAD successfully  intercepted their targets, demonstrating progress towards achieving an  integrated BMDS. In addition, the Aegis BMD SM-3 Block IB and GMD  programs successfully conducted developmental flight tests in 2013 that  demonstrated key capabilities and modifications made to resolve prior  issues. Specifically, the Aegis BMD SM-3 Block IB intercepted all targets  in its last three flight tests.

In its 2013 BAR, MDA  continued to incorporate useful changes it made last year, and took some  additional actions to improve the completeness and clarity of the BAR  baselines by:  identifying the date of the initial baseline and, if applicable, the date  when the initial baseline was most recently revised; explaining most of the significant cost and schedule changes from the  current baseline estimates against both the estimates reported in the  prior year\u2019s BAR and the latest initial baseline; and making the baselines easier to read by removing cluttered formatting  such as strikethroughs and highlights that made some of the events  listed in past BARs unreadable."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "MDA Continues to Face Testing and Acquisition Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Although MDA has taken some steps to improve its acquisitions, the  agency continues to face several challenges that we have found in  previous reviews.

It can  also create pressure to keep producing to avoid work stoppages. Our  April 2014 report found that Aegis BMD SM-3 Block IB and GMD, which  have already produced some of their assets before completing testing,  discovered issues during testing that could affect or have affected  production. Although both programs demonstrated progress in resolving  previous issues, some of which stemmed from their concurrent  acquisition strategies, testing revealed new issues.

While the  failure review is not yet complete, if a redesign is necessary,  interceptors that were already produced may require retrofits. MDA  continues to procure new SM-3 Block IBs while it investigates the  cause of the failure.", "A GMD CE-I interceptor failure in a July 2013 flight means that MDA  did not demonstrate the interceptor could perform under more  challenging conditions than previously tested, further delaying  knowledge of the interceptors performance capability. Additionally, the  failure precluded confirmation that previous design changes improved  performance, and delayed the upcoming test needed to resume  production of CE-II interceptors. According to program officials, the  failure review is not complete, but the failure could have been caused  by a component common to both the CE-I and CE-II interceptors. It is  still unclear what, if any, corrective action will be needed. The GMD  program has had many years of significant and costly disruptions  caused by production getting well ahead of testing and then  discovering issues during testing. Consequently, even though some  assets have already been produced, MDA has had to add tests that  were previously not planned and delay tests that are necessary to  understand the system\u2019s capabilities and limitations. Additionally,  since it has delivered approximately three-fourths of its interceptors,  MDA faces difficult and costly decisions on how it will implement  corrections from prior test failures. As a result of these development  challenges, the GMD program will likely continue to experience  delays, disruptions, and cost growth.", "We made recommendations to address the ongoing issues with both  systems in our April 2014 report.

Second, we also recommended testing the fielded GMD CE- I interceptor in order to complete the original purpose of the failed test to  (1) demonstrate the CE-I\u2019s effectiveness against a longer range threat in  more challenging conditions, and (2) confirm the effectiveness of previous  upgrades as well as (3) confirm any new modifications to address the  failure work as intended.

In our March 2014 and April 2014 reports, we found that  MDA combined, delayed, and deleted some tests, and eliminated test  objectives in others. For example, MDA had to make some  adjustments to its September 2013 operational flight test, reducing the  number of targets from five to two and removing the participation of  more mature elements. The agency also reduced the number of  ground tests, which are used to assess performance and  interoperability. While MDA added other ground tests to mitigate some  effects of this reduction, they are smaller in scope and may not  provide the same amount of data about how the systems work  together.", "Previously GAO has made recommendations to improve MDA\u2019s ability to  gather expected knowledge from testing.

As a result, it remains unclear how different  EPAA efforts are aligned together and what constitutes success in  delivering EPAA capabilities. Considering that defensive capability  planned for EPAA increasingly depends on integrated performance of the  participating systems, an acquisition approach that identifies and  synchronizes all needed activities becomes increasingly important. While  flexibility is a hallmark of the EPAA policy, it also increases the risk of  delivering less capability than expected without demonstrating the actual  performance of what is delivered.", "In fact, our March 2014 report found concurrency, fragmentation of  development activities, and delays for some originally planned  capabilities. For example, we found that some systems may be delivered  later than originally anticipated for integration activities. This reduces the  time to discover and correct issues. We also found schedule delays that  reduced both the capability MDA plans to deliver and the understanding  of how that capability will perform. For example, although MDA delivered  the first set of capability in December 2011, an upgrade originally planned  for 2014, is now expected in 2015. Additionally, we found that MDA split  the delivery of capability it initially planned to deliver in 2015 into two  segments.
