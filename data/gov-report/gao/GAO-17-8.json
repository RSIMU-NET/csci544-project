GAO identified three characteristics that contribute to the creation and operation of a comprehensive IPT: (1) executive leadership through team support, empowerment, and oversight; (2) team composition; and (3) processes for team operations. GAO also identified 18 practices supporting these three characteristics (see figure). For example, executive leadership is effective when sufficient resources are provided and teams are empowered to act, team composition is more robust when the IPT has cross-functional and multidisciplinary skill sets, and team operations are streamlined when team guidelines are established and stakeholders are involved as active members. When implemented, these practices can increase the IPT's likelihood of success by having the right mix of expertise to recognize problems early and by having the requisite authority to do something about them.", "While multiple factors contribute to a robust IPT, one aspect involves having a strong information technology (IT) workforce. To evaluate agencies' IT workforce planning efforts, GAO identified eight key workforce planning steps and activities based on relevant laws and guidance (see table).", "Five federal departments had mixed progress in assessing their IT skill gaps. While all five departments had demonstrated important progress in either partially or fully implementing key IT workforce planning activities, each had shortfalls. For example, four departments had not demonstrated an established IT workforce planning process.", "As shown in the figure, of the five departments, the Department of Defense had the most robust IT workforce planning process by fully or partially implementing all eight activities. However, the departments have not yet fully implemented all of the practices for various reasons. For example, policies were not comprehensive in requiring such activities or were not being applied to IT workforce planning at four departments, one department placed a greater emphasis on assessing its cybersecurity workforce, and two departments identified the need to perform more granular assessments of the workforce in order to identify skill gaps. Until the departments fully implement key workforce planning steps and activities, they risk not adequately assessing and addressing gaps in knowledge and skills that are critical to the success of major acquisitions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that selected departments implement IT workforce planning practices to facilitate more rigorous analyses of gaps between current skills and future needs, and the development of strategies for filling the gaps.

The hallmark of these teams is  their ability to efficiently make decisions that cross lines of expertise.", "Over the last two decades, the federal government has taken steps to  improve IT acquisitions through the use of IPTs. Building on success from  private industry\u2019s use of IPTs, Defense adopted them in an attempt to  improve its weapon system acquisitions. In 1996, the department  published a guide on integrated product and process development based  on its survey of policies and practices for over 80 government and  industry organizations.

In 2010, OMB  published a 25-point action plan that was intended to address many of the  most pressing, persistent challenges to the federal government\u2019s  management of IT. One of the actions OMB cited was to require that  IPTs were in place before OMB approves program budgets. Additional  actions agencies are to take are to dedicate resources to the team  throughout the program lifecycle and hold team members accountable for  individual goals and overall program success.", "Subsequently, OMB has incorporated revisions to its Capital  Programming Guide and related guidance, which require the use of IPTs  prior to OMB\u2019s approval of an investment\u2019s business case. Specifically,  OMB requires that each major IT investment establish an IPT that  includes, at a minimum, a fully dedicated program manager, a contracting  specialist (if applicable), an IT specialist, an IT security specialist, and a  business process owner or subject matter expert."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "IT Workforce Planning Is Needed to Support Effective IPTs", "paragraphs": ["Effective IT workforce planning is key to an agency\u2019s success in  developing IPTs with the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities to  execute a range of management functions that support the agency\u2019s  mission and goals. Over the past 20 years, various laws were enacted  and guidance issued that call for agencies to perform workforce planning  activities that ensure the timely and effective acquisition of IT. These laws  and guidance focus on the importance of (1) setting the strategic direction  for workforce planning, (2) analyzing the workforce to identify skill gaps,  (3) developing strategies to address skill gaps, and (4) monitoring and  reporting on progress in addressing skill gaps. For example:", "The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 requires agency CIOs to annually (1)  assess the requirements established for agency personnel regarding  knowledge and skill in information resource management and the  adequacy of such requirements for facilitating the achievement of  performance goals; (2) assess the extent to which the positions and  personnel at executive and management levels meet those  requirements; (3) develop strategies and specific plans for hiring,  training, and professional development to address any deficiencies;  and (4) report to the head of the agency on the progress made in  improving information resources management capability.", "The E-Government Act of 2002 requires the Director of OPM, in  consultation with the Director of OMB, the Chief Information Officers  Council, and the Administrator of General Services to (1) analyze, on  an on-going basis, the personnel needs of the federal government  related to IT and information resource management; and (2) identify  where current IT and information resource management training does  not satisfy personnel needs. In addition, the law requires the Director  of OMB to ensure that agency heads collect and maintain  standardized information on their IT and information resources  management workforce.", "In 2010, OMB issued its 25-point plan for IT reform and outlined  several action plans to build workforce capabilities, including  acquisition and program management. For example, OMB stated  that OPM will work with OMB to provide agencies with direct hiring  authority for program managers and directed OPM to create a  specialized career path. OMB also tasked agencies with identifying  program management competency gaps and reporting on those gaps.", "Subsequent to the 25-point plan, in July 2011, OMB released  guidance for agencies to develop specialized IT acquisition cadres.  Among other things, this memorandum required agencies to analyze  current acquisition staffing challenges; determine if developing or  expanding the use of cadres would improve program results; and  outline a plan to pilot or expand cadres for an especially high-risk  area, if the agency determined that such an effort would improve  performance.", "Further, in November 2011 OPM issued guidance for developing  career paths for IT program managers. OPM\u2019s career path guide  was to build upon its IT Program Management Competency Model  released in July 2011 by serving as a roadmap for individuals  interested in pursuing a career in this area and providing employees  and their supervisors with a single-source reference to determine  appropriate training opportunities for career advancement.", "In December 2014, Congress enacted legislation commonly referred  to as the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act  (FITARA). Among other things, the law aims to ensure timely  progress by federal agencies toward developing, strengthening, and  deploying IT acquisition cadres consisting of personnel with highly  specialized skills in IT acquisition, including program and project  managers. Agencies (other than Defense) are required to update their  acquisition human capital plans to address how they are meeting their  human capital requirements to support timely and effective  acquisitions.", "To assist agencies in implementing the provisions of FITARA  and to  reinforce provisions of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, OMB issued  guidance to agencies in June 2015. In doing so, OMB directed  agencies (other than Defense) to, among other things, (1) develop a  set of competency requirements for staff, including leadership  positions; and (2) develop and maintain a current workforce planning  process to ensure the agency can (a) anticipate and respond to  changing mission requirements, (b) maintain workforce skills in a  rapidly developing environment, and (c) recruit and retain the talent  needed to accomplish the mission. Each agency is to conduct an  annual self-assessment of its conformity with these requirements and  develop an implementation plan describing the changes it will make.", "In October 2015, OMB required agencies to identify their top five  cybersecurity talent gaps by December 2015 as a one-time effort.  Specifically, agencies were to participate in an OPM cybersecurity  staffing exercise to identify the universe of their cyber talent,  understand challenges for retaining talent, and address gaps  accordingly.", "The Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2015  required OPM, with support from the National Institute of Standards  and Technology, to establish a coding structure to be used in  identifying all federal civilian and non-civilian positions that require the  performance of IT, cybersecurity, or other cyber-related functions.  Agencies, in consultation with OPM, the National Institute of  Standards and Technology, and the Department of Homeland  Security, were then required to utilize this coding structure to annually  assess, among other things, the IT, cybersecurity, and other cyber- related work roles of critical need in the agency\u2019s workforce. We have  additional planned work in this area.", "OMB released its Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Strategy in July  2016. Among other things, the strategy cited the need for agencies  to examine specific IT, cybersecurity, and cyber-related work roles,  and identify personnel skills gaps, rather than merely examining the  number of vacancies by job series. The strategy identified several  actions that agencies could take to identify workforce needs, expand  the cybersecurity workforce through education and training, recruit  and hire highly skilled talent, and retain and develop highly skilled  talent.", "Finally, in July 2016 OMB issued updated policy for the planning,  budgeting, governance, acquisition, and management of federal  information, personnel, equipment, funds, IT resources and  supporting infrastructure and services.

For  example, we and OPM developed human capital management models  that call for implementing workforce planning practices that can facilitate  the analysis of gaps between current skills and future needs and the  development of strategies for filling the gaps, as well as planning for  succession. In addition, our Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government stress that management should consider how best to retain  valuable employees, plan for their eventual succession, and ensure  continuity of needed skills and abilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Has Previously Reported on Federal IPTs and IT Workforce Planning", "paragraphs": ["We have previously reported on commercial and Defense teaming  practices and found that IPTs can develop and deliver superior products  within predicted time frames and budgets\u2014often cutting calendar time in  half compared with earlier products developed without such teams. In  addition, we identified two elements that are essential to an IPT: the  knowledge and authority needed to recognize problems and make cross- cutting decisions expeditiously. We noted that knowledge is sufficient  when the team has the right mix of expertise to master the different facets  of product development and authority is present when the team is  responsible for making both day-to-day decisions and delivering the  product. We concluded that if a team lacks expertise, it will miss  opportunities to recognize potential problems early; without authority, it  can do little about them.", "Regarding broader human capital planning efforts, we first designated  strategic human capital management across the government as a high- risk issue in 2001 because of the federal government\u2019s long-standing lack  of a consistent approach to human capital management. In February  2011, we narrowed the focus of this high-risk issue to the need for  agencies to close mission-critical skill gaps. At that time, we noted that  agencies faced challenges effectively and efficiently meeting their  missions across a number of areas, including acquisition management.", "With regard to IT workforce and human capital planning, we reported that  effectively addressing mission-critical skill gaps in IT requires a  multi-faceted response from OPM and agencies. Specifically, our high  risk update in February 2013 noted that OPM and agencies would need  to use a strategic approach that (1) involves top management,  employees, and other stakeholders; (2) identifies the critical skills and  competencies that will be needed to achieve current and future  programmatic results; (3) develops strategies that are tailored to address  skill gaps; (4) builds the internal capability needed to address  administrative, training, and other requirements important to support  workforce planning strategies; and (5) includes plans to monitor and  evaluate progress toward closing skill gaps and meeting other human  capital goals using a variety of appropriate metrics. We subsequently  reported in January 2015 that while the Chief Human Capital Officers  Council identified skill gaps in six government-wide occupations\u2014 including IT/cybersecurity and contract specialist/acquisition\u2014it would be  important for lessons learned from these initial efforts to inform a new set  of skill gaps; key features of OPM\u2019s efforts to predict emerging skill gaps  beyond those already identified were in the early planning stages; and  OPM and selected agencies could improve efforts to address skill gaps  by strengthening their use of quarterly data-driven reviews.", "Further, we have reported that agencies across the federal government  have not always effectively planned for IT workforce challenges. For  example,", "We recently determined that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)  had performed key steps such as documenting an IT human capital  strategic plan and regularly analyzing workforce data, but the  department had not tracked and reviewed historical and projected  leadership retirements and had not identified gaps in future skill  areas. We recommended that the department track and review  historical workforce data and projections related to leadership  retirements and identify IT skills needed beyond the current fiscal year  to assist in identifying  future skills gaps and it concurred with our  recommendations.", "We identified that while the Federal Emergency Management Agency  had taken initial steps to assess the needs of its IT workforce, it had  not yet completed workforce planning efforts and lacked an  understanding of its regional IT workforce. For example, we noted  that while it had conducted a workforce assessment to identify skill  levels of employees in the agency\u2019s Office of the CIO, it had not  completed recommended actions called for by this assessment. In  addition, its workforce planning efforts had not included an  assessment of the many IT staff located in the agency\u2019s regions and  other offices. We concluded that the agency had less assurance that  its IT workforce will have the skills needed to successfully manage its  programs and recommended it establish time frames for completing  workforce planning efforts. The Department of Homeland Security  concurred with our recommendations.", "In November 2015, we testified that, among other things, the U.S.  Census Bureau faced challenges in the area of workforce planning.  Specifically, we noted that while it had taken steps to develop an  enterprise-wide IT workforce planning process, as we recommended  in 2012, it had yet to fill key positions.", "We have also identified human capital challenges at the Social  Security Administration (SSA). Specifically, we concluded that  SSA\u2019s IT human capital program had identified skills and  competencies to support certain workforce needs, but lacked  adequate planning for the future. The agency had developed IT  human capital planning documents, such as an Information  Resources Management plan and skills inventory gap reports, which  identified near-term needs, such as skill sets for the following 2 years.  Nevertheless, SSA has not adequately planned for longer-term needs  because its human capital planning and analysis were not aligned  with long-term goals and objectives and the agency did not have a  current succession plan for its IT efforts. Accordingly, we  recommended that SSA identify long-term IT needs in its updated  human capital operating plan and the agency agreed.", "Further, we determined that eight selected agencies had taken varied  steps to implement workforce planning practices for cybersecurity  personnel. For example, five of eight agencies, including the largest,  Defense, had established cybersecurity workforce plans or other  agency-wide activities addressing cybersecurity workforce planning.  However, all of the agencies faced challenges determining the size of  their cybersecurity workforce because of variations in how work was  defined and the lack of an occupational series specific to  cybersecurity. With respect to other workforce planning practices, all  agencies had defined roles and responsibilities for their cybersecurity  workforce, but these roles did not always align with guidelines issued  by the federal Chief Information Officers Council and National Institute  of Standards and Technology. We also noted that the robustness and  availability  of cybersecurity training and development programs varied  significantly among the agencies. We made recommendations aimed  at enhancing individual agency cybersecurity workforce planning  activities and to address government-wide cybersecurity workforce  challenges through better planning, coordination, and evaluation of  government-wide activities. The agencies agreed with the majority of  our recommendations.", "Our review of the Food and Drug Administration concluded that,  among other things, the agency was not strategically managing IT  human capital\u2014it had not determined its IT skill needs or analyzed  gaps between skills on hand and future needs.

For  example, the agency found that competency gaps existed in cloud  computing, security integration and engineering, enterprise/mission  engineering lifecycle, requirements development, and Internet data  collection. It also found that enterprise-level competency gaps existed in  program and project management, budget and cost estimation, systems  development, data analytics, and shared services. These mission-critical  gaps would have challenged the Census Bureau\u2019s ability to deliver critical  IT-related initiatives. In response, the agency identified actions to close  the competency gaps by December 2015, including several training- related actions. For example, it planned to implement centralized and  integrated professional training and development activities, create  environments conducive to on-the-job training from embedded personnel,  and leverage staff with related knowledge and experiences to provide  in-house workshops that share skills and experiences.

Our prior work on the Federal Aviation  Administration\u2019s acquisitions program for air traffic control facilities  demonstrated the problems associated with processes that did not  facilitate sufficient involvement of stakeholders throughout the system\u2019s  development. Specifically, the Federal Aviation Administration did not  include air traffic controllers in the design and testing of one of its integral  air traffic control programs. Because of this, issues that could have been  addressed early in the design phase were not discovered until  implementation, resulting in cost and schedule impacts. Partly due to not  having valuable stakeholder involvement, the program experienced a  cumulative 60 percent cost increase and schedule delays averaging 4  years. In response, the agency took steps to involve stakeholders by  signing a memorandum of understanding with the air traffic controllers\u2019  union.

This hindered executive level  governance over the program, which contributed, in part, to significant  challenges for the program.

The selection  criteria were: (a) suggested by OMB officials as being high-impact  programs that have had a challenging past performance and have  current increased oversight from OMB; (b) active engagement with  OMB\u2019s U.S. Digital Service; (c) observed by OMB has having  relatively strong teaming practices; (d) observed through the course of  GAO reviews as having relatively strong teaming practices; and (e)  observed through the course of GAO reviews as having a history of  problems from which lessons learned could be derived.", "The four offices of the CIO we interviewed were from the Departments  of Commerce, Defense, and Veterans Affairs. We selected  Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (within  the Department of Commerce), and Veterans Affairs CIO officials  because their departments had oversight responsibilities for the two  IPTs we interviewed. We also selected CIO officials from the  Department of Defense due to the department\u2019s history in adopting  IPT concepts.", "The two agencies\u2019 acquisition centers of excellence we interviewed  were the General Services Administration\u2019s Assisted Acquisition  Services and the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 Technology  Acquisition Center. We selected these two centers of excellence  based on OMB\u2019s 2011 guidance for agencies for formulating  specialized IT acquisition cadres.", "In our interviews, we asked these officials to describe desirable  characteristics of comprehensive IPTs, identify additional factors that  are critical to the success of IPTs, and provide examples. We added  their responses to our database of IPT recommended practices.", "We conducted a content analysis on the recommended IPT practices  from our literature research and from interviews with agency officials. In  doing so, team members individually reviewed the practices and assigned  them to various categories and sub-categories. Then the team members  met to compare their categorization schemes, discuss the differences,  and reach agreement on the final overarching characteristics and specific  sub-practices. We validated the outcome of our content analysis by  sending the results to the agency IPTs, CIOs, and centers of excellence  which we had interviewed, as well as two internal experts. We then  obtained their comments and revised our final list of IPT characteristics  and practices as appropriate. Finally, we created a graphic based on the  total number of times literature and agency officials identified specific  roles and responsibilities. In doing so, we incorporated the roles and  responsibilities that were most frequently cited as core disciplines and  organized the graphic in descending order.", "To evaluate whether selected federal agencies are adequately assessing  and addressing gaps in knowledge and skills that are critical to the  success of major IT acquisitions, we selected departments for our review,  created an evaluation framework and validated it, and assessed the  selected departments\u2019 documents and activities against the evaluation  framework.", "We selected the departments for our review based on a judgmental and  non-generalizable sample of agencies\u2019 data from the Federal IT  Dashboard as of August 31, 2015. Specifically, we selected five  departments\u2014Commerce, Defense, Health and Human Services,  Transportation, and the Treasury\u2014based on the following factors: (1)  largest number of major IT investments, (2) largest planned dollar total of  major IT spending in fiscal year 2016, and (3) largest planned percentage  of total major IT spending with development, modernization, and  enhancements in fiscal year 2016.", "To create the evaluation framework, we reviewed relevant laws and  guidance to identify steps and activities for federal agencies to conduct IT  workforce planning, including:", "Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996;", "E-Government Act of 2002;", "Legislation commonly referred to as the Federal Information  Technology Acquisition Reform Act;", "Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2015;", "OMB\u2019s 25 Point Implementation Plan to Reform Federal Information", "OMB\u2019s Guidance for Specialized Information Technology Cadres;", "OMB\u2019s Management and Oversight of Federal Information", "OMB\u2019s Cybersecurity Strategy and Implementation Plan for the", "OMB\u2019s Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Strategy;", "OMB\u2019s Circular A-130, Managing Information as a Strategic", "The Office of Personnel Management\u2019s (OPM) Workforce Planning", "OPM\u2019s workforce planning guidance on key elements and suggested", "OPM\u2019s IT Program Management Career Path Guide; and", "GAO guidance on federal internal control standards as well as key  principles for effective strategic workforce planning.", "We developed a framework consisting of four IT workforce planning steps  and eight key activities, as shown in table 7.", "We validated the evaluation framework by soliciting comments from  internal experts as well as officials from OMB and OPM and updated it as  appropriate. We did not perform a legal analysis as to whether the  selected agencies were in actual compliance with the laws we used to  derive our evaluation framework.", "We assessed the selected departments\u2019 documents and activities against  the evaluation framework by requesting relevant IT workforce and human  capital policies, as well as documentation from each of its most recent IT  workforce competency and staffing gap assessments. We analyzed the  policies and documents to determine whether they were consistent with  the workforce planning steps and activities found in our framework. The  documents we analyzed included: competency gap assessments, staffing assessments, strategic workforce plans, documentation of monitoring progress in addressing IT workforce skill  IT workforce competencies and staffing requirements,  gaps and reporting to department officials, documentation regarding IT acquisition cadres, documentation on cross-functional training of acquisition and IT documentation regarding career paths for IT program managers, documentation of efforts to strengthen IT program management, and documentation of the use of direct hire authority.", "We also interviewed cognizant officials at the five departments to discuss  their policies, documentation, and implementation of the workforce  planning steps and activities. Based on our assessment of the  documentation and discussion with department officials, we assessed the  extent to which the agencies implemented, partially implemented, or did  not implement the steps and activities. We considered an activity to be  fully implemented if a department addressed all of the underlying  practices for the activity; partially implemented if it addressed some but  not all of the underlying practices for the activity; and not implemented if it  did not address any of the underlying practices for the activity.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2015 to November 2016  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
