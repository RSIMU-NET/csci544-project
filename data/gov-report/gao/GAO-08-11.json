To address our objectives, GAO analyzed 2004 and 2006 FHCS results, summaries of OPM employee focus groups, and analyzed OPM strategic and human capital planning documents."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["OPM has taken positive actions to address specific concerns raised by employees and managers in the 2004 and 2006 FHCS responses. OPM conducted employee focus groups to understand factors contributing to the low 2004 survey scores and took actions, such as trying to improve communication throughout the agency. The 2006 survey results showed improvement in the area of leadership, with mixed results in the performance culture and accountability area, and continued concern in the talent management area. Without the responses from the investigative service employees who transferred from the Department of Defense in early 2005, OPM's 2006 FHCS results would have been, in many cases, significantly more positive than in 2004. The perceptions of the investigative service employees, however, will need continued attention. OPM has strategies in place, such as workforce and succession management plans, that are aligned with selected leading practices relevant to the agency's capacity to fulfill its strategic goals. For example, OPM's top leadership is involved in these efforts, and the agency has assessed gaps in numbers and competencies and created gap closure plans for its mission critical and leadership workforce. OPM lacks, however, a well-documented agencywide evaluation process of some of its workforce planning efforts. In particular, OPM's implementation of division-level training plans could make it difficult for the agency to identify and address reasons for shortfalls in meeting its talent management goals. In a relatively short time, there will also be a Presidential transition, and well-documented processes can help to ensure a seamless transition that builds on the current momentum."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has a vital role to play in  ensuring agencies are making strategic human capital management a  priority. In addition, OPM has an important operational responsibility to  work with federal departments and agencies to ensure that human capital  reforms, such as performance management systems, are providing  employees with fair and transparent results and meaningful opportunities  to enhance communication and improve individual and organizational  performance. These strategic and operational human capital management  challenges also exist within OPM, and as OPM\u2019s role in the federal  government continues to evolve, its workforce must be structured to  tackle these challenges.", "We have previously reported that OPM has made commendable efforts  toward transforming itself to being a more effective leader of  governmentwide human capital reform, but that it can build upon that  progress by addressing challenges that remain. For example, OPM\u2019s own  workforce, through the Federal Human Capital Survey (FHCS), has  expressed concerns about the agency\u2019s ability to recruit and develop  employees with the skills necessary to achieve its mission objectives.  Further, the executive branch agencies have pointed to problems in  receiving timely and accurate human capital guidance and advice from  OPM. In addition, OPM has undergone significant changes in the last few  years including the expansion of its agency functions in the area of  personnel security investigations. In early 2005, the agency\u2019s workforce  grew by approximately 40 percent when more than 1,500 security  clearance employees transferred from Defense Security Services (DSS), a  Department of Defense (DOD) agency, to the OPM investigative services  division.", "Given the importance of OPM\u2019s key role and these challenges, you asked  us to assess the extent to which OPM has the capacity to lead and  implement governmentwide human capital reform. In addition to the June  2006 testimony on OPM\u2019s internal capacity for leading human capital  reform, we issued a report in January 2007 that specifically identified  lessons that could be learned from OPM\u2019s efforts to lead and implement  the senior executive performance-based pay system and other human  capital initiatives that can be applied to ongoing and future human capital  reform efforts. For this report, the third in the series, we determined the  extent to which OPM (1) has addressed key internal human capital  management issues identified by examining employee responses to the  2004 and 2006 FHCS, and (2) has strategies in place to ensure it has the  mission critical talent it needs to meet current and future strategic goals.", "To address our first objective, we analyzed OPM\u2019s 2004 and 2006 FHCS  results related to key issues of leadership, performance culture and  accountability, and talent management to determine whether OPM has  made progress in addressing areas of concern from the 2004 survey. We  also analyzed OPM\u2019s 2006 survey results to identify any new challenges to  OPM\u2019s strategic human capital management. To address our second  objective, we reviewed OPM\u2019s strategic and human capital planning  documents and analyzed the extent to which OPM adheres to selected  strategic workforce planning practices and principles relevant to OPM\u2019s  capacity to fulfill its strategic goals. For example, we reviewed OPM\u2019s  analyses identifying critical skills and competencies and related gaps and  determined the extent to which they aligned with OPM\u2019s strategic and  operational plan. We focused primarily on examining Senior Executive  Service (SES) positions and positions from the two OPM divisions with the  most responsibility for working with federal departments and agencies to  assist them with their human capital efforts: the Strategic Human  Resources Policy (SHRP) and the Human Capital Leadership and Merit  System Accountability (HCLMSA) divisions.

Title 5 of the U.S. Code, which provides for the effective  management of the civil service, describes OPM\u2019s mission and  responsibilities. OPM is also responsible for administering retirement,  health benefits, and other insurance services to government employees,  annuitants, and beneficiaries.", "During the past several years, OPM has undergone significant changes.  The entire agency was restructured in fiscal year 2003, which included  steps such as eliminating redundant operations and organizational layers.", "As mentioned previously, in early 2005, OPM\u2019s workforce expanded by  approximately 40 percent when more than 1,500 security clearance  employees transferred from DSS. Several months later, OPM experienced  a change in top leadership, with the appointment of a new agency director  in May 2005. In addition to making organizational changes, OPM has recast  a number of its mission objectives. As we previously reported, OPM is  continuing to transform itself from less of a rulemaker, enforcer, and  independent agent to more of a consultant, toolmaker, and strategic  partner in leading and supporting executive branch agencies\u2019 human  capital management systems. OPM has also played a role in the design  and implementation of new human capital systems at the Departments of  Homeland Security and Defense and has exerted greater human capital  leadership through its Human Capital Scorecard of the President\u2019s  Management Agenda (PMA).", "OPM is responsible for helping other federal departments and agencies  with strategic human capital management, while serving as a model for  managing its own workforce. SHRP and HCLMSA are the two OPM  divisions with the most responsibility for working with federal  departments and agencies to assist them with making their human capital  efforts more effective. SHRP designs, develops, and implements human  capital policies and programs. SHRP\u2019s objective is to make sure federal  agencies understand human capital policy and correctly apply it. For  example, SHRP counsels agencies on how to apply policy to their  performance appraisal, employee development, labor-management  relations, information technology, and workforce planning programs.  HCLMSA serves as the strategic leader of the governmentwide effort to  transform human capital management so that agencies are held  accountable for managing their workforces effectively, efficiently, and in  accordance with merit principles. This division provides advice and  assistance in all areas of staffing and human capital management, such as  workforce restructuring and assistance in recruiting. While SHRP focuses  on developing human capital policy, HCLMSA\u2019s responsibilities deal  primarily with the implementation of that policy. The Management  Services Division (MSD), headed by the senior executive who also serves  as the agency\u2019s Chief Human Capital Officer (CHCO), is responsible for  providing human capital management services to the agency. MSD houses  the Center for Human Capital Management Services (CHCMS), which is  responsible for coordinating much of OPM\u2019s internal strategic human  capital planning, including workforce and leadership succession  management efforts. This group is also responsible for supporting the  agency in recruitment, hiring, and other day-to-day human capital  management activities. Figure 2 shows OPM\u2019s organizational structure.", "One of OPM\u2019s efforts has been to conduct the FHCS biennially to measure  employees\u2019 perceptions on whether conditions characterizing successful  organizations are present in their agencies. OPM uses the FHCS in the  Human Capital Assessment and Accountability Framework (HCAAF) as  one source of information for evaluating agency success in creating a  better working environment for their employees. OPM analyzes the FHCS  results for itself and each agency with the four indices of the HCAAF:  Leadership and Knowledge Management, Results-Oriented Performance  Culture, Talent Management, and Job Satisfaction. A performance  agreement at OPM showed the agency had a goal of being in the top half of  agencies surveyed for 2006 and being in the top 5 of government rankings  for 2008. The FHCS data are also used to rank agencies and  subcomponents on a \u201cBest Places to Work\u201d index score, which measures  employee satisfaction. The Partnership for Public Service and the Institute  for Study of Public Policy Implementation produce the best places to work  rankings. More than 220,000 federal employees responded to the most  recent survey in 2006, with a governmentwide response rate of 57 percent.  The survey participation rate within OPM was 80 percent.", "In 2006 testimony, we reported that OPM\u2019s 2004 survey results could be  summarized as reflecting employees\u2019 concerns about perceptions of  leadership; talent management; customer focus, communication, and  collaboration; and performance culture and accountability. We identified  these four key areas as critical for human capital development in order for  OPM to continue to transform itself into a more effective leader of  governmentwide human capital reform. The areas differ slightly from the  four HCAAF indices and represent a somewhat different grouping of  survey items than the indices. For example, we included three questions  that were asked relating to talent management: (1) the skill level in my  work unit has improved over the past year; (2) I have sufficient resources  to get my job done; and (3) supervisors/team leaders provide employees  with constructive suggestions to improve their job performance. For this  report, we did not include customer focus, communication, and  collaboration because the number of survey items we included in that area  decreased to one question from 2004 to 2006, making the data no longer  significant."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OPM 2006 Survey Results Show Improvement in Employees\u2019 Perceptions of Leadership: Challenges Exist in Talent Management and Perceptions of DOD Investigative Service Transfers", "paragraphs": ["Compared to its 2004 results, OPM\u2019s 2006 FHCS results indicate strong  improvement in employee perceptions on key questions relating to  leadership, mixed results in performance culture and accountability, and  continuing challenges in talent management.

Four questions out of the top 10  questions having the largest increase in positive responses from 2004 to  2006 were related to leadership. For example, there was an 8 percentage  point increase for both \u201csatisfaction with information received from  management\u201d and \u201cmy organization\u2019s leaders maintain high standards of  honesty and integrity,\u201d as displayed in figure 3.", "The positive response increase for leadership questions from 2004 to 2006  represents a major improvement for the agency and a decreasing gap  between OPM and the rest of government. OPM was significantly higher  than the rest of government on three of eight leadership questions.

In 2006, this gap persists  between SES and GS-level employees. For example, in both 2004 and 2006  OPM\u2019s SES responses were substantially more positive than non-SES  responses for the statement \u201cI have a high level of respect for my  organization\u2019s senior leaders.\u201d While OPM has taken steps to address the  lack of overall and cross-divisional communication and issues related to  employee views of senior management, this gap between SES and GS-level  response remains a challenge.", "Finally, the significant leadership changes that occurred at OPM since the  2004 FHCS survey may have affected the perspectives of employees  regarding leadership questions. A new director began a term at the agency  in May 2005 and, according to OPM, about half of the senior leadership  started after OPM administered the 2004 survey. Additionally, actions  taken beginning in May 2006 in response to the 2004 survey results, such  as Web casts and e-mail communications from the Director regarding  internal changes, were intended to lead to positive 2006 FHCS responses  to leadership questions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "2006 FHCS Performance Culture and Accountability Responses Show Mixed Results", "paragraphs": ["Effective performance management systems can drive organizational  transformation by encouraging individuals to focus on their roles and  responsibilities to help achieve organizational outcomes.

The  purpose of the groups was to understand the factors contributing to the  2004 responses and report employee ideas for addressing top priority  improvement areas. Employees were randomly selected to participate in  33 focus groups with participants from all major divisions, headquarters  and the field, employees and supervisors, and major installations. The  results of the 2004 FHCS and the responses of the focus groups showed  that OPM employees were most concerned with leadership and  leadership\u2019s ability to deal with staff about policies and performance.  Employees preferred OPM to have more open communication to address  inadequate planning and excessive supervision. Employees identified  additional problem areas for OPM including lack of management support,  inadequate training for supervisors and managers on performance culture  and accountability, and lack of senior executive interest in and respect for  employees.", "OPM required each division to develop specific action plans to address the  critical issues raised by employees in both the survey results and the focus  groups. In December 2005 and January 2006, the CHCMS met with each  associate director and their management team to present their individual  results and discuss the next steps in the process. OPM also held a half-day  planning meeting with a cross-section of OPM divisions and office  representatives to develop an OPM-wide action plan. As an example of  activities based on the 2004 survey action plans, OPM has attempted to  improve communication throughout the agency by initiating visits to its  field locations, creating an e-mail mail box where employees can make  suggestions on more efficient and effective ways of doing business, and  holding employee meetings. Additionally, to address employee concerns  about communication with senior leaders, OPM established brown bag  lunches with the Director and a process in all divisions to solicit employee  input on various initiatives and set aside \u201copen door\u201d time for employees  to speak with their managers.", "After release of the results of the 2006 FHCS, OPM reviewed and updated  the first set of action plans responding to the 2004 survey by incorporating  changes as needed to address new and continuing areas of concern to  OPM employees. OPM\u2019s analysis of the data included (1) comparisons  between responses in 2004 and 2006 agencywide and governmentwide,   (2) comparisons of results by organizational components, (3) a review of  responses between headquarters and field locations, and (4) a review of  the responses comparing supervisory and nonsupervisory employees.  OPM believed responses to eight questions on the 2006 FHCS improved  based on their previous actions for issue areas dealing with leadership.  OPM identified that the areas reflecting the lowest positive response rates  centered in large part around performance culture areas; for example,  promotions based on merit, employee empowerment, and awards. OPM  also found that the responses from the field employees were lower than  the responses from headquarters employees, where some questions had  significant differences ranging from 10 to 20 percentage points lower.", "In response to the survey results, OPM updated five actions from the  action plans responding to the 2004 survey and developed five new actions  for the action plans responding to the 2006 survey. In terms of leadership,  OPM carried over two actions from the first set of action plans because of  the positive response from employees: using OPM\u2019s Intranet for up-to-date  information sharing throughout the organization and using the Director\u2019s  formal and informal communication methods, such as brown bag  meetings, field site visits, and Web casts. One area of concern for  employees of OPM was employee empowerment. To address this issue,  OPM indicated that it would continue to work on delegating authorities to  the lowest appropriate level and involving employees in decisions to  increase internal approval and coordination to streamline organizational  processes. In addition, in OPM\u2019s recently developed action plans, 5 out of  10 actions will address talent management. For example, OPM will be  implementing the core curriculum for supervisory training that was  developed because of the first set of action plans. OPM officials said the  supervisory training program was funded in May 2007 and implementation  started in July 2007. Additionally, OPM developed four new actions to deal  with training and development: (1) administering performance  management training for all employees, (2) developing individual  development plans (IDP), (3) creating electronic access to training  opportunities, and (4) implementing an internal rotation professional  development program.", "Each division and office analyzed their organization-specific results to  reflect the 2006 responses of their employees in order to update their  previous action plans. SHRP, for example, had each of its center leaders  meet with employees to discuss the survey results and held a divisional  town hall meeting to talk about the results and answer any questions the  employees had. HCLMSA used a new interactive communication tool to  involve employees and management in resolving issues and capitalizing on  strengths identified by the 2006 FHCS results. HCLMSA focused on 38  questions where the positive results were less than 65 percent; from these  questions, 3 to 5 questions were consensually determined as key  discussion areas and included in the division\u2019s current action plans. OPM  also plans to develop communications plans to ensure field locations  receive the same information as headquarters on a timely basis.", "The investigative services division, which includes the DOD transfer  employees, also developed action plans in response to the 2006 FHCS. For  example, in response to employees\u2019 concerns with their personal work  experience, through early September 2007, 428 Federal Investigative  Service Division (FISD) employees had participated in detail assignments  within FISD, assignments outside of FISD but within OPM, and  assignments to other agencies to gain additional program knowledge. OPM  will conduct an agencywide employee survey in October 2007, and OPM  officials said they believe these survey results will show significant  improvement for FISD.", "After OPM assessed the survey results and the Director approved the  action plans, the agency notified its employees about how it will address  the responses and will post information on OPM\u2019s Intranet with continual  progress updates.

The ERB looks at the description of potential successors  identified and, according to the CHCMS official, will sometimes override  the supervisor\u2019s position profile assessments based on their \u201cbig-picture\u201d  knowledge of agencywide human capital resources. The ERB also works  with CHCMS to identify opportunities for economies of scale in addressing  training and development needs that cut across divisions. For example,  CHCMS and the ERB jointly proposed the establishment of a new  supervisory training curriculum for all OPM managers and supervisors.  This curriculum intends to address several agencywide training and  development needs, such as strengthening performance management  skills, closing leadership competency gaps, and addressing issues that  emerged in the 2004 FHCS results.

For example, a workforce plan can include measures  that indicate whether the agency executed its hiring, training, or retention  strategies as intended and achieved the goals for these strategies, and how  these initiatives changed the workforce\u2019s skills and competencies. With  regard to training and development, which are key to each of the OPM gap  closure plans we reviewed, we have reported that front-end analysis can  help ensure that agencies are not initiating these efforts in an  uncoordinated manner, but rather that they are strategically focusing their  training efforts on improving performance to achieve the agency\u2019s goals.", "A CHCMS official representing OPM on its workforce and succession  planning process reported that the agency\u2019s plans are largely developed at  the division level and are periodically evaluated by the ERB and the  agency director. The official noted that these reviews are informal and are  not documented or summarized in agency-level status reports. He further  explained that OPM provides agency-level workforce analysis data, such  as trends in hiring and turnover, to division heads and other top executives  at least annually as part of the PMA reporting process. In addition, the  official noted that, while there is no formal process for periodically  distributing division-level workforce analysis reports, OPM can generate  these data on demand and agency leaders and division heads can request  this information at any time as the need arises. However, OPM had  difficulty providing us with some of its key workforce analysis indicators,  which OPM officials explained was partially due to technical difficulties  with the reporting system.", "Regarding OPM\u2019s training and development efforts, in its January 2004  comments on our report on designing training and development, OPM  noted that it had increased the role of its CHCO to serve as an advisor to  the Director on overall employee training and development initiatives and  programs, as well as the establishment of the agency\u2019s training budget.  OPM viewed this move as a strategic approach to better position the  agency to prioritize its training needs and forecast funds to support those  needs. OPM has also recognized the importance of bringing a perspective  to training and development activities, particularly with regard to  prioritizing among training needs and forecasting funds to support those  needs. More recently, OPM acknowledged the importance of tracking  training and development investments when it announced a requirement  that agencies must begin regularly submitting data on the cost and amount  of training they provide their employees. Specifically, OPM now requires  agencies to report, among other items, the names of employees receiving  training; the title of the classes; the start and end dates; the facility where  courses were offered, such as a government agency or university; the  number of hours; cost; travel costs; and category, such as leadership  development. An OPM official said that the HCLMSA division would  monitor data and work with agencies to ensure they are using training  dollars for succession planning and to fill critical skills gaps, as well as to  improve performance management. In September 2006, OPM also issued a  guide for collection and management of training information that  emphasizes that agencies must manage and collect training information in  support of mission objectives and strategic goals and must properly  evaluate training to ensure it provides meaningful contributions to agency  results.", "When we asked for management reports or a similar means for OPM\u2019s top  management to track information on training activity, however, CHCMS  was unable to provide us with this information.

An OPM official  explained that while the agency has improved its training and  development tracking, he anticipates being able to do better in the coming  year. OPM had expected that its management would be able to use the  Enterprise Human Resources Initiative (EHRI) data warehouse to generate  information on training activity and expenditures as early as a year ago.  While CHCMS had begun tracking training instances for OPM employees  in its human resources data system by December 2006, OPM was  dependent on the General Services Administration to build the interface to  allow transmission of those data to the EHRI data warehouse. The  interface to allow transmission of the data to EHRI was completed in July  2007.", "In addition to gathering data on measures such as participant number and  program costs, we have reported that agencies also need credible  information to evaluate how training and development programs affect  organizational capacity.

He further explained that a  reallocation of internal funds to OPM\u2019s retirement systems modernization  project resulted in a 5 percent decline of agencywide spending on  discretionary activities, leaving a 25 percent cut to the less than 1 percent  allocation for fiscal year 2007 training activities. In addition to other  reductions within the agency, OPM may make similar cuts to the fiscal  year 2008 training budget. Although a CHCMS official told us that OPM is  increasing its use of in-house training and development opportunities such  as job shadowing and mentoring programs, which he believes can be more  effective than outside training, we were unable to ascertain OPM\u2019s full  investment in internal training and development programs since the  budget tracking information does not include indirect costs. As we  mentioned previously, however, survey results show that OPM employees  are not satisfied with their training and addressing this concern is a focus  of OPM\u2019s 2006 FHCS action plans.

Without a  well-documented process in place for OPM\u2019s top leadership to review and  monitor progress made at the division level, there is also a risk that the  agencywide approach to strategic human capital management could be  diminished. For example, OPM lacks information on direct and indirect  costs of its training and development programs. Because these actions are  essential to OPM\u2019s gap closure strategy for its mission critical workforce  and succession management efforts, it is vital to the success of these  efforts that the agency invests in training and development wisely. Without  an agencywide view of how training investments relate to the agency\u2019s  overall mission and strategic objectives, OPM may have difficulty  understanding reasons for shortfalls in meeting its talent management  goals and cannot effectively make a business case for prioritizing one set  of training activities over another, which is increasingly important given  tightening budget constraints."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help OPM continue down its path of improvement with regard to  internal capacity for strategic human capital management, we recommend  that the Director of OPM institute a documented process for OPM\u2019s top  leadership to monitor workforce and succession efforts carried out at the  division level, to help ensure an agencywide perspective on workforce and  succession funding, implementation, and evaluation.

We identified these key areas as  critical for human capital development in order for OPM to continue to  transform itself to being a more effective leader of governmentwide  human capital reform. The areas differ slightly from the four Human  Capital Assessment and Accountability Framework (HCAAF) indices and  represent a somewhat different grouping of survey items than the indices.  We also analyzed OPM\u2019s 2006 survey results to identify any new challenges  to OPM\u2019s strategic human capital management. In analyzing the data, we  performed significance tests with corrections for multiple, simultaneous  comparisons. Not all comparisons of 2004 and 2006 results were made  because some questions were dropped from the 2004 survey and not  included in the 2006 survey. We combined responses (for example,  strongly agree and agree) to calculate the overall positive response of  OPM employees, and we combined responses (for example, strongly  disagree and disagree) to calculate the overall negative response of OPM  employees. After an examination of documents detailing the survey  methodology, we found the survey data to be sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report.", "To address our second objective, we obtained key strategic and human  capital planning documents and analyzed the extent to which OPM  adheres to selected strategic workforce planning practices and principles  relevant to OPM\u2019s capacity to fulfill its strategic goals. We focused  primarily on examining Senior Executive Service (SES) positions and  positions from the two OPM divisions with the most responsibility for  working with federal departments and agencies to assist them effectively  with their human capital efforts: the Strategic Human Resources Policy  (SHRP) and the Human Capital Leadership and Merit System  Accountability (HCLMSA) divisions. We obtained and analyzed strategic,  human capital, workforce, succession, and training and development plans  along with executive performance contracts. We reviewed individual  succession planning position profile sheets for all supervisors, managers,  and executives in SHRP and HCLMSA, along with all career SES  incumbents throughout the agency except those from the Office of the  Inspector General.", "We also had discussions with and obtained other pertinent documentation  from OPM officials at their headquarters in Washington, D.C. We  conducted interviews with key officials at OPM to discuss workforce  planning and succession planning, and we met with the associate directors  of SHRP and HCLMSA. In addition, we reviewed OPM\u2019s own guidance to  executive branch agencies such as the HCAAF, along with prior GAO work  on leading practices in succession and workforce planning. The scope of  our work did not include independent evaluation or verification of the  effectiveness of the workforce and succession management planning used  at OPM, including any performance results that OPM attributed to specific  practices or aspects of its action plans.", "We conducted our review in Washington, D.C., from December 2006  through August 2007 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Selected Survey Questions and Data on the Federal Human Capital Survey", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Survey Items Corresponding to Federal Human Capital Survey (FHCS) Key Areas", "paragraphs": ["Q. 9: Overall, how good a job do you feel is being done by your immediate supervisor/team leader?", "Q. 36: I have a high level of respect for my organization\u2019s senior leaders.", "Q. 37: In my organization, leaders generate high levels of motivation and commitment in the workforce.", "Q. 38: My organization\u2019s leaders maintain high standards of honesty and integrity.", "Q. 39: Managers communicate the goals and priorities of the organization.", "Q. 51: Managers promote communication among different work units (for example, about projects, goals, needed resources).", "Q. 55: How satisfied are you with the information you receive from management on what\u2019s going on in your organization?", "Q. 57: How satisfied are you with the policies and practices of your senior leaders?", "Q. 4: I feel encouraged to come with new and better ways of doing things.", "Q. 22: Promotions in my work unit are based on merit.", "Q. 23: In my work unit, steps are taken to deal with a poor performer who cannot or will not improve.", "Q. 24: Employees have a feeling of personal empowerment with respect to work processes.", "Q. 26: Creativity and innovation are rewarded.", "Q. 28: Awards in my work unit depend on how well employees perform their jobs.", "Q. 29: In my work unit, differences in performance are recognized in a meaningful way.", "Q. 30: My performance appraisal is a fair reflection of my performance.", "Q. 31: Discussions with my supervisor/team leader about my performance are worthwhile.", "Q. 32: I am held accountable for achieving results.", "Q. 40: Managers review and evaluate the organization\u2019s progress toward meeting its goals and objectives.", "Q. 56: How satisfied are you with the recognition you receive for doing a good job?", "Q. 2: I am given a real opportunity to improve my skills in my organization.", "Q. 11: The workforce has the job-relevant knowledge and skills necessary to accomplish organizational goals.", "Q. 14: My work unit is able to recruit people with the right skills.", "Q. 15: The skill level in my work unit has improved in the past year.", "Q. 16: I have sufficient resources (for example, people, materials, budget) to get my job done.", "Q. 47: Supervisors/team leaders provide employees with constructive suggestions to improve their job performance.", "Q. 48: Supervisors/team leaders in my work unit support employee development.", "Q. 59: How satisfied are you with the training you receive for your present job?"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: OPM Succession Planning Position Profile\u2014Annotated with Instructions", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Office of Personnel Management", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, key contributors to this report  were William Doherty, Assistant Director; Ami Ballenger; Laura Miller  Craig; Judith Kordahl; and Katherine Hudson Walker.
