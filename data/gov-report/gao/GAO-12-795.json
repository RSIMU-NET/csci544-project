Associated costs cover a wide range of requirements, such as  broadcast equipment, new furniture, and additional staffing  requirements to manage information technology and security.  According to CMP officials, these costs were originally expected to be  funded by UN program offices through the regular UN budget  process. Therefore, the CMP office\u2019s original cost estimates for the  CMP did not include new furniture or equipment except where the  equipment was part of the permanent infrastructure of the UN. For  instance, according to the CMP office, the original CMP scope only  provided for furniture for three new mid-sized conference rooms and  supplemental office furniture associated with swing spaces.

With no solution to the security issues related to the  Library and South Annex, CMP officials told us that they would propose  limiting the scope of the renovations to these buildings. Rather than  renovating as originally planned, the renovations to the Library and South  Annex would only include connecting them to new building systems, such  as heating and air conditioning. Based on the original cost estimate for  these buildings, the CMP office estimates that not fully renovating the two  buildings would eliminate $65 million in planned work, which could be  applied to address projected cost overruns of the CMP. CMP officials also  told us that they plan to explore additional opportunities to reduce work  and achieve savings related to site landscaping and the General  Assembly Building, but have not estimated the potential savings of these  options. As shown in table 4, combining the proposed financing options  with reductions in the project\u2019s planned scope would still leave the project  with a shortfall of $212.7 million.", "Another potential financing option is an additional member assessment.

For example, with  regard to transparency, member states inquired why the CMP office did  not include $38 million in increased swing space leasing costs in earlier  CMP cost estimates. The CMP office noted that it negotiated swing space  leases for a period longer than necessary to mitigate the risk of CMP  schedule delays. The CMP office did not include these costs in its earlier  estimates because it assumed these leases could be terminated early or  used by other UN departments in the event the CMP project no longer  needed the swing space. According to the CMP office, in a healthy rental  market, early termination or subleasing is common; however, the  economic downturn prevented it from taking such actions. In addition,  member states inquired about the main factors that led to the projected  increase in cost overruns. According to the CMP office, a key factor of the  projected cost overruns was increased asbestos abatement costs related  to asbestos found in the basements and Conference Building in late  2011. However, the CMP office had previously reported that all asbestos  was abated from Conference Rooms 1-3 of the Conference Building in  February 2011. Further, the 2011 CMP annual report considered the  abatement of asbestos and the removal of obsolete materials from the  Secretariat and Conference Buildings a significant achievement.

For example, a U.S.  representative at the March 2012 session asked about the amount and  utilization of the remaining contingency fund for the CMP. While the CMP  office reported that $89.1 million remained in funds for contingency and  price escalation, this amount was as of May 2011, before the increase in  estimated cost overruns reported in March 2012. Moreover, USUN  officials told us that despite the briefings and information provided by the  CMP office, there was still insufficient information as to why and when the  projected cost overruns occurred.", "While CMP officials told us that they could not currently quantify the  individual cost drivers of the $149 million increase in projected cost  overruns that occurred between May 2011 and February 2012, they  stated that the February 2012 estimates were the best available.

Leases for the UN\u2019s two  largest leased office spaces expire at the end of March 2018, with options  to extend to the end of March 2023, but no renewal options beyond that  date.

In July 2011, the  Governor of the State of New York signed legislation authorizing the City  of New York to transfer parkland to UNDC to construct a new office  building for the UN as large as 900,000 square feet and located across  the street from UN headquarters. In October 2011, key officials of the City  and State of New York entered into a memorandum of understanding  (MOU) regarding the consolidation building. The MOU, to which UNDC  consented, obligates UNDC to specific actions, including initial funding for  and issuance of bonds to finance the project. Per the MOU, the property  will not convey to the UN until UNDC and UN reach agreement on the  terms, with a deadline of December 31, 2015. According to UNDC  officials, they would like to receive agreement from the UN by early 2014.", "UN officials told us that they were informed of the MOU by UNDC officials  shortly before it was finalized and signed, but have not entered into a  formal agreement regarding the consolidation building. UN officials stated  that they did not see the MOU prior to the City and State of New York  signing it in October 2011 and therefore had no input to the document.  Moreover, while the UN is not a party to the MOU, the document contains  requirements to which the UN must agree for the consolidation building to  move forward. For example, the UN would have to agree to lease the new  office building from UNDC, potentially in a lease-to-own or similar  arrangement. UN officials expressed concern that some of the terms of  the MOU could increase costs and risks to the UN. For instance,  according to UN officials, leasing the building would likely require the UN  to pay an amount roughly equivalent to the bonds issued by UNDC to  design and construct the consolidation building. UN officials told us that  since they will not know the potential lease costs until the bonds are  issued, they would like the option to opt out of the project upon review of  the potential costs. Additionally, according to the MOU, as a condition of  agreeing to lease the consolidation building, the UN would have to extend  the leases at two of its largest leased spaces at increased rental rates  and with additional costs. For instance, according to the terms of the UN\u2019s  current lease, its rates will increase from $27.50 per square foot (about  $18.2 million per year) to $30 per square foot (about $19.8 million per  year) if the organization exercises the option to extend its lease from  2018 to 2023. However, according to UN officials, under the MOU, the  UN would have to extend the leases from 2018 to 2023 and its rates  could rise to market rates, estimated by the UN to be approximately $77  per square foot. Additional costs include an amount equal to real estate  taxes attributable to the space, which UN officials said was not originally  included in the lease renewal terms. Finally, UN officials cited concerns  related to \u201crisk sharing\u201d in the proposal. Specifically, officials expressed  concern that the proposal places the entire risk for the cost of the project  on the UN, rather than sharing the risk between the UN and UNDC.
