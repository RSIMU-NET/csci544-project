According to industry participants, while annuities with GLWBs have been sold for a number of years, CDAs are relatively new and are not widely available. GAO was asked to review issues relating to these financial products. This report (1) compares the features of VA/GLWBs and CDAs and examines potential benefits and risks to consumers and potential risks to insurers, and (2) examines the regulation of these products and the extent to which regulations address risks to consumers.

Two such products, variable annuities with guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefits (VA/GLWB) and contingent deferred annuities (CDA), share a number of features but have some important structural differences. For example, both provide consumers with access to investment assets and the guarantee of lifetime income, but while VA/GLWB assets are held in a separate account of the insurer for the benefit of the annuity purchaser, the assets covered by a CDA are generally held in an investment account owned by the CDA purchaser. Consumers can benefit from these products by having a steady stream of income regardless of how their investment assets perform or how long they live, while at the same time maintaining access to their assets for unexpected or other expenses. VA/GLWBs and CDAs are complex products that present some risks to consumers and require them to make multiple important decisions. For example, consumers might purchase an unsuitable product or make withdrawal decisions that could negatively affect their potential benefits. Several insurers and regulators GAO spoke to said it was important for consumers to obtain professional financial advice before purchasing these products and making key decisions. These products can also create risks for insurers which, if not addressed, could ultimately affect insurers' ability to provide promised benefits to consumers.", "VA/GLWBs are considered to be both securities and insurance products, and are therefore covered by both federal securities regulations and state insurance regulations. For CDAs, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners committee responsible for life insurance and annuities products has determined CDAs to be life insurance products subject to state law and regulation for annuities. According to SEC officials, existing CDAs have been registered as securities with SEC, and therefore are covered by both federal securities laws and regulations, and state insurance regulations. At the state level, NAIC has developed state disclosure and suitability regulations for annuity products. However, states differ on the extent to which they have adopted these annuity regulations, and some do not have protections at all. As a result, consumers in states that have adopted different regulations may benefit from different levels of protection. NAIC and state regulators told GAO that they are currently reviewing the regulations of CDAs. In March 2012, NAIC began reviewing existing annuity regulations to determine whether any changes are needed to address the unique product design features of CDAs, including potential modifications to annuity disclosure and suitability standards. It is also reviewing what kinds of capital and reserving requirements may be needed to help insurers manage product risk. In addition, NAIC and the National Organization of Life and Health Guaranty Associations are each working to determine whether state insurance guaranty funds, which protect consumers in the event insurers become insolvent, cover CDA products. Both agree that each state will have to reach its own conclusion about whether their particular state guaranty fund laws allow for CDA coverage. Until these regulatory issues are resolved, consumers may not be fully protected."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Longevity risk, or the potential for outliving one\u2019s financial resources in  retirement, is a critical issue for today\u2019s older Americans.

In addition, LIMRA data on the  demographics of VA/GLWB consumers show that in 2010 the average  age of the consumer purchasing a VA/GLWB was 61 and the average  age at first withdrawal was 68. Typically, the average annual withdrawal  has been around $5,500. Also according to LIMRA, the average amount  of a VA/GLWB contract sale from 2007 through 2010 was around  $106,000.", "Like a GLWB rider, a CDA is an insurance contract that provides  guaranteed lifetime income payments if a consumer\u2019s investment account  is exhausted, whether through withdrawals or poor market performance.

Similar to a VA/GWLB, a CDA contract  defines how much a consumer is able to withdraw\u2014for example, 5  percent of the benefit base annually. Even if the value of the covered  assets drops to zero, the insurance company has guaranteed the 5  percent withdrawal benefit (based on the benefit base value when lifetime  withdrawals began) and continues making the annual payments to the  consumer. Whether or not a policyholder receives payment from the  insurance company selling the CDA is contingent upon the covered  assets dropping to zero. On the basis of the products we reviewed, fees  on CDAs are calculated as a set percentage of the investment assets or  benefit base per year.

Investors may rely on broker-dealers and investment  advisers for information or advice about securities, including insurance  products such as VA/GLWBs and CDAs.

In general,  both allow consumers to take lifetime withdrawals from their assets at a  rate that the insurance company guarantees even if such withdrawals and  investment losses deplete the consumer\u2019s assets. VA/GLWBs and CDAs  generally have three distinct phases of ownership: an accumulation  phase, a withdrawal phase, and an insured phase (see fig. 1).", "The accumulation phase begins when a consumer purchases a  VA/GLWB or CDA contract.with a GLWB rider or the value of assets covered by a CDA contract  establishes the initial withdrawal value, or benefit base, on which the   The initial premium paid under a VA contract  amount of lifetime withdrawals are based. This benefit base is not a  cash value that can be withdrawn, but rather is the amount to which  lifetime withdrawal percentages will be applied during the withdrawal  phase. The investment account value, on the other hand, represents the  total value of the consumer\u2019s investments, which is increased by  investment gains and decreased by fees, withdrawals, and any  investment losses. During this phase the consumer decides how to  allocate investment assets among various options, including funds made  available by an insurance company for investment under its VA/GLWB  products and funds that an insurance company has agreed to cover  under its CDA products. Also during this phase, the insurance company  monitors each consumer\u2019s account value and automatically adjusts the  benefit base periodically should investment gains increase the value of  this account. This feature, which exists for the VA/GLWBs and CDAs we  reviewed, is referred to as a step-up or ratchet. Once a consumer\u2019s  benefit base is stepped up, it cannot later decline because of investment  losses that reduce the consumer\u2019s investment account value.", "Some VA/GLWBs have an additional feature that guarantees that, no  matter how the investments perform, the benefit base will grow each year  by a set percentage. This guaranteed percentage, alternatively referred to  as a roll-up rate, growth credit, or bonus, is added to the benefit base, as  adjusted for any prior step-ups. For example, some of the VA/GLWBs we  reviewed included annual roll-up rates that ranged from 5 to 7 percent.  The amount of the roll-up rate and the frequency, duration, and manner of  calculation can affect the value of a consumer\u2019s benefit base and thus the  amount that can be taken as lifetime withdrawals. While such features  can increase a consumer\u2019s benefit base on which lifetime withdrawals are  determined, annuities with higher roll-up rates can have higher fees.", "The withdrawal phase starts when a consumer begins taking annual  lifetime withdrawals. The maximum amount of lifetime withdrawals that a  consumer can take each year (without incurring a reduction in their  benefit base) is calculated as a percentage of the consumer\u2019s benefit  base at the time of the first lifetime withdrawal. The VA/GLWBs and CDAs  we reviewed had withdrawal percentages for a single life that ranged from  3 percent to over 8 percent of the benefit base, and the percentages were  generally lower for younger consumers and higher for older consumers.  Some products also have a joint life option where, if the consumer dies,  the guarantee of lifetime income passes to their spouse. When such an  option is elected, withdrawal amounts are typically one-half a percent less  than they would be otherwise.", "Step-ups, like those during the accumulation phase, can increase the  benefit base after lifetime withdrawals have begun, increasing the amount  of annual lifetime withdrawals. Typically, the insurance company will  increase the benefit base if a consumer\u2019s account value, net of  withdrawals and fees, has increased above this amount. After a step-up  during the withdrawal phase, the base and the lifetime maximum  withdrawals cannot decline because of investment losses that reduce the  consumer\u2019s account value. Step-ups that occur after lifetime withdrawals  begin allow consumers to benefit from investment gains that can offset  the effects of inflation.", "A consumer enters the insured phase only if their investment account  value has been reduced to zero as a result of lifetime withdrawals;  investment losses; or any expenses, fees, or other charges. In such  cases, the consumer\u2019s benefit base on which lifetime withdrawals are  determined (the amount to which the withdrawal percentage is applied)  remains unchanged but the consumer\u2019s investment account value, which  was the source for the funds previously withdrawn, is zero. Consequently,  the funds needed to continue paying the same level of benefits to the  consumer (and spouse, if a joint life option is elected) would then come  from the insurance company\u2019s own assets, and consumers receive  payments from the insurance company that are equal to their prior lifetime  withdrawal amount. Once the insurance company begins paying the  agreed-upon withdrawal payment, the fees that the consumer had been  paying for that protection would cease, as would any investment  management and other fees paid for other benefits. Once the insured  phase begins, all rights and benefits under a VA/GLWB or CDA contract,   In addition, all  except those related to continuing benefits, terminate. lifetime withdrawal benefits will continue to be paid to the consumer on  the established schedule and generally cannot be changed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Structural Differences Exist between VA/GLWBs and CDAs", "paragraphs": ["For example, the right to make additional contributions and receive the benefit of future  step-ups in the withdrawal amount would no longer be available to an owner once the  account is depleted. a separate account of the insurance company. The mutual funds may be  managed by outside advisers, but the insurance company holds these  assets for the benefit of consumers. By comparison, the investment  assets covered by a CDA are held by the consumer in his or her own  brokerage or investment advisory account and invested in investment  funds, such as mutual funds, that the insurance company has agreed to  cover under a CDA. The investment assets are not owned\u2014nominally or  otherwise\u2014by the insurance company issuing the guarantee. Like the  investment options available under a VA/GLWB, the investment assets  covered by a CDA may or may not be managed by the insurance  company or an affiliate. In this way, consumers can accumulate  retirement assets in a personal account, such as an individual retirement  account (IRA), and obtain lifetime withdrawal guarantees without having  to transfer those assets to an insurance company.", "Further, the base variable annuity contracts to which GLWB riders are  attached provide additional benefits not available under CDAs. For  example, a VA/GLWB contract permits the consumer to annuitize an  account balance in the future and receive benefit payments from the  insurance company for life at rates set forth in the annuity contract.  Also, with a VA/GLWB, if a consumer dies before annuitizing the account  balance or taking lifetime withdrawals, the death benefit payable to  beneficiaries is typically the greater of the sum of premiums paid or the  investment account value. The additional VA/GLWB benefits come with  additional costs, however. For example, in addition to the guarantee fee,  variable annuity contracts with death benefits entail additional fees to  cover the cost to the insurer. For the CDAs we reviewed, the assets  covered by the CDA could not be annuitized in the future. The assets  would first have to be sold and the proceeds used to purchase a separate  annuity.

That  is, for a fee, they can ensure that consumers receive a minimum annual  payment until they die, regardless of how long they live or how their  investment assets might perform. These products may also lock  investment gains into the benefit base on which future lifetime  withdrawals are determined and, in the case of variable annuities, also  offer other potentially beneficial features such as death benefits, which  pass on certain guaranteed amounts to a spouse or other beneficiaries.  Further, VA/GLWBs and CDAs typically offer consumers the ability to  invest their assets in a variety of investment funds.", "A unique benefit of these products is that they allow consumers to receive  income guarantees while still maintaining ownership of and access to their  funds during the accumulation and withdrawal phases. With traditional  annuity products, in order to receive lifetime income consumers must  transfer assets to the insurer, who holds them in their own general account  and uses them to fund an annuity (they are annuitized). Consequently,  once these assets are annuitized the consumer does not have access to  these assets. With VA/GLWBs and CDAs, however, the consumers\u2019 assets  are not annuitized. As a result, consumers can withdraw any or all of their  funds at any time. This can benefit consumers should they need funds for  unexpected uses, such as medical or other expenses.", "One benefit specific to CDAs is that the guarantee of lifetime withdrawals  can, in certain cases, be applied to existing investment assets. That is,  consumers who have existing investment assets may be able to purchase  a CDA to cover those assets, if an insurer agrees to cover those assets  under a CDA. If the same consumers wanted to use those assets to  obtain a guaranteed stream of income through a traditional annuity, they  would have to first sell the investment assets and then use the proceeds  to purchase the annuity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consumers Face Risks When Purchasing and Withdrawing Funds from VA/GLWBs and CDAs", "paragraphs": ["Several insurers and regulators we spoke with said that VA/GLWBs and  CDAs are complex products, and emphasized the importance of obtaining  professional financial advice before purchasing these products and  making key decisions. Consumers that purchase VA/GLWBs and CDAs  can face risks similar to those they may face with the purchase of other  financial products. These risks include purchasing an unsuitable product,  paying too much, making withdrawal decisions that decrease benefits,  and having an insurer become insolvent before benefits are received.", "First, consumers face the risk of purchasing an unsuitable product if they  do not understand how a particular product functions and meets their own  needs, including how much might be appropriate to invest in a particular  product. Insurers with whom we spoke said that VA/GLWBs and CDAs  are generally attractive to middle-income consumers who want more  control and flexibility over the investments they are relying on to provide  retirement income. In addition, one insurer with whom we spoke said that  consumers investing in such products have generally had around  $500,000 in retirement savings and invested around 20 percent of that  amount.", "Second, consumers may face the risk of being unable to determine if they  are obtaining the best price for similar benefits provided by different  insurers. Several insurers and regulators told us that because of the  uniqueness of VA/GLWB and CDA products, it would be difficult to  compare one insurer\u2019s product to that of another insurer. For example,  products can function in slightly different ways, have different  combinations of features, and charge different amounts for the  guarantees. As a result, consumers would find it difficult to take a price  quoted to them from one insurer for a specific product with specific  features, then compare that to a product from another insurer to  determine if they could receive similar benefits at a lower price.", "Third, VA/GLWBs and CDAs pose a risk that certain decisions by  consumers in withdrawing their assets, such as the timing and size of the  withdrawals, could affect them negatively. For example, these decisions  can reduce or even eliminate guaranteed benefits and result in additional  fees that further reduce their assets. The investment assets underlying  VA/GLWB and CDA guarantees are typically available for withdrawal  before guaranteed lifetime withdrawals begin, but taking withdrawals too  early or above certain thresholds can result in financial penalties and  deplete assets, as the following examples illustrate,", "Variable annuities are frequently sold without any up front sales  charges but impose contingent deferred sales charges, or \u201csurrender\u201d  charges, on withdrawals taken during the early years of the contract  (for example, the first 7 years) that are above a \u201cfree\u201d withdrawal  limit. Surrender charges on variable annuities are expressed as a  series of percentages that decline over time and are applied to annual  withdrawals that are typically greater than either accumulated  earnings or 10 percent of premiums paid. Because CDAs split  insurance and investment elements of the guarantee, there are no  surrender charges on the CDA contract. However, a surrender charge  may apply when a consumer sells shares of mutual funds covered by  the CDA contract. In addition to sales charges, income taxes and an  additional 10 percent penalty tax on withdrawals taken before age  59\u00bd may apply.", "With some VA/GLWB products, taking withdrawals of any amount  after reaching a minimum age can trigger the beginning of lifetime  withdrawals (at a specified percentage) and stop all future roll-ups of  the benefit base. In addition, a consumer who takes withdrawals  sooner than initially planned can experience a permanent reduction of  the lifetime withdrawal amount. For example, for one of the products  we reviewed a withdrawal at age 64 triggers the establishment of a 4  percent lifetime withdrawal percentage, but waiting for a year would  raise the percentage to 5 percent. Further, starting lifetime  withdrawals during a downturn in the market can have a negative  effect on lifetime income because the investment account balance will  be that much lower than the benefit base, making the possibility of a  step-up, and a possible increase in the withdrawal percentage and  amount, less likely.", "The age at which lifetime withdrawals begin can have an impact on  the value of other benefits and guarantees. For example, withdrawals  and the related charges can reduce the cash value and death benefits  under a variable annuity contract, leaving fewer assets available for  surviving spouses and other beneficiaries. On the other hand, waiting  too long to withdraw benefits can result in not living long enough to  benefit from the product\u2019s guarantees or receiving enough income to  offset the amount of fees paid. For example, a person who first  purchases a VA/GLWB or CDA at age 60 and waits until age 85 to  begin taking lifetime withdrawals will be able to take a higher amount,  but likely for a shorter period of time. Further, the purchaser will have  paid fees for 25 years to protect against outliving his assets, a  possibility that becomes less likely over time.", "In addition to deciding when to begin taking lifetime withdrawals,  consumers need to decide how much to withdraw and need to be aware  of certain product features when doing so. For example, lifetime  withdrawals above the maximum annual amount specified in the  withdrawal guarantee are permitted and are referred to as \u201cexcess  withdrawals.\u201d However, such withdrawals typically reduce the benefit  base to which withdrawal percentages are applied, thus reducing future  annual withdrawal amounts. Further, guarantee fees and other charges  are typically not counted as withdrawals for purposes of calculating the  maximum for a given year, but some VA/GLWB and CDA products we  reviewed counted certain fees and charges or those above a certain  threshold toward the annual lifetime withdrawal maximum.", "Finally, as with the purchase of any long-term insurance product,  consumers can face some level of risk that by the time the consumer  needs the benefit promised by the insurer, the insurer may not be able to  provide it. However, insurers and insurance regulators take a number of  steps to ensure that insurers remain financially solvent. In addition, in the  event of an insurer\u2019s insolvency, state insurance guaranty funds can help  pay consumers what was promised by insurers, up to any coverage limits  of those guaranty funds. According to officials from the National  Organization for Life and Health Guaranty Associations (NOLHGA), while  promises made under GLWBs, which are distinct from the investment  portion of a variable annuity, are generally covered by state guaranty  funds, such certainty does not exist with respect to CDAs.

While a number of insurers and NAIC officials said that VA/GLWBs and  CDAs do not pose undue risk to insurers, as we noted, at least one major  insurer has decided not to sell CDAs because of the potential risk  involved, and another insurer told us that they do not sell VA/GLWBs  because they do not fit with the company\u2019s risk profile.", "Insurance company officials with whom we spoke told us that in designing  their products they consider not only the features that will help to meet  consumer needs, but also the company\u2019s own appetite for certain risks,  the methods for managing those risks, and the price charged for the  products\u2019 guarantees.

Another  insurer that sells CDAs told us that they were only willing to cover  index funds for major, highly traded indices, such as the Standard and  Poor\u2019s 500.", "Determining the formulas used to rebalance consumers\u2019 investments  into and out of fixed-income funds to mitigate some of the financial  risks associated with providing lifetime withdrawal guarantees.  Prospectuses for these VA/GLWB products disclose that the  automatic rebalancing feature may limit the consumer\u2019s participation  in future market gains and, therefore, the potential for future increases  in their annual lifetime income.", "Insurers will also price their products to ensure they have sufficient  revenue and capital to pay for the expenses they expect to incur related  to the products they sell. That is, they will charge more for products that  they deem to be more risky or on which they expect to incur greater  costs. With respect to VA/GLWBs and CDAs, for example, insurers may  charge higher fees for products with features that can result in a higher  guaranteed benefit base. Insurers also use hedging programs to help  further manage the investment risks of the assets underlying the  VA/GLWB and CDA. Hedging involves buying financial instruments, such  as options, to offset the potential loss on an investment.", "To the extent that product design and hedging is not sufficient, insurers  can also manage financial risks by modifying their products after they  have been purchased by consumers to the extent permitted by their  contracts, their prior disclosure, and applicable law. For the VA/GLWB  and CDA products we reviewed, insurers sometimes reserve certain  rights, such as the right to determine which investment funds will be  covered by a GLWB rider or CDA guarantee and the conditions  surrounding the allocation of a consumer\u2019s investment assets, change the  frequency and amount of a guarantee fee, or reject additional  contributions or transfers. Some insurers have recently raised fees on  VA/GLWB guarantees or stopped accepting additional contributions to  existing contracts in response to changing market conditions. Insurers  generally cannot change the roll-up, step-up, or withdrawal rates for  existing contract holders, but can make these changes prospectively for  new customers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal and State Oversight Varies by Type of Product and Is Currently under Industry Review", "paragraphs": ["Federal disclosure and suitability regulations apply to the offer,  recommendation, and sale of securities products such as variable  annuities, including variable annuities with GLWB riders.

NAIC has developed these model disclosure and suitability  regulations for annuity products in collaboration with consumer advocates  and industry experts. However, unlike federal standards that are  consistently applied to variable annuities regardless of where consumers  live, state adoption of these model regulations varies, so protections may  be stronger in some states than in others. In 2011, NAIC developed a  model disclosure regulation for annuity products that serves several  functions for consumers and insurers, including: helping ensure that consumers understand annuity products by  explaining basic features, benefits, and fees;  suggesting that annuity products with guaranteed income or benefit  provisions are intended to be longer-term investment products; providing guidance for insurers when they choose to develop product  illustrations intended to help consumers better understand how a  particular annuity product works. In particular, the guidance provides  illustration formats and specifies what kinds of illustration disclosures  must be made when an insurer chooses to develop them; and  requiring that annuity customers be provided or referred to NAIC\u2019s  Annuity Buyer\u2019s Guide that also contains general product information  and provides answers to basic questions about risks and investing  that consumers can use to decide whether these products are right for  them.", "In addition to its model disclosure regulation, NAIC developed a model  suitability regulation in 2003 to help ensure that insurers consider the  financial needs and objectives of consumers and that these needs are  appropriately addressed at the time annuity sales or exchanges occur.  More specifically, the model suitability regulation requires insurers and  insurance agents to inquire about consumers\u2019 suitability information and  ensure that they have reasonable grounds to believe that annuity  products would benefit consumers before recommending purchases or  exchanges. In 2006, NAIC revised the model regulation to expand its  scope to consumers of all ages, and in 2010 the model regulation was  again revised to further strengthen a number of annuity suitability  protections. Among other changes, the 2010 revision requires insurers to be responsible for compliance with the model regulation whether or  not they contract suitability functions out to a third party; maintain procedures for reviewing each investment recommendation  made to consumers and helping ensure that the product is suitable for  the particular purchaser and that the purchaser understands the  annuity product recommended; ensure that insurance agents, or producers, complete general annuity  training before selling annuity products; and provide product-specific annuity training and training materials to the  agent or producer before an agent or producer can solicit the sale of a  product.", "In addition to these changes, NAIC adopted the revised the model  regulation to set standards and procedures for suitable annuity  recommendations and to require insurers to establish a system to  supervise recommendations so that the insurance needs and financial  objectives of consumers are appropriately addressed. The revised NAIC  model regulation includes a \u201csafe harbor\u201d provision that is intended to  prevent duplicative suitability standards from being applied to sales of  annuities through FINRA member broker-dealers. Annuity sales made in  compliance with FINRA requirements are deemed to comply with the  suitability requirements outlined in NAIC\u2019s model regulation. Violations of  state law developed from the model regulation can result in remedies for  consumers and penalties for insurers and agents. Under the model  regulation, state insurance commissioners can require reasonably  appropriate corrective action for violations that have harmed consumers.", "NAIC information shows that, as of October 2012, state adoption of  NAIC\u2019s disclosure and suitability regulations varied significantly, meaning  that consumers in some states may not be protected as well as those in  other states. According to NAIC, many states have adopted some form  of annuity disclosure regulation, although some states and the District of  Columbia do not have disclosure protections in place. As of October  2012, officials are working to determine which states had adopted the  revised model disclosure regulation. In terms of the suitability model  regulation, 19 states plus the District of Columbia have adopted NAIC\u2019s  most recent model regulation that incorporates the added protections  noted above, and another 29 states have adopted other suitability  protections for annuity consumers. The remaining 2 states do not have  suitability regulations in place. According to NAIC officials, model  disclosure and suitability standards are not required as part of NAIC\u2019s  accreditation program. Figure 2 summarizes the state adoption of  suitability regulations.", "Whether or not states have adopted NAIC disclosure and suitability  regulation is important for CDA consumers. Unlike federal regulations that  apply to the sale of VA/GLWBs nationwide, disclosure and suitability  regulations for CDAs may depend on the actions of individual states and  the extent to which they have implemented these protections. According  to NAIC, regulatory action by states can time to occur and depends on  legislative cycles and the political environment of states. As the  information in figure 2 shows, consumers across states are subject to  different suitability protection and in some cases to no protection at all.", "The different regulatory approaches among the sample of seven states  we reviewed also show the variation in regulation of CDAs across states.  Although most states in our sample have not specifically approved CDA  sales, most have adopted some form of disclosure and suitability  regulation for annuity products. Among these seven states, three have  adopted NAIC\u2019s model disclosure regulation and three have adopted  NAIC\u2019s most recent suitability regulation. For the states that allow CDA  sales, the consumer protections found in the model regulations are  critical. Of the two states that allow CDA sales\u2014Iowa and Ohio\u2014both  have adopted NAIC\u2019s model disclosure regulation, but only Iowa has  adopted its most recent model suitability regulation. Ohio, according to  NAIC information, has passed a previous version of NAIC\u2019s model  suitability regulation, and therefore has not adopted added protections  found in the revised model regulation as outlined above. Consumers in  states that have not adopted NAIC\u2019s model regulations may not be  benefitting from available disclosure and suitability protections. More  specifically, states that have not adopted the most recent model suitability  regulations may not be extending to consumers protections developed  through NAIC\u2019s 2010 suitability revision. Table 1 shows the variation in  the disclosure and suitability protections across our seven sample states.", "Some industry participants suggest state insurance regulation and  existing actuarial guidance may adequately address risks to insurers  offering CDAs and to consumers. Others said that CDAs may pose  solvency risks for both because insurers offer consumers an income  guarantee but do not maintain the assets on which the guarantees are  made. One major insurer has said that CDAs pose significant enough  pricing and reserving challenges that it does not offer CDAs. In addition,  two consumer advocates with whom we spoke highlighted the solvency  risks CDAs pose for insurers. One advocate suggested that reasonable  and appropriate insurer reserving and capital requirements do not  currently exist for CDAs and that considerable NAIC and state regulatory  work would be needed to develop them. The same advocate said selling  CDA products before key issues concerning the regulatory framework are  finalized might expose consumers to risks that might result from an  insurer\u2019s potential insolvency. The advocate concluded that the potential  for insurers to increase the marketing and sale of CDAs, given the  growing needs of retirees, makes having consumer and insurer  protections in place important.", "Potential risks to CDA consumers and insurers have prompted industry  oversight reviews of these products and their regulation. Although NAIC  has determined that CDAs are a life insurance product, it is working with  state regulators, insurers, and consumer advocates through its CDA  Working Group, formed in March 2012, to build greater consensus around  the classification of CDAs and to determine whether any adjustments to  state regulation might be appropriate. In particular, NAIC is evaluating the  adequacy of existing state annuity laws and regulations for CDA sales,  including those on insurer solvency such as capital adequacy and reserve  requirements. According to NAIC officials, both NAIC and state insurance  regulators recognize the complexity of CDA products for consumers and  are also working to revise disclosure and suitability practices where  appropriate.", "Another industry review by the NOHLGA, NAIC, and state insurance  regulators aims to address whether CDA consumers are protected by  state insurance guaranty funds in the event of an insurer\u2019s insolvency.  According to NOLHGA officials, variable annuities are not covered by  guaranty funds because they are indistinguishable from equity  products. That is, they are not supported by assets in an insurer\u2019s general  account, but by specific assets in separate accounts dedicated to the  particular fund or funds chosen for the variable annuity. However, the  officials said that guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefits, which are now  part of most variable annuity contracts, are distinct from the equity portion  of a variable annuity and are generally covered by state guaranty  funds. The officials said that while CDAs would also appear to have an  equity portion and a guarantee portion, they have a committee studying  the extent to which CDAs might be covered by state guaranty  funds. Officials noted that even when the committee has reached a  determination on guaranty fund protections, each state will have to reach  its own conclusion about whether their particular guaranty fund laws allow  for CDA coverage."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of the report to SEC and NAIC and relevant excerpts  to FINRA.
