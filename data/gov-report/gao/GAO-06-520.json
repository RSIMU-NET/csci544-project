Advocates of specialty hospitals contend that competition from these physician-owned facilities can prompt general hospitals to implement efficiency, quality, and amenity improvements, thus favorably affecting the overall health care delivery system. Critics of specialty hospitals are concerned that general hospitals may respond to such competition by making changes that do not necessarily increase efficiency or benefit patients or communities, for example, by adding services already available in the community. The appropriateness of physicians' financial interests in specialty hospitals has also been questioned. GAO was asked to provide information on the competitive response of general hospitals to specialty hospitals. GAO surveyed approximately 600 general hospitals in markets with and without specialty hospitals to provide information on the extent to which these two groups of general hospitals reported implementing operational and clinical service changes to remain competitive. GAO received responses from 401 general hospitals."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Nearly all general hospitals responding to GAO's survey reported making operational and clinical service changes to remain competitive in what they viewed as increasingly competitive healthcare markets; however, there was little evidence to suggest that general hospitals made substantially more or fewer changes or different types of changes if some of their competition came from a specialty hospital. While the majority of survey respondents indicated that competition from other general hospitals had increased, a larger proportion of respondents--91 percent of urban general hospitals and 74 percent of rural general hospitals--reported increases in competition from limited service facilities, a category that includes approximately 100 specialty hospitals across the nation and thousands of ambulatory surgical centers and imaging centers. To enhance their ability to compete, general hospitals reported making an average of 22 operational changes, such as introducing a formal process for evaluating efforts to improve quality and reduce costs, and 8 clinical service changes, such as adding or expanding cardiology services, from 2000 through 2005. Although specialty hospital advocates have hypothesized that the entrance of a specialty hospital into a market encourages the area's existing general hospitals to adopt changes that make them more efficient and better able to compete, the survey responses largely did not support this view. There were no substantial differences in the average number of operational and clinical service changes made by general hospitals in markets with and without specialty hospitals and, for the vast majority of the potential changes included on GAO's survey, there was no statistical difference between the two groups of hospitals in terms of the specific changes they reported implementing. GAO received comments on a draft of this report from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). In its comments, CMS stated that GAO's study, by providing quantitative data on the market effect of specialty hospitals, was extremely helpful."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The approximately 4,800 general hospitals in the nation face competition  from a variety of sources, including, in some markets, specialty hospitals  whose owners or investors include physicians who admit patients to the  facility. Specialty hospitals are distinguished from other short-term acute  care hospitals in that the former primarily treat patients who have specific  medical conditions or need surgical procedures. Specialty hospitals that  have opened in recent years typically provide cardiac or orthopedic care  or specialize in surgical procedures. In 2005, there were approximately 100  such specialty hospitals in operation or under development that had  physician owners or investors.", "Although there are relatively few physician-owned specialty hospitals,  their potential effect on general hospitals and hospital markets has  become a subject of debate. Advocates for specialty hospitals have stated  that competition from these facilities favorably affects the overall health  care delivery system for hospital services. According to advocates, this  result occurs both because specialty hospitals\u2019 focused missions enable  them to provide high-quality care efficiently and because competition from  specialty hospitals creates incentives for general hospitals to implement  quality, efficiency, and amenity improvements. In contrast, critics of  specialty hospitals have stated that these facilities, in part because of their  focused missions, have an unfair competitive advantage relative to general  hospitals, which have broad missions to serve all of a community\u2019s health  care needs, including the provision of emergency care. These critics are  also concerned that physicians\u2019 ownership or investment interests in  specialty hospitals create financial incentives that could inappropriately  affect physicians\u2019 clinical and referral behavior. Moreover, this view holds,  the competitive behaviors that specialty hospitals elicit from general  hospitals may not all be socially desirable. For example, in their quest to  compete, general hospitals could add services that duplicate those already  available in a community, enter into exclusive contracts with health plans,  or make changes to discourage physicians from opening rival specialty  hospitals. We and other federal agencies have studied various issues  related to hospital market competition and specialty hospitals. To date,  however, the evidence of how general hospitals\u2019 competitive actions have  been influenced by the presence of specialty hospitals has largely been  anecdotal.", "Provisions in the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and  Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) had the effect, in general, of  establishing an 18-month moratorium on the development of new specialty  hospitals. Although the moratorium expired in June 2005, the recently  enacted Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA) has the effect of extending  the moratorium until the date the Secretary of Health and Human Services  issues a final report to appropriate committees of jurisdiction of Congress  on a plan that addresses issues concerning physician investment in  specialty hospitals or up to 8 months after the enactment date of DRA,  whichever is earlier.", "Because the issue of specialty hospitals remains controversial, you  expressed interest in knowing more about the competitive response of  general hospitals to specialty hospitals. In this report, we provide  information on the extent to which general hospitals in markets with  specialty hospitals and general hospitals in markets without specialty  hospitals reported implementing operational and clinical service changes  to remain competitive.", "To conduct our analysis, we surveyed a sample of general hospitals in  regional markets with at least one specialty hospital that had opened since  the beginning of 1998. We also surveyed a comparison sample of general  hospitals in regional markets where there were no specialty hospitals.  General hospitals in both groups were asked to describe the extent of  competition within their markets in 2005, and to indicate the operational  changes and clinical service changes they made from 2000 through 2005 to  remain competitive in their markets. (See app. II for a copy of the survey.)  The 72 potential operational changes listed in the survey included, for  example, increasing income guarantees to recruit physicians. The 34  potential clinical services listed in the survey that hospitals could have  reported adding, expanding, reducing, or eliminating included services  such as cardiac care. We analyzed the survey responses to determine  whether there were significant differences between the two groups of  hospitals in terms of the total number and types of changes made. This  comparison was made separately for urban general hospitals, defined as  those hospitals located in a metropolitan statistical area (MSA), and rural  general hospitals, defined as those hospitals located outside of an MSA,  because the extent of changes made by general hospitals in response to  the presence of a specialty hospital could be different in the two  environments.", "Our analysis accounted for the possibility that the presence of a specialty  hospital might be more likely to elicit competitive responses from general  hospitals that are reasonably close by. In constructing our sample of  general hospitals in regional markets with specialty hospitals, we excluded  urban general hospitals that were 90 miles or more from the nearest  specialty hospital and rural general hospitals that were 120 miles or more  from the nearest specialty hospital. We further explored this possibility by  analyzing the responses of a subset of urban general hospitals\u2014those that  were in the same local market as a specialty hospital. Urban general  hospitals in this local subset may be more likely than other general  hospitals in the same regions to be affected by the presence of a specialty  hospital and thus may be more likely to have implemented operational or  clinical service changes in response. Therefore, we compared the  responses from this subset with the responses from urban hospitals in  regions without specialty hospitals.", "We selected specific regional markets for our hospital comparison groups  by identifying areas that were similar to one another on several different  dimensions, including, for example, the number of Medicare beneficiaries  in each regional market. All of the regional markets were located in states  that did not have laws requiring hospitals to obtain state approval before  adding inpatient beds or building new inpatient facilities.", "We surveyed 603 general hospitals during August and September of 2005,  and received responses from 401 facilities (67 percent response rate). (See  app. I for more detail regarding our scope and methodology.) We took  several steps to ensure that the data used to produce this report were  sufficiently reliable. For example, we checked each survey response for  internal consistency and contacted hospitals to clarify their responses  when necessary. We ensured the reliability of the hospital and market- related data sets used in this report by verifying that they were widely  used for similar research purposes and by performing appropriate  electronic data checks.

In contrast, there were an estimated 4,800 general  hospitals, 4,100 Medicare certified ASCs, and 2,400 imaging centers. (See  fig. 1.) Another methodology for assessing the relative magnitude of  specialty hospitals is through Medicare inpatient spending. In prior work  pertaining to specialty hospitals of various types and ownership  structures, we found that specialty hospitals accounted for a low share of  Medicare spending for inpatient services relative even to their low share of  the hospital market.

In 2003, using a broader definition of  specialty hospitals that included facilities with and without physician  owners or investors, we reported that specialty hospitals tended to treat  less-severely-ill patients, served proportionately fewer Medicaid patients,  and were less likely to have emergency rooms. We also reported that  physicians were owners or investors in the majority of specialty hospitals  we identified. These findings were consistent with critics\u2019 concerns that  specialty hospitals tend to concentrate on the most profitable procedures  and serve patients with the fewest complications. According to such  critics, specialty hospitals draw financial resources away from general  hospitals and leave those hospitals with the responsibility of caring for the  sickest patients and fulfilling their broad missions to provide charity care,  emergency services, and standby capacity to respond to communitywide  disasters.

The  information contained in MedPAC\u2019s report was gathered through site visits  and interviews with representatives of specialty and general hospitals in  selected markets where specialty hospitals existed and interviews with  others in the health care community. Collectively, the reports identified  several actions general hospitals took in response to the entry, or the  anticipation of entry, of specialty hospitals into the marketplace,  including: improving operating room scheduling, extending service hours,  building a single-specialty wing to discourage the establishment of  competing facilities, partnering with physicians on their medical staff to  open a specialty hospital, signing exclusive contracts with private payers  to preclude specialty hospitals or the physicians who invest in them from  contracting with those payers, and revoking the admitting privileges of  physicians involved with a competing specialty hospital."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Presence of Specialty Hospitals Had Little Effect on the Number or Type of Operational and Clinical Service Changes Reported by General Hospitals", "paragraphs": ["Nearly all general hospitals responding to our survey reported making  operational and clinical service changes to remain competitive in markets  they viewed as increasingly competitive; however, there was little  evidence to suggest that the absence or presence of specialty hospitals had  much of an effect on the number or types of changes general hospitals  reported implementing between 2000 and 2005.

These CMS and DAP  files are widely used for similar research purposes.", "We identified two potential limitations of our analysis. First, because  independent information to verify survey responses was not available, all  analyses in this report are based on data that are self-reported and  potentially limited by the respondent\u2019s ability to report the operational or  clinical service changes implemented from 2000 through 2005 for  competitive reasons. Second, in response to the threat of future  competition, it is possible that general hospitals made changes to their  facilities prior to 2000 or that changes made by some general hospitals in  anticipation of the new specialty hospitals successfully deterred the entry  of that hospital, which our survey did not capture."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Survey Questionnaire", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Survey Response by Category", "paragraphs": ["Our survey listed 72 potential operational changes and 34 potential clinical  service changes that a respondent hospital could have indicated that they  had implemented from 2000 through 2005. Within the survey, the potential  operational changes were organized into nine separate subject-oriented  categories. For each of the clinical service changes, respondents were  asked to indicate whether they had added, expanded, eliminated, or  decreased the service. For analytical purposes, we grouped together  \u201cadded\u201d and \u201cexpanded\u201d clinical service change responses.

When stratified by urban and rural location there were few  differences between general hospitals in markets with and without  specialty hospitals, in terms of the average number of changes they  reported implementing in each category of operational and clinical service  change from 2000 through 2005.
