While deemed critical, especially in making citizenship decisions, A-files are sometimes missing during adjudications. In 2002, naturalization was granted to an alien whose A-file was missing and who was later found to be associated with a terrorist organization. GAO focused its review on (1) how often USCIS adjudicates naturalization applications without an A-file and why, (2) the effect that missing A-files can have on the adjudication process, and (3) steps taken to help mitigate the risk of missing A-files. To address these questions, GAO interviewed officials and staff from USCIS and reviewed relevant data, policies, and procedures related to processing naturalization applications and the automated file-tracking system DHS established to track the movement of A-files."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["A-files were not available to adjudicate naturalization applications in a small percentage of cases. GAO found that of the naturalization applications adjudicated in 2005, about 30,000--or about 4 percent of them--may have been adjudicated without A-files. However, this number may be less because USCIS staff are not required to record whether an A-file was available. USCIS officials said that a major reason A-files were not available for naturalization application adjudications is that staff are not using the automated file-tracking system. USCIS officials suggested that staff might not be using the automated file-tracking system for lack of sufficient training on how to use the system, while local management may not be adequately emphasizing the importance of complying with A-file tracking policies and procedures. Missing A-files can have an impact on the process of adjudicating naturalization applications in several ways. For example, when an A-file is not available at the location indicated in the automated file-tracking system, additional time is spent trying to locate the file, which slows the adjudication process and applicants may wait longer for USCIS to process their application. In addition, missing A-files can hinder USCIS's ability to uncover immigration benefit fraud and limit DHS' ability to take enforcement actions. USCIS has steps in place to help mitigate the risk of adjudicating a naturalization application without an A-file. These steps include verifying the applicant's lawful admission to the United States and conducting extra supervisory reviews to ensure that naturalization processing procedures have been followed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), within  the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is responsible for processing  noncitizens\u2019 applications (sometimes commonly referred to as benefit  applications) to live and in some cases work in the United States either  permanently or on a temporary basis or to become a United States citizen.  For certain noncitizens, such as immigrants, USCIS creates an alien file,  called an A-file, to serve as the one central file for all of the noncitizen\u2019s  immigration-related applications and related documents. USCIS manages  over 55 million A-files. Not only do USCIS staff rely on an alien\u2019s historical  A-file to determine eligibility for immigration benefits, but other DHS  components, such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), use   A-files during criminal investigations and to determine, for example,  whether an alien should be removed from or allowed to stay in the United  States. Information and documents from A-files may also be shared with  other law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI), to investigate individuals suspected of being involved  in terrorist activities. Consequently, it is critical that A-files be available  when needed. Because A-files are paper-based, they require physical  transfer from one location to another. USCIS has developed an automated  file-tracking system, called the National File Tracking System (NFTS), to  enable all DHS staff at numerous DHS locations around the country to  locate, request, receive, and transfer A-files. NFTS users are to access  USCIS\u2019s NFTS intranet site via their personal computers to locate and  request an A-file and update NFTS when they receive an A-file or transfer  an A-file to another person or office.", "Naturalization is the process whereby a noncitizen becomes a United  States citizen. An application for naturalization is both the last step in the  immigration process and the last opportunity for USCIS, through its  benefit-granting review procedures, to prevent ineligible noncitizens from  becoming citizens and hence remaining in the United States. In 2002,  USCIS\u2019s predecessor, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, granted  naturalization to a noncitizen who was later identified to be associated  with a terrorist organization. In this case, the adjudicator had not obtained  the A-file in adjudicating the application for naturalization and deciding to  grant the benefit. Indeed, background checks conducted as part of  USCIS\u2019s naturalization process continue to reveal instances where  individuals who pose a potential risk to national security have applied for  naturalization. Because naturalization is the final benefit that USCIS can  bestow upon a noncitizen, it is critical that USCIS staff have access to the  full and complete history of an applicant\u2014which is contained only in the  A-file\u2014before making a final eligibility decision.", "Because of the importance of the naturalization decision, we focused our  review on the availability of A-files in adjudicating naturalization  applications. For this report we examined (1) the extent to which USCIS  records how often naturalization applications are adjudicated without an  A-file, as well as the reasons why an A-file might be missing; (2) the effect  that missing A-files can have on the adjudication of naturalization  applications; and (3) what steps USCIS takes to help mitigate the risk of  adjudicating naturalization applications without an A-file.", "To address these objectives, we sent e-mail questionnaires and followed  up with phone calls to officials and staff from 13 USCIS district offices and  reviewed relevant documents, policies, and procedures on processing  naturalization applications. We also obtained written responses from  another district for a total of 14 district offices. We selected these offices  because they adjudicated most of the naturalization applications.  Specifically, USCIS data indicate that these 14 offices adjudicated nearly  two-thirds of the approximately 715,000 naturalization applications  adjudicated in fiscal year 2005. To examine the extent to which USCIS  records how often naturalization applications are adjudicated without an  A-file and why A-files might be missing, we obtained summary data from a  USCIS database containing information on whether an A-file was available  when adjudicating a naturalization application. We also obtained summary  data from NFTS on A-files indicated as lost and, as having been in transit  and yet to be recorded as received.  We also interviewed officials from  USCIS headquarters and obtained instructions and guidance about using,  locating, and requesting A-files. To determine the effect that missing   A-files can have on the adjudication process, we interviewed USCIS  district office officials and staff. To determine if USCIS has instituted  additional procedures to help mitigate the risk of adjudicating a  naturalization application without an A-file, we reviewed policies and  procedures related to processing these applications, interviewed USCIS  officials, and reviewed relevant documents. In a prior review we  determined how USCIS ensures the quality and consistency of adjudicator  decisions by examining USCIS\u2019s two quality assurance programs and  resulting outcomes, and reviewed the findings and recommendations of an  independent study of USCIS\u2019s quality assurance programs. To assess the  reliability of USCIS\u2019s system for managing naturalization applications and  NFTS data we (1) reviewed summary data and specific data elements for  obvious errors in accuracy and completeness, (2) reviewed related  documentation, and (3) interviewed USCIS staff knowledgeable about  USCIS\u2019s system for managing naturalization applications and NFTS. We  found the data from its system for managing naturalization applications  and its quality assurance database were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. Regarding NFTS, we found that the summary data we used were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. We conducted our  review from August 2005 through August 2006 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. Appendix I presents  more details on our scope and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Millions of noncitizens apply annually to enter the United States to live,  work, or study. USCIS creates alien files, more commonly called A-files,   to document the history of a person\u2019s interaction with USCIS or any DHS  entity involved in immigration related actions. USCIS\u2019s Records Operation  Handbook (ROH) provides instruction on when and how to create an   A-file as well as how to request files and transfer them from one office to  another. USCIS maintains A-files on certain individuals, including those  who    are immigrants or who apply for immigrant status,   have become citizens, or   have applied for asylum in the United States or refugee status overseas.", "The A-file is to contain all of the relevant documents of an alien\u2019s  interactions with USCIS or other DHS components. For example, the A-file  could contain an application for lawful permanent residency and petitions  for an alien relative as well as documents related to enforcement actions  such as an arrest warrant and the results of any immigration proceedings.  While USCIS is the main user of A-files and the official DHS custodian for  all of them, other DHS components, such as ICE and Customs and Border  Protection (CBP), also use A-files for investigations or other enforcement  actions. In addition, information and documents from A-files may be  shared with agencies such as the FBI and Department of State. According  to senior USCIS officials, USCIS spends about $13 million each year  transporting A-files within USCIS and to other components and agencies.  USCIS\u2019s long-range plans call for eventually converting paper A-files into  electronic files, thus avoiding these transportation costs and making   A-files available to multiple users simultaneously. In August 2006, USCIS  awarded a 5-year $150 million contract to begin converting A-files.", "USCIS adjudicates applications for immigration benefits through a  network of field offices that include 4 service centers, 33 district offices,  and 8 asylum offices. In fiscal year 2005, USCIS\u2019s budget was about   $1.8 billion and USCIS adjudicated about 7.5 million applications, of which  over 715,000 were applications for naturalization. Naturalization  applications are adjudicated at USCIS district offices and require the  applicant to, among other things, undergo a security background check, be  interviewed by an adjudicator and, demonstrate proficiency in English and  a basic understanding of U.S. civics. As part of the adjudications process,  adjudicators are to review the applicant\u2019s A-file to identify any information  that may disqualify the applicant for naturalization, including information  that may indicate potential fraud. Of the over 715,000 naturalization  applications adjudicated in fiscal year 2005, USCIS denied about 64,000.", "All applications for an immigration benefit, including naturalization, are to  be filed in the applicant\u2019s A-file. USCIS staff use USCIS\u2019s Central Index  System to locate and request the A-file from the last known office location.  However, the Central Index System can only identify the office location  for the A-file; it does not provide precise information about where in an  office an A-file is located. USCIS has NFTS, a system designed to provide  more detailed information on the location of an A-file, down to a specific  individual or file drawer. USCIS\u2019s predecessor, the Immigration and  Naturalization Service, began deploying NFTS in November 2002. The  system is now deployed to all records units in USCIS district and asylum  offices, the USCIS\u2019s Texas Service Center and National Benefits Center,  and all ICE and CBP units. Tentative plans call for deploying NFTS to  USCIS\u2019s three other service centers by March 2007. NFTS is a Web-based  system that is available to anyone in DHS who needs A-files. Users can  obtain a user identification code that allows them to request, receive, and  transfer A-files. Web-based training on how to use NFTS is available via  DHS component intranet sites, including USCIS\u2019s EdVanatage Learning  University, ICE\u2019s Virtual University, and the CBP Learning University. In  January 2004, USCIS, ICE, and CBP signed a Service Level Agreement in  which USCIS agreed to provide A-files to ICE and CBP, and ICE and CBP  agreed to follow the ROH.", "USCIS\u2019s ROH describes the procedures that are to be followed for  locating, sending, and receiving A-files. The ROH states that all DHS staff  with access to NFTS should use NFTS to, for example,  record the creation of an A-file,  request A-files from other offices,  record when an A-file is sent or transferred out to another office,  and   immediately record both when an A-file is received and the file\u2019s  specific location.", "USCIS uses the Computer-Linked Application Information Management  System (CLAIMS) 4, as the case management and tracking system for  naturalization applications.

To improve the  quality and consistency of all naturalization application processing, USCIS  has issued Naturalization Quality Procedures (NQP) guidelines. The NQP  provides detailed checklists that clerical staff and adjudicators must  complete at each stage of the naturalization process. These completed  checklists must be included in an A-file, along with the naturalization  application and related documents.

The CLAIMS 4 database contains a data field that  indicates the status of the A-file request, such as whether the file has been  received in the district office, requested but not yet received, or that the   A-file has been declared lost. According to data from the CLAIMS 4  database, of the approximately 715,000 naturalization applications  adjudicated in fiscal year 2005, the district office received the A-file in  685,000 of these cases (about 96 percent), indicating that A-files may not  have been available in about 4 percent (about 30,000) of them. However,  USCIS officials told us that this CLAIMS 4 data field is an optional field  that USCIS staff may complete at various times during the adjudications  process or not at all. USCIS officials told us that of the approximately  30,000 naturalization cases where the A-file status indicated something  other than received in the district office, A-files were probably available in  a number of them. However, because adjudicators may not always update  the A-file data field to indicate whether the A-file was eventually received,  how many is unknown. In about 13,000 of the approximately 30,000 cases,  the A-file status indicator was blank.", "Data from USCIS\u2019s quality assurance audit of the naturalization program  also indicate that the A-files are missing in a relatively small percentage of  cases. In fiscal year 2005, the USCIS Performance Management Division  sampled 28,575 naturalization applications adjudicated by district offices.  Staff found that A-files were available in all but 129 of 28,575 cases  sampled, about 0.5 percent. However, because of limitations in its  sampling methodology, USCIS said this percentage cannot be projected to  the universe of approximately 715,000 naturalization applications  completed that year. Although USCIS officials from the 13 district offices  we spoke with acknowledged that their offices do not track how often  naturalization applications are adjudicated without an A-file, they believed  the percentage was low. They estimated the percentage of naturalization  applications in fiscal year 2005 that were adjudicated without A-files  ranged from less than 1 percent to 10 percent.", "GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states  that information needed to achieve an agency\u2019s objectives should be  identified and regularly reported to management. According to USCIS\u2019s  Naturalization Quality Procedures, having and reviewing an applicant\u2019s   A-file is critical to confirming that the applicant is eligible for  naturalization and that no incidents have taken place that would disqualify  the applicant from naturalization. In a November 2005 memo, the Acting  USCIS Director of Domestic Operations stated that not having an A-file  should be a \u201crare\u201d occurrence, but did not quantify what \u201crare\u201d meant.  Since USCIS deems reviewing the A-file critical to the naturalization  adjudications process, the lack of precise data on when an A-file is not  available limits USCIS\u2019s ability to determine compliance with this critical  step and whether additional actions are necessary to ensure A-files are  available when needed.", "According to USCIS officials, adjudicators sometimes have difficulty  locating A-files or cannot find them at all because the locations shown in  NFTS are incorrect or not up to date. For example, according to a  summary of the results of an April 2005 file audit conducted by USCIS\u2019s  San Diego district office records staff, nearly 21 percent of the district\u2019s  files (11,731 of 56,092 files audited) were not in the location shown in  NFTS. Another 34,764 files shown to be under the control of the San Diego  district could not be immediately located during the audit. Some of these  files may have been in locked file cabinets that audit staff could not  access, while others may have been transferred to another location and  were no longer in the district. NFTS showed duplicate file locations for  464 files. Audit staff also found 281 of the files that NFTS indicated were  lost. About half of the lost files were found within the local ICE Office of  Investigations. The other half were found mostly within CBP. In addition,  in June 2006 the Los Angeles district office conducted a file audit of three  locations that had files. As shown in table 1, about 6 percent of the files  indicated by NFTS to be at these three locations could not be found.", "For some A-files, the office location recorded in NFTS is not up to date.  NFTS procedures require that a person receiving an A-file should  \u201cimmediately\u201d update NFTS. According to the Section Chief of the Records  Systems Services Section of USCIS\u2019s Office of Records Management  Branch, once a file is sent (either via the U.S. Postal Service or a private  package delivery service) from one office to another, it should take no  longer than a month for the A-file to arrive at the receiving office and for  NFTS to be updated. During our review, USCIS checked NFTS and found  107,000 A-files that have been in transit over a month but had yet to be  recorded as received in NFTS. Nearly 63,000 had been in transit more than  3 months.", "GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government also  states that transactions and other significant events should be promptly  recorded so that they maintain their relevance, value, and usefulness to  management in controlling operations and making decisions. Although  USCIS considers compliance with NFTS procedures critical to enabling it  to maintain control over A-files, DHS staff are not always complying with  these procedures.", "According to USCIS officials, DHS staff are not always recording the  movement of an A-file in NFTS, resulting in inaccurate information on the  location of A-files. Officials from 10 of the 13 USCIS district offices we  spoke with claim that the failure to record the movement of files in NFTS  is a major reason for delays in locating an A-file, in not being able to locate  an A-file at all, and in an A-file being declared lost. One district director  stated that the cooperation of other DHS components in adhering to file  transfer procedures was imperative, especially since they maintained   A-files relating to national security investigations and other sensitive  issues. According to USCIS records officials, the USCIS Records Division  has not conducted a formal study or evaluation as to why NFTS users are  not complying with all NFTS and ROH procedures. This cooperation is  important, especially because USCIS has no authority to enforce  compliance with file-tracking procedures among the other DHS  components. The report summarizing the San Diego district\u2019s April 2005  file audit cited above stated that the number of files, in the thousands, that  were not in the location shown in NFTS or could not be found was  \u201cstaggering\u201d and attested to the need to ensure that all personnel in all  units and agencies use NFTS and follow procedures. According to the  report, several locations were not using NFTS although NFTS was  available. USCIS records officials stated that lack of compliance with  NFTS procedures was \u201cvery prevalent.\u201d As of July 27, 2006, for the   14 district offices we included in our review, NFTS indicated that about  111,000 A-files were lost.", "USCIS officials offered several reasons why some staff may not be  complying with NFTS file-tracking procedures. According to the report  summarizing the San Diego district\u2019s April 2005 file audit, additional NFTS  training is needed and compliance with the NFTS procedures should be  mandated for all sites. The audit report recommended regular NFTS  workshops for USCIS, CBP, and ICE staff. USCIS records officials stated  that local management may not be emphasizing enough the importance of  using NFTS. ICE officials we spoke to commented that they believe some  of the NFTS file transfer procedures are cumbersome, resulting in some  ICE staff circumventing them and not recording the file movement in  NFTS. For example, whether sending or receiving A-files, the ROH  requires that they all be routed through the local USCIS records unit  whenever a file needs to be transferred from one ICE field location to  another. This is because members of USCIS staff are the only ones allowed  to transfer a file from one field location to another. However, according to  ICE officials, because of the urgency of the situation, ICE personnel may  send an A-file directly from one ICE office to another, bypassing the  USCIS records units. As a result, the file movement to the new location is  not recorded in NFTS. USCIS records officials stated that they do not  believe lack of compliance stems from any technical problems with using  NFTS because the system is Web-based and relatively easy to use."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Missing A-files Can Affect the Naturalization Adjudication Process in Several Ways", "paragraphs": ["Missing A-files can cause delays in awarding immigration benefits, hinder  USCIS\u2019s ability to uncover immigration fraud, and limit DHS\u2019s ability to  take enforcement actions. According to USCIS\u2019s ROH, lost or missing   A-files can cause delays or errors in awarding immigration benefits and  can hamper investigation and enforcement actions. For example, USCIS  procedures for processing naturalization applications allow USCIS to wait  up to 3 months to try to find an A-file, thereby delaying adjudicating the  application. According to several USCIS district officials, USCIS staff  spend additional time and effort trying to locate files that are not in the  location identified in NFTS, thus delaying their ability to process benefits  quickly. Officials from all of the district offices we spoke with told us that  USCIS faces an increased risk of granting naturalization to an ineligible  applicant when the adjudicator does not have the A-file available because  the file may contain potentially disqualifying information. Officials from  several district offices stated that the A-file is needed to look for any  inconsistencies between the naturalization application and other  applications that the applicant had submitted when applying for previous  benefits like legal permanent residency. For example, a naturalization  application may contain facts about the applicant\u2019s marital or family  (children) status that are inconsistent with information in the A-file, a  possible indication of fraud that may not be uncovered without the A-file.  These types of inconsistencies cannot be checked without the A-file. In  addition, USCIS conducts background security checks on all naturalization  applicants via the Interagency Border Inspection System (IBIS). IBIS  guidance requires an IBIS name check on all names an applicant may have  used. According to several district officials, the A-file may contain other  names (aliases) the applicant may have used that should be checked  against IBIS. Therefore, without the A-file, any potentially damaging  information related to these other names may not be uncovered,  increasing the risk of granting naturalization to an ineligible applicant.  DHS\u2019s ability to take an enforcement action against an applicant may also  be compromised. According to an ICE attorney, some immigration judges  may be reluctant to, for example, order an alien removed from the United  States without the complete A-file."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Naturalization Quality Procedures Help to Mitigate the Risk of Adjudicating a Naturalization Application without an A-file", "paragraphs": ["Officials we spoke with stated that the steps contained in the  Naturalization Quality Procedures mitigate somewhat the risk of  naturalizing someone who is ineligible.

We obtained written responses to our questionnaire from another  district office (Boston). We selected these offices because they  adjudicated most of the naturalization applications. Specifically, USCIS  data indicate that these 14 offices adjudicated nearly two-thirds, or about  497,000, of the approximately 715,000 naturalization applications  adjudicated in fiscal year 2005. In addition, to examine the extent to which  USCIS records how often naturalization applications are adjudicated  without an A-file, as well as the reasons why an A-file might be missing  and what steps USCIS takes to compensate for any lack of an A-file during  an adjudication process we obtained data related to    naturalization applications adjudicated in fiscal year 2005 contained in  the Computer-Linked Application Information Management System  (CLAIMS) 4 database that records information from the naturalization  application and related information,  the results from USCIS quality assurance audits of a sample of  naturalization applications reviewed in fiscal year 2005, and    A-files indicated as lost and, as having been in transit and yet to be  recorded as received in USCIS\u2019s National File Tracking System (NFTS).", "We also reviewed policies and procedures related to processing  naturalization applications and instructions and guidance about using,  locating, and requesting A-files. In a prior review, we determined how  USCIS ensures the quality and consistency of adjudicator decisions by  reviewing USCIS reports and data on accuracy rates related to its two  quality assurance programs, interviewing USCIS officials in the  Performance Management Division, reviewing the findings and  recommendations of an independent study on USCIS\u2019s quality assurance  programs and, discussing supervisory review practices with senior  managers at the field offices we visited. However, we did not  independently verify the extent and quality of supervisory review.", "We assessed the reliability of CLAIMS 4 and NFTS data by (1) reviewing  summary data and specific data elements for obvious errors in accuracy  and completeness, (2) reviewing related documentation, and   (3) interviewing USCIS staff knowledgeable about the CLAIMS 4 and  NFTS systems. For NFTS, we also observed how A-files are located,  transferred, and received. However, we did not independently evaluate  whether technical malfunctions may be a factor in the number of files with  improperly identified locations, although we have no reason to believe that  technical malfunctions have occurred. We found that information and  summaries of the NFTS, CLAIMS 4, and quality assurance data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. We conducted our  review from August 2005 through August 2006 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the above, Michael Dino, Assistant Director;   Richard Ascarate; Jenny Chanley; Frances Cook; Carlos Garcia;   Julian King; and Brian Lipman were key contributors to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
