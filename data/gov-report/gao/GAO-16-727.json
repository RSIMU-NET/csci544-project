The United States covers 85 central government entities under the revised GPA, but only 53 entities under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Similarly, the United States covers 37 states under its GPA commitments and from no states to 30 in the FTAs GAO reviewed. While all the top five GPA parties GAO reviewed cover some subcentral government entities, Canada, Mexico, and South Korea do not have a subcentral government entity coverage schedule in their FTA commitments.

Each agreement contains lists of circumstances under which  government entities may use limited tendering, with similarities across the  agreements. For instance, if the covered procurement is for products that  are purchased on a commodity market, or if a government entity has not  received any tenders that conform to the essential requirements on a  notice of intended procurement, a government entity may opt to use  limited tendering procedures.

First, a government  entity proposes a procurement. Under the selected agreements, unless  other procedures apply, for covered procurements, entities must publish a  notice. In general, these notices are required to include information such  as a description of the procurement and a final date for receiving tenders.  These notices often include technical specifications describing exactly  what the government entity anticipates procuring. The agreements  prohibit the parties from adopting or applying technical specifications that  would create unnecessary obstacles to trade. For example, the  agreements generally prohibit technical specifications that require  particular trademarks or country-specific details. The revised GPA, the  Colombia-FTA, the South Korea-FTA and the Australia-FTA add that  these rules for technical specifications are not intended to prevent parties  from adopting technical specifications for the conservation of natural  resources or the promotion of the environment.", "If a supplier believes it can meet all of the listed requirements and provide  the desired goods or services, it may submit a tender. The agreements  vary in the amount of time the parties must allow suppliers to submit  tenders once the notice has been released.

Subject  to exceptions, the 1994 GPA, NAFTA, the revised GPA, the South Korea- FTA, and the Colombia-FTA require parties to establish a final  submission date for tenders in an open procurement of no less than 40  days from the publication of the notice, and the Australia-FTA requires at  least 30 days. One such example of an exception is in the revised GPA,  which specifies that if parties incorporate electronic means into the  procurement process, they may reduce the deadline by 5 days for each of  the three electronic means prescribed. As a result, parties to the revised  GPA are capable of reducing this deadline to 25 days.

According to USTR officials, they must obtain state  government authorization to cover procurement in a trade agreement on  a state-by-state basis, and each state independently determines whether  to have its procurement covered under a trade agreement. Officials noted  that despite the flexibilities that states have in determining the scope of  procurement covered, such as being able to limit coverage to  procurement by specified agencies and to exclude purchases of sensitive  goods or services, U.S. state participation has not increased over time.", "Other countries give U.S. suppliers access to their subcentral government  procurement as well. Among the top five GPA parties, there has been an  expansion in the number of subcentral government entities covered by  the agreement over time between the 1994 and the revised GPA. Canada  added a territory to its subcentral government entity coverage schedule in  the revised GPA and excluded procurement by the entities listed in the  subcentral coverage schedule from Iceland and the Principality of  Liechtenstein. Japan added 7 designated cities; it covers all 47  prefectures and 19 designated cities. South Korea increased the number  of subcentral government entities covered by adding to its coverage  schedule the Ulsan Metropolitan City, and the local government entities in  three metropolitan cities: Seoul (25 local governments), Busan (16 local  governments), and Incheon (10 local governments). As stated previously,  of the FTAs we reviewed, only the Australia-FTA and the Colombia-FTA  include subcentral government entities\u2019 coverage schedules.

Each party\u2019s coverage is the result of a variety  of factors, including the structure and organization of its government and  its market access negotiations with other parties.", "Under the GPA, some parties define their coverage of other government  entities by listing specific entities that will be covered in the annex. Of the  five GPA countries we reviewed, the United States, Canada, Japan, and  South Korea follow this model. The U.S.\u2019 coverage includes electric  utilities and ports/port authorities in the agreements we reviewed.  Canada\u2019s coverage includes federal Crown corporations, such as some  museums and a railway corporation; Japan\u2019s coverage includes banks,  centers, corporations, councils, foundations, funds, institutions, and  museums; and South Korea\u2019s coverage includes entities such as the  Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency, the Korea Rail Network  Authority, and the Korea Tourism Organization, in addition to a number of  banks and corporations. On the other hand, the EU and Norway define  their commitments with respect to other government entities by listing  activities in specific sectors undertaken by certain classifications of  entities rather than by naming specific entities. These sectors include  drinking water, electricity, airports, and maritime or inland ports. Under  the Australia-FTA and the Colombia-FTA, coverage is limited to only  those other government entities listed. Similar to GPA trading partners,  these FTA partners also include a variety of entities, such as industry,  agencies, and commissions.

Officials noted that  all parties have certain procurements that they deem sensitive and do not  want to open to foreign suppliers, for example for social, policy, or  national security reasons. Officials also stated that because market  access commitments are negotiated on a reciprocal basis, some parties  also exclude some types of procurement only from another party, for  example when they believe they are not receiving enough market access  of that particular type. According to the WTO, reciprocity is the foundation  of coverage commitments generally. In terms of U.S. and trading  partners\u2019 exclusions, we found commonalities across the agreements we  reviewed.", "Provisions describing the exclusion of specified goods, services, and  construction services can be found in the general notes sections in the  agreements and often in a specific annex to the agreements, at an entity  level. In particular, exclusions of specified services are generally identified  on a positive or negative list. According to a former trade agreement  negotiator, most parties use a positive list; that is, only the services listed  are covered by the agreement. Under the GPA, Canada, the EU, Japan,  Norway, and South Korea use a positive list. The United States uses a  negative list approach \u2014 unless listed, any procurement by a covered  entity of a service meeting the procurement threshold is covered by the  agreement. According to Commerce officials, a negative list approach  provides more liberal coverage than a positive list approach because it is  not an exhaustive list and allows for coverage of new services.", "The United States specifies exclusions in the six agreements we  reviewed, and these exclusions apply to the procurements of all entities  covered by the agreement, except as specified otherwise. The exclusions  include \u201cset-asides\u201d for small or minority businesses. For example, U.S.  laws promoting the economic development of small businesses, as  defined by the U.S. Small Business Administration, reserve certain  contracts for these types of firms, according to a former trade agreement  negotiator. Similar to the United States, Canada also excludes set-asides  for small and minority businesses. Commerce officials noted that the  Australia-FTA, the Colombia-FTA, and the South Korea-FTA all exclude  purchases for the direct purpose of providing international assistance  from the scope of the government procurement commitments.", "Parties also define specific exclusions of goods, services, and  construction services at the entity level. U.S. exclusions of procurements  by central government entities are generally similar across the six  agreements we reviewed. (See table 3.)", "Trading partners also set exclusions at the central entity level. For  example, Colombia\u2019s exclusions include the procurement of agricultural  raw materials or inputs related to agricultural support programs and food  assistance by the Ministero de Agricultura y Desarrollo Rural; Australia\u2019s  exclusions include procurement of ship and marine equipment by the  Department of Defence and the Defence Materiel Organisation; and  South Korea\u2019s exclusions include certain procurements of agricultural,  fishery, and livestock products by covered central government entities.  The EU coverage schedule also contains specific exclusions regarding  the United States under the GPA. According to a former trade  agreement negotiator, under the GPA, the EU withholds about 200  central government entities of member states from the United States and  not from other countries because, as noted previously, the United States  does not cover all federal agencies and does not cover legislative or  judicial entities.", "At the subcentral level, U.S. states covered in the GPA, the Australia- FTA, and the Colombia-FTA include exclusions to their procurement. As  noted previously, the other FTA agreements do not cover U.S. states\u2019  procurement. First, these agreements include four exclusions that apply  to all state entities outlined in the coverage schedules. Provisions in the  agreements do not apply to preferences or restrictions associated with programs promoting the  development of distressed areas or businesses owned by minorities,  disabled veterans, and women; any procurement by a covered state entity on behalf of a noncovered  entity at a different level of government;  restrictions attached to federal funds for mass transit and highway  transit projects that are undertaken with federal funds; and procurement of services excluded by the United States, as well as  printing services.", "In addition, under the subcentral level procurement covered under the  GPA, the Australia-FTA, and the Colombia-FTA, a number of U.S. states  have state-specific exclusions related to certain types of procurement,  some of which are the same across these three agreements. (See table  4.)", "In addition, in procurements by the Texas Building and Procurement  Commission, Texas excludes preferences for motor vehicles, travel  agencies located in the state, and rubberized asphalt paving made from  scrap tire by a Texas facility in the Colombia-FTA and the Australia-FTA  but not the GPA. Georgia excludes the procurement of beef, compost,  and mulch by the Department of Administrative Services and the Georgia  Technology Authority in the Australia-FTA.", "Of the FTAs we reviewed, only the Australia-FTA and the Colombia-FTA  have subcentral government entity coverage schedules. In the Australia- FTA, at the subcentral government entity level, exclusions include health  and welfare services, education services, and motor vehicles for  procurement by certain entities. Colombia\u2019s exclusions include food,  agricultural raw materials/inputs, and live animals related to agricultural  support programs and food assistance.

Officials  also noted that conversely, foreign suppliers do not benefit from the  agreements\u2019 coverage with regard to relatively smaller procurements. For  the GPA, threshold values are expressed as special drawing rights (SDR)  in coverage schedules delineating covered entities.", "We found that among the top five WTO GPA procurement markets (the  EU, Japan, Canada, South Korea, and Norway) we reviewed, parties set  the same threshold levels as at least one other party, with a few  exceptions. (See table 5.) In the revised GPA, among the central  government entities\u2019 coverage schedules we reviewed, the threshold level  for goods and services is 130,000 SDRs (approximately $182,000), and  for construction services it is 5 million SDRs (approximately $7 million) for  all parties except for Japan. For subcentral government entities\u2019  coverage schedules, four parties set the threshold level for goods and  services at 200,000 SDRs (approximately $279,000), and two parties  set the threshold level at 355,000 SDRs (approximately $496,000). For  the procurement of construction services by subcentral government  entities, most of the parties set the threshold level at 5 million SDRs  (approximately $7 million). For other entities\u2019 coverage schedule, most  of the parties set the threshold level for goods and services at 400,000  SDRs (approximately $559,000) and for construction services at 5  million SDRs (approximately $7 million). For the United States, for  example, the 2016-17 threshold value is set at $191,000 for procurement  of goods and services and $7.4 million for procurement of construction  services for covered central government entities in the revised GPA.", "We also found that for the most part, threshold levels for these countries  did not change between the 1994 GPA and the revised GPA. For  example, only Japan lowered its threshold level for the procurement of  goods and certain services by central government entities; changing the  threshold level from 130,000 SDRs (approximately $182,000) to 100,000  SDRs (approximately $140,000).

We  focused on the five largest procurement markets of parties to the World  Trade Organization\u2019s (WTO) Agreement on Government Procurement  (GPA) and the five largest procurement markets among active U.S. free  trade agreement (FTA) partners since 1994. This scope encompasses  six agreements: the 1994 GPA, the revised GPA, and four U.S. FTAs (the  North American Free Trade Agreement , the South Korea-FTA,  the Colombia-FTA, and the Australia-FTA). We reviewed agreements that  entered into force from 1994 on, beginning with NAFTA. We included the  GPAs in our scope because they are multilateral international  procurement agreements that cover the most parties and the largest  markets. In addition, the FTAs we reviewed correspond to the five largest  procurement markets among active U.S. FTAs in our scope. We reviewed  4 out of the 14 active U.S. FTAs. As we reviewed the commitments of the  five largest procurement markets covered by the GPA and the five largest  procurement markets among active U.S. FTA trade partners since 1994,  our findings may not be applicable to all the U.S.\u2019s FTA agreements.", "The WTO\u2019s GPA and the government procurement chapters of FTAs are  very long, complex documents, making direct textual comparisons  challenging without an analytical framework. To compare the text, we  created a framework to isolate sections of the text to make direct  comparison possible and reliable. First, we had four analysts  independently read the text of two of the six agreements to identify  overarching themes; broad categories such as \u201ctransparency\u201d; and  subthemes, specific provisions such as \u201cstatistical reporting\u201d found in  these agreements. The analysts were instructed to reference the WTO  literature, including WTO\u2019s statement of general principles, to help reflect  the negotiating parties\u2019 main priorities as presented by the WTO. When all  four analysts had finished compiling their lists independently, they met  and compared them. The four lists shared broad similarities across  themes and subthemes, and through discussion they were combined into  one draft list. This draft list was shared with officials from the Office of the  United States Trade Representative (USTR) and the Department of  Commerce (Commerce), as well as with a former trade official and  internally with GAO general counsel staff and a methodologist to ensure  consistency. After their feedback was incorporated, the final list contained  nine themes and 31 subthemes. Using this final list as a framework, two  analysts independently read through the text of all six agreements and  sorted pieces of text that corresponded to each subtheme. The pieces of  text could be as short as one sentence or as long as multiple pages and  were sorted according to the content of the text rather than chapter or  section headers. The two analysts independently filled out a spreadsheet,  using separate copies of the agreements for referencing to ensure that  the integrity of the blind review was not compromised. When they had  completed their review, they compared their results and combined them  into a master spreadsheet, resolving differences through discussion. For  the few instances when agreement could not be reached, the other two  analysts who had participated in compiling the draft list of themes were  consulted to make a decision. The master spreadsheet was then  reviewed by GAO general counsel staff. The master spreadsheet served  as a guide and a framework to describe and compare the text and identify  similarities and differences across the agreements. This master  spreadsheet also assisted us in finding the textual examples contained in  the report.", "In addition to reviewing the text of the agreements, we also analyzed and  compared the market access-related commitments (lists of covered  entities and excluded procurements) made in the annexes of these  agreements. We identified similarities and differences in coverage and  exclusions across these agreements. Specifically, we compared the U.S.\u2019  market access commitments in the 1994 GPA to the revised GPA and to  the FTAs in our scope. We also identified market access commitments of  selected U.S. trading partners in these agreements. To verify our findings,  we reviewed WTO and USTR documentation. In addition, we interviewed  USTR and Commerce officials to discuss these similarities and  differences in coverage and exclusions.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2015 to September  2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
