From its inception, the process for selecting Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) claims administration contractors was stipulated by Congress and differed from most other federal contracts in that, among other things, the Medicare contracts were not awarded through a competitive process. The MMA repealed limitations on the types of contractors CMS could use and required that CMS use competitive procedures to select new contracting entities to process medical claims and provide incentives for contractors to provide quality services. CMS has implemented the MMA contracting reform requirements by shifting and consolidating all claims administration tasks to new entities called Medicare Administrative Contractors. CMS is currently in the process of further consolidating these contracts. The agency also uses other contractors to review claims to ensure payments are proper and investigate potential fraud.", "CMS contracts with private organizations to administer benefits under Medicare Advantage (MA), but has an important administrative and oversight role. MA is the private plan alternative to FFS and differs from FFS in that CMS contracts with private entities, known as Medicare Advantage organizations (MAOs), to provide covered health care services to beneficiaries who enroll. MAOs are paid a predetermined monthly amount for each beneficiary enrolled in one of their health plans and must provide coverage for all FFS services (except hospice care), but may also provide additional coverage. The government first began contracting with private plans in 1973. Several laws since then have changed how the MAOs are paid and the types of plans that can participate. While contract requirements for MAOs and parameters of the program are largely derived from statute, CMS has responsibility to implement the program and ensure compliance with these requirements.", "CMS also contracts with private organizations, called plan sponsors, to provide the outpatient prescription drug benefit under Part D. Through the Part D contracts, plan sponsors offer prescription drug plans which may have different beneficiary cost-sharing arrangements (such as copayments and deductibles) and charge different monthly premiums. The Part D program relies on sponsors to generate prescription drug savings through negotiating price concessions with entities such as drug manufacturers, pharmacy benefit managers, and pharmacies, and managing beneficiary use. While CMS contracts with plan sponsors to provide the Part D benefit, the agency has oversight responsibilities. For instance, CMS is responsible for making accurate payments to plan sponsors and ensuring the accuracy of information submitted by plan sponsors to the beneficiary-focused Medicare Plan Finder website. Medicare actuaries have attributed lower-than-projected expenditures in Part D to a combination of factors, including lower-than-projected Part D enrollment, slower growth of drug prices in recent years, greater use of generic drugs, and higher-than-expected rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers to the prescription drug plans."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We are pleased to be here today to discuss the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services\u2019 (CMS) contracting in the agency\u2019s administration of  the Medicare program.

By law, CMS was required to select carriers  from among health insurers or similar companies and to choose fiscal  intermediaries from organizations that were first nominated by  associations representing providers, without the application of competitive  procedures. In addition, CMS could not terminate these contracts unless  the contractors were first provided with an opportunity for a public  hearing, whereas the contractors themselves were permitted to terminate  their contracts, unlike other federal contractors.

From 1965 to 1996, the legacy contractors  were not only responsible for paying claims but also for tasks related to  program integrity, such as working with law enforcement on cases of  suspected fraud. However, the Health Insurance Portability and  Accountability Act of 1996 established the Medicare Integrity Program,  authorizing CMS to award separate contracts for program integrity  activities such as investigating suspected fraud. These contracts are  now handled by Zone Program Integrity Contractors and are generally  aligned with the same jurisdictions as the MACs. In 2003, the MMA  directed CMS to develop a demonstration project testing the use of  contractors to conduct recovery audits in Medicare.known as recovery auditors, conduct data analysis and review claims that  have been paid to identify improper payments. While other contractors  that review claims are given a set amount of funding to conduct reviews,   These contractors,  recovery auditors are paid contingency fees on claims they have  identified as improper.

The payment for each beneficiary was adjusted by demographic and  other factors. The accuracy of this adjustment was criticized by us and  other researchers.

This, in part, encouraged continued  growth in Medicare private plans and by May 1, 1997, 4.6 million  beneficiaries\u2014nearly 12 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries\u2014were  enrolled in private plans under 280 contracts.

These changes to the program included new types of plans  that could be offered, the standards applied to the contracts, beneficiary  enrollment rules, and payment rules. In an effort to refine the payment  methodology, the BBA required CMS to use health status measures to  adjust payments to plans, added a payment methodology establishing a  minimum amount or floor rate, and limited rate updates in higher payment  counties that, with other refinements, resulted in reducing some of the  payment differences between high and low spending areas. Following  these changes, and coincidental with broad-based dissatisfaction with  managed care practices more generally, organizations offering Medicare  private plans reversed what had been a rapid expansion in the mid-1990s  and began a period of plan withdrawals and declining beneficiary  enrollment in plans. For example, from 1999 through 2003, the number of  Medicare contracts with private plans fell from 309 to 154. During the  same period, private plan enrollment fell from about 6.3 million to   4.6 million beneficiaries.
