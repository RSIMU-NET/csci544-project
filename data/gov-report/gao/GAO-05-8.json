Given longstanding concerns about the preparedness of DOD's servicemembers in this critical area, GAO has undertaken a body of work covering NBC protective equipment and training. For this review, GAO was asked to determine the following: (1) To what extent do Army and Marine Corps units and personnel attending combat training centers participate in NBC training, and to what extent do these units and personnel perform NBC tasks at the centers to service standards? (2) Do the Army and the Marine Corps report NBC training at the centers in a standardized format that allows the services to identify lessons learned and to do cross-unit and cross-center comparisons?"]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Army and Marine Corps combat training centers provide a unique opportunity for units to perform advanced training under conditions that approximate actual combat, thereby enabling units to assess and build upon skills learned at home stations. Although DOD and both services have stressed the importance of including NBC defense in all types of training, they have not established minimum NBC-related tasks for units attending the centers. Commanders sometimes reduce NBC training to focus on other priority areas. As a result, the extent of NBC training actually conducted at these centers varies widely, and some units receive little or none at all. For example, officials at two Army training centers estimated that during fiscal years 2002 and 2003, a typical unit training rotation for a brigade-sized unit--which may include up to 4,000 soldiers--experienced NBC events that required only about 5 percent of these troops to train in full NBC protective clothing for a total of 18 hours or more. For the Marine Corps, no NBC training was conducted during combined arms exercises at its training center for at least 5 years prior to January 2004. The Marine Corps began to introduce NBC training into its combined arms exercises in two rotations that occurred in January and February 2004 but suspended it because of other priorities related to preparing units for ongoing operations. Without minimum NBC tasks, the services often miss the opportunity to use the centers' unique environment to improve units' proficiency in NBC defense. When Army units did undergo NBC training, observers noted that many units did not perform basic NBC tasks to Army standards. For example, during fiscal years 2002 and 2003, most brigades attending one center did not meet standards for basic NBC tasks such as donning protective gear, seeking overhead shelter, and conducting unmasking procedures. Observers at the Army centers often cited inadequate home-station training as the reason units were not performing basic NBC tasks to standards. Skills in these basic tasks are normally acquired during training at home stations and lay the foundation for acquiring more complex skills associated with large-unit NBC training. When units arrive at the centers with inadequate basic NBC skills, they may not be able to take full advantage of the unique and more complex large-unit NBC training opportunities offered at these centers. The Army and the Marine Corps do not always report lessons learned on NBC training at the centers in a way that can be used to identify trends over time and allow for cross-unit and cross-center comparisons. Army and Marine Corps doctrine stresses the importance of identifying lessons learned during training to enable tailored training at home stations and elsewhere to reduce the likelihood that similar problems will occur during operations. Because service guidance does not require standardized reporting formats, the training centers submit different types of after-action reports that might or might not mention NBC training. This lack of standardized reporting represents opportunities lost to the services to collect comparable data to identify NBC training trends and lessons learned."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) believes that it is increasingly likely  that an adversary will use nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons (NBC)  against U.S. forces as a means of offsetting superior conventional warfare  capabilities, for gaining an asymmetrical advantage, or as an act of  terrorism.

For the Army, these centers include the National Training  Center (NTC), the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC), and the  Combat Maneuver Training Center (CMTC). The Marine Corps\u2019 combat  training center is located at Twentynine Palms, California. These two  military services introduce NBC training to their servicemembers in basic  training and continue with formal and on-the-job training at NBC schools  and home stations and during collective training field exercises, such as  those offered at the CTCs. The CTCs are large ground-combat training  sites where units can train collectively in a realistic battlefield  environment, including live fire. The centers represent an opportunity for  units to train on their mission-essential tasks and to discover\u2014through  training lessons learned provided by expert observers/controllers\u2014areas  requiring additional training at their home stations or elsewhere that could  improve their ability to perform on an actual battlefield. Specifically, you  asked that we answer the following questions: (1) To what extent do Army  and Marine Corps units and their personnel attending CTCs participate in  NBC training, and to what extent do these units and personnel perform  NBC tasks to service standards while at the CTCs?

The U.S.  National Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction acknowledges  that NBC weapons in the possession of hostile states and terrorists  represent one of the greatest security challenges facing the United States.  At the DOD level, Joint Publication 3-11, Joint Doctrine for Operations in  Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) Environments, states that \u201cUS  forces must be prepared to conduct and sustain operations in NBC  environments with minimal degradation\u201d and urges that individuals and  organizations train often and realistically while wearing NBC protective  clothing so that they are better prepared for the constraints it imposes on  communication, vision, and movement.", "Army and Marine Corps regulations, orders, and doctrine similarly stress  the importance of fully integrating NBC scenarios into training exercises.  For example, Army Regulation 350-1, \u201cArmy Training and Education,\u201d  which establishes Army-wide baseline NBC defense training policy,  requires that NBC defense tasks, such as contamination avoidance,  protection, and decontamination, be fully integrated into units\u2019 mission  training, including field training exercises. Specifically, Army Regulation  350-1 states that \u201cThe NBC defense training must be fully integrated into  unit exercises . . . for both offensive and defensive operations.\u201d This  integration is intended to develop and test the capability of commanders,  staffs, and units to perform their missions under extended NBC  conditions. In other words, NBC skills are not seen as isolated tasks, but  NBC defense is viewed as a condition under which units should be able to  do their mission-essential tasks. Similarly, Marine Corps Order 3400.3F,  paragraph 6, establishes Marine Corps-wide baseline NBC defense training  requirements and states that \u201cEvery unit and commander will fully  integrate NBCD  training into every combat, combat  support, combat service support, and command and control exercise  during offensive and defensive operations, to include live fire evolutions.\u201d   Like the Army, the Marine Corps intends to integrate NBC training into its  exercises in order to develop and test the ability of Marines at all levels not  only to survive an NBC attack but to perform their missions under NBC  conditions.", "Army and Marine Corps regulations and orders also require after-action  reporting for unit training exercises, including those that occur at the  CTCs. The Army believes that it is important to capture lessons learned  during training in order to identify combat-relevant lessons learned that  will enhance the Army\u2019s ability to perform its missions and that will  support tailored training for anticipated conditions of combat. Army  regulations for the JRTC and the CMTC state that NBC defense training  should be addressed in every training unit commander\u2019s after-action  report, but guidance for the NTC and the overall Army lessons learned  program does not. Like Army regulations, Marine Corps orders state that  after-action reports should be prepared for all training exercises and  maintained in a central lessons learned facility.

One measure of intensive unit training under NBC defense  conditions is the extent to which soldiers are required to dress and  operate for extended periods of time in their individual protective  clothing, including their masks and gloves. NTC training officials  estimated that, on average since fiscal year 2002, a typical 20- to 25-day  brigade rotation\u2014which may include up to 4,000 soldiers\u2014includes NBC  events that cause the entire unit to don the full chemical protective suit for  a total of 2 to 3 hours and about 150 to 200 soldiers to train in full  protective gear for a total of 18 to 24 hours. In other words, only about 5  percent of the brigade is affected by NBC training that requires wearing  full protective gear for more than 2 to 3 hours.

A unit rotation traditionally emphasizes the warfighting  skills a unit requires to perform its mission and combat operations.  Because training to survive and operate under potential NBC conditions is  generally treated as a condition of training for all mission-essential tasks  for units, rather than as a separate mission task, the CTCs, which develop  the training scenarios, generally propose some types of NBC conditions in  all rotations.

NBC  defense training at CTCs has been emphasized less for units training for  Bosnia and Kosovo or for Afghanistan and Iraq after NBC weapons were  not found there.

Observers/controllers at all three CTCs noted that because units had not  adequately prepared for basic NBC training at their home stations, they  were not able to fully train on the more sophisticated collective and  mission tasks under NBC conditions that could be practiced at the CTCs.  Of the three CTCs, the NTC had the most complete information on the  NBC skills of the units being trained during fiscal years 2002 and 2003.  Unlike the other CTCs, the NTC often uses a standard format to assess  incoming units on six basic NBC tasks while they are receiving their  equipment and assembling to begin training. For example, one of these  early NTC training scenarios subjects a brigade arriving at a deployment  destination to an attack by a chemical weapon. Table 1 summarizes the  assessments made by NTC observers/controllers of the NBC skills of  brigades that arrived for training during fiscal years 2002 and 2003. The  table lists the six NBC tasks assessed at the NTC and shows whether the  brigades did or did not perform the tasks to the level of proficiency  defined as acceptable by the Army.

In 1999, we noted  that training units lacked proficiency when they arrived at the training  centers, and as a result, the content of the CTC training was frequently  modified to provide less challenging scenarios than would normally be  expected. We also reported that, although units should have been  proficient at battalion-level tasks when they arrived at the CTCs, many had  trained only up to company level, and the units\u2019 leaders struggled with the  more complicated planning and synchronization tasks required for the  battalion- and brigade-level exercises conducted at the centers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "NBC Training Was Not Conducted at the Marine Corps\u2019 Combined Arms Exercises at Twentynine Palms", "paragraphs": ["No NBC training was conducted during combined arms exercises at the  Marine Corps\u2019 training center at Twentynine Palms for at least 5 years  prior to our review.

In the absence of specific training requirements, NBC defense  training has historically been left up to the discretionary control of the unit  commander, and Marine Corps commanders decided to remove it to make  room for other training. According to a Marine Corps training official, unit  commanders gave several reasons that NBC defense training at the  combined arms exercise was given a lower priority, including that it was  difficult to perform tasks in cumbersome and uncomfortable protective  gear, chemical training was time-consuming, and the likelihood of NBC  warfare was perceived as low.", "In November 2001, the Naval Audit Service issued a report on infantry and  armor readiness in the Marine Corps. One of its findings was that the  Marine Corps was not fully integrating chemical and biological training  into its collective unit exercises in a consistent manner.

As a result, different  types of after-action reports and lessons learned are prepared for CTC  training, and these documents might or might not mention NBC training.", "The Army\u2019s regulation that establishes the purpose and objectives of its  CTC program states that as part of their mission to provide realistic joint  combined arms training, the CTCs will provide the Army and joint  participants with feedback to improve warfighting, to increase units\u2019  readiness for deployment and warfighting, and to provide a data source for  lessons learned. This regulation also requires that each CTC conduct  doctrinally based after-action reviews for each unit that undergoes a  rotation at a CTC. The Army regulation on the Army\u2019s lessons learned  system requires that these after-action reports be submitted to the Center  for Army Lessons Learned (CALL) no later than 120 days from the end of  an exercise. Each of the Army\u2019s CTC regulations describes a general  format to be used in the after-action reports and lists specific topics to be  included. Though the CTC and lessons learned regulations agree on some  general points, they differ on what should be covered specifically in after- action reports. For example, the JRTC and CMTC regulations indicate that  NBC defense training should be addressed in the training unit  commander\u2019s after-action report, but the CTC, NTC, and overall Army  lessons learned program regulations do not. Appendix IV includes specific  details of how the various Army regulations differ in recommended  formats for after-action reports.", "Like the Army regulations, the Marine Corps order on its lessons learned  system states that after-action reports should be prepared for all training  exercises.

These reports are primarily  intended to be feedback for the units being trained to help them assess  their own training levels and craft home-station training plans to address  identified deficiencies. The after-action reporting and supplementary  materials provided to the units that are trained, such as videos of training,  are called \u201ctake-home packages\u201d and may include as many as five or six  compact discs containing Microsoft PowerPoint presentations and  summaries of observers/controllers. The structure, format, and content of  the after-action reporting vary by center.", "The NTC typically includes Microsoft PowerPoint briefings and written  after-action reports for the units training during each rotation. When  subunits of a brigade experience NBC \u201cevents,\u201d or NBC training scenarios,  during their rotations, observers/controllers generally include a  description of the units\u2019 performance in an \u201cNBC executive summary,\u201d  which cites areas in which subunits need to improve proficiency, along  with specific recommendations for home-station training and citations of  applicable NBC-related field manuals. When subunits do not experience  NBC events, this section is absent from after-action reporting for the  overall unit. Nowhere in the report does the NTC include an overall  brigade summary for the entire rotation period of 20 to 25 days that  indicates the number of NBC events that occurred during a single rotation,  the percentage of subunits that conducted NBC tasks, the type of tasks  performed, or how well all individual subunits did. The NTC does include,  in many cases, an assessment of a brigade\u2019s NBC skills in its first week of  training. Out of the 21 rotations conducted by the NTC during fiscal years  2002 and 2003, take-home packages for 12 brigades contained such  scorecards, which assessed units\u2019 ability to perform six essential NBC  tasks when they first arrived for training.", "Like a take-home package for the NTC, a take-home package prepared by  the JRTC contains multiple types of documents and after-action reporting.  One document lists the types of NBC events planned for the rotation and  their timing. When NBC events are not planned for the rotation, this  document is absent, and when planned NBC events are canceled, there is  no documentation stating that these scenario events did not occur or why.", "Neither is there a document that contains an overall summary of how  many NBC events occurred during a single rotation, the percentage of  subunits performing NBC tasks and the type of tasks performed, or how  well all individual subunits did. Unlike the NTC, the JRTC includes no  \u201cscorecard\u201d for assessing units\u2019 ability to perform basic NBC tasks. When  subunits do experience NBC events, JRTC observers/controllers cite areas  in which subunits need to \u201csustain\u201d or \u201cimprove\u201d proficiency, along with  specific recommendations for home-station training and citations of  applicable NBC field manuals.", "A CMTC take-home package also contains multiple Microsoft PowerPoint  briefings, written after-action reporting, and videotapes. However, a  package might or might not mention NBC training that occurred during a  rotation, as this is not a mandatory reporting section. When a subunit  experiences an NBC event, an observer/controller may mention how the  unit performed if the subunit\u2019s performance was considered to be notable.  When NBC events are discussed in an after-action report, CMTC, like NTC  and JRTC, includes general observations of a unit\u2019s performance,  comments on what it did well, and recommendations for improvement.  Because there is no overall NBC summary document, however, CMTC\u2019s  take-home packages seldom provide information on how many NBC  events occurred during a rotation, what these events were, what  percentage of the overall rotating unit participated, and how well they did  on particular NBC tasks. Because no NBC section is required, it is not  possible to calculate what percentage of CMTC rotations experience NBC  events.", "Twice a year, CALL publishes \u201ctrends\u201d documents for each Army CTC.  These publications cover all rotations that occurred during a 6-month  period and expunge any information from the reporting that would  identify a particular unit. The trends documents are compiled from after- action reports prepared for CTC training. They are prepared by  observers/controllers and given to CALL representatives at each CTC, who  then forward these reports to CALL analysts at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.  When NBC training is determined to reveal a \u201ctrend\u201d to report, it is  included in the trends publications. Individual take-home packages and  after-action reports that identify particular units are not generally made  available. Rather, they are protected to prevent them from becoming  public \u201creport cards.\u201d CALL is now limited in its ability to identify NBC  trends in its trends reports because NBC training completed at CTCs is not  now uniformly reported in a standardized format that can reliably provide  comparable data to support the identification of NBC trends.", "The Army has a large portion of CTC after-action reports located in a  database at CALL. However, because each CTC sends different or no  information on NBC training, CALL does not have information available  that would make it possible to do cross-unit or cross-center comparisons.  CALL also stores compact discs and videotapes, some of which are  entered into the electronic database. The CALL representative at each CTC  maintains some portions of the take-home packages on site. However, at  least in part because the take-home packages are considered the property  of the units being trained, they are not made widely available. Also, many  of the Army\u2019s after-action reports for NBC training at the CTCs for fiscal  years 2002 to 2003 were not received, not locatable, or never loaded into  the database located at CALL for archiving and subsequent research.

However, the command does not prepare  written after-action reports for the other major segments of the exercise.  After-action feedback is primarily given orally throughout the exercise  period. This oral feedback is based on observations by  observers/controllers assigned to each unit being trained. In the combined  arms exercises that included NBC training in 2004, the written final  exercise reports did not include any lessons learned on NBC operations  because this training did not occur during the final 3 days.

The Marine Corps recently  determined that its overall lessons learned system was not functioning  well. In December 2003, a working group that studied the Marine Corps  Lessons Learned System found that problems with reporting and  maintaining lessons learned were Marine Corps-wide. A Marine Corps  information paper reported that throughout the Marine Corps, only eight  reports had been submitted to the Marine Corps Lessons Learned System  in 2002. The information paper also stated that the Marine Corps plans to  implement an improved Web-based lessons learned system in the future.

The services  stress the importance of including NBC defense training in their exercises.  Yet only a small percentage of the servicemembers passing through the  CTCs encounter NBC defense training tasks because an Army or Marine  Corps regulation or order requiring it is lacking. We recognize that  commanders\u2019 discretion in determining unit training plans for CTC  rotations is, and should continue to be, a central part of Army and Marine  Corps training doctrine. However, until units are required to perform at  least minimum NBC tasks while attending the CTCs, the services will  continue to risk missing a unique opportunity to (1) uniformly assess these  units\u2019 proficiency while they are operating in a field environment and (2)  leverage the benefits of an objective assessment by an expert staff of units\u2019  NBC skills.", "NBC lessons learned during training rotations at the combat training  centers would be very useful for the services in their attempts to anticipate  and train for NBC problems that may occur later during operations.  Service regulations or orders specify that (1) all units at CTCs should  conduct doctrinally based after-action reviews of events supported by  observers/controllers, (2) lessons learned should be entered into an  archived database, and (3) training unit commanders\u2019 after-action reports  should be analyzed for trends and lessons learned. However, service  regulations or orders do not now state that NBC training at the CTCs must  be captured in a standardized format. In the absence of such a  requirement, the Army\u2019s archived NBC data on training at the CTCs will  remain incomplete or noncomparable and thus will not fully support  research and reporting on NBC trends and lessons learned. The Marine  Corps also does not employ a standard method of reporting NBC training  at Twentynine Palms or providing the Marine Corps\u2019 trend and lessons  learned reporting systems with NBC training information. Until the Marine  Corps standardizes the reporting formats to capture service-defined NBC  training at Twentynine Palms, it will be unable to analyze, over time, the  units\u2019 NBC skills at these exercises, the effectiveness of NBC training at  Twentynine Palms, or NBC trends and lessons learned.
