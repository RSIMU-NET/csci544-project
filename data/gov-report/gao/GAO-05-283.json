To augment river flows and avoid jeopardizing the salmon's existence, Reclamation established a multiyear water bank as part of its Klamath Project operations for 2002 through 2011. Water banks facilitate the transfer of water entitlements between users. This report addresses (1) how Reclamation operated the water bank and its cost from 2002 through 2004, (2) whether Reclamation met its annual water bank obligations each year, (3) the water bank's impact on water availability and use in the Klamath River Basin, and (4) alternative approaches for achieving the water bank's objectives."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Reclamation has changed how it operates the Klamath Project water bank, as it has gained more experience, to help it meet its growing obligations and mitigate costs. For example, Reclamation initially obtained most of the water for the water bank by contracting with irrigators to either forego irrigation altogether (crop idling), or use only well water (groundwater substitution). It later added the option to pump well water into the irrigation canals for others to use (groundwater pumping). For the period 2002 through 2004, Reclamation's water bank expenditures totaled over $12 million, and the cumulative cost could exceed $65 million through 2011. GAO's analysis of water bank contracts and river flow records found that Reclamation met its water bank obligations by acquiring and delivering the required amount of water for 2002 through 2004. However, Reclamation has not provided stakeholders with systematic and clear information concerning the water bank's management and status and its decision to use river flow data that are not publicly available limited stakeholders' ability to monitor water bank activities. This has led to confusion and doubt among stakeholders on whether Reclamation met its water bank obligations. The water bank appears to have increased the availability of water to enhance river flows by reducing the amount of water diverted for irrigation, but the actual impacts are difficult to quantify because Reclamation lacks flow measurement equipment and monitoring data for the Klamath Project. Reviews by external experts of the impacts of the 2002 and 2003 crop idling contracts indicate that significantly less water may have been obtained from these contracts than Reclamation estimated. Given the uncertainty surrounding how much water can be obtained from crop idling, in 2004 Reclamation officials decided to rely primarily upon metered groundwater wells for the water bank. However, Reclamation has since learned that groundwater aquifers under the Klamath Project, already stressed by drought conditions, have shown significant declines in water levels and are refilling at a slower than normal rate in recent years. As a result, Reclamation is considering lessening its reliance on groundwater for the 2005 water bank but is uncertain if it can meet its water bank obligations, particularly for spring flows, while increasing its reliance on crop idling. Although several alternative approaches for achieving the water bank's objectives have been identified by Reclamation and other stakeholders, limited information is available regarding their feasibility or costs. Some alternatives to the water bank include permanently retiring Klamath Project land from irrigation or adding new short-term or long-term storage. Each alternative has been considered to varying degrees, but significant analysis is still needed on most alternatives before any implementation decisions can be made. Meanwhile, Reclamation and the National Marine Fisheries Service have an ongoing dialogue regarding the water bank and will likely reconsult on Klamath Project operations, including the water bank, in 2006."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Located in the Upper Klamath Basin, the Bureau of Reclamation\u2019s  (Reclamation) Klamath Project (Project) is a federal water project  spanning the borders of southern Oregon and northern California. Initiated  in 1905, the Project was designed to dam the Upper Klamath Lake to  manage Klamath River flows, drain nearby lakes and marshlands to create  approximately 200,000 acres of farmland, and provide farmers with  irrigation water through an elaborate system of canals and drains. As a  result, Project operations largely determine the amount of water flowing in  the Klamath River, which subsequently passes through several  hydroelectric generating dams before running freely into the Lower  Klamath Basin and emptying into the Pacific Ocean, as shown in figure 1.  On average, about 1.5 million acre-feet\u2014nearly 500 billion gallons\u2014of  water pass from the Upper Basin to the Lower Basin annually.", "Drought conditions since 2000 have made it difficult for Reclamation to  balance the demands for irrigation water by farmers on the Project with the  requirements for specific river flows and lake levels for threatened and  endangered species. The southern Oregon/northern California coho (coho),  a species of salmon native to the river, was listed as threatened under the  Endangered Species Act in 1997, and two species of sucker in Upper  Klamath Lake were listed as endangered in 1988. Project operations were  severely impacted in April 2001 when Reclamation cut off water deliveries  to the majority of Project irrigators in order to meet river flow and lake  level requirements to protect the coho and suckers under the act. As a  result, agricultural production was impaired or eliminated on much of the  Project, and some individuals engaged in acts of civil disobedience to  protest Reclamation\u2019s actions.", "To avert future crises similar to 2001, Reclamation proposed a new 10-year  Project operations plan for 2002 through 2011. As required under the act  and applicable regulations, Reclamation consulted with the National  Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) on its biological assessment of the plan to  determine its effect on listed species. NMFS issued a final biological  opinion finding that the plan would jeopardize the continued existence of  the coho and likely adversely modify its critical habitat. In its opinion,  NMFS recommended an alternative plan to protect the coho, which  included the establishment of a multiyear water bank to provide additional  river flows that would better protect critical habitat. Reclamation  incorporated the water bank program into its Project operations plan  through 2011. The biological opinion also provides for reinitiation of  consultation to modify the plan if, for example, new scientific information  on river flow requirements for coho becomes available.", "To comply with the biological opinion, Reclamation must meet certain river  flow requirements and also provide a water bank of 30,000 acre-feet in  2002, 50,000 acre-feet in 2003, 75,000 acre-feet in 2004, and 100,000 acre-feet  from 2005 through 2011 to supplement river flows. In broad terms, a water  bank is an institutional mechanism that facilitates the transfer of water  entitlements between users and/or uses. As such, Reclamation\u2019s water bank  is not a physical reservoir where water can be deposited and withdrawn as  needed but is an administrative process under which Project irrigators who  volunteer to participate are paid by Reclamation to forego their contractual  entitlement for one irrigation season in order to make more water available  for release downstream. Water accrues to the water bank over the course  of the year when participants do not use irrigation water for their crops as  they normally would. By March 31 each year NMFS and Reclamation will  meet to determine a flow schedule, including water bank deliveries.  According to Reclamation, the water bank provides a temporary means to  augment river flows for threatened species and also allows it to meet its  contractual responsibility to deliver water to Project irrigators while long- term, basinwide solutions for balancing water demands are evaluated. To  collaboratively develop potential long-term solutions to improve habitat  conditions, some of which could increase river flows, the biological  opinion also requires Reclamation to initiate a Conservation  Implementation Program to bring together stakeholders, including federal  agencies, tribes, and the states.", "This report addresses (1) how Reclamation operated the water bank and  how much it cost from 2002 through 2004, (2) whether Reclamation met its  annual water bank obligations each year, (3) the water bank\u2019s impact on  water availability and use in the basin, and (4) alternative approaches for  achieving the water bank\u2019s objectives.", "To address the objectives of this report, we visited the Klamath Project and  met with and collected documentation from Reclamation and NMFS  officials, as well as representatives from other stakeholder federal  agencies, tribes, irrigators, commercial fishermen, academics, and  conservationists. To determine how Reclamation operated the water bank  and its costs, we analyzed water bank planning, contracting, and  expenditure documentation. To determine whether Reclamation met its  annual water bank obligations, we analyzed water bank contracts and  documentation of Klamath River flows. To describe the water bank\u2019s  impact, we analyzed relevant land, surface water, and groundwater use  data; reviewed relevant studies; and met with stakeholders. We did not  review the water bank\u2019s impact on fish species because the short history of  the water bank makes it difficult to obtain reliable information. To describe  alternative approaches to the water bank, we met with potential land  sellers, reviewed studies of water storage options, and reviewed the status  of basinwide efforts to increase flows. We performed our work between  May 2004 and February 2005 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Klamath River Basin, spanning the southern Oregon and northern  California borders, covers over 15,000 square miles. The Klamath River  originates in the Upper Basin, fed by Oregon\u2019s Upper Klamath Lake, a large,  shallow body of water composed of flows from the Sprague, Williamson,  and Wood Rivers. The river subsequently flows into the Lower Basin in  California, fed by tributaries including the Shasta, Scott, Salmon, and  Trinity Rivers, and empties into the Pacific Ocean. River flows and lake  levels depend primarily upon snowpack that develops during the winter  months, melts in the spring, and flows into the river basin. Rainfall and  groundwater from natural springs also contribute to flows. On average,  about 1.5 million acre-feet of water pass from the Upper Basin to the Lower  Basin annually at Iron Gate Dam.", "The Secretary of the Interior authorized construction of the Klamath  Project in 1905. Reclamation dammed Upper Klamath Lake, drained and  reclaimed Lower Klamath and Tule Lakes, stored the Klamath and Lost  Rivers\u2019 flows, and provided irrigation diversion and flood control on the  reclaimed land. About 85 percent of the Project lands obtain irrigation  water from Upper Klamath Lake and the Klamath River, while Gerber  Reservoir, Clear Lake, and the Lost River supply the remainder of the  Project. Water is delivered to Project lands using an elaborate system of  canals, channels, and drains, including diversions directly from the  Klamath River. The distribution system is considered highly efficient,  ensuring that water that is diverted for use within the Project is reused  several times before it returns to the Klamath River. Homesteading of the  reclaimed lands began in 1917 and continued through 1948.", "As shown in figure 2, the Project is currently composed of about 207,000  acres of irrigable lands. Historically, about 200,000 acres of Project lands  have been in agricultural use annually. For example, in 2003, the most  recent year for which data is available, about 202,000 acres were  considered to be in agricultural use, of which about 180,000 acres were  irrigated and harvested. Crops grown and harvested on the Project include  alfalfa, barley, oats, wheat, onions, potatoes, and peppermint, and cattle  graze on more than 40,000 acres of irrigated pastureland. In addition to  farm and pastureland, four national wildlife refuges were set aside by  executive orders in conjunction with the construction of the Project. The  refuges, managed by Interior\u2019s Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) support  many fish and wildlife species and provide suitable habitat and resources  for migratory birds of the Pacific Flyway. About 23,000 acres of the two  refuges within the Project water delivery area\u2014Tule Lake and Lower  Klamath National Wildlife Refuges\u2014are leased for agricultural purposes.", "Reclamation, through contracts, provides water for irrigation and  hydropower production and must also provide water for the national  wildlife refuges. Reclamation has entered into contracts with numerous  irrigation districts and individual irrigators on the Project to provide for the  repayment of Project costs and the right to receive Project water. The  contracts most commonly specify a land acreage amount to be covered by  the contract\u2014not a specific water amount to be delivered. Also by contract  with Reclamation, California-Oregon Power Company (now PacifiCorp)  obtained the right to use certain amounts of water, after requirements of  the Klamath Project are satisfied, for hydropower generation at its  privately owned and independently operated dams on the Klamath River  downstream of the Project. PacifiCorp\u2019s southernmost hydropower dam,  Iron Gate Dam, located about 20 miles downriver of the Oregon-California  border, is the last control point before Klamath River flows run freely to the  Pacific Ocean. Finally, the national wildlife refuges have federally reserved  rights for the water necessary to satisfy the refuges\u2019 primary purposes, and  Reclamation must satisfy refuge water needs after its other obligations are  met.", "Reclamation is also obligated to protect tribal trust resources, such as  water and coho salmon. The Klamath River Basin is home to four federally  recognized tribes, identified by Reclamation as the Klamath Tribes in the  Upper Basin area of Oregon, and the Hoopa Valley Tribe, Yurok Tribe, and  Karuk Tribe in the Lower Basin area of California. Each tribe has long- standing cultural ties to the Klamath River, its tributaries, and native fish  species. Furthermore, the Klamath, Hoopa, and Yurok tribes have, either by  treaty or executive order, reserved rights to sufficient water quality and  flows to support all life stages of fish life in protection of tribal fishing  rights. As with all federal agencies, Reclamation has a trust responsibility  to protect these tribal resources and to consult with the tribes regarding its  actions in a government-to-government relationship.", "Reclamation must comply with the Endangered Species Act to ensure that  any action it authorizes, funds, or carries out is not likely to jeopardize the  continued existence of any listed species of plant or animal or adversely  modify or destroy designated critical habitat. Interior\u2019s FWS and  Commerce\u2019s NMFS are responsible for administering the act. If FWS or  NMFS finds that an agency\u2019s proposed activity is likely to jeopardize a  threatened or endangered species or destroy or adversely modify its critical  habitat, then a \u201creasonable and prudent alternative\u201d that would avoid such  harm must be identified. Three species of fish that are of particular  importance to the cultures of the tribes\u2014the threatened southern  Oregon/northern California coho, and the endangered Lost River sucker  and shortnose sucker\u2014are affected by Project operations. NMFS listed the  coho as threatened in 1997, and FWS listed the two species of suckers,  which populate Upper Klamath Lake and rivers other than the Klamath, as  endangered in 1988.", "Drought conditions since 2000 have complicated Reclamation\u2019s efforts to  balance the irrigation water demands on the Project with the requirements  for specific river flows and lake levels for threatened and endangered  species. Reclamation operates the Project according to an annual  operations plan that helps the agency to meet its various obligations and  responsibilities, given varying hydrological conditions. In 2001, responding  to Reclamation\u2019s biological assessment of its proposed Project operations  plan, FWS and NMFS issued biological opinions that suggested  Reclamation take numerous actions, including maintaining higher water  levels in Upper Klamath Lake and two reservoirs on the Lost River and  higher flows of the Klamath River below Iron Gate Dam. Because of the  new biological opinions and drought conditions, Reclamation was  prohibited from releasing normal amounts of water to most Project  irrigators, which impaired or eliminated agricultural production on much  of the Project.", "Subsequently, Reclamation proposed a new 10-year Project operations plan  for 2002 through 2011. NMFS reviewed Reclamation\u2019s biological  assessment of the plan to determine its effect on listed species, and issued  a final biological opinion on May 31, 2002, directing Reclamation to  establish a multiyear water bank to provide additional river flows.", "Reclamation incorporated this water bank into its Project operations plan  through 2011. NMFS and Reclamation can reconsult on the requirements of  the biological opinion as warranted, for example, if new scientific  information on river flow requirements for fish is developed.  Reconsultation is likely during 2006, when ongoing studies of Klamath  River flows are expected to be completed.", "Although NMFS\u2019 biological opinion recommended a water bank as an  alternative and specified the amounts of water to be provided each year, it  provided Reclamation little specific guidance regarding the structure,  management, or operation of the water bank. Water banking is broadly  defined as an institutional mechanism that facilitates the legal transfer and  market exchange of various types of surface water, groundwater, and water  storage entitlements. Water banks have been proposed or are operating in  almost every western state. However, significant differences exist in the  way that each bank operates with respect to market structure, degree of  participation, pricing, regulatory oversight, environmental objectives, and  other factors.", "Under Reclamation\u2019s water bank program, participating irrigators would be  paid to forego their contractual entitlement to water for one irrigation  season in order to make more water available for release into the river.  Water acquired by Reclamation would accrue to the water bank over the  course of the year as participants did not divert water for irrigation  purposes as they normally would. A schedule for delivery of additional  flows is determined by NMFS and Reclamation by March 31 each year, with  the majority of the water bank provided in the spring and early summer  when the water is most needed by the coho. According to Reclamation, the  water bank would enable the agency to augment river flows for threatened  species and also meet its contractual responsibility to deliver water to  Project irrigators until other solutions for balancing water demands were  identified. Reclamation was also required to initiate a Conservation  Implementation Program that would bring together basin stakeholders,  including federal agencies, tribes, and the states, to collaboratively develop  long-term solutions, some of which would increase flows, such as surface  water storage and groundwater resource development."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reclamation Modified Its Water Bank Operations from Year to Year as Its Obligations and Costs Increased", "paragraphs": ["Reclamation modified its water bank operations from year to year as its  obligations and costs increased. Reclamation acquired water for the water  bank by contracting with irrigators for the water needed to augment  Klamath River flows as required by the biological opinion. As it gained  more experience each year, Reclamation modified its water bank  operations to better meet the increasing obligations and to mitigate costs.  As its annual obligations increased, Reclamation\u2019s annual water bank  expenditures also increased, totaling more than $12 million through 2004.  Based on Reclamation\u2019s estimated annual cost of about $7.6 million for  fiscal year 2005 and onward, the cumulative cost of the water bank could  exceed $65 million through fiscal year 2011."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Reclamation Modified Its Water Bank Operations from Year to Year to Meet Increasing Obligations", "paragraphs": ["Reclamation initiated the Klamath Project water bank program in 2002, as  recommended under NMFS\u2019 biological opinion, with the objective of  purchasing irrigators\u2019 water entitlement for one irrigation season so that  this water could be used to provide additional Klamath River flows for  threatened coho salmon. The water bank is not a physical reservoir of  stored water but an administrative mechanism through which Reclamation  contracts with irrigators both on and off the Klamath Project. Through  these contracts irrigators agreed to either (1) forego irrigation altogether  (crop idling), (2) irrigate using only well water (groundwater substitution),  or (3) pump well water into the irrigation canals for others to use  (groundwater pumping), thus making water available to augment river  flows. Water accrues to the water bank over the course of the irrigation  season as water bank contractors forego irrigating their land by crop idling  or groundwater substitution and as groundwater is pumped into canals  under water bank contracts. However, because Reclamation is required to  provide large amounts of water in spring and early summer before  sufficient water has accrued to the water bank, it actually \u201cborrows\u201d water  for the bank from short-term storage supplies. This water is later replaced  by foregone irrigation water over the course of the year.", "Reclamation modified its water bank operations each year, changing its  composition, selection process, contracting process, and program rules as  it gained experience to meet its increasing obligations. In 2002 when the  obligation was 30,000 acre-feet, the water bank sources included crop  idling off-Project and groundwater pumping; in 2003 when the obligation  was 50,000 acre-feet, sources included crop idling on-Project and  groundwater substitution; and in 2004 when the obligation was 75,000 acre- feet, all three sources of water were included in the water bank.  Reclamation modified the selection process from relying on only two  irrigators in 2002\u2014without a public application process\u2014to soliciting  applications from any qualified irrigator in both 2003 and 2004. In 2004,  Reclamation solicited water bank applicants earlier in the year than it had  in 2003, in part, to allow successful applicants more lead time in planning  their irrigation. Reclamation also modified the contracting process to  obtain more flexibility by competitively bidding contract rates in 2004  rather than paying a fixed rate as in 2003 and entering into contingency  contracts for groundwater pumping that could be activated \u201cas needed\u201d to  deliver additional water to meet its increasing water bank obligation and  uncertain delivery schedule. These contingency contracts allowed  Reclamation to acquire only the amount of water it needed to meet the  agreed upon delivery schedule. Finally, Reclamation expanded its program  rules to make participation in the water bank more practical and attractive  to potential applicants. For example, Reclamation changed the rules for the  2004 water bank to allow harvesting of crops on land under crop idling  contracts, reflecting the fact that some crops such as alfalfa can grow with  water from subsurface moisture alone.", "Similarly, Reclamation modified its monitoring process for the water bank  over time. For example, in 2003, Reclamation monitored every participant  for compliance with the program rules. Enforcement staff examined and  tested each crop idling parcel of land at least once over the course of 2003\u2019s  water bank to ensure that no intentional irrigation occurred. In addition,  Reclamation relied on self-policing by irrigators who called in tips  identifying potential cheaters. A Reclamation official estimated a greater  than 95 percent compliance rate in 2003 and only terminated the contract  of one participant who intentionally irrigated fields after deciding to  withdraw from water bank participation without notifying Reclamation. In  contrast, during 2004 Reclamation sought to reduce enforcement costs and  increase efficiency by examining and testing crop idling parcels of land  only toward the end of the year while following up on tips identifying  potential cheaters throughout the year. In 2004, Reclamation found no  intentional violations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Water Bank Costs Could Exceed $65 Million through Fiscal Year 2011", "paragraphs": ["Reclamation\u2019s water bank expenditures through fiscal year 2004 exceeded  $12 million and could total more than $65 million through 2011.

Reclamation estimates that the 100,000 acre-foot water bank requirements  for fiscal years 2005 through 2011 will cost at least $7.6 million annually,  bringing the total water bank costs to more than $65 million. For 2005 and  onward, according to Reclamation, the water bank will be a specific budget  item in its budget request. Accordingly, Reclamation requested $7.626  million for fiscal year 2005 and plans to gradually increase annual budget  requests to about $7.660 million by 2011.", "Reclamation\u2019s expenditures fall into five categories: groundwater contract  costs, crop idling contract costs, Klamath Basin Rangeland Trust contract  costs, administrative costs, and other costs.

We found that, in total, Reclamation augmented Klamath River  flows by approximately 30,000 acre-feet within the brief 2002 water bank  time frame\u2014meeting its 30,000 acre-feet schedule requirement; by more  than 71,000 acre-feet in 2003\u2014surpassing its 50,000 acre-feet schedule  requirement; and by more than 95,000 acre-feet in 2004\u2014surpassing its  74,373 acre-feet schedule requirement. According to Reclamation officials,  these augmented flows represent water provided per water bank  requirements plus additional releases of water purchased and stored to  meet tribal trust obligations. Because the water bank is not a physical pool  of water allowing the constant measurement and monitoring of deposits  and withdrawals, estimating the status of water bank accruals or deliveries  and differentiating water bank deliveries from tribal trust deliveries during  the year is neither precise nor easy. Reclamation views water bank  deliveries as simultaneously meeting both its requirement to augment river  flows under the biological opinion and its tribal trust responsibilities.  However, to account for its annual deliveries, Reclamation officials have  generally counted augmented flows as first satisfying the water bank  requirement and consider excess flows, such as the approximately 20,000  acre-feet delivered above the water bank requirement in 2003 and 2004, as  tribal trust deliveries.", "Augmented flow is defined as the volume of water in excess of base flows  measured at Iron Gate Dam.

Heavier than expected rainfall in early spring of 2003  caused a \u201cspill condition\u201d to exist on April 1 when the water bank was set  to begin. However, the biological opinion does not specify how much, if  any, spill water can be counted as a water bank delivery. In the absence of  specific guidance from NMFS, Reclamation could have counted spill  toward water bank deliveries in one of three ways: (1) up to the amount  already scheduled for delivery during the spill; (2) in its entirety, including  water above the scheduled amount; or (3) not at all. According to  Reclamation officials, they eventually decided to reset the water bank\u2019s  start to May 21\u2014when the spill condition ended\u2014and started counting  augmented flows as of that date.

For example, according to some tribal representatives,  Reclamation provided a preliminary status report in July stating that over  20 percent of the water bank\u2014over 11,000 acre-feet\u2014was delivered during  the spill. This contradicted a Reclamation official\u2019s statement that the  agency had retroactively reset the water bank\u2019s start date to after the spill  conditions ceased. Reclamation officials concede that stakeholder  confusion as a result of these actions was understandable. Subsequently,  NMFS and Reclamation agreed that, beginning in 2004, spill water will be  counted only up to the amount already scheduled for delivery by the water  bank.", "Similarly, Reclamation\u2019s reclassification of the water-year type\u2014which  determines the base river flow requirement\u2014has also caused confusion for  stakeholders. Like spill conditions, the biological opinion is silent on  whether the water-year type can be reclassified midyear after its initial  determination in April. NMFS and Reclamation officials contend that  reclassifying the water year type to reflect changing water conditions is  necessary to reflect the most current and accurate data available. However,  some stakeholders, such as the tribes, contend that midyear  reclassification is not allowed under the biological opinion and could lead  to the improper manipulation of water bank delivery schedules. While  Reclamation issued a press release informing the public of its  reclassification of the water-year type in 2003, the impact of such changes  on the water bank was not clearly articulated. For example, Reclamation  did not mention that it would also change its estimate of year-to-date water  bank deliveries as a result of the midyear reclassification in water-year  type, leading to stakeholder concerns that water deliveries were being  manipulated to benefit irrigators at the expense of fish. Reclamation  officials believe that reclassifying water-year types is in compliance with  the biological opinion and that the confusion related to reclassifying the  water-year type stems from Reclamation\u2019s attempt to incorporate the most  recent and accurate data on water conditions in their water bank delivery  schedules.", "Reclamation also has not clearly or systematically communicated the water  bank\u2019s status and operations, further increasing stakeholder confusion.  Specifically, Reclamation does not have a systematic mechanism to  communicate information regarding the water bank to all stakeholders.  Rather than regularly providing updated calculations of year-to-date  deliveries to all stakeholders simultaneously through a single mechanism,  such as a Web site or regularly scheduled press releases, Reclamation  provides information on the water bank and its status \u201cupon request\u201d and  through occasional press releases. Consequently, different stakeholders  receive different information at different times. According to Reclamation  officials, they meet regularly with the tribes and discuss the water bank\u2019s  status. However, Reclamation does not systematically seek feedback on the  operation of the water bank from all stakeholders, limiting the  opportunities to clarify misunderstandings. As a result, after several years  of operation, questions continue to persist among stakeholders, including  some Project irrigators and tribes, on basic topics such as the purpose of  the water bank. Reclamation placed some information about the water  bank application process on its Web site; however, Reclamation has not  made other water bank information\u2014such as the year-to-date status\u2014 available since that time, in part, because Reclamation has been reluctant  to release status information that will almost certainly require revision later  in the year.", "Finally, Reclamation\u2019s use of river flow data generated by PacifiCorp to  estimate the water bank\u2019s river flow augmentation has reduced the  transparency of the water bank and limited the ability of stakeholders to  independently monitor the operation of the water bank. The PacifiCorp  data used by Reclamation to calculate actual Klamath River flows is not  available to the public. Therefore, interested stakeholders must use a  different source\u2014the publicly available USGS data on actual Klamath River  flows\u2014to calculate year-to-date water bank deliveries. The PacifiCorp and  USGS flow data differ because each uses a different formula to calculate  the average daily flow. Thus, Reclamation and stakeholders will arrive at  different augmented flow calculations, depending upon which data source  they use. For example, we found that, in 2003, augmented flows appeared  to be about 2,500 acre-feet greater when using USGS data than when using  PacifiCorp data. Furthermore, Reclamation, using PacifiCorp data, would  calculate that it had met its water bank obligation on a different date than a  stakeholder would using USGS data, creating the potential for stakeholder  confusion and doubt regarding the status of water bank deliveries.

Crop idling  contributed to a significant increase in the amount of land not irrigated in  2003, compared with recent years. For example, according to  Reclamation\u2019s 2003 crop report, a total of 20,335 Project acres were not  irrigated, which is about a 60 percent increase over 2002 when 12,546 acres  of land were not irrigated, and well exceeds the average of 7,665 acres of  Project land not irrigated due to agricultural fallowing practices from 1998  through 2000\u2014the three years preceding Reclamation\u2019s restriction of  irrigation water in 2001.", "Although the number of acres of crop land idled is a useful indication of the  water bank\u2019s impacts, it does not provide a reliable estimate of the true  extent to which irrigation water has been made available for river flows.  According to Reclamation officials, the precise impact of the water bank  cannot be determined because of year-to-year variation in irrigation  demand and its determining factors such as temperature, precipitation, and  crop types. Moreover, throughout the life of the water bank, Reclamation  has used varying assumptions about the amount of water that can be saved  by crop idling as more research and information has become available  about this practice. Specifically, in 2002, Reclamation assumed that it could  obtain about 5 acre-feet of irrigation water per acre of crop idling, in 2003  and 2004 assumed 2.5 acre-feet, and is currently assuming that it can obtain  2 acre-feet per acre through crop idling. To help it quantify the actual  results of the water bank, Reclamation has turned to other organizations  for assistance. For example, after the 2002 water bank was completed,  Reclamation engaged USGS to review the assumptions and results for its  off-Project crop idling. In February 2004, USGS reported to Reclamation  that, based on the available data, the amount of water actually obtained per  acre of crop land idled during the 2002 water bank was most likely in the  range of .9 to 1.3 acre-feet of water per acre.", "Similarly, in 2003, Reclamation was again unable to obtain precise  information on the measurable impacts of the water bank for the year, so it  contracted with California Polytechnic State University to study this issue.  This study concluded that without effective flow measurement equipment  and monitoring data for the Project it could not precisely estimate the  impact of the water bank in reducing Upper Klamath Lake and Klamath  River diversions to the Project. According to the study, in 2003 the  reduction in diversions compared with 2000 may have ranged from 11,000  to 71,000 acre-feet and, moreover, this reduction may have been  attributable to numerous other factors in addition to the water bank, such  as heavy rainfall, a large amount of groundwater pumping, changes in  irrigation district operations, and awareness among Project irrigators of  the need to reduce water use. Based on subsequent university analysis,  Reclamation now estimates that it actually obtained about 2 acre-feet of  water per acre from crop idling in 2003 and 2004.", "Despite the ongoing uncertainty regarding the impact that reducing the  amount of irrigated land has on the availability of water for river flows,  Reclamation officials told us they must continue to rely on crop idling for a  significant portion of the water bank. While some stakeholders favor taking  farmland out of irrigation, they are also uncertain of the extent to which  crop idling reduces diversions for irrigation. For example, both tribal and  fishing industry representatives told us that they doubt that Reclamation  can accurately estimate how much additional water is actually made  available to the river. Some irrigators question the effectiveness and  accountability of crop idling as a strategy for the water bank, and also are  concerned about the economic impacts to taking farmland out of  production."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Groundwater Pumping for the Water Bank under Drought Conditions Raises Concerns about the Impacts on Aquifers", "paragraphs": ["Because of the uncertainty regarding the measurable impact of crop idling,  Reclamation shifted to groundwater for most of its water bank acquisitions  in 2004; however, the impact of groundwater pumping on basin aquifers  during ongoing drought conditions is largely unknown and continued  reliance may not be sustainable.

Figure 6 below shows a groundwater pump delivering water into a canal for  the water bank. According to Reclamation officials, in the absence of  stored water, groundwater pumping is the only way to meet required flows  in the spring and early summer because land idling provides little water in  the April through June time period. An advantage of groundwater pumping  for the water bank is that, unlike crop idling, flow meters on pumps and  wells allow the exact measurement of the amount of groundwater being  used in place of river diversions for irrigation.", "The impact of groundwater pumping on Upper Basin aquifers, however, is  not well understood, and its use during drought conditions is a matter of  growing concern for Reclamation and others. The basin has suffered  drought conditions since 2000, resulting in less rain and snowmelt to fill  lakes, rivers, and aquifers. Recognizing that water demand would cause  more users to turn to groundwater but that there is little reliable  information on the groundwater hydrology of the Upper Klamath Basin,  USGS and the Oregon Water Resources Department initiated a cooperative  study in 1998 to study and quantify the Upper Basin\u2019s previously unknown  groundwater flow system. The study, funded in part by Reclamation, is  expected to be substantially completed in 2005.", "Nevertheless, USGS and Oregon Water Resources Department officials  have found evidence that groundwater aquifers in the Upper Basin, already  stressed by drought conditions, are being pumped by an increasing number  of newly drilled wells and refilling at slower than normal rates in recent  years.

From 1998 to 2000, 21 domestic wells were  deepened; from 2001 to 2003, 30 domestic wells were deepened; and in  2004, another 13 were deepened. Furthermore, USGS officials have  identified wells in various parts of the Upper Basin, within and outside the  Project boundaries, which have shown significant water level declines. For  example, wells outside the Project have shown declines of up to 10 feet  since 2000, thought to be primarily attributable to climatic conditions.  Wells within the Project have shown a variety of responses to pumping\u2014 some wells seem to decline during irrigation season and then recover  substantially during winter months, while other wells have shown steady  year-to-year declines, some dropping more than 15 feet.", "Reclamation engaged USGS in May 2004 to conduct an assessment of their  current water bank strategies and any potential strategies that could help  the agency meet its obligations.

Reclamation, irrigators, and tribal representatives told us that they believe  that retiring irrigated land would reduce river diversions, but none are  certain as to precisely by how much. Nevertheless, Reclamation, based on  its most recent estimate of the amount of irrigation water obtained from  crop idling for the water bank, assumes that irrigation is reduced by about  2 acre-feet of water per acre idled. Using this assumption, Reclamation  estimates that at least 50,000 irrigated acres\u2014about 30 percent of the  acreage currently irrigated by water from Upper Klamath Lake and the  Klamath River\u2014would need to be retired to reduce irrigation by 100,000  acre-feet. However, according to Reclamation officials, because crop idling  provides little water from April to June, such land retirement by itself will  not provide sufficient water to meet spring river flow requirements under  the biological opinion. Furthermore, the actual reduction in irrigation  would depend upon factors such as the extent of irrigation on the land  before it was retired and how it is used after retirement.", "Although there may be a fairly large number of potential willing land sellers  on the Project, the amount of irrigated land actually available for purchase  and permanent retirement is not known. In 2001, the American Land  Conservancy (Conservancy)\u2014a national, nonprofit organization involved  in land conservation efforts\u2014obtained 1-year agreements with 78 different  landowners to purchase over 25,000 acres of irrigated land for the purpose  of land retirement. The Conservancy made agreements with willing  sellers\u2014who, according to Conservancy officials, were generally aging and  fearful of future drops in property values\u2014expecting that the federal  government would purchase the land for retirement. However, according to  the Conservancy, Reclamation was not interested because the land was not  in a single block. Moreover, according to Reclamation officials, the federal  government is not interested in acquiring more land in the Klamath Basin.  Subsequently, the Conservancy\u2019s agreements with the sellers lapsed.  Whether a coalition of willing sellers could be put together again is  unknown. An incentive to potential sellers could come from an expected  increase in power rates in 2006. According to a recent Oregon State  University economic study, an increase in power rates could raise  agricultural production costs by an average of $40 per sprinkler-irrigated  acre, potentially making agriculture unprofitable on as much as 90,000  acres of Project land. This scenario could potentially make more land  available for sale and might even result in some voluntary land retirement  due to lack of profitability, thus increasing river flows.", "Additionally, the price at which land might be obtained for retirement is  unknown. According to the Conservancy, the appraised value of the  potential willing sellers\u2019 land in 2001 was $3,000 per acre. However, based  on 2001 estimates from an Oregon State University and University of  California economic study, the market value for Project irrigated land can  range from $300 per acre for Class V soils\u2014the lowest quality for  agricultural purposes\u2014to $2,600 for Class II soils\u2014 some of the better  agricultural soil on the Project. In addition, Project landowners are  concerned that property values may have decreased due to the uncertainty  of water deliveries for irrigation after the 2001 water restriction. Using the  2001 price estimates from the universities\u2019 study, the total cost to retire  50,000 acres, assuming the land is available from willing sellers, could  range from $15 to $130 million, depending upon the mixture of low and  high valued land offered for sale.", "Finally, while tribal representatives and others favor significant irrigated  land retirement as a means to reduce demands on the river, the extent of  impacts on the agricultural economy is cause for concern in the Project  farming community. Tribal representatives and downstream fishing  representatives told us that irrigated land retirement is essential to  restoring the balance between the supply of and demand for water in the  basin. However, according to Klamath irrigators, the Klamath agricultural  economy is fragile and must maintain close to current levels of agricultural  acreage in production to sustain its infrastructure. Irrigators argue that  retiring large amounts of irrigated farmland on the Project could eliminate  or adversely impact key aspects of agricultural infrastructure, such as fuel,  transportation, equipment and fertilizer suppliers, and affect a whole host  of other dynamics of the agricultural community. However, retiring land  with the lowest agricultural value could help minimize the potential  negative effect on the region\u2019s agricultural economy.

Such an  adjustment would not directly alter Reclamation\u2019s water bank  obligations; however, it would decrease Reclamation\u2019s overall  responsibility for ensuring Klamath River base flows by increasing the  responsibilities of other basin stakeholders, such as the states and other  federal agencies. According to NMFS, such a change would need to be  considered within the context of the U.S. District Court\u2019s 2003 criticism  of the allocation of responsibility for providing flows.", "Not requiring a water bank in Above Average or Wet water years, thus  eliminating the cost and effort of obtaining and managing the water  bank when natural flows are abundant.", "Changing the method for determining water-year types from a five-tier  system to a more incrementally adjustable method that would cause less  dramatic changes in flow requirements, thus addressing one of the  concerns raised by stakeholders.

Over the last three  years, Reclamation has demonstrated commitment and resourcefulness in  this task, particularly under drought conditions, by implementing and  meeting the obligations of the temporary water bank. However, whether  Reclamation can continue meeting its water bank obligation using current  methods is unclear, given the uncertain results of crop idling and the  unknown sustainability of groundwater pumping. This uncertainty adds  urgency to Reclamation and stakeholder efforts to collaboratively identify  and evaluate long-term solutions. In the mean time, because the water bank  acts as the primary mechanism for balancing competing demands for  water, Reclamation must be able to clearly communicate to stakeholders  how the water bank is managed and how water is accounted for.
