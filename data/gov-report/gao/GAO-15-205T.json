A key component of this responsibility is ensuring that security-related information is collected, analyzed, and shared effectively across all modes, including rail. In 2008, TSA issued a regulation requiring U.S. passenger rail agencies to report all potential threats and significant security concerns to TSA, among other things.", "This testimony addresses the extent to which TSA has (1) developed systematic processes for integrating stakeholder feedback about security-related information it provides and analyzing trends in reported rail security incidents and (2) ensured consistent implementation of rail security incident reporting requirements. This statement is based on related GAO reports issued in June 2014 and December 2012, including selected updates on TSA's efforts to implement GAO's prior recommendations related to rail security and information sharing. For the selected updates, GAO reviewed related documentation, including tools TSA developed to provide oversight. GAO also interviewed TSA officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In June 2014, GAO found that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) did not have a systematic process for incorporating stakeholder feedback to improve security-related information sharing and recommended that TSA systematically document and incorporate stakeholder feedback. TSA concurred with this recommendation and, in April 2015, TSA developed a standard operating procedure to help ensure proper evaluation and consideration of all feedback TSA receives. In December 2012, GAO found TSA had made limited use of the rail security incident information it had collected from rail agencies, in part because it did not have a systematic process for conducting trend analysis. TSA's purpose for collecting this information was to allow TSA to \"connect the dots\" through trend analysis. However, the incident information provided to rail agencies by TSA was generally limited to descriptions of specific incidents. As a result, officials from passenger rail agencies GAO spoke with reported that they generally found little value in TSA's incident reporting requirement. On the basis of these findings, GAO recommended that TSA establish a systematic process for regularly conducting trend analysis of the rail security incident data. Although GAO has not assessed the effectiveness of TSA's efforts, by August 2013, TSA had developed a new analysis capability that, among other things, produces Trend Analysis Reports from the incident data.", "In December 2012, GAO found that TSA had not provided consistent oversight of its rail security reporting requirement, which led to variation in the types and number of passenger rail security incidents reported. Specifically, GAO found that TSA headquarters had not provided guidance to local TSA inspection officials, the primary TSA points of contact for rail agencies, about the types of rail security incidents that must be reported, which contributed to inconsistent interpretation of the regulation. The variation in reporting was compounded by inconsistencies in compliance inspections and enforcement actions, in part because of limited utilization of oversight mechanisms at the headquarters level. GAO also found that TSA's incident management data system, WebEOC, had incomplete information, was prone to data entry errors, and had other limitations that inhibited TSA's ability to search and extract basic information. On the basis of these findings, GAO recommended that TSA (1) develop and disseminate written guidance on the types of incidents that should be reported, (2) enhance existing oversight mechanisms for compliance inspections and enforcement actions, (3) establish a process for updating WebEOC with previously unreported incidents, and (4) develop guidance to reduce data entry errors. TSA concurred with these recommendations and has taken actions to implement them. Specifically, in September 2013, TSA disseminated written guidance to local TSA inspection officials and passenger and freight rail agencies that provides clarification about the rail security incident reporting requirement. In August 2013, TSA enhanced existing oversight mechanisms by creating an inspection review mechanism, among other things. TSA also established a process for updating WebEOC in March 2013, and in October 2014, officials reported that they have updated the guidance used by officials responsible for entering incident data to reduce data entry errors associated with incident types. Although GAO has not assessed the effectiveness of these efforts, they address the intent of the recommendations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making no new recommendations in this statement."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to participate in today\u2019s hearing to discuss our  work related to the Transportation Security Administration\u2019s (TSA) efforts  to secure the U.S. surface transportation system, particularly those  associated with passenger and freight rail. The transportation system\u2019s  size and importance to the country\u2019s safety, security, and economic well- being make it an attractive target for terrorists. As shown by the active  shooter incident that occurred on a train traveling from Amsterdam to  Paris on August 21, 2015, rail systems are inherently vulnerable to attack  in part because they rely on an open architecture that is difficult to  monitor and secure because of its multiple access points; hubs serving  multiple carriers; and, in some cases, lack of barriers to access. One of  the critical challenges facing rail system operators\u2014and the federal  agencies that regulate and oversee them\u2014is finding ways to protect rail  systems from potential terrorist attacks without compromising the  accessibility and efficiency of rail travel.", "Within the federal government, TSA\u2014a component of the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS)\u2014is the primary federal agency responsible for  security in all modes of transportation, including aviation, passenger and  freight rail, highway and motor carrier, maritime, and pipeline. A key  component of this responsibility is ensuring that information related to  transportation security and potential threats across all modes is collected,  analyzed, and shared effectively. Disrupted terrorist attacks in recent  years, such as the April 2013 disruption of a planned attack on a  passenger train operating between Toronto and New York City, highlight  the importance of reporting and sharing security-related information.  TSA\u2019s other responsibilities, however, vary by transportation mode.  Specifically, TSA has a direct role in ensuring the security of the aviation  mode through its management of a passenger and baggage screener  workforce that inspects individuals and their property to deter and prevent  an act of violence or air piracy. In contrast, TSA\u2019s responsibilities for  securing surface transportation systems such as passenger and freight  rail systems have primarily included developing national strategies,  establishing security standards, and conducting assessments and  inspections of surface transportation modes, while public and private  sector transportation operators are responsible for implementing security  measures for their systems. TSA\u2019s annual budget further highlights the  difference between TSA\u2019s roles in securing the aviation and surface  transportation modes. For example, the DHS Appropriations Act, 2015,  enacted March 4, 2015, appropriated $123,749,000 for surface  transportation security compared with $5,639,095,000 for aviation  security.", "My statement today addresses the extent to which TSA has (1)  developed systematic processes for integrating stakeholder feedback  about security-related information provided by the agency and analyzing  trends in reported rail security incidents and (2) ensured consistent  implementation of rail security incident reporting requirements. This  statement is based on related GAO reports issued in December 2012 and  June 2014, including selected updates on TSA\u2019s efforts to implement our  prior recommendations related to information sharing and rail security.  To conduct our earlier work, among other things, we conducted a survey  of 481 transportation stakeholders, including freight and passenger rail  stakeholders, from November 2013 through January 2014, regarding their  satisfaction with TSA\u2019s sharing of security-related information. We  received responses from 337 stakeholders (a 70 percent response rate).  We also reviewed TSA policy documents and guidance on rail security  reporting requirements, and passenger rail security incident data from  January 2011 through June 2012. The reports cited in this statement  provide detailed information about our scope and methodology. For the  selected updates, we reviewed related documentation and interviewed  TSA officials on TSA\u2019s progress in addressing our recommendations. This  documentation includes tools TSA developed to provide oversight of the  rail security incident reporting process, guidance for TSA inspectors and  rail agencies, and updates to TSA\u2019s data management system, among  other things. The work upon which this statement is based was conducted  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of  2007 (9/11 Commission Act) directed DHS to create a plan for sharing  transportation security\u2013related information among public and private  entities that have a stake in protecting the nation\u2019s transportation system,  including passenger and freight rail. This plan\u2014first issued in July 2008\u2014 is now called the Transportation Security Information Sharing  Environment (TSISE). The TSISE describes, among other things, the  information\u2013sharing process. TSA disseminates security information  through several information products, including reports, assessments,  and briefings, among others. These products are distributed through  mechanisms including the Homeland Security Information Network and  mechanisms sponsored by industry, such as the Association of American  Railroads\u2019 Railway Alert Network, among others.", "TSA is also specifically responsible for receiving, assessing, and  distributing intelligence information related to potential threats and  significant security concerns (rail security incidents) related to the nation\u2019s  rail system. Specifically, in 2008, TSA issued a regulation requiring U.S.  rail systems to report all rail security incidents to TSA\u2019s Transportation  Security Operations Center (TSOC), among other things. The TSOC is  an operations center open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, that serves as  TSA\u2019s main point of contact for monitoring security\u2013related incidents or  crises in all modes of transportation. The regulation also authorizes TSA  officials to view, inspect, and copy rail agencies\u2019 records as necessary to  enforce the rail security incident reporting requirements. This regulation  is supported by TSA policies and guidance, including the Transportation  Security Inspector Inspections Handbook, the National Investigations and  Enforcement Manual, and the Compliance Work Plan for Transportation  Security Inspectors. TSA\u2019s regulation is intended to provide the agency  with essential information on rail security incidents so that TSA can  conduct comprehensive intelligence analysis, threat assessment, and  allocation of security resources, among other things. According to the  regulation, potential threats and significant security concerns that must be  reported to the TSOC include bomb threats, suspicious items, or  indications of tampering with rail cars, among others.", "Within TSA, different offices are responsible for sharing transportation  security\u2013related information and for implementing and enforcing the rail  security incident reporting requirement. For instance, TSA\u2019s Office of  Security Policy and Industry Engagement (OSPIE) is the primary point of  contact for sharing information with private sector stakeholders, and is  responsible for using incident reports and analyses, among other things,  to develop strategies, policies, and programs for rail security, including  operational security activities, training exercises, public awareness, and  technology. TSA\u2019s Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA) receives  intelligence information regarding threats to transportation and designs  intelligence products intended for officials in TSA, other parts of the  federal government, state and local officials, and industry officials,  including rail agency security coordinators and law enforcement officials.", "The TSOC, managed by TSA\u2019s Office of Law Enforcement/Federal Air  Marshal Service, is the TSA entity primarily responsible for collecting and  disseminating information about rail security incidents. Once notified of a  rail security incident, TSOC officials are responsible for inputting the  incident information into their incident management database known as  WebEOC, and for disseminating incident reports that they deem high  priority or significant to selected TSA officials; other federal, state, and  local government officials; and selected rail agencies\u2019 law enforcement  officials. Figure 1 shows the intended steps and responsibilities of TSA  components involved in the rail security incident reporting process.", "TSA\u2019s Office of Security Operations (OSO) is responsible for overseeing  and enforcing the incident reporting requirement. Responsible for  managing TSA\u2019s inspection program for the aviation and surface modes  of transportation, the Office of Security Operations\u2019 Surface Compliance  Branch deploys approximately 270 transportation security inspectors\u2013 surface (TSI-S) nationwide. The TSI-Ss are responsible for, among  other things, providing clarification to rail agencies regarding the incident  reporting process and for overseeing rail agencies\u2019 compliance with the  reporting requirement by conducting inspections to ensure that incidents  were properly reported to the TSOC. Six regional security inspectors\u2013 surface (RSI-S) within the Compliance Programs Division are responsible  for providing national oversight of local surface inspection, assessment,  and operational activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Has Developed Processes Designed to Integrate Stakeholder Feedback and Address Gaps in Trend Analysis", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "TSA Has Developed a Process Designed to Incorporate Feedback on Security-Related Information", "paragraphs": ["In June 2014, we found that TSA had some mechanisms in place to  collect stakeholder feedback on the products it disseminates containing  security-related information and had initiated efforts to improve how it  obtains customer feedback, but had not developed a systematic process  for collecting and integrating such feedback. Specifically, in February  2014, TSA reconvened its Information Sharing Integrated Project Team  (IPT), whose charter included, among other things, milestones and time  frames for developing a centralized management framework to capture  stakeholder satisfaction survey data on all of TSA\u2019s security-related  products and the systems used to distribute these products. However,  at the time of our June 2014 report, the IPT Charter did not specify how  TSA planned to systematically collect, document, and incorporate  informal feedback\u2014a key mechanism used by the majority of the  stakeholders we surveyed, and a mechanism TSA officials told us they  utilize to improve information sharing. For instance, the rail industry  provided TSA with a list of areas for emphasis in intelligence analysis in  December 2012, and TSA subsequently initiated a product line focusing  on indications and warnings associated with disrupted or successful  terrorist attacks. TSA officials stated that they further refined one of the  products as a result of a stakeholder requesting information on tactics  used in foreign rail attacks. In 2013, one TSA component built a system to  track informal information sharing with stakeholders at meetings and  conferences, and through e-mail, but TSA officials stated that the data  were not used for operational purposes, and TSA had no plans to  incorporate this system into its centralized management framework  because the IPT had decided to focus its initial efforts on developing a  survey mechanism.", "According to our June 2014 survey results, surface transportation  stakeholders were generally satisfied with TSA\u2019s security-related products  and the mechanisms used to disseminate them. In particular, 63 percent  of rail stakeholders (70 of 111) reported that they were satisfied with the  products they received in 2013, and 54 percent (59 of 110) reported that  they were satisfied with security-related information sharing  mechanisms. However, because TSA lacked specific plans and  documentation related to improving its efforts to incorporate all of its  stakeholder feedback, it was unclear how, or if, TSA planned to use  stakeholder feedback to improve information sharing. As a result of these  findings, we recommended that TSA include in its planned customer  feedback framework a systematic process to document informal  feedback, and how it incorporates all of the feedback TSA receives, both  formal and informal. TSA concurred, and in response, by April 2015, had  taken actions to develop these processes. Specifically, TSA developed a  standard operating procedure to organize how its offices solicit, receive,  respond to, and document both formal and informal customer feedback  on its information-sharing efforts, which delineates a systematic process  for doing so. TSA also developed a TSA-wide standard survey for its  offices to use to obtain formal and informal feedback on specific products,  and created an information-sharing e-mail inbox to which all survey  responses will be sent, evaluated, and distributed to the appropriate office  for action. We have not evaluated these actions, but if implemented  effectively, we believe that TSA will now be better positioned to meet  stakeholder needs for security-related information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Efforts Should Help Address Gaps in Conducting Trend Analysis of Rail Security Incident Information", "paragraphs": ["In December 2012, we found TSA had made limited use of the rail  security incident information it had collected from rail agencies, in part  because it did not have a systematic process for conducting trend  analysis.

However, the incident information provided to rail agencies by  TSA was generally limited to descriptions of specific incidents with  minimal accompanying analysis. As a result, officials from passenger rail  agencies we spoke with generally found little value in TSA\u2019s incident  reporting process, because it was unclear to them how, if at all, the  information was being used by TSA to identify trends or threats that could  help TSA and rail agencies develop appropriate security measures.  However, as we reported in December 2012, opportunities for more  sophisticated trend analysis existed. For example, the freight industry,  through the Railway Alert Network\u2014which is managed by the Association  of American Railroads, a rail industry group\u2014identified a trend where  individuals were reportedly impersonating federal officials. In coordination  with TSA, the Railway Alert Network subsequently issued guidance to its  member organizations designed to increase awareness of this trend  among freight rail employees and provide descriptive information on steps  to take in response. The Railway Alert Network identified this trend  through analysis of incident reporting from multiple freight railroads. In  each case, the incident had been reported by a railroad employee and  was contained in TSA\u2019s incident management system, WebEOC.", "On the basis of these findings, in December 2012, we recommended that  TSA establish a systematic process for regularly conducting trend  analysis of the rail security incident data, in an effort to identify potential  security trends that could help the agency anticipate or prevent an attack  against passenger rail and develop recommended security measures.  TSA concurred with this recommendation and by August 2013 had  developed a new capability for identifying trends in the rail security  incident data, known as the Surface Compliance Trend Analysis Network  (SCAN). SCAN is designed to identify linkages between incidents  captured in various sources of data, assemble detailed information about  these incidents, and accurately analyze the data to enhance the agency\u2019s  ability to detect impending threats. According to TSA officials, SCAN  consists of three elements: two OSO surface detailees located at TSOC,  enhanced IT capabilities, and a new rail security incident analysis product  for stakeholders. According to TSA, one of the key functions of the  surface detailees is to continuously look for trends and patterns in the rail  security incident data that are reported to TSOC, and to coordinate with  OSPIE and OIA to conduct further investigations into potential trends. As I  will discuss later in this statement, TSA has also made improvements to  WebEOC, including steps to improve the completeness and accuracy of  the data and the ability to produce basic summary reports, which we  believe should facilitate this type of continuous trend analysis.", "TSA generates a Trend Analysis Report for any potential security trends  the surface detailees identify from the rail security incident data. The  Trend Analysis Report integrates incident information from WebEOC with  information from multiple other sources, including TSA\u2019s compliance  database and media reports, and provides rail agencies and other  stakeholders with analysis of possible security issues that could affect  operations as a result of these trends. According to TSA officials, since  SCAN was established, approximately 13 Trend Analysis Reports have  been produced and disseminated to local TSA inspection officials and rail  agencies. Although we have not assessed the effectiveness of these  efforts to better utilize rail security information, we believe these actions  address the intent of our recommendation. Further, if implemented  effectively, they should better position TSA to provide valuable analysis  on rail security incidents and to develop recommended security measures  for rail agencies, as appropriate."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "TSA Has Taken Steps to Improve Consistent Implementation of the Rail Security Incident Reporting Process", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "TSA Has Taken Steps to Improve the Consistency of the Rail Security Incident Reporting Process", "paragraphs": ["In December 2012, we found that TSA had not provided consistent  oversight of the implementation of the rail security reporting requirement,  which led to considerable variation in the types and number of passenger  rail security incidents reported. Specifically, we found that TSA  headquarters had not provided guidance to local TSA inspection officials,  the primary TSA points of contact for rail agencies, about the types of rail  security incidents that must be reported, a fact that contributed to  inconsistent interpretation of the regulation by local TSA inspection  officials. While some variation was expected in the number of rail  security incidents that rail agencies reported because of differences in  agency size, geographic location, and ridership, passenger rail agencies  we spoke with at the time reported receiving inconsistent feedback from  their local TSA officials regarding certain types of incidents, such as those  involving weapons. As a result, we found that, for 7 of the 19 passenger  rail agencies included in our review, the number of incidents reported per  million riders ranged from 0.25 to 23.15.", "This variation we identified was compounded by inconsistencies in  compliance inspections and enforcement actions, in part because of  limited utilization of oversight mechanisms at the headquarters level. For  example, in December 2012, we found that TSA established the RSI-S  position as a primary oversight mechanism at the headquarters level for  monitoring rail security compliance inspections and enforcement actions  to help ensure consistency across field offices. However, at the time of  our report, the RSI-S was not part of the formal inspection process and  had no authority to ensure that inspections were conducted consistently.  We also found that the RSI-S had limited visibility over when and where  inspections were completed or enforcement actions were taken because  TSA lacked a process to systematically provide the RSI-S with this  information during the course of normal operations. As a result, our  analysis of inspection data from January 1, 2011, through June 30, 2012,  showed that average monthly inspections for the 19 rail agencies in our  review ranged from about eight inspections to no inspections, and there  was variation in the regularity with which inspections occurred. We also  found that TSA inconsistently applied enforcement actions against  passenger rail agencies for not complying with the reporting requirement.  For example, TSA took enforcement action against an agency for not  reporting an incident involving a knife, but did not take action against  another agency for not reporting similar incidents, despite having been  inspected.", "On the basis of these findings, in December 2012, we recommended that  TSA: (1) develop and disseminate written guidance for local TSA  inspection officials and rail agencies that clarifies the types of incidents  that should be reported to the TSOC and (2) enhance and utilize existing  oversight mechanisms at the headquarters level, as intended, to provide  management oversight of local compliance inspections and enforcement  actions. TSA concurred with both of these recommendations and has  taken actions to implement them. Specifically, in September 2013, TSA  disseminated written guidance to local TSA inspection officials and  passenger and freight rail agencies that provides clarification about the  requirements of the rail security incident reporting process. This guidance  includes examples and descriptions of the types of incidents that should  be reported under the regulatory criteria, as well as details about the type  of information that should be included in the incident report provided to  the TSOC. Further, as of August 2013, TSA had established an RSI- dashboard report that provides weekly, monthly, and quarterly information  about the number of inspection reports that have been reviewed,  accepted, and rejected. According to TSA officials, this helps ensure that  rail agencies are inspected regularly, by providing the RSI-Ss with greater  insight into inspection activities. TSA has also enhanced the utilization of  the RSI-Ss by providing them with the ability to review both passenger  and freight rail inspections before the inspection reports are finalized and  enforcement action is taken. According to TSA officials, this allows the  RSI-Ss to ensure that enforcement actions are applied consistently by  local TSA inspection officials. TSA also developed a mechanism for  tracking the recommendations RSI-Ss make to local TSA inspection  officials regarding changes to local compliance inspections, as well as  any actions that are taken in response. Collectively, we believe that these  changes should allow the RSI-Ss to provide better management oversight  of passenger and freight rail regulatory inspections and enforcement  actions, though we have not assessed whether they have done so. We  also believe these actions, if implemented effectively, will help ensure that  the rail security incident reporting process is consistently implemented  and enforced, and will address the intent of our recommendations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Has Taken Steps to Improve the Accuracy and Completeness of Incident Data", "paragraphs": ["In December 2012, we also found that TSA\u2019s incident management data  system, known as WebEOC, had incomplete information, was prone to  data entry errors, and had other limitations that inhibited TSA\u2019s ability to  search and extract basic information. These weaknesses in WebEOC  hindered TSA\u2019s ability to use rail security incident data to identify security  trends or potential threats. Specifically, at the time of our 2012 report,  TSA did not have an established process for ensuring that WebEOC was  updated to include information about rail security incidents that had not  been properly reported to the TSOC. As a result, of the 18 findings of  noncompliance we reviewed that were a result of failure to report an  incident, 13 were never entered into WebEOC, and consequently could  not be used by TSA to identify potential security trends. In addition, in  December 2012, we found that TSA\u2019s guidance for officials responsible  for entering incident data was insufficient, a fact that may have  contributed to data entry errors in key fields, including the incident type  and the mode of transportation (such as mass transit or freight rail). At the  time of our report, because of data errors and technical limitations in  WebEOC, TSA also could not provide us with basic summary information  about the rail security incident data contained in WebEOC, such as the  number of incidents reported by incident type (e.g., suspicious item or  bomb threat), by a particular rail agency, or the total number of rail  security incidents that have been reported to the TSOC. Without the  ability to identify this information on the number of incidents by type or the  total number of incidents, we concluded that TSA faced challenges  determining if patterns or trends exist in the data, as the reporting system  was intended to do.", "On the basis of these findings, in December 2012 we recommended that  TSA (1) establish a process for updating WebEOC when incidents that  had not previously been reported are discovered through compliance  activities, and (2) develop guidance for TSOC officials that includes  definitions of data entry options to reduce errors resulting from data entry  problems. TSA concurred with both of these recommendations and has  taken actions to implement them. Specifically, in March 2013, TSA  established a process for the surface detailee position, discussed earlier  in this statement, to update WebEOC when previously unreported  incidents are discovered through compliance activities. Additionally, in  October 2014, TSA officials reported they have updated the guidance  used by TSOC officials responsible for entering incident data into  WebEOC to include definitions of incident types. TSA has also made  changes to WebEOC that will allow for officials to search for basic  information, such as the total number of certain types of incidents,  required to facilitate analysis. We have not reevaluated the data  contained in WebEOC, but we believe that the changes TSA has made  should allow the agency to conduct continuous analysis of the rail security  incident data to identify potential trends. We believe these actions  address the intent of our recommendations and, if implemented  effectively, should improve the accuracy and completeness of the incident  data in WebEOC. This should provide TSA with a more comprehensive  picture of security incidents as well as allow it to better identify any trends  or patterns.", "Chairmen Katko and King, Ranking Members Rice and Higgins, and  members of the subcommittees this concludes my prepared statement.
