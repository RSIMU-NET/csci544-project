DOE considers a range of factors to determine whether each application is in the public interest. After the first application was conditionally approved in 2011, DOE commissioned a study to help it determine whether additional LNG exports were in the public interest.

This increase has helped reduce natural gas prices in the  United States, although prices remain significantly higher overseas. To  take advantage of overseas prices, energy companies have applied to the  federal government for permission to export natural gas. Natural gas, like  crude oil, requires federal approval before it can be exported. To  transport natural gas by ship, the natural gas is cooled to a liquid state  called liquefied natural gas (LNG). This cooling process requires  expensive processing and liquefaction facilities that do not currently exist  in the contiguous United States.", "The Department of Energy (DOE) and Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission (FERC) are two federal agencies with primary responsibility  for approving LNG exports.

In this report, we discuss non-FTA  applications that require a public interest review. FERC is responsible for  authorizing the construction and operation of facilities located onshore or  within state waters that liquefy natural gas and load the LNG onto ships  for export. FERC conducts an environmental review of the facility to help  with this decision. Until May 2014, DOE granted approvals\u2014known as  conditional approvals\u2014on the condition that FERC completed a  satisfactory environmental review of the associated export facility.

In  addition to four onshore import terminals that were already operational,  natural gas companies built five LNG onshore import facilities in the latter  half of the 2000s to meet the expected need for natural gas imports.  However, technology enhancements improved the extraction of natural  gas from shale formations and resulted in a dramatic increase in domestic  natural gas production. These technology enhancements allow  companies to extract natural gas from shale formations that were  previously considered to be inaccessible because traditional techniques  did not yield sufficient amounts for economically viable production.  According to Energy Information Administration (EIA) data, between  2007 and 2013, domestic natural gas withdrawals increased by 22  percent, driven primarily by increased withdrawals from shale  formations. According to EIA, increases in natural gas supplies  generally cause prices to drop. Specifically, between 2007 and 2013, the  price of natural gas in the United States decreased by nearly 50  percent. As the price of natural gas in the United States declined, prices  in Europe and Asia remained considerably higher. In July 2014, FERC  estimated that prices of LNG imported to Europe and Asia during August  of 2014 would be about 100 and 250 percent higher than prices in the  United States, respectively.
