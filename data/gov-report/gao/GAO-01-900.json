However, fine collection rates for both organizations improved after they changed their fine imposition practices. SEC has begun to collect data that would allow it to analyze securities sanctions throughout the industry. Similarly, CFTC has begun to document the results of its review of industrywide futures sanctions. Both SEC and CFTC have reviewed the extent to which their respective SROs maintain automated fine collection records. FMS' efforts to collect SEC's fines have been hampered by SEC's delays in approving compromise offers, delays by SEC's Commissioners in responding to FMS' requests for more timely action, and by SEC's failure thus far to adopt the regulations it needs to again submit its fines to the Treasury Offset Program to benefit from the associated collection opportunities. Although CFTC has only recently begun submitting fines to FMS for collection, concerns about the timeliness of these submissions already exist. The agency's Inspector General staff has recommended steps to ensure that CFTC fines are submitted more timely to FMS, but these steps have yet to be implemented. Weaknesses in procedures for ensuring that CFTC submits all needed information to FMS to collect its unpaid fines also appear to have caused further delays in FMS' collection efforts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Levying fines is an important mechanism that regulators use to sanction those who violate securities and futures industry rules.

Two SROs--NASD for the securities industry and NFA for the futures industry--are associations that regulate registered securities and futures firms as well as oversee individuals employed in the securities and futures industries. SEC has enforcement programs and processes for taking actions against violators of federal securities laws, and CFTC has similar programs and processes for taking actions against violators of futures laws. SROs have disciplinary programs through which they can discipline their members for violations of securities and commodity futures laws, agency rules, and their own rules. Once a violation is detected or suspected, agency or SRO staff can investigate the facts of each case. Depending on the circumstances, a case may be adjudicated in a federal court or decided by an administrative body within the agencies or SROs. After a hearing, if the adjudicators determine that a violation occurred, they may levy sanctions against the violators. Also, the agencies or SROs may reach a settlement with the alleged violator before an adjudicatory proceeding takes place, in which both parties agree on the sanctions to be imposed.

The DCIA was passed to maximize collections of delinquent debts owed to the government and minimize the cost of debt collection by consolidating related functions, among other things. Specifically, the DCIA requires federal agencies to refer their receivables that are over 180 days delinquent to FMS. FMS staff attempt to collect referred debts during an initial 30-day period and then transfer any unpaid debts to private collection agencies that make further collection attempts for specified periods, during which time they send any collections to FMS to return to the federal agencies that submitted the debts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Our work focused on fine collections achieved by the respective enforcement and disciplinary programs of SEC, CFTC, and the securities and futures SROs.

In addition, NASD has taken other actions to improve its fine collection activities, including affirming violators\u2019 fine obligations under court orders obtained by SEC and contracting with a private collection agency to assume collection responsibilities for NASD fines. NASD and NFA changed their fine imposition practices to eliminate routinely assessing fines in cases in which violators were being barred from their industries.

NASD established a task force in 1998 to review its policy on the imposition, suspension, and collection of monetary sanctions. This task force considered the purpose of monetary sanctions, particularly remedial fines when a violator is to be barred from the industry, and determined that fines need not be imposed in certain instances in which no widespread customer harm was done and serious wrongdoers had been removed from the industry. In its November 1998 report, the task force suggested that, in lieu of continuing to add fines routinely to sanctions barring individuals from the industry, NASD should add fines in only the most egregious cases. Officials told us that NASD had intended its previous policy of suspending fines until the violators sought reentry into the securities industry to serve as a barrier to keep barred or suspended violators from seeking reentry into the industry.", "In 1999, NASD adopted the task force recommendations and implemented a new sanctioning policy that requires payment of restitution and disgorgement, as well as a fine, in sales practice cases in which (1) widespread, significant, and identifiable customer harm results or (2) the violator has retained substantial ill-gotten gains;   orders restitution and disgorgement in cases in which quantifiable customer harm has been demonstrated or a violator has been unjustly enriched;   does not impose a fine in certain categories of cases (i.e., exam cheating, conversion, and forgery) if an individual is barred; and requires satisfaction of any order of restitution or disgorgement when an individual reenters the securities industry in cases in which there has been no widespread customer harm and the violator has been barred or suspended.", "NASD\u2019s policy continues to consider a violator\u2019s inability to pay when imposing monetary sanctions. According to an NASD official, this policy is consistent with applicable case law. NASD officials told us that when a fine is ordered in addition to an order of restitution and/or disgorgement, NASD\u2019s first priority is to return collected funds to customers under the restitution or disgorgement orders. Only after the restitution or disgorgement has been fully discharged do NASD officials apply collected money toward fine payment."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "NASD Has Initiated Other Changes to Improve Its Fine Collection Capabilities", "paragraphs": ["In addition to changing its sanctioning policy, NASD has also taken two other steps to improve its collection efforts. NASD recently  initiated a program to obtain SEC assistance in obtaining court orders that direct violators owing NASD fines to pay these amounts. In late 1998, NASD contacted SEC to inquire whether SEC could use particular authority under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) to help NASD pursue collection of its fines.  SEC agreed to do so. Section 21(e)(1) of the Exchange Act authorizes SEC to seek court orders that require violators to comply with certain orders issued under the act, which include those orders involving monetary sanctions imposed by SROs, and affirmed by the SEC.  Under the agreement reached between SEC and NASD, SEC requires that the cases meet certain criteria before it will seek these court orders. Specifically, SEC will seek such orders for cases that   have been affirmed by SEC on appeal, require the violator to pay any amount of restitution or a fine of $50,000 or more, and   are less than 5 years old so that they are within the statute of limitations, and the appeal process has been exhausted.", "NASD officials said that one reason for seeking this agreement with SEC was so to obtain federal court orders that would make it easier to pursue collection of fines owed by violators. Between April 1999 and December 31, 2000, NASD submitted over 60 cases to SEC. As of April 30, 2001, SEC had accepted 34 of these cases and had obtained court orders on 11 of the cases, representing fines of over $648,000. By that date, NASD had collected over $22,000 on 3 of the 11 cases, and had forwarded 8 to a private collection agency. In addition, NASD reported receiving about $67,000 on four cases before SEC obtained final court orders.  The remaining 26 cases of the over 60 submitted to SEC, which did not meet SEC\u2019s criteria, were returned to NASD. NASD officials said that they intend to submit the cases to a private collection agency.", "Another improvement NASD made was to contract with a national collection agency to handle all aspects of its collections. In spring 2001, NASD staff finalized a contract with a private organization to pursue outstanding money obligations from NASD-related disciplinary proceedings.

Of the 17 fines due in 2000, 9 were paid in full and 8 are being paid on 1-year payment plans, with balances due by December 31, 2001. NFA officials explained that they use an accrual accounting system, which, under generally accepted accounting principles, allows entities to report amounts as fully earned in the year recorded, regardless of whether they were actually received or remain due as receivables. Therefore, NFA reports fines as fully paid both when they have received full payment and when installment payments are current as of the reporting date.", "NFA\u2019s improved collection rate stems from the change in its fine assessment practices. Previously, NFA levied fines as an additional sanction against violators that it also barred from the futures industry. NFA officials stated that in adding fines to bars, their intent had been to ensure that the violators would remain out of the industry. They said that such fines were also intended to deter other industry participants from violating the rules. They cited our November 1998 report, which pointed out that such fines were seldom, if ever, collected, as influencing their decision to discontinue the practice in all but the most egregious cases. They reasoned that a bar alone would both protect the industry and punish the violators by removing them from the industry and denying them their livelihood.

According to NASD and NFA officials, few individuals that they have barred for violating their rules have ever applied for readmission. NASD officials told us that, as of June 12, 2001, applications for reentry by individuals who had been barred by NASD since they changed their fine imposition policy had not increased. These officials said that they did not believe that their policy change would cause such applications to increase because it is very difficult to obtain approval for reentry after being permanently barred. They also said that other SROs that do not impose fines on barred individuals have not seen many applications for reentry.  The criteria that NASD considers for reentry by barred individuals include the nature and gravity of the disqualifying event, the length of time that has elapsed since the disqualifying event,   whether any intervening misconduct has occurred,   whether the disqualified person has other disciplinary history,   any other mitigating or aggravating circumstances that may exist, the precise nature of the securities-related activities proposed in the  application, and the disciplinary history and industry experience of both the member  firm and the person proposed by the firm to serve as the responsible  supervisor of the disqualified person.", "An official in NFA\u2019s General Counsel\u2019s Office told us that the Commodity Exchange Act, which governs the futures industry, does not specifically contain provisions that would allow a barred individual to seek reentry, nor does it specifically preclude such reapplication. An individual seeking reentry would have to present evidence of mitigating facts or circumstances relating to the conduct that led to the individual\u2019s being barred as well as evidence of rehabilitation since the conduct occurred.The NFA official also could not recall anyone being allowed to reenter and stated that such applications would be held to strict standards. Both NASD and NFA officials also pointed out that under their new practices, individuals who had committed violations that resulted in considerable customer losses would still have to pay disgorgement and restitution monies before they could reenter either industry.", "Both SEC and CFTC officials have a role in reviewing applications for persons seeking readmission into the securities and futures industries. SEC officials told us that Rule 19h-1 under the Securities Exchange Act requires SROs to submit applications of persons subject to statutory disqualification for readmission into SEC.  These applications are then reviewed by staff in the Chief Counsel\u2019s Office within SEC\u2019s Division of Market Regulation.  SEC has the authority to deny the applications of such persons.

This group meets quarterly to discuss various issues of mutual interest, including the review of applications of persons seeking entry or readmission into the futures industry.

The report stated that a fine should be set significantly higher than the amount of ill-gotten gains resulting from violative activity in order to serve as a deterrent to such future activity. In another SRO inspection report, SEC examiners cited the imposition of disparate fines of $1,000 and $10,000 in two separate, but similar, cases involving failure to disclose criminal information.

According to the FMS official, the age of the SEC\u2019s debts further reduces their collectibility compared with the smaller, more recent debts referred by other agencies.", "FMS officials stated that the low collection rate is the fault of neither the agency nor FMS but is due to the nature of the cases themselves. Both SEC and FMS officials told us that, in some cases, by the time a debt has been referred to FMS, the debtors are either in jail or their assets have already been stripped and there is no way to collect. According to FMS records on the status of debts, in 6 of the 25 SEC cases, totaling almost $600,000, debtors had no assets or were no longer in business. However, in 11 of the 25 cases, totaling almost $2.7 million, collection agents have been unable to locate and initiate contact with the debtors to attempt to collect the fines. The remaining eight cases represented a variety of dispositions, including those returned to SEC as uncollectible. SEC officials also pointed out that SEC fines represent rulings against violators who have already proved unwilling to pay, despite being ordered to do so by a judge. In contrast, other debts referred to FMS involve such government debts as delinquent loans. According to an SEC official who oversees collection efforts, FMS\u2019 lack of success in collecting SEC fines underscores the thoroughness of SEC\u2019s own collection efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Timely Action on Compromise Offers May Have Hampered Collections", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the characteristics that make SEC fines difficult to collect, SEC\u2019s slow responses to compromise offers have also exacerbated FMS\u2019 low collection rate on these fines. In some cases, an agency and a debtor may reach an agreement, called a compromise offer, in which the agency agrees to discharge a debt by accepting less than the full fine amount. Private collection agencies under contract to FMS usually negotiate compromise offers with individual debtors. A compromise offer can also result if the collection agency negotiates an agreement under which the debtor would pay his or her total debt or some lesser amount in installments, rather than in one lump sum. Once an offer to pay a lesser amount or installment payments over an extended time period has been negotiated, a collection agency then sends the compromise offer to FMS. Although some FMS collection agreements with federal agencies stipulate that FMS can unilaterally accept compromise offers above certain dollar amounts or percentages of the originally owed amount, SEC\u2019s agreement requires FMS to send all compromise offers to the agency for approval. Because SEC was one of the original agencies with which FMS agreed to perform collection services, the agreement between the two agencies did not provide broad authority for FMS to accept compromise offers on SEC\u2019s behalf.", "However, SEC has not always made timely responses to compromise offers presented by FMS, which may have worsened FMS\u2019 chances of collecting the amounts offered in those compromises. FMS officials told us that during the time the offers were awaiting SEC approval, some violators\u2019 assets diminished to the point that the debtors were no longer able to pay the agreed amount. As a result, money that could have been collected was not. According to FMS officials, SEC has kept compromise offers for long periods before responding. For instance, according to data provided by SEC and FMS, three cases that SEC approved in March 2001 had spent from 42 to 327 days awaiting SEC decisions. An FMS official said that, by the time the cases had been approved, the debtors no longer had the money to pay the amounts in the agreements. As of mid-June 2001, FMS had not received any payments on these compromise offers, which totaled almost $250,000. The FMS official responsible for overseeing these offers stated that the likelihood of nonpayment increases with the passage of time, because assets can be depleted during the time that SEC is considering its decision.", "SEC officials acknowledged that there had been delays in responding to FMS.  In the case that took 327 days to review, SEC officials explained that they attempted to contact the regional office staff who originally investigated the case to discuss the compromise offer, but these staff had left the agency.  The officials said that because the compromise offer involved repayments over a 16-year period, obtaining the investigating staff\u2019s opinion was considered important to ensure that the fine remained meaningful.  However, in some cases, the SEC staff said that not all of the information that SEC needed to review the compromise offers, such as the violators\u2019 financial statements, were included with FMS requests for action.  In such cases, a few days were added to the time that SEC spent reviewing the offers because SEC staff had to request this information from FMS before they could conduct their reviews.  An FMS official explained that because FMS had not required its private collection agencies to obtain violators\u2019 financial statements, FMS staff had to request these documents on SEC\u2019s behalf.  However, beginning October 2001, all collection agencies with which FMS contracts will be required to obtain such statements in addition to the currently required credit bureau reports.", "FMS and SEC officials told us they have been working together to reduce the delays in approving compromise offers.  At a meeting in April 2001, FMS officials informed SEC staff that the DCIA gives FMS the authority to act on behalf of other agencies to approve compromise offers. They stated that a clause to that effect is now routinely part of its standard agreement with other federal agencies, although such a clause was not included in the SEC/FMS agreement.  On April 20, 2001, FMS sent SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement a letter proposing that, unless such action is otherwise prohibited by SEC\u2019s governing statute, the FMS/SEC agreement be amended to state that FMS is authorized to act on SEC\u2019s behalf to approve compromise offers if SEC has not responded after 30 days. SEC staff are considering the Commission\u2019s legal authority to delegate to an external agency the authority to compromise a judgment debt.", "SEC staff said that they are currently making improvements to their procedures for processing compromise offers submitted by FMS. They stated that they have changed their process to include using a standardized format and new tracking system to ensure that compromise agreements are on track for response within 30 days of receipt.  According to the information they provided, the compromise offer that FMS most recently sent to SEC took the shortest amount of time--42 days\u2014for SEC to review.

In addition to its other collection efforts, FMS also uses the Treasury Offset Program (TOP) to attempt to obtain monies owed to federal agencies. This program is designed to (1) identify any federal government payments, such as tax refunds, due to an individual or entity with an outstanding government debt and (2) apply them toward repayment of the outstanding government debt. The collection agreement between FMS and SEC stated that FMS could use TOP to collect SEC debts after consulting with and obtaining the concurrence of SEC officials. FMS has collected some money on SEC- ordered disgorgements through TOP and had also routinely put SEC fines into the program.   However, SEC officials said that they did not believe that their existing offset regulations provided sufficient authority to allow FMS to obtain collections on fines owed to SEC through TOP.  In addition, they did not believe that they had ever formally concurred with FMS\u2019 submission of SEC fines into TOP.  In April 2001, SEC officials asked FMS to withdraw all outstanding fines from the program until the SEC staff had completed steps to comply with the DCIA, including addressing additional requirements arising from November 2000 amendments. This legislation requires agencies to first adopt regulations that address collecting fines by administrative offset before using TOP for collection.

CFTC signed a letter of agreement with FMS on August 27, 1999, authorizing FMS to provide debt collection services on its behalf for its delinquent debts. On September 29, 2000, CFTC referred its first 13 fine cases to FMS totaling $3.2 million, followed in November by 2 more cases totaling over $200,000. According to FMS officials, as of December 31, 2000, FMS had not yet made any collections on the 15 cases. The FMS officials also stated that they have not had the referrals for a sufficient period of time to make collections, and they do not have enough experience with CFTC referrals yet to comment on the cases.", "However, FMS collections on CFTC fine cases may be reduced if the referrals are not timely. According to a report prepared by the CFTC Inspector General, CFTC staff does not refer cases to FMS as soon as they are eligible. This internal audit report, which examined the agency\u2019s civil monetary penalty collections, reviewed data collected through February 1, 2001. According to the report, the auditors found 12 eligible cases totaling over $17 million that had not yet been sent to FMS. Of these, 11 cases were eligible to have been sent with the first batch of cases in September 2000, and 1 case was eligible to have been sent with the second batch in November 2000. The report recommended that CFTC refer cases to FMS at least monthly. As previously stated in this report, the longer cases wait for collection, the lower the likelihood that they will be collected. Therefore, CFTC\u2019s delays in referring cases are likely to reduce FMS collections. CFTC officials stated that since February 2001, they have sent 15 more penalties to FMS including 11 of the 12 cases previously discussed.  They expect to refer the 12th case to FMS soon. Also, rather than waiting for fines to be delinquent 180 days, CFTC officials said they have begun to refer cases to FMS as soon as the required debtor notification periods are complete.", "Weaknesses in CFTC\u2019s procedures for submitting fines to FMS may reduce FMS collections. According to CFTC officials, although the agency\u2019s staff recently submitted additional fines to FMS, their written procedures have not been updated to address referrals to FMS. In addition, one fine submission to FMS was delayed because of inadequate communication between the CFTC\u2019s Division of Trading and Markets and its Division of Enforcement. According to the CFTC Inspector General report, this communication problem resulted in one fine of over $7 million not being referred for more than 2 years. CFTC staff stated that the agency is also taking steps to use other information sources for violator addresses. CFTC is currently awaiting Treasury instructions for obtaining addresses from Internal Revenue Service records. In commenting on this report, CFTC noted that the Commission is revising its internal instructions to ensure that cases are referred to FMS within 180 days of becoming delinquent, and that the Division of Enforcement provides all of the necessary information to make such referrals."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["On the basis of the data we obtained, collection rates at SEC, CFTC, and the nine securities and futures SROs were generally comparable to, or higher than, their rates from our previous review. In addition, NASD and NFA, which previously had the lowest collection rates, changed their fine imposition practices and, therefore, their collection rates greatly improved.", "However, whether the actions NASD and NFA have taken will affect the number of formerly barred individuals seeking and gaining reentry into the securities or futures industries is unknown. Previously, these SROs would levy fines in addition to barring individuals from their respective industries for rule or law violations. These fines, though seldom collected, served as a potential barrier to individuals applying for readmission into their industries. The subsequent decisions by NASD and NFA to generally discontinue levying fines when barring individuals appear to have improved these SROs\u2019 fine collection rates. However, because certain barred violators no longer face the prospect of paying off a fine before reentering these industries, they may be more willing to seek readmission. NASD and NFA officials indicated that to prevent readmission of unsuitable individuals to either industry, they would continue to apply stringent criteria to any readmission applications. SEC and CFTC staff also review readmission applications when they are received from the SROs and could, as part of their periodic reviews of SRO operations, ensure that changes in NASD\u2019s and NFA\u2019s fine imposition practices do not result in any unintended consequences, such as inappropriate readmissions.", "Although the fines that SEC refers to FMS may be difficult to collect, various weaknesses also appear to have hampered FMS\u2019 efforts to collect fines on SEC\u2019s behalf. Delays in the approval of compromise offers appear to have resulted in lost opportunities to collect monies. Also, SEC has not yet adopted the regulations it needs to again submit its fines to TOP to benefit from the associated collection opportunities. Resolution of these issues would likely lead to an improvement in FMS\u2019 ability to collect fines on SEC\u2019s behalf.", "Finally, although CFTC has only recently begun submitting fines to FMS for collection, already concerns about the timeliness of these submissions exist. The agency\u2019s Inspector General staff have recommended steps to ensure that CFTC fines are submitted more timely to FMS, but these steps have yet to be implemented. Weaknesses in procedures for ensuring that CFTC submits all needed information to FMS to collect its unpaid fines also appear to have further delayed FMS\u2019 collection efforts.

The Acting Chairman further pointed out that any registration applications from individuals subject to an NFA bar would be carefully reviewed at the CFTC Registration Working Group\u2019s quarterly meetings. We responded by adding text to this report on the role that both SEC and CFTC have in reviewing applications for readmission into their respective industries.  In addition, we revised our recommendation to clarify our intention that, in addition to reviewing individual applications for readmission, these agencies should also assess the pattern of applications to ensure that the changes in NASD\u2019s and NFA\u2019s fine imposition practices do not have unintended consequences. Regarding our recommendation that CFTC take steps to ensure that delinquent fines are promptly referred to FMS, the Acting Chairman stated that all but one case mentioned in our draft report had been sent to FMS, and that case should be referred to FMS by the end of August.

Since the passage of the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, cross-servicing collections have totaled $74.9 milion.", "Federal agencies are required to send delinquent debts owed to them to FMS for collection once these debts are 180 days past due. FMS policy is to keep a case for 30 days, during which time it will send the debtor a demand letter asking for payment.  If no payment is received 20 days after sending the demand letter, FMS will refer those cases that have a debtor\u2019s taxpayer ID number or electronic ID number to TOP for collection where it can remain active for up to 10 years.  At the end of the 30-day period, FMS refers each unpaid case to 1 of the 11 private collection agencies it has on contract to collect debts on a commission basis. When referring cases to these collection agencies, FMS uses a distribution formula intended to distribute the debts among the agencies on the basis of their performance history. A collection agency has 180 days to attempt to collect the debt, during which time it performs such actions as skip traces, asset searches, and information searches from credit bureaus. If a collection agency is unsuccessful in collecting the debt during the period it has the case, the case is referred to a second agency to pursue collection over a second 180-day period.  These collection agencies work on a commission basis and get nothing if their efforts are unsuccessful at collecting a debt. FMS evaluates these agencies on their performance and may reward good performance with bonus payments or with additional referrals. For cases in which debtors can prove they are unable to pay their debts in full, a collection agency can also work with debtors to \u201ccompromise\u201d debts, which means that they will accept less than full payment to discharge a debt.  This compromise must be agreed to by the referring agency when amounts exceed certain agreed-upon thresholds.", "After two collection agencies have been unsuccessful in collecting a debt, the case is returned to FMS.  FMS then can refer a case to the Department of Justice to pursue litigation against the debtor, or it can return the case to the referring agency as uncollectible.
