The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) faces the daunting challenge of determining how to allocate its finite resources to manage risks while addressing threats and enhancing security across all transportation modes. To assist the Congress and TSA in focusing resources on the areas of greatest need, we were asked to describe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and TSA efforts in managing risks and allocating resources across aviation and surface transportation modes, and in integrating screening, credentialing, and research and development (R&D) efforts to achieve efficiencies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["TSA has undertaken numerous initiatives to strengthen transportation security, particularly in aviation, and its efforts should be commended. For example, since September 11, 2001, TSA has installed explosive detection systems at most of the nation's commercial airports to provide the capability to screen all checked baggage for explosives; expanded screener training and developed performance measures and indicators for the screening systems; and evaluated the security of airport perimeters and access controls and provided funding for security equipment. While these efforts are commendable, we found that TSA has not consistently implemented a risk management approach or conducted the systematic analysis needed to inform its decision-making processes and to prioritize security improvements. Our work has shown that a risk management approach can help inform decision makers in allocating finite resources to the areas of greatest need. For example, we found that since initially deploying equipment to screen checked baggage for explosive at airports in response to congressional mandates, TSA has not conducted the systematic planning needed to optimize the deployment and integration of this equipment. Limited analysis of nine airports showed that the integration of this equipment in-line with airport baggage conveyor systems--rather than continuing to maintain the equipment in a stand-alone mode--could result in significant savings for the federal government. We also found that TSA's efforts to implement a comprehensive risk management approach for its air cargo and rail security programs are ongoing. The President's fiscal year 2006 budget request proposes two key DHS organizational changes designed to leverage resources and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of various screening, credentialing, and R&D programs. While we applaud DHS's efforts, it will be important for DHS to address several program challenges as the integration moves forward because restructuring alone will not resolve all existing challenges or ensure the successful integration and achievement of DHS's goals. These challenges including developing regulations identifying eligibility requirements for the Transportation Workers Identification Credential, establishing goals with measurable objectives in research and development strategic plans, and using risk assessments to select and prioritize research and development efforts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to participate in today\u2019s hearing to discuss the  security of our nation\u2019s transportation system and the numerous initiatives  under way and planned intended to strengthen security.

Screening  workforce and equipment includes funding to support passenger and  baggage screener activities such as screener salaries and training, and the  purchase and installation of screening equipment. Aviation direction and  enforcement includes regulation compliance for air cargo, airports, and  airlines through inspections and other efforts, and airport technology  activities and administrative support. The budget requests about $5 billion  for the aviation security appropriation for fiscal year 2006. These funds  will support the current federalized and privatized screener workforce,  provide training and other support for both passenger and baggage  screening, and continue other aviation security regulation and  enforcement activities.

For example, we found that TSA has not always conducted  needed assessments of threats, vulnerabilities, and criticality in allocating  its resources, and has not fully assessed alternatives that could be pursued  to achieve efficiencies and potentially enhance security. Such planning  could guide TSA in moving forward in its allocation of transportation  security funding and assist it in making wise investment decisions while  enhancing the security of all transportation modes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Systematic Planning Needed to Optimize the Deployment of Checked Baggage Screening Systems", "paragraphs": ["In February 2005, we reported that TSA had installed EDS and ETD  systems at most of the nation\u2019s more than 400 commercial airports to  provide the capability to screen all checked baggage using explosive  detection systems, as mandated by Congress. Despite these efforts,  however, we found that in moving forward, TSA had not conducted the  systematic planning needed to optimize the deployment of these  systems\u2014in particular determining at which airports EDS machines  should be integrated in-line with airport baggage conveyor systems to  achieve efficiencies. Such planning is important for TSA to be able to  ensure that it is efficiently allocating its limited resources to maximize the  effectiveness of its checked baggage screening operations and is achieving  desired results.", "From its creation in November 2001 through September 2004, TSA  obligated about $2.5 billion (93 percent) of the approximately $2.7 billion  it had budgeted for fiscal years 2002 through 2004 for procuring and  installing explosive detection equipment\u2014predominantly to screen  checked baggage for explosives\u2014and making associated airport  modifications to accommodate the equipment. Specifically, TSA procured  and placed about 1,200 EDS machines and about 6,000 ETD machines at  over 400 airports, and modified airports for the installation of this  equipment. Given the congressional mandate to screen all checked  baggage using explosive detection systems by December 31, 2002, later  extended to December 31, 2003, TSA worked with a contractor to quickly  deploy EDS and ETD equipment to the nation\u2019s airports. This response  resulted in TSA placing stand-alone ETD and the minivan-sized EDS  machines\u2014usually in airport lobbies\u2014that were not integrated in-line  with airport baggage conveyor systems. Some of these interim lobby  solutions resulted in operational inefficiencies, including requiring a  greater number of screeners, as compared with using EDS machines in- line with baggage conveyor systems. Also, screening solely with ETD  machines is more labor intensive and less efficient than screening using  the EDS process. TSA officials stated that they used EDS machines in a  stand-alone mode and ETD machines as an interim solution in order to  meet the congressional deadline for screening all checked baggage for  explosives. Officials further stated that they employed these interim  solutions because of the significant costs required to install in-line systems  and the need to reconfigure many airports\u2019 baggage conveyor systems to  accommodate the equipment. While in-line EDS baggage screening  systems have a number of potential benefits, including streamlining airport  and TSA operations and reducing screenings costs, these systems are  capital-intensive because they often require significant airport  modifications, including terminal reconfigurations, new conveyor belt  systems, and electrical upgrades.", "Since the initial deployment of EDS and ETD equipment, TSA has not  conducted a systematic analysis of cost savings and other benefits that  could be achieved from the installation of in-line baggage screening  systems. However, TSA has estimated\u2014through its limited retrospective  analysis for the nine airports that received letter of intent (LOI) funding  agreements\u2014that in-line baggage screening systems at these airports  could save the federal government $1.3 billion over 7 years compared with  stand-alone EDS systems. TSA further estimated that it could recover its  initial investment in the in-line systems at these airports in a little over   1 year. One factor that significantly affected estimated savings was the  number of screeners required to conduct screening when using in-line  baggage screening systems. According to TSA\u2019s analysis, in-line EDS  systems would reduce by 78 percent the number of TSA baggage screeners  and supervisors required to screen checked baggage at these nine airports,  from 6,645 to 1,477. This analysis indicates the potential for cost savings  through the installation of in-line EDS systems at other airports and  provides insights about other key factors likely to influence potential  savings. These factors include how much an airport\u2019s facilities would have  to be modified to accommodate the in-line configuration; TSA\u2019s costs to  buy, install, and network the EDS machines; and subsequent maintenance  costs.", "TSA and airport operators are relying on LOIs as their principal method  for funding the modification of airport facilities to incorporate in-line  baggage screening systems. The fiscal year 2003 Consolidated  Appropriations Resolution approved the use of LOIs as a vehicle to  leverage federal government and industry funding to support facility  modification costs for installing in-line EDS baggage screening systems.  When an LOI is established to provide multiyear funding for a project, the  airport operator is responsible for providing\u2014up front\u2014the total funding  needed to complete the project. Work proceeds with the understanding  that TSA will, if sufficient funding is appropriated, reimburse the airport  operator for a percentage of the facility modification costs, with the  airport funding the remainder of the costs. The LOI does not constitute a  binding commitment for federal funds.", "Although airport officials we interviewed stated that they will require  federal funding to install in-line systems\u2014and TSA officials stated that  additional airports would benefit from in-line systems to achieve  efficiencies and for other reasons\u2014TSA officials stated that they do not  have sufficient resources in their budget to fund additional LOIs beyond  the eight LOIs that have already been issued as of January 2005. These  eight LOIs will support the installation of in-line baggage screening  systems at nine airports for a total cost to the federal government of   $957.1 million over 4 years. The Vision 100\u2014Century of Aviation  Reauthorization Act\u2014among other things, provided for the creation of the  Aviation Security Capital Fund to help pay for placing EDS machines in  line with airport baggage handling systems. The President\u2019s fiscal year  2006 budget request for TSA provides approximately $240.5 million for the  continued funding of the eight existing LOIs and provides no funds for  new LOI agreements for in-line system integration activities.", "We reported that with the objective of initially fielding EDS and ETD  equipment largely accomplished, TSA needs to shift its focus from  equipping airports with interim screening solutions to systematically  planning for the more optimal deployment of checked baggage screening  systems. Part of such planning should include analyzing which airports  should receive federal support for in-line baggage screening systems based  on cost savings and other benefits that could be achieved from more  effective and efficient baggage screening operations. Also, for airports  where in-line systems may not be economically justified, a cost- effectiveness analysis could be used to determine the benefits of  additional stand-alone EDS machines to screen checked baggage in place  of more labor-intensive ETD machines currently used at more than   300 commercial airports.", "To assist TSA in planning for the optimal deployment of checked baggage  screening systems, we recommended that TSA systematically evaluate  baggage screening needs at airports, including the costs and benefits of  installing in-line baggage screening systems at airports that do not yet have  in-line systems installed. DHS agreed with our recommendation, stating  that TSA has initiated an analysis of deploying in-line checked baggage  screening systems and is in the process of formulating criteria to identify  those airports that would benefit from an in-line system.

With regard to screener training, the  President\u2019s fiscal year 2006 budget requests $91 million to fully implement  TSA\u2019s passenger and baggage screener training programs and related  workforce development programs at the expected fiscal year 2006  screener workforce level. However, as we reported this time last year,  insufficient screener staffing and, at many airports, a lack of high-speed  Internet/intranet connectivity have made it difficult for all screeners to  receive required training and have access to all courses offered.  Specifically, we reported that Federal Security Directors at 5 of the   15 category X airports we visited\u2014during our reviews of passenger and  baggage screening\u2014stated that it was difficult, if not impossible, to  comply with TSA\u2019s recurrent training requirement of 3 hours each week,  averaged over a 3-month period. The directors stated that because of  staffing shortages, they were unable to let screeners take required training  because it would affect the director\u2019s ability to provide adequate screener  coverage.", "In May 2004, TSA announced a revised allocation of the 45,000 full-time  equivalent screeners among the nation\u2019s airports in order to provide more  appropriate screener coverage. TSA based the allocation on various  factors, including forecasted air travel, hours of operation, baggage  screening and checkpoint configurations, types of screening equipment  deployed, and actual operating experience. In addition, TSA headquarters  officials stated that TSA is factoring training requirements into workplace  planning efforts, including a new staffing model currently under  development. However, it is too soon to determine whether the staffing  model will address TSA\u2019s ability to provide required training while  maintaining adequate coverage for screening operations. The President\u2019s  request of about $2.7 billion for the screener workforce in fiscal year 2006  represents an increase of about $245 million over last year\u2019s enacted  budget, but maintains the screener staffing level at the congressionally  mandated ceiling of 45,000 full-time equivalent screeners.", "The lack of high-speed Internet/intranet connectivity at airport training  facilities has also limited screener access to TSA training tools. TSA  established its Online Learning Center to provide passenger and baggage  screeners with online, high-speed access to training courses. However,  effective use of the Online Learning Center requires high-speed  Internet/intranet access, which TSA has not been able to provide to all  airports. In February 2004, we reported that TSA had provided  connectivity to 71 airport locations, including training sites with 927 fully  connected training computers, and expected to install high-speed  connectivity at up to 81 additional airports by the end of fiscal year 2004.", "However, TSA suspended installation of high-speed connectivity at  airports in April 2004 when funding was exhausted. Currently, TSA reports  that it has provided high-speed connectivity to 120 airports with 1,822 fully  connected training computers. TSA plans to continue to distribute new  training products using other delivery channels, such as written training  materials and CD-ROMs. However, we reported that until TSA provides  high-speed connectivity at every airport, screeners at airports without  high-speed connectivity will not have access to the full menu of courses  available through the Online Learning Center.", "The budget request for fiscal year 2006 includes $174 million to complete  the installation of high-speed connectivity at the nation\u2019s commercial  airports. The budget request stated that without these funds, 379 out of   600 (63 percent) of the field sites, including airports, will continue to  communicate and provide security-related information over dial-up  Internet connections, causing delays and access problems. We believe that  the installation of high-speed connectivity at the nation\u2019s airports will  significantly increase screener access to available training, thereby  assisting TSA in strengthening its screening operations. For example, the  budget request stated that without these funds, screeners would not have  access to training programs such as \u201cThreat of the Day,\u201d which allows  screeners to stay abreast of the most current security threats.", "In addition to training, developing performance measures for TSA\u2019s  screening program is necessary to assess achievements and make  decisions about where to direct performance improvement efforts. In April  2004, we reported that while TSA was taking steps to measure screener  performance, it had not collected sufficient data to assess how well  screeners performed\u2014particularly with regard to baggage screeners\u2014and  had not determined what steps to take to strengthen screener  performance. Since then, TSA has gathered additional performance data  and has established performance measures and targets for the screening  system.

One of the key components of TSA\u2019s  risk-based approach for securing air cargo is the development and  implementation of a system to screen 100 percent of high-risk cargo. This  program, known as the Freight Assessment System, is based on several  key components. First, the system will use data on known shippers and  indirect air carriers who deliver cargo to air carriers for transport. It is  important that this data be complete, accurate, and current, so that  shippers about whom relevant security information is known can be  distinguished from those shippers about whom there is inadequate  security information. Second, the system must incorporate criteria for  profiling cargo so that it can identify high-risk cargo that must undergo  physical screening. Third, effective technology must be deployed to screen  cargo identified as high-risk.", "TSA is still in the early stages of developing the Freight Assessment  System and needs to resolve several issues that could affect the system\u2019s  development. First, the principal source of data for prescreening is  through the use of its Known Shipper Program. However, carriers who  collect this information are not currently required to submit data on  known shippers for inclusion in TSA\u2019s centralized database. In May 2004, a  TSA official testified that the known shipper database contained only  about one-third of all known shippers. There are also concerns about the  relative ease of obtaining known shipper status, and the ability for  someone to pose as a known shipper by falsifying or counterfeiting  shipping documents used to identify the source as a known shipper.  Second, the TSA working group charged with proposing criteria for  profiling cargo has not yet reported its recommendations to TSA. Any field  testing of the Freight Assessment System will require complete and  verified data on known shippers, as well as criteria for evaluating risk.  Finally, TSA is in the early stages of identifying and testing air cargo  security technologies. For example, it has not yet developed plans  outlining when these tests will be completed, or determined whether  technologies proven to be effective will be deployed.", "In addition, TSA\u2019s proposed air cargo security rule estimates the costs of  implementing the agency\u2019s proposals for enhancing air cargo security at  $837 million over a 10-year period. However, industry stakeholders have  raised concerns over TSA\u2019s projected cost estimates, in part because of the  number of air cargo workers the stakeholders estimate to be affected by  some of the proposed measures. For example, several stakeholders  commented that TSA\u2019s cost estimate for conducting the proposed security  threat assessments of air cargo workers was low, and that TSA  underestimated the number of air cargo workers that would have to  undergo an assessment. In addition, air cargo industry stakeholders  expressed concerned that they would incur approximately 97 percent of  the projected cost of the air cargo security procedures described in the  proposed rule.

These evaluations\u2014 though not yet complete\u2014have identified perimeter and access control  security concerns. For example, TSA identified instances where airport  operators failed to comply with existing security requirements, including  access control-related regulations. In addition, TSA identified threats to  perimeter and access control security at each of the airports where  vulnerability assessments were conducted during 2003. In January 2004,  TSA temporarily suspended its assessment efforts to conduct higher- priority vulnerability assessments dealing with shoulder-fired missiles.  Although TSA plans to begin conducting joint vulnerability assessments  with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, it has not yet determined how it  will allocate existing resources between its own independent airport  assessments and the new joint assessments, or developed a schedule for  conducting future vulnerability assessments.

Further, at the time of  our review, these efforts had not been completed, and TSA had not yet  developed a plan with specific milestones for implementing the tools and  assessments. Without such a plan, it will be difficult for TSA to determine  the proper allocation of its resources to the areas of greatest need and to  monitor the progress of its efforts.", "TSA has also partnered with industry associations to develop security  guidelines that enable general aviation airport managers to assess their  own vulnerabilities to terrorist attack, and works through industry  associations to communicate threat information. However, industry and  state aviation officials we spoke with stated that security advisories  distributed by TSA were general in nature and were not consistently  received. In part this is understandable because, among other things, TSA  relies on other federal agencies for threat information. However, we have  found that applying risk communication principles\u2014relaying only timely,  specific, and actionable information, to the extent possible\u2014provides  organizations like TSA with the best opportunity to achieve desired  results.", "We also found that TSA and the Federal Aviation Administration have  taken a number of steps to address security risks to general aviation  through regulation and guidance but still face challenges in their efforts to  further enhance security. For example, TSA developed regulations  governing background checks for foreign candidates for U.S. flight training  schools and issued security guidelines for general aviation airports.  However, we found limitations in the process used to conduct compliance  inspections of flight training schools.", "Because of the importance of securing general aviation operations and to  help address associated challenges, we recommended, and DHS generally  agreed, that TSA take actions to better assess the possibility of terrorists\u2019  misuse of general aviation aircraft, better communicate terrorist threat  information, and help mitigate security risks to general aviation  operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Established a Screening Partnership Program but Needs to Finalize Performance Measures", "paragraphs": ["In November 2004, we reported on our preliminary observations of TSA\u2019s  efforts to establish and implement a Screening Partnership Program, a  program through which commercial airports can apply to TSA to use  private rather than federal passenger and baggage screeners.

A federal workforce has performed this  function since November 2002, in response to a congressional mandate  that the federal government take over screening services from air carriers  after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. A 2-year pilot program at  five airports testing the effectiveness of private sector screening in a post- September 11 environment was concluded on November 18, 2004.", "In assessing TSA\u2019s efforts to implement a Screening Partnership Program,  we found that TSA had completed or was developing key policies and  procedures addressing program implementation and oversight, and was  taking steps to communicate with stakeholders by developing  informational guidance and soliciting information and suggestions.

TSA officials stated that once  developed, performance measures for the Screening Partnership Program  will be based on measures already developed by an independent  consulting firm for the five airports that participated in the pilot screening  program. These measures include how well screeners detect test threat  objects, such as guns and knives, during screening operations. TSA also  reported that it plans to develop performance measures evaluating how  well private screening contractors comply with the terms of their  contracts, which they intend to become part of a quality assurance plan.

First, DHS proposes to create an Office of Screening  Coordination and Operations within the Border and Transportation  Security Directorate that would coordinate a comprehensive approach to  several ongoing terrorist-related screening initiatives\u2014in immigration; law  enforcement; intelligence; counterintelligence; and protection of the  border, transportation systems, and critical infrastructure. Specifically,  the Office of Screening Coordination and Operations would consolidate  nine screening activities, including six that are currently housed within a  single TSA office. DHS expects this consolidation to save administrative  overhead costs, thereby enabling the department to use those savings  toward accomplishing the missions of the programs. In total, DHS is  requesting about $847 million for the Office of Screening Coordination and  Operations. Table 2 provides the budget request for the 6 screening  activities that currently reside within TSA.", "DHS identified 11 goals in creating the Office of Screening Coordination  and Operations:    enable consistent, effective, and efficient day-to-day operations  through the application of standards and use of common services;    assist in the development of policy for DHS-wide screening and    create an integrated business strategy for DHS screening and  credentialing programs that enhances security, facilitates travel, and  safeguards privacy;  reduce redundancy and close mission and technological gaps;    manage investments of screening and credentialing programs to ensure  efficient use of assets;  remove technological barriers to sharing screening information within  DHS;    enable consistent status reporting of major screening and credentialing    ensure consistent acquisition/contracting and program management    establish a central clearinghouse to administer registered traveler  programs and worker credentialing programs;    deliver clear and consistent messages to domestic and foreign travelers  and workers for increased compliance; and    work with other federal agencies to improve and coordinate screening  standards.", "Second, DHS is proposing to consolidate its R&D efforts inside its Science  and Technology Directorate. This office will house the current R&D  activities that are currently spread across four DHS component agencies\u2014 TSA, U.S. Coast Guard, Customs and Border Patrol, and Information  Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorates. The existing TSA  R&D program consists of research and development (Transportation  Security Laboratory), next-generation explosive detection systems, and  air cargo research, and received a total of $178 million in fiscal year 2005  appropriations. By consolidating these and other R&D programs under a  single office, DHS is seeking to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness  of its R&D efforts to allow the components to focus on their operational  missions and eliminate duplicate management infrastructure. DHS\u2019s fiscal  year 2006 budget request includes $1.4 billion for R&D.", "We applaud DHS\u2019s efforts to achieve efficiencies and cost savings,  leverage resources and technology, and improve internal coordination and  operations. As DHS works toward consolidating screening functions and  initiatives within the Office of Screening Coordination and Operations, and  the R&D functions within the Science and Technology Directorate, it will  be important for DHS to define the interrelationships and commonalities  among these programs, explicitly define roles and responsibilities, and  identify data needs. Additionally, DHS will need to address the existing  challenges that have been identified regarding the programs these offices  will absorb. While these organizational changes should assist DHS in  providing a solid foundation from which to manage and oversee its  screening, credentialing, and R&D efforts, restructuring alone will not  resolve all existing challenges or ensure the successful integration and  achievement of DHS\u2019s goals. We have recently reported on challenges DHS  and TSA are facing with regard to some of these programs, including  Secure Flight, the Transportation Worker Identification Credential, and  research and development activities. The sections below describe the  challenges we identified."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "TSA Is in Early Stages of Testing and Implementing the Secure Flight Passenger Prescreening System", "paragraphs": ["One challenge the proposed Office of Screening Coordination and  Operations will face immediately is the continued development of a  system to prescreen domestic airline passengers. The prescreening of  passengers\u2014that is, determining whether airline passengers pose a  security risk before they reach the passenger screening checkpoint\u2014is  used to focus security attention on those passengers representing the  greatest potential threat. Since the late 1990s, passenger prescreening has  been conducted using the Computer-Assisted Passenger Prescreening  System (CAPPS I). This system, operated by air carriers, compares  passenger information against CAPPS I rules as well as a government- supplied watch list that contains the names of known or suspected  terrorists.", "In the wake of September 11, concerns were raised over the effectiveness  of CAPPS I. In 2002, TSA began developing a second-generation computer- assisted passenger prescreening system, known as CAPPS II, which was  intended to provide a more effective and efficient way to prescreen airline  passengers. However, the development of CAPPS II faced a number of  significant delays and challenges. As we reported in February 2004, key  activities in the development of CAPPS II were delayed, complete plans  identifying system functionality were not established, and TSA was behind  schedule in testing and developing initial increments of the system.  Further, we found that TSA had not yet fully addressed seven of the eight  issues identified by Congress as key areas of interest, such as privacy  concerns, passenger redress, and system oversight. We further reported  that TSA faced challenges in obtaining the international cooperation  needed to obtain passenger data, managing the expansion of the program\u2019s  mission beyond its original purpose, and ensuring that identify theft\u2014in  which an individual poses as and uses information of another individual\u2014 cannot be used to negate the security benefits of the system.", "Moreover, in July 2004, the 9/11 Commission advised that improvements to  the passenger prescreening system are required, noting that the watch lists  used by the air carriers for the current prescreening system, CAPPS I, do  not include all terrorists or terrorism suspects because of concerns about  sharing intelligence information with private firms and foreign countries.  The 9/11 Commission stated that passenger prescreening should be  performed by TSA and should use the larger consolidated watch list data  maintained by the federal government. As a result of these problems and  challenges, as well as widespread concerns with CAPPS II by Congress,  the public, and other key stakeholders, DHS terminated the CAPPS II  program and in August 2004 announced that it would develop a new  passenger prescreening program called Secure Flight.", "Under Secure Flight, TSA will take over, from commercial airlines, the  responsibility for checking passenger information against terrorist watch  lists and the CAPPS I rules. TSA expects that Secure Flight, once  implemented, will provide a number of benefits over the current airline- operated system. For example, TSA expects that Secure Flight will be  more effective than CAPPS I in identifying terrorists because it will utilize  an expanded watch list with more information than is currently available  to air carriers. TSA also believes Secure Flight will reduce the number of  passengers mistakenly identified as being on a terrorist watch list as  compared with the current system. TSA is currently testing the ability of  Secure Flight to perform watch list matching and applying CAPPS I rules.  TSA expects that this phase of testing will be completed later this month.  In addition, TSA plans to test the feasibility of using commercial data to  improve the ability of Secure Flight to more accurately verify passenger  identity. TSA expects to complete commercial data testing in early April  2005. On the basis of these test results, TSA plans to make policy  decisions regarding the use of commercial data as part of Secure Flight.  TSA also plans subsequently to test additional functionality and the  operations of Secure Flight before implementation, regardless of whether  it incorporates the use of commercial data as part of Secure Flight. At the  conclusion of testing, TSA expects to implement Secure Flight with one or  two air carriers in August 2005.", "Although TSA reported that it spent approximately $100 million on the  development of CAPPS II, TSA considers much of that cost to be  applicable to Secure Flight. This is because Secure Flight will leverage  certain capabilities that had been developed for the CAPPS II program,  such as the system infrastructure used to match passenger information  against terrorist watch lists. However, in developing Secure Flight, TSA  modified the CAPPS II infrastructure to remove certain features that were  not authorized for Secure Flight. For fiscal year 2005, TSA was allocated  $35 million for the development of Secure Flight. The President\u2019s fiscal  year 2006 budget request includes approximately $94 million for Secure  Flight development and implementation as well as crew vetting. This  represents an increase of approximately $46 million for Secure Flight and  approximately $3 million for crew vetting. These funds are intended to  support continued testing, information systems, connectivity to airlines,  and daily operations.", "As mandated by the fiscal year 2005 Homeland Security Appropriations  Act (Public Law 108-334, Section 522), as well as in response to  congressional requests, we are currently conducting a review of the  Secure Flight program. Our review will highlight four key areas: (1) the  status of Secure Flight\u2019s development and implementation, (2) any  challenges to the system\u2019s effective implementation and operation,   (3) processes in place for system oversight and program management, and  (4) efforts to minimize the impact of Secure Flight on passengers and to  protect passenger rights. As part of this review, we will examine the future  costs associated with the development and implementation of Secure  Flight. We will also determine if TSA has addressed the weaknesses  identified in our February 2004 report on CAPPS II.

The TWIC program is intended  to improve security by establishing an integrated, credential-based,  identity management program for higher risk transportation workers  requiring unescorted access to secure areas of the nation\u2019s transportation  system. TSA expects that the Office of Screening Coordination and  Operations will leverage separate screening processes within TWIC, such  as in establishing watchlist checks on transportation workers and  establishing access interoperability with transportation companies, and  apply those practices to other screening activities.", "In December 2004, we reported on TSA\u2019s efforts to issue a worker  identification card that uses biometrics, such as fingerprints, to control  access to secure areas of ports or ships. We found that three main factors  caused TSA to miss its initial August 2004 target date for issuing maritime  worker identification cards: (1) TSA officials had difficulty obtaining  timely approval of the prototype test from DHS because of competition for  executive-level attention and agency resources, (2) extra time was  required to work with DHS and Office of Management Budget officials to  identify additional data to be collected for cost-benefit and alternative  analyses, and (3) additional work was required to assess the capabilities of  various card technologies to determine which technology was most  appropriate for controlling access in seaports. Because of program delays,  some port facilities, recognizing an immediate need to enhance access  control systems, are proceeding with plans for local or regional  identification cards that may require additional investment in order to  make them compatible with the TWIC system. Accordingly, delays in the  program may affect enhancements to port security and complicate  stakeholder\u2019s efforts in making wise investment decisions regarding  security infrastructure.", "We also identified additional challenges that DHS will face as it moves  forward with developing and operating the TWIC program, such as  developing regulations that identify eligibility requirements for the card  and instituting a comprehensive plan for managing the project. A  documented comprehensive project plan will assist DHS in achieving  mutual understanding, commitment, and performance of individuals,  groups, and organizations that must execute or support the plan. Without  such a plan\u2014which is an established industry best practice for project  planning and management\u2014the program\u2019s schedule and performance is  placed at higher risk. For example, additional delays could occur unless  involved parties agree on efforts guiding the remainder of the project,  stakeholder responsibilities, and associated deadlines. Additionally,  without a plan to guide the cost-benefit and alternatives analyses\u2014another  industry best practice\u2014risk is increased that DHS may not sufficiently  analyze the feasibility of various approaches to issuing the card, an  analysis needed to make informed decisions regarding the program. On  the basis of our work, we recommended, and DHS generally agreed, that  TSA employ industry best practices for project planning and management  by developing a comprehensive project plan for managing the program  and specific detailed plans for risk mitigation and cost-benefit and  alternatives analyses. As DHS moves forward in developing TWIC, it will  be important that it incorporates these best practices to help address the  challenges it faces in developing and implementing a maritime worker  identification card.", "DHS\u2019s fiscal year 2006 budget request includes about $245 million for  TWIC. This amount is to cover the costs of personnel, contractors,  equipment maintenance, software and license updates, background  checks, fingerprint processing, and adjudication of results. DHS estimated  that the $245 million will enable it to distribute roughly 2 million TWICs to  transportation security workers needing access to high-risk areas of the  transportation system by the end of fiscal year 2006. Additionally, DHS is  seeking authority to recover these costs in their entirety through fees  charged to the applicants.", "TSA is also exploring the cost-effectiveness of two other program  alternatives: (1) a federal approach: a program wholly designed, financed,  and managed by the federal government, and (2) a decentralized approach:  a program requiring ports and port facilities to design, finance, and  manage programs to issue identification cards. In February 2005, TSA  officials stated that they do not expect to make a decision on which of the  three alternatives to implement\u2014the federal, decentralized, or TWIC  program\u2014until later in 2005. Officials stated that whichever approach is  selected will be known as TWIC and will meet legislative requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Further Planning, Risk Assessment, and Coordination Needed to Focus R&D Efforts", "paragraphs": ["As DHS moves forward in integrating its R&D functions into a single  office\u2014a commendable goal\u2014it will be important for the department to  resolve the existing challenges facing its various R&D programs.  Researching and developing technologies to detect, prevent, and mitigate  terrorist threats is vital to enhancing the security of the nation\u2019s  transportation system. In September 2004, we reported that TSA and DHS  have made some progress in managing transportation security R&D  programs according to applicable laws and R&D best practices.  However, we found that their efforts were incomplete in several areas,  including preparing strategic plans for R&D efforts that contain  measurable objectives, preparing and using risk assessments to select and  prioritize R&D projects, and coordinating with stakeholders. We also  found that TSA and DHS delayed several key R&D projects and lacked  both estimated deployment dates for the vast majority of their R&D  projects and adequate databases to effectively manage their R&D  portfolios.", "The Homeland Security Act requires DHS, through its Science and  Technology Directorate, to prepare a strategic plan that identifies goals  and includes annual measurable objectives for coordinating the federal  government\u2019s civilian efforts in developing countermeasures to terrorist  threats. Similarly, the National Academy of Sciences has stated that  research programs should be described in strategic and performance plans  and evaluated in performance reports. We are encouraged that TSA and  DHS have prepared strategic plans for their agencies, and that TSA has  prepared a strategic plan for its R&D program. However, we found that  these plans do not contain measurable objectives for tracking the progress  of R&D efforts. We recommended that TSA and DHS complete strategic  plans containing measurable objectives for their transportation security  R&D programs. According to DHS officials, the department is preparing a  separate strategic plan for its R&D program that will include more specific  goals and measurable objectives. DHS also stated that the Science and  Technology Directorate\u2019s strategic planning process will include   (1) determining strategic goals for the next 5 years, threats, and  vulnerabilities, and (2) developing a list of prioritized projects for fiscal  years 2005 through 2010.", "In consolidating its R&D functions, it will also be important for DHS to use  risk management principles in making R&D funding decisions, as required  by ATSA. Although both TSA and DHS have established processes to  select and prioritize R&D projects that include risk management  principles, they have not yet completed vulnerability and criticality  assessments, which we have identified as key elements of a risk  management approach, for all modes of transportation. In the absence of  completed risk assessments, TSA and DHS officials report basing funding  decisions on other factors\u2014such as available threat intelligence, expert  judgment, and information about past terrorist incidents. TSA officials  further stated that TSA\u2019s Chief Technology Officer receives daily  intelligence briefings and that the agency uses threat information to select  R&D projects to pursue. However, officials stated that they do not use  formal threat assessments to make R&D decisions. In addition, the DHS  Inspector General reported in March 2004 that although many senior  officials agreed that DHS\u2019s Science and Technology and the Information  Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorates should closely  coordinate, staff below them were not actively involved in sharing terrorist  threat information or using the information to form the basis for selecting  new homeland security technologies. On the basis of our work, we  recommended, and DHS generally agreed, that TSA and DHS use the  results of risk assessments to help select and prioritize their R&D efforts.", "In moving forward with the proposed integration of R&D functions, DHS  will also need to enhance its efforts to coordinate with other federal  agencies with respect to transportation security R&D, and reach out to  industry stakeholders. ATSA and the Homeland Security Act require DHS  to coordinate its efforts with those of other government agencies, in part  to reduce duplication and identify unmet needs. Similarly, R&D best  practices identify the importance of stakeholder coordination in  identifying R&D needs. For TSA and DHS to select the best technologies to  enhance transportation security, it is important that they have a clear  understanding of the R&D projects currently being conducted, both  internally and externally. During our review, we found limited evidence of  coordination between TSA and DHS, or between these agencies and other  federal agencies, such as the Department of Transportation. Without such  coordination, DHS raises the risk that its R&D resources will not be  effectively leveraged and that duplication may occur. Further, most  transportation industry association officials we interviewed stated that  TSA and DHS had not coordinated with them to obtain information on  their security R&D needs. We recommended, and officials generally  agreed, that TSA should develop a process with the Department of  Transportation to coordinate transportation security R&D, such as a  memorandum of agreement identifying roles and responsibilities, and  share this information with transportation stakeholders.", "DHS will also need to address several additional challenges while moving  forward in consolidating its R&D functions into a single office, including  managing delays in key R&D projects, better estimating deployment dates,  and conducting better tracking of its R&D portfolio. During our review, we  found that progress on some R&D projects was delayed in fiscal year 2003  when TSA transferred about $61 million, more than half of its $110 million  R&D appropriation, to support operational needs, such as personnel cost  for screeners. As a result, TSA delayed several key R&D projects related to  checked baggage screening, checkpoint screening, and air cargo security.  For example, TSA delayed the development of a device to detect weapons,  liquid explosives, and flammables in containers found in carry-on baggage  or passengers\u2019 effects, as well as the development and testing of a walk- through portal for detecting traces of explosives on passengers. We also  found that although many of TSA\u2019s projects were in later phases of  development, the agency had not estimated deployment dates for 133 of  the 146 projects that it funded in fiscal years 2003 and 2004. While we  recognize that deployment dates are not always predictable, we generally  believe that R&D program managers should estimate deployment dates for  projects that are beyond the basic research phase because deployment  dates can serve as goals that the managers can use to plan, budget, and  track the progress of projects. We also found that TSA and DHS did not  have adequate databases to monitor and manage the spending of the  hundreds of millions of dollars that Congress had appropriated for R&D.  For example, for the 146 projects that it funded in 2003 and 2004, TSA was  not able to provide us information on anticipated deployment dates for   91 percent, the current phase of development for 49 percent, and the  amounts obligated and budgeted for 8 percent that were appropriated tens  of millions of dollars in both fiscal years 2003 and 2004. We recommended  that TSA and DHS develop a database to provide accurate, complete,  current, and readily accessible project information for monitoring and  managing their R&D portfolios, and a vehicle for communicating R&D  need with the transportation industry. In September 2004, DHS stated that  TSA had developed a system to track R&D projects\u2019 goals and milestones,  acquisition, funding, testing, and deployment information."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["DHS and TSA have undertaken numerous initiatives to strengthen  transportation security, particularly in aviation, and their efforts should be  commended. Meeting the congressional mandates to screen passengers  and checked baggage alone was a tremendous challenge\u2014yet TSA  successfully hired and deployed a federal screening workforce of over  40,000 and deployed equipment to screen checked baggage for explosives  at over 400 commercial airports nationwide. In our previous work  addressing transportation security, we identified future actions that TSA  should take to enhance security within and across all modes of  transportation. Throughout the course of this work, one theme  consistently surfaced\u2014the need for TSA to fully utilize and integrate a risk  management approach into its decision making processes. Our work has  shown\u2014in homeland security and in other areas\u2014that a comprehensive  risk management approach can help inform decision makers in allocating  finite resources to the areas of greatest need. We are encouraged that the  President\u2019s fiscal year 2006 budget request discusses TSA\u2019s plans to  implement a risk management approach in focusing its resources related  to transportation security. However, we recognize that fully integrating a  risk management approach into decision making processes is challenging  for any organization. Further, in order to fully apply this approach, TSA  must also address the challenges we have identified in our work related to  program planning, risk assessments, and implementation and monitoring.
