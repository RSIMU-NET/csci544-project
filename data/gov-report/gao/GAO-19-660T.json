As we reported last year, chemistry contributes to  virtually every aspect of modern life, from the production of food and  clean drinking water to medicines, cleaners, personal care products, and  a host of other products. For example, the American Chemistry Council  claims that in 2016 the chemical industry supported nearly 26 percent of  the gross domestic product of the United States. In addition, the Bureau  of Labor Statistics estimates that the chemical manufacturing industry  employed more than 858,000 people in June 2019 and the Department of  Commerce estimated that the sector generated an additional 2.7 million  indirect jobs via industry suppliers.
