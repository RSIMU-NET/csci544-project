In addition, weaknesses exist in other information security controls relating to segregation of duties and application change controls. A key reason for these weaknesses is that FDIC has not fully implemented elements of its information security program. For example, it has not consistently implemented its security-related policies, addressed security plans for certain applications, provided specialized training to individuals with significant security responsibilities, implemented remedial action plans for resolving known weaknesses, and updated or tested continuity plans in light of its implementation of the new financial environment.

This analysis is an essential step in the  process to develop and test contingency plans since the impact analysis  establishes the risks associated with disruption and helps prioritize the  recovery process. If service continuity controls are inadequate, even  relatively minor interruptions can result in lost or incorrectly processed  data, which can cause financial losses, expensive recovery efforts, and  financial or management information to be inaccurate or incomplete.", "FDIC did not update its business impact analysis to reflect the significant  changes resulting from the implementation of the New Financial  Environment; consequently, the continuity plans and testing do not reflect  the current environment. We previously reported a similar business impact  analysis weakness in the corporation\u2019s information security controls.  Although FDIC performed a limited disaster recovery test for the New  Financial Environment, the April 2005 test was conducted prior to  implementation of the new production system. Further, at the time of our  review, the corporation had not tested the new production environment.  Without a current business impact analysis for the new system and the  successful restoration of the new production environment, the corporation  cannot ensure that NFE will be recovered in a timely manner in the event of  a disaster."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["While FDIC has made progress in addressing our previous  recommendations, information security weaknesses continue to impair the  corporation\u2019s ability to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability  of financial and other sensitive data. The severity of these weaknesses was  such that we reported information system control weaknesses to be a  reportable condition in our 2005 financial audit report since financial and  sensitive information are at increased risk of unauthorized access,  modification, and/or disclosure, possibly without detection. Until FDIC  fully implements key security control elements that include enhanced  access permissions, system monitoring, physical access, and continuity of  operations, its facilities and computing resources and the information that  is processed, stored, and transmitted on its systems will remain vulnerable  to unauthorized access, modification, or destruction."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help fully implement the corporation\u2019s information security program, we  recommend that the FDIC Chairman take the following five actions:  consistently implement the corporation\u2019s documented policies and  procedures related to information security,  include security plans or requirements for nonmajor applications into  the plans for general support systems,  provide specialized training to individuals with significant security   report weaknesses as closed in remedial action plans only when  corrective actions have been completed, and  update continuity of operations plans and test them for the New  Financial Environment.", "We are also making recommendations in a separate report designated for  \u201cLimited Official Use Only.\u201d These recommendations address actions  needed to correct specific information security weaknesses related to  access and other information system controls."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We received written comments on a draft of this report from FDIC\u2019s Deputy  to the Chairman and Chief Financial Officer (these are reprinted in app. I).  In these comments, the Deputy acknowledged the benefit of the  recommendations made as a part of this year\u2019s audit and provided  examples of actions that FDIC has taken with regard to security. The  Deputy stated that FDIC concurred with one of our recommendations,  partially concurred with three, and did not concur with one. He also stated  that FDIC disagreed with our assessment that its information system  control weaknesses were sufficient to constitute a reportable condition.", "According to the Deputy, FDIC agreed with our recommendation that it  include security plans or requirements for nonmajor applications into the  plans for general support system and stated that it had added these  applications into such security plans. However, the Deputy questioned the  need for the corporation to assess the security plans for its payroll service  provider (the National Finance Center), as we had stated in a draft of this  report. FDIC considers that such effort on its part would be duplicative,  because its payroll service provider is federally certified and audited by the  Department of Agriculture\u2019s Inspector General, and FDIC reviews the IG  assessments. In addition, the Deputy stated that the corporation has  secured the appropriate agreements required for interconnections of  systems, as required by NIST. We agree with the FDIC position and have  revised the report accordingly.", "With regard to our recommendation that FDIC consistently implement the  corporation\u2019s documented policies and procedures related to information  security, FDIC partially concurred. The corporation agreed with some  aspects of our analysis and took remedial action, such as removing certain  inactive accounts from computers, in conformance with corporation  policy. However, FDIC did not agree with other aspects of our assessment.  For example, we identified a machine in FDIC\u2019s security testing lab as not  compliant. According to the Deputy, the risk from this vulnerability was  fully mitigated because the machine was not a production computer, and  software was implemented to prevent simultaneous connection to the  production network and to wireless computing network. We disagree that  these conditions fully mitigate the risk posed by this vulnerability: in  certain circumstances, one vulnerable machine on a network could be used  to gain access to related networks and compromise the confidentiality,  integrity, and availability of information and information systems as a  whole. Even with mitigating controls, such vulnerability increases risk.", "With regard to our recommendation that FDIC provide specialized training  to individuals with significant security responsibilities, FDIC partially  concurred. The corporation acknowledged that a \u201csmall subset\u201d of  employees with significant security responsibilities did not attend the  originally scheduled specialized training; however, according to the Deputy,  these employees have since attended training or were provided with  training materials. Accordingly, FDIC believes that it is now in compliance  with this recommendation. As stated in our report, FDIC reported that only  58 percent of such employees had received specialized training. If the  remaining 42 percent have now received the appropriate training, FDIC will  have satisfied our recommendation.", "With regard to our recommendation that FDIC update its continuity of  operations plans and test them for the New Financial Environment, FDIC  partially concurred. According to the Deputy, the corporation has now  updated its Business Impact Analysis (on which its continuity of operations  plans are based), and it retested its disaster recovery program in 2006,  including a full test of the New Financial Environment. Accordingly, FDIC  believes that it is now in compliance with this recommendation. The  Deputy described the corporation\u2019s concurrence as partial because of the  timing of several events, including the corporation\u2019s response to Hurricane  Katrina and other priorities. According to the Deputy, FDIC had exercised  its discretion in continuing to rely on its previous Business Impact Analysis  because of these other priorities. In addition, the Deputy stated that  although the corporation did not test the New Financial Environment in a  production environment, it ran a limited test of the system before it went  into production. At the time of our review, however, the Business Impact  Analysis did not reflect the current environment, which had been  significantly changed as a result of the implementation of the New  Financial Environment. An outdated Business Impact Analysis increases  risk because this analysis provides a mechanism for identifying the  business functions that will be affected by availability problems and thus  forms the basis for disaster recovery planning and testing. FDIC\u2019s recent  actions to address this risk are thus important; although we have not  evaluated these actions, if they have been implemented appropriately,  FDIC will have satisfied our recommendation.", "FDIC did not concur with our recommendation that it report weaknesses  as closed in remedial action plans only when corrective actions are taken.  According to the Deputy, the corporation disagreed with the assessment on  which this recommendation was based: that is, that it did not effectively  implement or accurately report the status of remedial actions. According to  FDIC, our observation was based on a single instance that was part of a  pilot test process, and thus the finding was not valid for the program that  was in place through most of 2005. However, we disagree with FDIC\u2019s  characterization that our observation was based on a single instance. Our  finding is based on a remediation plan that FDIC developed following a  security test and evaluation of its New Financial Environment. In that plan,  dated November 2005, we found 38 control weaknesses that were closed  without test or validation. FDIC also provided us with an updated  remediation plan for this test, dated December 2005, which did not include  the improperly closed weaknesses or any indication that they had been  addressed. We also disagree that our finding was not valid for the process  that was in place for most of 2005. Our analysis was based on the process in  effect from March to December 2005. Further, several of the items that  were improperly closed were the same weaknesses that we identify in this  report. For example, we found that the corporation closed weaknesses that  had been identified in areas such as security awareness training,  segregation of duties, encryption, and audit and monitoring; however,  during our audit we found that these weaknesses still existed.", "After the end of the review period, FDIC informed us that it was improving  its process to ensure that weaknesses were not closed without corrective  action, but we have not evaluated this improved process. In his comments,  the Deputy stated that FDIC is now in compliance with our  recommendation, because its mature program requires full monitoring of  remedial actions and testing for completion. If FDIC\u2019s process has been  implemented appropriately, the corporation will have satisfied our  recommendation.", "Finally, the FDIC does not share our assessment that it had a reportable  condition due to the severity of the risk impact or the magnitude of the  collective vulnerability posed by potential control issues. However, we  believe that the problems we identified in this report concerning FDIC\u2019s  security program adversely affected the overall security posture of the  corporation and did merit a reportable condition. These problems included  the (1) lack of consistent implementation of documented policies and  procedures related to information security, (2) absence of integration of  nonmajor applications into general support security plans, (3) lack of  specialized security training for trusted employees, (4) an oversight  process that allowed weaknesses to remain open even though they were  reported as closed, (4) lack of updated Business Impact Analyses and  contingency plans, (5) failure to test the New Financial Environment in a  production environment, and (6) significant access controls vulnerabilities  described in a separate report. All of these vulnerabilities contributed to  our reinstating a reportable condition on FDIC information security  controls.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Chairman and Ranking Minority  Member of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs;  the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the House Committee on  Financial Services; members of the FDIC Audit Committee; officials in  FDIC\u2019s divisions of information resources management, administration,  and finance; and the FDIC inspector general.
