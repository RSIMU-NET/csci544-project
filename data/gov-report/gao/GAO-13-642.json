However, these analyses do not address all planned NGJ roles, such as communications jamming in irregular warfare environments, or take into account the military services' evolving airborne electronic attack investment plans. According to GAO's analysis, none of the systems that have emerged since DOD completed its NGJ analyses duplicate its planned capabilities; however there is some overlap in the roles they are intended to perform. Redundancy in some of these areas may, in fact, be desirable. However, pursuing multiple acquisition efforts to develop similar capabilities can result in the same capability gap being filled twice or more, lead to inefficient use of resources, and contribute to other warfighting needs going unfilled. Therefore, continued examination of potential overlap and duplication among these investments may be warranted.", "DOD has several ongoing efforts that could provide a mechanism for updating its analysis of potential overlap and duplication to address these shortcomings as the program moves forward.

The NGJ's capabilities are not intended to meet all of the military services' airborne electronic attack needs and the services are planning to make additional investments in systems that are tailored to meet their specific warfighting roles. The military services might be able to leverage the NGJ program in support of their own acquisition priorities because it plans to use a modular open systems approach, which allows for components to be added, removed, or modified without significantly impacting the rest of the system.

Airborne electronic attack involves the  use of aircraft to neutralize, destroy, or temporarily degrade (suppress)  enemy air defense and communications systems, either through  destructive or disruptive means. It helps protect aircraft, maritime, and  ground forces from a variety of threats. For example, during major combat  operations, airborne electronic attack helps prevent other systems, such  as fighter jets or naval carriers, from being detected by enemy radars and  targeted by missiles. In irregular warfare environments, it supports ground  troops by performing functions such as jamming enemy communications.  Weapons designed to counter U.S. airborne electronic attack capabilities  are becoming increasingly common and sophisticated. These weapons\u2014 held by both nation-state and non-state actors\u2014vary from advanced,  integrated air defense systems to older surveillance radars that are being  upgraded with advanced computers.", "One of the current systems used to counter these threats is the AN/ALQ- 99 (ALQ-99), a jamming pod system that operates from EA-6B Prowler  and EA-18G Growler aircraft. Jammers transmit electronic signals that  neutralize or temporarily degrade enemy air defenses and  communications, thus aiding combat aircraft, maritime, and ground  forces\u2019 freedom to maneuver and strike. According to the Department of  Defense (DOD), the capabilities of the ALQ-99 are insufficient to keep up  with rapidly evolving threats and the system is becoming obsolete. As a  result, the Navy is planning to replace the ALQ-99 with a more capable  Next Generation Jammer (NGJ) on its EA-18G aircraft. The NGJ program  was authorized to begin technology development in July 2013, and the  Navy expects the program to cost over $7 billion, including over $3 billion  for research, development, test and evaluation, and over $4 billion for  procurement.", "Each of the military departments is making investments in airborne  electronic attack capabilities. In March 2012, we found potential overlap  among airborne electronic attack systems in development, particularly  among systems used for irregular warfare that the services were  acquiring under urgent operational needs processes. While some  redundancy is often desirable, our prior work has shown that pursuing  multiple acquisition efforts to develop similar capabilities can result in the  same capability gap being filled twice or more, lead to inefficient use of  resources, and contribute to other warfighting needs going unfilled.", "We also found that DOD\u2019s ability to identify department-wide needs and  solutions and eliminate potentially unnecessary overlap may have been  undermined by a lack of designated, joint leadership charged with  overseeing electronic warfare acquisition activities. Senate Report 112- 196, which accompanied the bill for the Department of Defense  Appropriations Act, 2013 and was subsequently incorporated into the  Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013, directed  GAO to review the NGJ program and potential duplication. This report  examines (1) the extent to which DOD has assessed whether there is  duplication among the NGJ, existing capabilities, and other acquisition  programs, and (2) the extent to which the NGJ is being managed as a  joint solution that supports multiple military services.", "To determine the extent to which DOD assessed duplication among the  NGJ, existing capabilities, and other acquisition programs, we reviewed  key NGJ and DOD electronic warfare documents, including the 2004  Airborne Electronic Attack Initial Capabilities Document, the 2009  Electronic Warfare Initial Capabilities Document, the NGJ Analysis of  Alternatives, and the DOD\u2019s annual Electronic Warfare Strategy Report to  Congress.

The  ALQ-99/EA-6B combination was originally developed for use in major  combat operations, and in 1995, the EA-6B was selected to become the  sole tactical radar support jammer for all services after the Air Force  decided to retire its fleet of EF-111 aircraft. The role of the EA-6B has  continued to expand over time. According to DOD officials, when  Operation Iraqi Freedom began, EA-6Bs were used in irregular warfare  environments along with another aircraft, the EC-130H Compass Call,  because they provided needed jamming capabilities and there were no  other airborne electronic attack assets available for this role. These and  other demands have strained DOD\u2019s airborne electronic attack capacity  and increased the stress on systems, such as the ALQ-99.", "Like the ALQ-99, the NGJ will be comprised of jamming pods that will fly  on the Navy\u2019s EA-18G. Its main purpose will be to counter integrated air  defense systems in major combat operations. The EA-18G with NGJ is to  primarily be based on aircraft carriers at sea where it is to be employed in  U.S. Navy carrier strike groups to counter both sea- and land-based  weapon systems. DOD also plans for it to support joint expeditionary  warfare missions. The EA-18G with NGJ is currently planned to primarily  serve in a modified escort role, in which it is expected to jam enemy  radars while the aircraft is outside the range of known surface-to-air  missiles. It is also expected to be capable of conducting stand-off  jamming missions, in which the aircraft is located outside of defended  airspace. In both cases, the idea is to protect or \u201chide\u201d other systems from  enemy radars. The EA-18G with the NGJ is also intended to be used for  other purposes, such as communications jamming.

In addition, DOD\u2019s JCIDS Manual directs that initial  capabilities documents, which describe capability gaps that require a  materiel solution, identify proposed capability requirements for which  there exists overlaps or redundancies. Initial capabilities documents  should also assess whether the overlap is advisable for operational  redundancy or whether it should be evaluated as a potential trade-off or  alternative to satisfy identified capability gaps. The manual also states  that, when validating key requirements documents, the chair of the group  responsible for that capability area is also certifying that the proposed  requirements and capabilities are not unnecessarily redundant to existing  capabilities in the joint force.

The military services are quick to differentiate their airborne  electronic attack needs and justify individual service, rather than joint or  common, solutions to meet them. While none of the new programs  planned duplicate NGJ capabilities, new areas of overlap and potential  duplication could emerge as these plans continue to evolve. Redundancy  in some of these areas may, in fact, be desirable, but pursuing multiple  acquisition efforts to develop similar capabilities can also result in the  same capability gap being filled twice or more, lead to inefficient use of  resources, and contribute to other warfighting needs going unfilled.", "DOD has mechanisms, such as the Electronic Warfare Strategy Report to  Congress, U.S. Strategic Command Annual Electronic Warfare  Assessment, and NGJ capability development document, that it can use  to continue to assess overlap and duplication between the NGJ and other  airborne electronic capabilities at key points in the acquisition process  and communicate its evolving airborne electronic attack investment plans  to Congress. Identifying existing and planned systems across all of the  NGJ\u2019s planned roles in its capability development document could help  ensure that DOD\u2019s analysis of potential overlap and duplication is  complete. Moreover, providing Electronic Warfare Strategy Reports to  Congress as required and incorporating information on potentially  overlapping systems and why such overlap is warranted would provide  Congress with more complete information about the relationship between  electronic warfare programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense take the following two  actions:", "To help ensure that the NGJ does not unnecessarily duplicate existing  or planned capabilities, require the Navy, in coordination with the Joint  Staff, to address overlap and duplication between the NGJ and other  systems in all of its planned roles in the NGJ capability development  document. The NGJ capability development document should identify  the existing and planned systems that the Navy assessed for potential  redundancies to help determine if its analysis was comprehensive.", "To provide Congress complete information about the relationship  between electronic warfare programs, ensure that the Electronic  Warfare Strategy Reports to Congress include information on  potentially overlapping capabilities among systems, such as the NGJ  and Electronically Attack Enabled AESA Radar, CEASAR, Intrepid  Tiger II, and Multi-Function Electronic Warfare, and why that overlap  is warranted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD for review and comment. In its  written comments, which are reprinted in full in appendix II, DOD partially  concurred with our first recommendation and concurred with our second  recommendation. DOD also provided technical comments that were  incorporated as appropriate.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation to address overlap and  duplication between the NGJ and other systems in all of its planned roles  in the NGJ capability development document. DOD responded that it  concurs with the need to continue to assess unnecessary duplication and  redundancy, but it does not concur with including the assessment in the  capability development document. Rather DOD stated that it will address  unnecessary duplication and redundancy in accordance with its existing  processes, such as the Joint Capabilities Integration Development  System (JCIDS), and statutory requirements. DOD explained that  changes it made to the JCIDS process in January 2012 address the  concerns about potential capability overlaps and redundancies raised in  this and other GAO reports. For example, the revised JCIDS manual  emphasized the role of functional capabilities board in assessing potential  unnecessary capability redundancy prior to forwarding a program\u2019s  requirements documents for approval. In addition, DOD stated that the  Joint Staff is further improving these processes through a pending update  to JCIDS that will include increased emphasis on functional area portfolio  management. DOD also reiterated in its comments and in a classified  enclosure that NGJ\u2019s capabilities are not unnecessarily duplicative.", "We acknowledged the existing JCIDS mechanisms that address potential  overlap and duplication in this report and have discussed the value of  effective portfolio management in prior reports. However, as we point out  in our recommendation, documenting the assessments that support these  processes is important because it allows others to determine if DOD\u2019s  analysis was comprehensive. We identified the NGJ capability  development document as the appropriate vehicle to document DOD\u2019s  assessment of potential duplication because DOD already requires that  potential overlap and duplication be considered before the document can  be validated and the program can move forward in the acquisition  process. Finally, while DOD\u2019s current analysis indicates that none of its  current or planned programs duplicate NGJ capabilities, new areas of  overlap and potential duplication could emerge as military service  investment plans continue to evolve.", "DOD concurred with our second recommendation regarding providing  complete information about the relationship between electronic warfare  programs in its Electronic Warfare Strategy Reports to Congress. DOD  did not provide details regarding how it plans to implement this  recommendation.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional  committees, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Army, the  Secretary of the Navy, the Secretary of the Air Force, and the  Commandant of the Marine Corps.

We assessed DOD\u2019s analysis of duplication against DOD\u2019s Joint  Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) Manual.
