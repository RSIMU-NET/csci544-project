GAO was asked to review possible effects of these regulations. This report (1) discusses views on the expected effects of the QM and QRM regulations, and (2) examines the extent of agency planning for reviewing the regulations' effects, among its objectives. GAO's methodologies included identifying and reviewing academic, industry, and federal agency analyses on the expected effects of the regulations.

Lenders that originate QM loans receive certain liability protections.", "Securities collateralized exclusively by residential mortgages that are \u201cqualified residential mortgages\u201d are exempt from risk-retention requirements. The QRM regulations align the QRM definition with QM; thus, securities collateralized solely by QM loans are not subject to risk-retention requirements.", "The analyses GAO reviewed estimated limited effects on the availability of mortgages for most borrowers and that any cost increases (for borrowers, lenders, and investors) would mostly stem from litigation and compliance issues. According to agency officials and observers, the QRM regulations were unlikely to have a significant initial effect on the availability or securitization of mortgages in the current market, largely because the majority of loans originated were expected to be QM loans. However, questions remain about the size and viability of the secondary market for non-QRM-backed securities.", "Agencies have begun planning their reviews of the QM and QRM regulations (due January and commencing December 2019, respectively); however, these efforts have not included elements important for conducting effective retrospective reviews. Federal guidance encourages agencies to preplan their retrospective reviews and carefully consider how best to promote empirical testing of the effects of rules. To varying degrees, the relevant agencies have identified outcomes to examine, potential data sources, and analytical methods. But existing data lack important information relevant to the regulations (such as loan performance or borrower debt to income) and planned data enhancements may not be available before agencies start the reviews. The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB) has proposed expanding Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data reporting requirements, but the earliest that the enhanced data will be available is 2017. Similarly, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) identified how it intends to examine its QM regulations and some potential data sources but has yet to determine how it would measure the effects of these regulations, including metrics, baselines, and analytical methods. Agencies also have not specified how they will conduct their reviews, including determining which data and analytical methods to use. Finalizing plans to retrospectively review the mortgage regulations will position the agencies to better measure the effects of the QM and QRM regulations and identify any unintended consequences. Additionally, the agencies could better understand data limitations and methodological challenges and have sufficient time to develop methods to deal with these limitations and challenges."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["CFPB, HUD, and the six agencies responsible for the QRM regulations should complete plans to review the QM and QRM regulations, including identifying specific metrics, baselines, and analytical methods.

Section  1411 of the Dodd-Frank Act generally requires lenders to make a  reasonable and good faith determination of a consumer\u2019s ability to repay  a residential mortgage loan. According to section 1412 of the Dodd-Frank  Act, a lender is presumed to have satisfied the ability-to-repay  requirement and receives certain protection from liability when it  originates a \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d (QM). To implement the ability-to-repay  and QM provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Bureau of Consumer  Financial Protection (known as CFPB) issued a final rule amending  Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act (TILA).  Regulation Z already had a prohibition against lenders making \u201chigher- priced\u201d mortgage loans without regard to a consumer\u2019s ability to repay the  loan. The final rule\u2014Ability-to-Repay and Qualified Mortgage Standards  (ATR/QM) under the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z), effective in  January 10, 2014\u2014applies expanded ability-to-repay considerations to  most residential mortgage loans and defines QM. The Dodd-Frank Act  also required the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD),  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Department of Agriculture (USDA),  and USDA Rural Housing Service to issue rules to implement the QM  provisions. (For the purposes of this report, we define \u201cQM regulations\u201d as  the segments of the final rules that implement section 1412 of the Dodd- Frank Act.)

The Dodd-Frank Act creates an exception to this  requirement if a mortgage-backed security is collateralized exclusively by  residential mortgages that meet a separate set of criteria (to be defined  by regulators) that are associated with a lower risk of default. Securitized  mortgages that meet these criteria are referred to as \u201cqualified residential  mortgages\u201d (QRM). The risk-retention provision is designed to protect  investors from losses and improve financial stability. To implement the  risk-retention requirements of the Dodd Frank Act, six agencies jointly  issued a final rule\u2014Credit Risk Retention\u2014in December 2014 that,  among other things, defines QRM as equivalent to QM. The rule will be  effective for residential mortgage-backed securities in December 2015  and other asset-backed securities in December 2016.

Similarly, a key challenge in  implementing the QRM provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act was balancing  the goal of protecting investors with preserving access to affordable  mortgage credit.

This process, often referred to as  securitization (see fig. 1), plays an important role in providing capital for  mortgage lending by generating funds that can be used to originate more  loans.

In addition, the enterprises require  that loans they purchase with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80 percent  have a credit enhancement mechanism, such as private mortgage  insurance.

However, CFPB did not generate a similar estimate for high- priced QM loans. Following CFPB\u2019s rule, the credit rating agencies  published credit enhancement adjustments, which are used to offset  potential investor losses due to increased risk of litigation, for high-priced  QM and non-QM loans.

In addition, the future role of the  enterprises in the residential mortgage market has yet to be determined  and the mortgage activities of federal agencies may change (many  proposals have been introduced to change the single-family housing  finance system).

The  QM and QRM regulations provide incentives to originate QM and QRM  loans. For example, originating a QM loan provides litigation protection for  the lender and assignee if the loan is sold to an investor. Similarly,  securitization sponsors are not required to retain any portion of the credit  risk of QRM loans if the securitization exclusively comprises QRM loans.  Should underwriting standards begin to loosen and lenders become more  willing to offer loans that do not meet QM or QRM standards, these  incentives may deter some lenders from loosening standards beyond the  limits specified in the regulations.

For example, CFPB officials said they have  been tracking industry news, reviewing reports from media outlets, and  reviewing reports published by institutions and market participants (such  as credit rating agencies and some lenders) and the Federal Reserve. In  addition, CFPB officials said they have held informal conversations with  lenders at industry events and conferences to obtain their views on the  effects of the QM regulations.
