Some UN organizations establish targets for member state representation, and such positions are classified as geographic positions. GAO's 2006 report found that the State Department (State) could take additional steps to increase U.S. representation. This report examines (1) U.S. representation at five UN organizations; (2) issues affecting the employment of professional staff, including Americans at these organizations; and (3) efforts State has undertaken to increase U.S. representation. GAO analyzed employment data from five UN organizations that comprise over 50 percent of total UN professional staff and interviewed U.S. and UN officials, including 63 Americans employed at the five organizations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In 2009, the United States was underrepresented, based on formal and informal targets, at all five of the UN organizations GAO reviewed--the Secretariat, World Health Organization (WHO), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). This follows general U.S. underrepresentation at most of these organizations from 2006 to 2009. At the four UN organizations that distinguish geographic and nongeographic positions, there was an increase in the percentage of nongeographic professional positions during 2006 to 2009. The United States is not as well represented in nongeographic as geographic positions at FAO and the Secretariat, which could affect future overall U.S. representation. In addition, U.S. representation in policymaking and senior-level positions generally decreased at these UN organizations from 2006 to 2009. The five UN organizations GAO reviewed have challenges that affect the recruitment, hiring, and retention of professional staff, including Americans. Challenges include Americans' lack of proficiency in UN languages, difficulty for spouses to obtain employment in some locations, lengthy hiring processes, and limited opportunities for promotion and professional growth. For example, 45 out of 63 Americans we interviewed identified the lengthy hiring process as a challenge to recruiting and hiring. While these UN organizations have initiated human resource reforms that may address some of the issues, such as efforts to decrease hiring time, it is too early to determine their impact. Since 2006, State has made efforts to increase U.S. representation in the UN, including implementing some of GAO's 2006 recommendations. State has improved its Web site; increased outreach initiatives; begun developing a Web-based database, so interested UN job applicants can receive automatic vacancy announcements; and conducted an informal review of funding JPOs, but it continues to allocate JPOs at only a few UN organizations. State has not assessed the effectiveness of most of its current efforts to increase U.S. representation. Despite State's efforts, many Americans employed at the five organizations learned about UN job opportunities through their own networks, not through State."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Secretary of State (1) include data on U.S. representation in all professional positions in its annual report to Congress, (2) evaluate its ongoing activities to increase U.S. representation, and (3) consider a pilot program to fund Junior Professional Officers (JPO), who are entry-level employees funded by member states, at UN organizations where the United States currently does not have any JPOs. In commenting on a draft of this report, State concurred with GAO's recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Congress has long-standing concerns about U.S.  underrepresentation in some United Nations (UN) organizations. The  equitable representation of Americans at UN organizations is a priority to  Congress in part because the United States is the largest financial  contributor to most of these organizations. According to the State  Department (State), the U.S. agency primarily responsible for leading U.S.  efforts toward achieving equitable U.S. representation in UN  organizations, Americans bring desirable skills, values, and experience  that can have a significant impact on UN organizations\u2019 operational  effectiveness. The UN Charter recognizes the importance of recruiting  staff on as wide a geographic basis as possible. In response, some UN  organizations have created quantitative formulas that establish formal  targets for member state representation. Other UN organizations have  negotiated informal geographic targets with member states or give some  consideration to geographic balance when filling positions. Positions that  count toward these formal or informal targets are referred to in this report  as geographic positions. UN organizations may also employ staff in  professional positions not based on geography, referred to in this report as  nongeographic positions. According to State officials, geographic  positions generally have better job security than the nongeographic  positions. Since 1991, Congress has required the Secretary of State to  provide it with annual reports on whether international organizations with  geographic targets were meeting their targets for Americans and whether  organizations were making a good faith effort to hire more Americans.  Members of Congress have concerns that the United States is  underrepresented with respect to the geographic employment targets set  by several UN organizations. In its 2009 report to Congress, State reported  that many of the 10 UN organizations it reviewed had not met their U.S.  geographic targets.", "In 2006, we reported on U.S. employment at five UN organizations: the UN  Secretariat (the Secretariat); the United Nations Development Program;  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA); the United Nations  Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization; and the Office of the  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). We found  that the United States was underrepresented, or close to the lower end of  its target range with respect to geographic employment targets, at many of  these UN organizations. We also found that UN organizations face several  challenges to recruiting and retaining professional staff, most of which are  outside the U.S. government\u2019s control. In addition, we reported that State  could take additional steps to target candidates for professional positions.  We recommended that State (1) provide more consistent and  comprehensive UN employment information on the State and U.S. Mission  Web sites; (2) expand targeted recruiting and outreach to more  strategically reach populations of Americans that may be qualified for and  interested in entry- and mid-level UN positions; (3) evaluate the costs,  benefits, and trade-offs of maintaining a roster of qualified candidates for  high-priority positions; and (4) evaluate the costs, benefits, and trade-offs  of funding Junior Professional Officers (JPO), who are entry-level  employees funded by member states, where Americans are  underrepresented. State\u2019s Bureau of International Organization Affairs  (IO) is the lead entity responsible for promoting and seeking to increase  U.S. representation at the UN and for implementing State\u2019s requirement to  provide the annual reports to Congress on U.S. representation. State IO  also relies on other bureaus within State, U.S. Missions to the UN, and  other U.S. government agencies to assist with efforts to improve U.S.  representation and support Americans currently employed in the UN.  While State is responsible for promoting and seeking to increase U.S.  representation in the UN, the UN organizations themselves are ultimately  responsible for hiring their employees and achieving equitable  representation.", "In response to your request and to address the concerns discussed above,  we examined (1) U.S. representation at five UN organizations; (2) issues  affecting the recruitment, hiring, and retention of professional staff,  including Americans at these five UN organizations; and (3) efforts State  has undertaken to increase U.S. representation at UN organizations,  including its implementation of our 2006 recommendations.", "To address these objectives, we focused our review on U.S. employment at  five UN organizations: the Secretariat in New York; the IAEA in Vienna;  the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in Rome; and the UNHCR  and World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva. We reviewed three of  these UN organizations in 2006 (the Secretariat, IAEA, and UNHCR) and  selected two additional organizations (FAO and WHO) for this review. We  selected these five organizations because, as of 2009, they had either  formal\u2014the Secretariat, FAO, and WHO\u2014or informal\u2014IAEA and  UNHCR\u2014geographic targets, and together comprise over 50 percent of  total UN organizations\u2019 professional staff. To determine the staffing levels  of Americans in these UN organizations, and how U.S. representation has  changed, we analyzed employment data for 2006 through 2009 that we  obtained from the five UN organizations. For the purpose of this report,  the United States is considered equitably represented if the number of  Americans is within the UN organizations\u2019 geographic target range. We  determined the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  review for the Secretariat, FAO, IAEA and UNHCR, while WHO raised  questions about the reliability of its data. To examine issues affecting the  recruitment, hiring, and retention of Americans at the five UN  organizations, we analyzed documents from these organizations and  interviewed UN human resources officials, 63 Americans employed at the  five UN organizations, and U.S. government officials. The results of our  interviews with the Americans employed at the five UN organizations are  not generalizeable to those organizations or the UN system. To assess  efforts State has undertaken to increase U.S. representation at UN  organizations, we reviewed documents from State, other U.S. agencies,  and the UN. We also interviewed State officials, representatives of U.S.  government agencies, human resources and other staff from the five UN  organizations, and nongovernmental organizations engaged in issues  related to U.S. representation in the UN.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2009 to September  2010, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

The UN system also  encompasses funds and programs, such as the United Nations  Development Program, and specialized agencies, such as FAO. These  funds, programs, and specialized agencies have their own governing  bodies and budgets but follow the guidelines of the UN charter. Article  101 of the UN Charter states that, in recruiting staff, the primary  consideration is to obtain \u201cthe highest standards of efficiency,  competence, and integrity\u201d and recognizes the importance of recruiting  staff on \u201cas wide a geographical basis as possible.\u201d Each UN organization  has its own personnel policies, procedures, and staff rules that it uses to  fulfill these recruitment goals. Generally, UN organizations use a standard  pay scale based on a common job classification system to compensate  their professional staff. Table 1 shows the UN grade scale and the  approximate U.S. government equivalent. UN organizations also have their  own governing bodies composed of member states that provide those  countries with a method of influencing the policies of the organization.", "Of the five agencies we reviewed, four\u2014the Secretariat, FAO, WHO, and  IAEA\u2014have designated positions subject to geographic distribution. The  Secretariat, FAO, and WHO have established formulas to determine  member states\u2019 targets for equitable representation, which consider three  factors: membership status, financial contribution, and population size.  IAEA informally calculates a member state to be underrepresented if its  geographic representation is less than half of its percentage contribution  to the budget. Using this method, we calculated a U.S. target for  geographic representation at IAEA. UNHCR has not established a  quantitative formula or positions subject to geographic representation, but  it acknowledges U.S. concerns regarding the appropriate level of U.S.  representation. According to State\u2019s 2009 report to Congress on U.S.  representation in the UN, State has determined that, for organizations to  which the United States contributes 22 percent, Americans should hold at  least 13 percent of professional positions to be considered equitably  represented.", "Figure 1 shows the number of total staff in geographic and nongeographic  professional positions, in 2006 and 2009, at four UN organizations we  reviewed. Figure 2 shows the number of Americans in geographic and  nongeographic positions at these four UN organizations in 2006 and 2009.

In  doing so, State cooperates with at least 17 federal agencies that have  interests in specific UN organizations. For example, Brookhaven and  Argonne National Laboratories, the U.S. Department of Agriculture  (USDA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) all  play active roles in recruiting Americans to work for IAEA, FAO, and  WHO, respectively. A 1970 executive order assigns the Secretary of State  responsibility for leading and coordinating the federal government\u2019s  efforts to increase and improve U.S. participation in international  organizations through transfers and details for federal employees. The  order further calls for each agency in the executive branch \u201cto the  maximum extent feasible\u201d promote details and transfers to international  organizations through measures such as (1) notifying well-qualified agency  employees of vacancies in international organizations and (2) upon  request of an appropriate authority, providing international organizations  with detailed assessments of the qualifications of employees being  considered for specific positions. Some U.S. agencies allow for  secondments, in which the agency\u2019s employees are detailed to a UN  organization for a certain period of time, while the U.S. agency pays the  salaries, benefits, and other allowances for these secondees. The  Department of Health and Human Services has about 45 officials, usually  from CDC, seconded to WHO worldwide. Similarly, Argonne and  Brookhaven National Laboratories currently have 25 American CFEs  working at IAEA, according to these agencies\u2019 officials.

These issues range from challenges related to the organizations\u2019  human resource policies and practices, such as policies limiting hiring  opportunities, to the particular situations of individual candidates, such as  whether they have proficiency in more than one UN language. Our 2001  and 2006 reports identified similar types of human resource challenges.  These challenges are as follows:    American candidates lack proficiency in more than one UN language.", "UN organizations face challenges finding qualified Americans who  sometimes lack proficiency in more than one UN language, a requirement  for many UN organizations. For example, a FAO human resources official  said that, while most other nationals know at least two languages,  Americans and Japanese particularly struggle to meet FAO\u2019s language  requirement. As a result, for unrepresented and underrepresented  countries, FAO is working on reducing the barrier created by lack of  another foreign language by offering language training once the candidate  is hired. U.S. Mission officials in New York and Geneva also commented  that many Americans are at a disadvantage in competing for UN jobs  because they lack knowledge of multiple languages. UNHCR human  resources officials said that knowledge of English, French, and one other  language is important for the organization, particularly for promotion, and  Americans experience difficulties in meeting this requirement.", "Difficulty obtaining spousal employment. At the four UN organizations  located in Europe, many spouses of American employees have difficulty  finding employment, which could contribute to the attrition of American  employees at those organizations. In contrast, citizens of European Union  countries have the right to employment without a work permit in any  European Union country. As we reported in 2006, at many overseas UN  duty stations, work permits can be difficult to obtain, the local economy  may offer few employment opportunities, and knowledge of the local  language may be required. According to a Brookhaven National  Laboratory discussion paper on obstacles to recruiting Americans for  IAEA positions, since \u201cU.S. families tend to have two wage earners, lack of  employment for the spouse represents a loss of wages and the  unemployed spouse can feel unfulfilled.\u201d FAO, UNHCR, and IAEA human  resources officials said that it is difficult for American spouses to get  employed in Rome, Geneva, and Vienna, which is a major challenge for  American candidates and employees. The majority of Americans we spoke  with also identified spousal employment as a challenge to recruiting,  hiring, and retaining Americans in UN organizations. For example, at  IAEA, several Americans said that their spouses gave up jobs to move to  Vienna, and one said that she would leave the organization when her  contract ends if her spouse remained unemployed. U.S. government  officials acknowledge the challenge of spousal employment, and State IO\u2019s  Web site now has a booklet with resources for families seeking  employment abroad. The Brookhaven National Laboratory also plans to  develop resources for spousal employment in Vienna in 2010. The UN  organizations we reviewed allow spousal employment; however, at most  of these organizations, spouses must obtain jobs through the normal  competitive process. FAO and IAEA have explored ideas with other UN  organizations in Rome and Vienna to accommodate spousal employment,  although human resources officials at IAEA said they have not yet been  successful in finding employment for spouses at other UN organizations.  FAO said that it has been designated the lead organization in a pilot  program to negotiate with the Italian government on obtaining work  permits for UN spouses.", "Lengthy hiring process. UN organizations\u2019 lengthy hiring processes can  deter candidates from accepting employment. According to UN human  resources officials, the average hiring process can take from  approximately 6 to 9 months. (See fig. 3 for the average length of the hiring  process at the five UN organizations we reviewed.) As we noted in 2006, a  report from the Secretary-General stated that the average hiring process is  too slow, taking 174 days from the date a vacancy announcement is issued  to the date a candidate is selected. An independent external evaluation of  FAO in 2007 found that FAO\u2019s recruitment processes were slow, complex,  and overly centralized. Human resources officials at FAO and the  Secretariat acknowledged that lengthy hiring times cause problems  because applicants find work elsewhere while waiting to hear from the UN  organization. Human resources officials at the Secretariat and WHO also  said that the lengthy hiring process can cause some hiring managers to  circumvent the process by hiring people on short-term contracts. For  example, at WHO, candidates can obtain temporary contracts of less than  6 months without having to go through the competitive hiring process. Of  the 63 Americans we spoke with, 45 identified the length of the hiring  process as a challenge to recruitment and hiring. Most of the organizations  we reviewed are working on initiatives to decrease average hiring time at  their organizations. For instance, IAEA is preparing to implement an  initiative to reduce the hiring time to 15 weeks by advertising job  vacancies for a shorter period of time and having hiring managers review  applications as they come in, rather than after the vacancy announcement  has closed. In response to the independent external evaluation, FAO has  begun streamlining its hiring process, for instance, eliminating the  \u201conerous\u201d requirement to enter data on all job applicants, regardless of  whether they meet the job qualifications.", "Limited opportunity for promotion and professional growth. According  to many Americans employed at the five UN organizations, limited  opportunities for promotion and professional growth present a challenge  to retaining Americans. Promotion is generally achieved by applying to a  new position at a higher grade level rather than through the  reclassification of one\u2019s current position. For example, IAEA human  resources officials said that only about 5 percent of promotions at each  grade level occur through the reclassification of a position to a higher  grade-level and that the primary means of moving to a higher grade level is  by competing for a new position. Likewise, at WHO, promotion occurs  through applying for a new job at a higher grade level, although human  resources officials said that their human resource reform initiatives will  change the promotion process. Human resources officials at FAO also told  us about the limited availability for promotion at their organization, where  24 percent of staff have been in the same job or grade level for 8 or more  years. At UNHCR, a 2008 survey of headquarters and field staff found that  only 23 percent of staff surveyed thought that promotion at UNHCR was  based on merit.", "Low or unclear benefits or compensation. Officials at three of the five UN  organizations said that either their organizations could do a better job  explaining their employment benefits to prospective employees or that  low compensation makes it difficult to recruit and retain Americans. At  FAO, for example, vacancy announcements do not provide consistent  information on benefits and salary. Some FAO announcements provide a  link to the general Web site of the International Civil Service Commission  (ICSC), some provide a link to the specific ICSC Web page that has  information on salaries and benefits, and some only provide the salary  range without giving any information on other employment benefits.  Representatives of the staff association at FAO said that benefit and salary  information is not clear when applying for FAO positions and even  difficult to obtain after being hired. FAO human resources officials  acknowledged that it could be helpful to provide more compensation and  benefits information in their vacancy announcements. At IAEA, a human  resources official explained that it is difficult for people outside the  organization to understand all of the benefits of UN employment, which  vary significantly from candidate to candidate. For example, people often  do not understand that their salary at IAEA would be composed of a base  salary plus a post-adjustment that depends on the location where they will  be working. IAEA provides prospective employees with a link to a salary  estimation calculator created by the United Nations Development Program  that allows them to estimate items such as the post-adjustment, as well as  dependency and hardship allowances but does not include information on  other benefits, such as education grants. The U.S. government provides  prospective UN employees with some information on UN benefits and  salary. For instance, some Americans at IAEA said that Brookhaven  National Laboratory\u2019s Web site provides helpful information on salary and  benefits. State IO\u2019s Web site also provides a general list of the UN\u2019s  benefits.", "Noncompetitive practices. The 2007 independent external evaluation of  FAO found a strong and consistent perception among FAO staff that the  appointment process for FAO representatives lacks transparency and  results in politicized appointments. Additionally, the Office of the UN  Ombudsman and Mediation Services reported in 2009 that it received  cases from individuals who said that the recruitment and selection  processes in the UN lacked rigor and were not transparent. Of the 63  American employees at the five UN organizations we interviewed, 28 said  that noncompetitive human resource practices at their organizations  present challenges to recruitment, hiring, and retention. Some Americans  expressed the perception that friends and fellow nationals help each other  within their organization. Other Americans also noted that some UN  officials have ways to bypass an organization\u2019s procedures and policies, or  vacancy announcements appear to be written for specific candidates.  Several Americans at IAEA expressed the perception that promotion  based on merit is almost nonexistent and that Americans who start at the  entry to midcareer level cannot move up through the organization.  UNHCR\u2019s Office of the Ombudsman reported in 2009 that, in its opinion,  UNHCR had failed to come up with a methodology for promotion that staff  see as credible and fair. However, several Americans said that the hiring  process at their organizations were rigid with many steps or were very  competitive processes. UN human resources officials described  competitive recruitment processes for professional staff\u2014 such as  selection panels composed of officials from various parts of the  organization, interviews, and tests\u2014while also needing to be responsive to  organizations\u2019 commitments to gender and geographic diversity.", "Preference for hiring internal candidates. As we reported in 2006,  increased recruitment and hiring of U.S. candidates may be difficult  because some UN organizations give preference to internal candidates.  For example, both the Secretariat and UNHCR have human resource  policies that give priority to internal job candidates, which could make it  more difficult for external applicants to obtain jobs. All of the Americans  we spoke to at the Secretariat and UNHCR perceived limited opportunities  for external candidates to be a barrier to hiring. The Secretariat\u2019s human  resources officials said that, prior to a recent change, the Secretariat\u2019s  policy ensured that hiring managers reviewed internal candidates\u2019  applications for vacancies 30 to 45 days prior to those submitted by  external candidates. One path for external candidates to be hired into  entry-level positions at the Secretariat involves taking the National  Competitive Recruitment Exam, which the Secretariat offers to candidates  in underrepresented countries such as the United States. However, of the  240 Americans invited to take the exam, only 9 were hired on average each  year between 2006 and 2009. (See fig. 4.)", "Required mobility or rotation. UNHCR requires most professional staff to  change posts every few years, while IAEA requires the majority of its  regular staff to leave the agency after 5 to 7 years. UNHCR expects its staff  to be mobile and work in different locations worldwide during their  career. At IAEA, the organization\u2019s position is that the rotation policy  provides it with a continuous influx of new knowledge and experience.  However, such a policy may dissuade some Americans from accepting or  staying in a UN position because moves to different locations may cause  disruptions to personal or family life. A majority of Americans we  interviewed at UNHCR and IAEA indicated that required mobility or  rotation is a challenge to recruitment, hiring, and retention. At UNHCR,  officials said that the hardship of rotation is a major challenge for the  organization, and the frequent reassignment of staff can destabilize  families and also causes staff to feel insecure about their career  development. Most Americans we spoke with at IAEA cited the policy  requiring rotation out of the organization as a primary reason why  Americans leave IAEA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "UN Organizations Are Currently Implementing Human Resources Reform Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["The five UN organizations we reviewed have initiated or are in the process  of implementing a variety of human resource reforms that may lessen  some of the human resource challenges affecting the recruitment, hiring,  and retention of Americans and other nationals.

For instance, initiatives to reform the performance management processes  could help address concerns over promotion processes and perception of  limited professional growth in the UN organizations we reviewed.  According to UN officials, many of these reforms have recently been  completed or are still under way. For example, contract reforms to  consolidate the different types of contracts at the Secretariat went into  effect in July 2009, although agreement on the terms of one type of  contract, the continuing appointment, has yet to be reached by the General  Assembly. UNHCR officials said that they are waiting for the General  Assembly\u2019s decision on this type of appointment before finishing UNHCR\u2019s  own contract reforms.

In 2006, we reported that State, U.S.  Missions, and agency Web sites had limited information on UN  employment opportunities. For example, the Web site did not provide a  means for applicants to obtain more specific information on their  expected total compensation, which may hamper a candidate\u2019s ability to  decide whether a UN position is in his or her best interest. Since 2007,  State has provided more information on its Web site, such as information  on UN benefits and compensation; an updated and expanded fact sheet on  UN employment; and information on resources for spousal employment.", "Expanded recruitment activities. In 2006, we reported that State\u2019s  recruitment and outreach efforts did not reach some potential applicants.  State officials attended career fairs and other conferences to discuss UN  employment opportunities with attendees, but they had not taken  advantage of other opportunities to expand the audience for their  outreach activities.

In 2006, we reported that  State no longer maintained a roster of qualified American candidates for  professional and technical positions. Other U.S. government and UN  officials informed us that some countries maintained rosters of  prescreened, qualified candidates for UN positions and that this practice  was an effective strategy for promoting their nationals. In August 2010,  State officials noted that they were in the process of finalizing the  implementation of a roster database, in which people interested in UN  jobs could self-populate information about their skills and interests, then  receive an automated e-mail listing relevant UN organizations\u2019 vacancy  announcements.", "In addition, the U.S. Missions to the UN in New York, Rome, Geneva, and  Vienna work with State IO to promote U.S. employment.

According to U.S. and UN officials,  U.S. Missions to the UN have open dialogues with UN organizations\u2019  human resources officials to promote the U.S. presence at these  organizations. For example, the U.S. Mission to the UN in Rome has  provided lists of professional associations to FAO officials to identify  targeted groups of American candidates. State IO officials told us that, in  their meetings with Americans employed by UN organizations, they found  that many Americans were interested in a forum where they could discuss  concerns with other Americans. In 2008, State IO requested that the U.S.  Missions intensify their efforts to improve support of Americans working  at UN organizations by maintaining active and open communication with  them, such as regularly holding events to foster relationships. However,  we found that different U.S. Missions provided different levels of support.  For example, the U.S. Mission in Rome has periodically hosted meetings  for Americans employed at UN organizations there to discuss their  common concerns, but the U.S. Mission in New York has not held such a  meeting, which some American employees of the Secretariat we  interviewed noted would be beneficial. Several American employees of UN  organizations in Geneva said they experienced problems overseas, but  they did not have the means for seeking out other Americans in order to  share information.

For example,  State, through Argonne National Laboratory, has been working on a survey  to determine the effectiveness of current IAEA recruitment efforts.  However, State has not assessed the effectiveness of most of its efforts to  increase U.S. representation. For instance, despite the increased number  of outreach events State officials attend, State does not survey the  attendees to determine ways to improve its presentation of information.  Recognizing the need to understand recruitment problems at IAEA,  Brookhaven National Laboratory convened a workshop with participants  who have expertise in the technical area or with recruitment issues, to  discuss ways in which the laboratory can increase U.S. representation. The  report resulting from the workshop provided specific recommendations,  such as polling Americans currently working at IAEA to gather  information about how they learned about IAEA. State has not conducted  such formal analysis of its approach to increasing American presence in  UN organizations overall. In its fiscal year 2011 Bureau Strategic Plan,  State IO has a performance indicator of the average percentage of  Americans as part of UN organizations\u2019 workforce in geographic positions.  As discussed earlier, in 2009, the United States was underrepresented in all  five UN organizations we reviewed. State officials\u2019 position remains that it  is difficult to make a direct link between current or proposed efforts by  the department and the number of Americans ultimately hired by the UN  because of the many factors that State cannot control. For example,  interested American candidates may not attend State\u2019s outreach events  and may not be aware of State IO\u2019s Web site.

Such an evaluation would help  determine which UN organization the United States should prioritize in  terms of increasing U.S. employment by funding JPOs. We noted that the  assessment would also involve weighing the trade-offs between funding  JPOs and other agency programs. According to a State official, State did  not conduct its own formal assessment of funding JPOs. Instead, its  informal review of funding the JPO program consisted of relying on and  agreeing with the findings of a 2008 JIU report that reviewed JPO  programs across the UN system. The JIU report noted that countries may  use the JPO program as a tool to remedy their underrepresentation in UN  organizations, and UN organizations have high retention rates of JPOs.

State does not currently make determinations about how to prioritize  which UN organization could benefit most from having JPOs. The overall  result is that State has funded as many as 11 JPOs at one UN organization  and none at some other organizations that may benefit from having JPOs.  For example, in 2009, 39 countries sponsored 248 JPOs at the Secretariat,  with no representation from the United States where the Secretariat  headquarters is located.

However, State\u2019s lack of information on the  effectiveness of its current efforts limits State\u2019s ability to modify its  approach by expanding on its best practices and eliminating ineffective  activities. The JPO program represents one area with the potential for  positive impact on improving U.S. representation at the UN; however,  State allocates JPOs at only a few UN organizations. Furthermore,  geographic positions only represent a subset of the overall level of  employment at UN organizations. Examining employment data for both  geographic and nongeographic positions shows the UN organizations in  which the United States may have an even more difficult time achieving  equitable representation. Although State\u2019s recruitment efforts are directed  at increasing U.S. representation without regard to geographic or  nongeographic positions, its current reporting does not capture important  trends of U.S. representation in UN organizations.
