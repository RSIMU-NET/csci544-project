The Compact provided about $2.1 billion in U.S. funds, supplied by the Department of the Interior, over 17 years (1987-2003) to the FSM and the RMI. These funds were intended to advance economic development. In a past report, GAO found that this assistance did little to advance economic development in either country, and accountability over funding was limited. The Compact also established U.S. defense rights and obligations in the region and allowed for migration from both countries to the United States. The three parties recently renegotiated expiring economic assistance provisions of the Compact in order to provide an additional 20 years of assistance (2004-2023). In addition, the negotiations addressed defense and immigration issues. The House International Relations and Resources Committees requested that GAO report on Compact negotiations. This testimony discusses negotiated changes to the levels and structure of future assistance, including the potential cost to the U.S. government. Further, it reviews accountability, defense, and immigration changes brought about by the amended Compacts and related agreements."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The amended Compacts of Free Association between the United States and the FSM and the RMI to renew expiring U.S. assistance could potentially cost the U.S. government about $6.6 billion in new authorizations from the Congress. Of this amount, $3.5 billion would cover payments over a 20-year period (2004-2023), while $3.1 billion represents payments for U.S. military access to Kwajalein Atoll in the RMI for the years 2024 through 2086. While the level of annual grant assistance to both countries would decrease each year, contributions to trust funds--meant to eventually replace grant funding--would increase annually by a comparable amount. Nevertheless, at an assumed annual 6 percent rate of return, earnings from the FSM trust fund would be unable to replace expiring grant assistance in 2024, while earnings from the RMI trust fund would encounter the same problem by 2040. The amended Compacts strengthen reporting and monitoring measures that could improve accountability over assistance, if diligently implemented. These measures include the following: assistance grants would be targeted to priority areas such as health and education; annual reporting and consultation requirements would be expanded; and funds could be withheld for noncompliance with grant terms and conditions. The successful implementation of the many new accountability provisions will require appropriate resources and sustained commitment from the United States, the FSM, and the RMI. Regarding defense, U.S. military access to Kwajalein Atoll in the RMI would be extended from 2016 through 2066, with an option to extend through 2086. Finally, Compact provisions addressing immigration have been strengthened. For example, FSM and RMI citizens entering the United States would need to carry a passport, and the U.S. Attorney General could, through regulations, specify the time and conditions of admission to the United States for these citizens."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to testify on the Compact of Free  Association between the United States and the Pacific Island nations of  the Federated States of Micronesia, or the FSM, and the Republic of the  Marshall Islands, or the RMI. In 1986, the United States entered into this  compact with the two countries after almost 40 years of administering the  islands under the United Nations Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. The  Compact has provided U.S. assistance to the FSM and the RMI in the form  of direct funding as well as federal services and programs for almost 17  years. Further, the Compact establishes U.S. defense rights and obligations  in the region and allows for migration from both countries to the United  States. Provisions of the Compact that address economic assistance were  scheduled to expire in 2001; however, they can remain and have remained  in effect while the United States and each nation renegotiated the affected  provisions.", "Today I will discuss our review of the amended Compacts and related  agreements that the United States signed with the FSM and the RMI in  April and May of 2003, respectively. (According to a Department of State  official, while the original Compact was one document that applied to both  the FSM and the RMI, the Compact that has been amended is now a  separate Compact with each nation.) Specifically, I will discuss changes to  levels and structure of future assistance, including the potential cost to the  U.S. government. Further, I will comment on changes in accountability  and other key issues addressed in the amended Compacts and related  agreements. Our testimony is based on our reports on the Compact  published over the past several years as well as our assessment of the  amended Compacts that was requested by Chairman Leach and Ranking  Minority Member Faleomavaega, Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific,  House Committee on International Relations; Ranking Minority Member  Lantos, House Committee on International Relations; Ranking Minority  Member Rahall, House Committee on Resources; and Congressman  Bereuter."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In 1986, the United States and the FSM and the RMI entered into the  Compact of Free Association. This Compact represented a new phase of  the unique and special relationship that has existed between the United  States and these island areas since World War II. It also represented a  continuation of U.S. rights and obligations first embodied in a U.N.  trusteeship agreement that made the United States the Administering  Authority of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. The Compact  provided a framework for the United States to work toward achieving its  three main goals: (1) to secure self-government for the FSM and the RMI,  (2) to assist the FSM and the RMI in their efforts to advance economic  development and self-sufficiency, and (3) to ensure certain national  security rights for all of the parties. The first goal has been met. The FSM  and the RMI are independent nations and are members of international  organizations such as the United Nations.", "The second goal of the Compact \u2013 advancing economic development and  self-sufficiency for both countries \u2013 was to be accomplished primarily  through U.S. direct financial payments (to be disbursed and monitored by  the U.S. Department of the Interior) to the FSM and the RMI. For the 15- year period covering 1987 through 2001, funding was provided at levels  that decreased every 5 years. For 2002 and 2003, while negotiations to  renew expiring Compact provisions were ongoing, funding levels  increased to equal an average of the funding provided during the previous  15 years. Thus, funds available to the two governments were \u201cbumped-up\u201d  during the last 2 years of assistance. For 1987 through 2003, U.S.  assistance to the FSM and the RMI to support economic development is  estimated on the basis of Interior data, to be about $2.1 billion. We have  found that many Compact-funded projects in the FSM and the RMI  experienced problems because of poor planning and management,  inadequate construction and maintenance, or misuse of funds. Further the  U.S., FSM, and RMI governments provided little accountability over  Compact expenditures and have not ensured that funds were spent  effectively or efficiently.", "Economic self-sufficiency has not been achieved. Although total U.S.  assistance (Compact direct funding as well as U.S. programs and services)  as a percentage of total government revenue has fallen in both countries  (particularly in the FSM), the two nations remain highly dependent on U.S.  funds. U.S. direct assistance has maintained standards of living that are  higher than could be achieved in the absence of U.S. support. In addition,  U.S. programs have been extended to the FSM and the RMI to provide a  wide range of critical services, such as health care, education,  telecommunications, and job training, but in most cases local conditions  have impaired the programs\u2019 effectiveness.", "The third goal of the Compact \u2013 securing national security rights for all  parties \u2013 has been achieved. At the time that the Compact was negotiated,  the United States was concerned about the use of the islands of the FSM  and the RMI as \u201cspringboards for aggression\u201d against the United States, as  they had been used in World War II, and the Cold War incarnation of this  threat \u2013 the Soviet Union. The Compact and its related agreements  established several key defense rights for all three countries. The Compact  obligates the United States to defend the FSM and the RMI against an  attack or the threat of attack in the same way it would defend its own  citizens. The Compact also provides the United States with the right of  \u201cstrategic denial,\u201d the ability to prevent access to the islands and their  territorial waters by the military personnel of other countries or the use of  the islands for military purposes. In addition, the Compact grants the  United States a \u201cdefense veto\u201d over actions by the FSM or the RMI  governments that the United States determines are incompatible with its  authority and responsibility for security and defense matters in these  countries. Finally, through a Compact-related agreement, the United States  secured continued access to military facilities on Kwajalein Atoll in the  RMI through 2016. In a previous report, we identified Kwajalein Atoll as  the key U.S. defense interest in the two countries. Of these rights, only the  defense veto is due to expire in 2003 if not renegotiated.", "Another aspect of the special relationship between the FSM and the RMI  and the United States involves the unique immigration rights that the  Compact grants. Through the original Compact, citizens of both nations  are allowed to live and work in the United States as \u201cnonimmigrants\u201d and  can stay for long periods of time, with few restrictions. Further, the  Compact exempted FSM and RMI citizens from meeting U.S. passport,  visa, and labor certification requirements when entering the United States.  In recognition of the potential adverse impacts that Hawaii and nearby  U.S. commonwealths and territories could face as a result of an influx of  FSM and RMI citizens, the Congress authorized Compact impact payments  to address the financial impact of these nonimmigrants on Guam, Hawaii,  and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). By  1998, more than 13,000 FSM and RMI citizens had made use of the  Compact immigration provisions and were living in the three areas. The  governments of the three locations have provided the U.S. government  with annual Compact nonimmigrant impact estimates; for example, in  2000 the total estimated impact for the three areas was $58.2 million. In  that year, Guam received $7.58 million in impact funding, while the other  two areas received no funding.", "In the fall of 1999, the United States and the two Pacific Island nations  began negotiating economic assistance and defense provisions of the  Compact that were due to expire. Immigration issues were also addressed.  According to the State Department, the aims of the amended Compacts are  to (1) continue economic assistance to advance self-reliance, while  improving accountability and effectiveness; (2) continue the defense  relationship, including a 50-year lease extension (beyond 2016) of U.S.  military access to Kwajalein Atoll in the RMI; (3) strengthen immigration  provisions; and (4) provide assistance to lessen the impact of Micronesian  migration on Hawaii, Guam, and the CNMI."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Amended Compacts Would Alter Assistance Levels and Structure", "paragraphs": ["Under the amended Compacts with the FSM and the RMI, new  congressional authorizations of approximately $3.5 billion in funding  would be required over the next 20 years, with a total possible  authorization through 2086 of $6.6 billion.

Under the U.S. proposals, annual grant  amounts to each country would be reduced each year in order to  encourage budgetary self-reliance and transition the countries from  receiving annual U.S. grant funding to receiving annual trust fund earnings.

Annual grant assistance to the RMI would fall from a real value of $35  million to a real value of $24 million over the same period.

The share of new authorizations to the FSM would be about $2.3 billion  and would end after fiscal year 2023. The share of new authorizations to  the RMI would be about $1.2 billion for the first 20 years, with about $300  million related to extending U.S. military access to Kwajalein Atoll through  2023. Further funding of $3.1 billion for the remainder of the period  corresponds to extended grants to Kwajalein and payments related to U.S.  military use of land at Kwajalein Atoll. The cost of this $6.6 billion new  authorization, expressed in fiscal year 2004 U.S. dollars, would be $3.8  billion (see the appendix for a breakout of estimated new U.S.  authorizations to the FSM and the RMI in fiscal year 2004 U.S. dollars).", "This new authorized funding would be provided to each country in the  form of    annual grant funds targeted to priority areas (such as health, education,  and infrastructure), audit assistance, and disaster assistance;   contributions to a trust fund for each country such that trust fund earnings  would become available to the FSM and the RMI in fiscal year 2024 to  replace expiring annual grants;   payments the U.S. government makes to the RMI government that the RMI  transfers to Kwajalein landowners to compensate them for the U.S. use of  their lands for defense sites; and    an extension of federal services that have been provided under the original  Compact but are due to expire in fiscal year 2003.", "In addition to the new authorized funding, the U.S. government has further  expenditures related to the FSM and the RMI.

The real value of grants per capita to the RMI  would begin at an estimated $627 in fiscal year 2004 and would further  decrease to an estimated $303 in fiscal year 2023.

For example, the  FSM is likely to experience fiscal pressures in 2004, when the value of  Compact grant assistance drops in real terms by 8 percent relative to the  2001 level (a reduction equal to 3 percent of GDP). For the RMI, however,  the proposed level of Compact grant assistance in 2004 would actually be  8 percent higher in real terms than the 2001 level (an increase equal to 3  percent of GDP). According to the RMI, this increase would likely be  allocated largely to the infrastructure investment budget and would  provide a substantial stimulus to the economy in the first years of the new  Compact.", "Challenges to achieving economic self-sustainability in the long run remain  significant for both countries. First, education and health indicators show  the need to improve basic services in these areas, as the nations face  challenges with regard to literacy rates, high birth rates, and access to safe  water. Second, private sector employment is largely made up of services  and distribution activities that support the public sector such that  employment prospects are uncertain, given declining U.S. assistance.  Third, private sector growth, which would rely on expanded exports and a  growing tourism industry, is limited by constraining factors common to  small island economies, such as limited domestic markets, a narrow  resource base, and a lack of infrastructure. Fourth, socioeconomic  activities, infrastructure, and population may be vulnerable to the impacts  of climate change because the two countries could experience coastal  inundation, more frequent droughts and floods, and increases in tropical  cyclone intensities that could damage transport infrastructure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Trust Funds May Be Insufficient to Replace Expiring Grants", "paragraphs": ["Given the challenges for achieving economic self-sustainability, the  amended Compacts were designed to build trust funds that, beginning in  fiscal year 2024, yield annual earnings to replace grant assistance that ends  in 2023.

In designing the  trust funds, the State Department assumed that the trust fund would earn  a 6 percent rate of return. The amended Compacts do not address  whether trust fund earnings should be sufficient to cover expiring federal  services, but they do create a structure that sets aside earnings above 6  percent, should they occur, that could act as a buffer against years with  low or negative trust fund returns. Importantly, whether the estimated  value of the proposed trust funds would be sufficient to replace grants or  create a buffer account would depend on the rate of return that is realized  (see table 2).", "If the trust funds earn a 6 percent rate of return, then the FSM trust fund  would yield a return of $57 million in fiscal year 2023, an amount  insufficient to replace expiring grants by an estimated value of $27 million.

In sum, most of our  recommendations regarding future Compact assistance have been  addressed with the introduction of strengthened accountability measures  in the signed amended Compacts and related agreements.

In both countries, 5 percent of the amount dedicated to  infrastructure, combined with a matching amount from the island  governments, would be placed in an infrastructure maintenance fund. We  recommended in a September 2000 report that the U.S. government should  negotiate provisions that would provide future Compact funding through  grants targeted to priority areas and that funding should be set aside for  infrastructure maintenance.", "Compact-related agreements with both countries (the so-called \u201cfiscal  procedures agreements\u201d) would establish a joint economic management  committee for the FSM and the RMI that would meet at least once  annually.

In our previously cited  2000 report, we recommended that the U.S. government negotiate an  expanded agenda for future annual consultations.

General terms and conditions for the grants  would include conformance to plans, strategies, budgets, project  specifications, architectural and engineering specifications, and  performance standards.

Specific post-award requirements address  financial administration by establishing, for example, (1) improved  financial reporting, accounting records, internal controls, and budget  controls; (2) appropriate use of real property and equipment; and (3)  competitive and well-documented procurement. In our 2000 report, we  recommended that future assistance be provided with grants that had  specific requirements.", "The United States could withhold payments if either country fails to  comply with grant terms and conditions. The withholding amount would  be proportional to the breach of the term or condition. In addition, funds  could be withheld if the FSM or RMI governments do not cooperate in U.S.  investigations regarding whether Compact funds have been used for  purposes other than those set forth in the amended Compacts. In our 2000  report, we recommended that withholding of funds be allowed.", "The fiscal procedures agreements would require numerous reporting  requirements for the two countries. For example, each country must  prepare strategic planning documents that are updated regularly, annual  budgets that propose sector expenditures and performance measures,  annual reports to the U.S. President regarding the use of assistance,  quarterly and annual financial reports, and quarterly grant performance  reports. In our 2000 report, we recommended that expanded reporting  requirements be negotiated.", "The amended Compacts\u2019 trust fund management agreements would grant  the U.S. government control over trust fund management: The United  States would appoint three members, including the chairman, to a  committee to administer the trust funds, while the FSM or the RMI would  appoint two members.
