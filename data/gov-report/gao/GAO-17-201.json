Since then, the U.S. government has restored diplomatic relations with Cuba and modified some aspects of the U.S. embargo. The Cuban government has also implemented economic reforms in recent years to allow for certain private sector activity. While much of Cuba's economy is still state-controlled and the U.S. embargo on Cuba remains in place, developments in recent years have created new opportunities for U.S. economic engagement with Cuba.", "This report examines what is known about (1) the size and scope of the Cuban private sector, (2) the effect of changes to U.S. legal and regulatory restrictions on the Cuban private sector and U.S. businesses, and (3) the extent to which the U.S. government has planned and implemented activities to increase U.S. engagement with the Cuban private sector and expand U.S. economic opportunities in Cuba.

However, the Cuban private sector is smaller than in 16 comparable countries GAO analyzed. It is also still highly constrained by the Cuban government and faces challenges, including a lack of access to needed supplies and equipment.", "U.S. regulatory changes have created some new opportunities in Cuba, but economic engagement is still limited. The U.S. government has made six sets of regulatory changes since December 2014 to ease restrictions on travel, remittances, financial services, and trade with Cuba. For example, the Department of Commerce created a new export license exemption to facilitate U.S. exports that support the Cuban people, including the private sector. The regulatory changes have generated U.S. business interest; however, relatively few commercial deals have been completed. In addition, U.S. trade with Cuba has decreased, driven by declining agricultural exports, which have been legal since 2000. Changes in remittance and travel regulations are expected to benefit the Cuban private sector through increased capital and purchases from U.S. visitors. Although the regulatory changes have created some new opportunities for U.S. businesses and the Cuban private sector, embargo restrictions and Cuban government barriers continue to limit U.S.-Cuba economic engagement.", "U.S. agencies have conducted a range of activities to support U.S. policy changes; however, embargo restrictions, resource constraints, and Cuban government priorities affect their ability to support U.S. businesses or engage the Cuban private sector. Within these limitations, the Department of State (State) and other U.S. agencies have engaged with the Cuban government, U.S. businesses, and the Cuban private sector. Among other things, they have established memoranda of understanding with the Cuban government, hosted events with Cuban entrepreneurs, and promoted training opportunities. However, U.S. agencies have not collected and documented key information on the Cuban economy, the effects of regulatory changes, and agency activities, in accordance with federal standards for internal control.

Under the new approach, the U.S.  government has reestablished diplomatic relations with Cuba; removed  Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terrorism; and reduced restrictions  on travel, remittances, and commerce. The President also stated his  intent to take a number of steps designed to support the Cuban people,  including Cuba\u2019s emerging private sector, which has grown as the Cuban  government has implemented some market-oriented reforms and granted  greater economic freedoms to Cuban citizens. However, much of Cuba\u2019s  economy remains controlled by the state, and information about the  Cuban private sector is more limited than for most countries. In addition,  many U.S. legal restrictions on economic activity with Cuba remain. As a  result, policymakers have raised questions regarding the size and scope  of the Cuban private sector and the extent to which the U.S. government  and U.S. businesses could effectively engage with Cuba.", "You asked us to review U.S. government activities to support the Cuban  private sector and facilitate U.S. businesses\u2019 economic engagement in  Cuba.

To assess the reliability of Cuban employment data,  we interviewed U.S. officials and Cuba experts familiar with the data and  examined how the data had been used in other assessments of the  Cuban economy. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of this report. We also conducted interviews with U.S.  officials, experts on Cuba, U.S. business association officials, and  representatives from the Cuban embassy in Washington, D.C., to gain  additional information on the Cuban private sector, including key factors  affecting its development. To examine the effect of changes to U.S. legal  and regulatory restrictions related to Cuba on the Cuban private sector  and U.S. businesses, we analyzed relevant laws and regulations  governing the U.S. embargo on Cuba and interviewed agency officials,  U.S. business association officials, and Cuban private sector  representatives. In addition, we analyzed U.S. government reports,  strategies, and other documents and interviewed U.S. government  officials to identify steps agencies have taken to plan and implement  activities to increase U.S. engagement with the Cuban private sector and  expand U.S. economic opportunities in Cuba. In assessing agencies\u2019  efforts to increase economic engagement with the Cuban private sector,  we compared their actions with GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in  the Federal Government.

As a nonmarket economy where the government is largely  responsible for setting prices and wages, it is challenging to assess  Cuba\u2019s economic performance using typical economic indicators. Cuba  also has a dual-currency system that distorts information on the Cuban  economy because multiple exchange rates are used internally within the  country, which results in the mispricing of various transactions, among  other things. In addition, Cuba is not a member of international financial  institutions, such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund,  and is thus not subject to regular reviews of its economy, including its  economic and financial data, as is typical of countries that are members  of these organizations.", "Cuba\u2019s key trading partners are Venezuela, the European Union, and  China.

In November 2015, the Cuban  government published an updated list of 326 projects, for a total of $8.2  billion in foreign investment opportunities. Much of the foreign investment  in Cuba is concentrated in the tourism, energy, and mining sectors.

However, after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991,  these subsidies stopped, and Cuba entered a period of significant  economic hardship. More recently, the Cuban government has relied  heavily on subsidies from Venezuela to support its economy. Among  other things, Venezuela has provided Cuba with around 100,000 barrels  of oil per day, some of which the Cuban government refines and then  sells on the world market to generate hard currency. However, as  Venezuela\u2019s political and economic situation has deteriorated, these  subsidies have reportedly declined. In July 2016, the Cuban government  announced the need to prepare for energy shortages and other economic  challenges.", "The Cuban government controls most sectors of the economy and  employs the majority of the Cuban workforce. In the years after the  Castro regime came to power, the Cuban government shut down most  forms of private sector activity. However, the Cuban government has  periodically allowed some private sector activity.

For example, as shown in figure 6,  the number of licensed cuentapropista workers grew from 142,000 in  2008 to approximately 500,000 in 2015, according to Cuban government  data.", "As shown in figure 7, Cuban government data indicate that as of 2015,  approximately 29 percent of the Cuban workers were employed in the  private sector, an increase of approximately 12 percentage points from  2008. Some analyses we reviewed and experts we interviewed indicated  that at least some of the growth of the Cuban private sector in recent  years has been driven by the formalization of previously unauthorized or  informal private sector activity, rather than the creation of new  employment.", "Although the size of the Cuban private sector has grown since 2008,  there are some indications that this growth has slowed recently. For  example, according to reporting by the Economist Intelligence Unit,  Cuba\u2019s Ministry of Labor and Social Security stated that the number of  licensed cuentapropistas declined in the second half of 2015 after hitting  a high in May 2015. However, the Economist Intelligence Unit reported  that the number of licenses subsequently recovered to previous levels in  the first quarter of 2016. In addition, U.S. officials and experts we  interviewed noted that the Cuban government appears to have slowed  down or even stopped the approval of new nonagricultural cooperatives.  The Cuban government\u2019s plans to shift some employment to the private  sector have also not been fully realized. For example, in 2012, the Cuban  government announced plans to privatize almost 13,000 state-run  eateries and personal service providers; however, as of 2015, only 108 of  these businesses had become operational in the private sector, according  to State officials. More recently, in October 2016, news outlets reported  that the Havana provincial government announced that it was temporarily  halting approvals of new licenses for private restaurants in Havana.", "The U.S. government has not independently analyzed the size and scope  of the Cuban private sector; however, some academic studies have  developed estimates of the size of the Cuban private sector. These  estimates generally found that 25 to 35 percent of the Cuban workforce is  in the private sector. There were some differences in the scope of private  sector activity included in these estimates. For example, some estimates  included joint venture employees in their estimates, while others did not.  Some estimates sought to quantify the number of Cubans who work part  time or unofficially within the private sector; others did not. For example,  one analysis estimated that there are likely between 400,000 to 800,000  Cuban government workers who earn significant private income to  supplement their government salaries.", "Although increasing, the percentage of Cubans working in the private  sector remains small compared to other countries. The ILO maintains a  database that collects information on employment by institutional sector\u2014 public or private\u2014from national statistical agencies. Based on our  analysis of these data, the share of Cuba\u2019s workforce in the private sector  is smaller than in all 16 other countries\u2014for which data were available\u2014 that fall into the same World Bank income category.", "The percentage of Cuba\u2019s workforce in the private sector was  approximately 28 percent in 2014 compared to a median of approximately  83 percent for the other 16 countries (see fig. 8). Most countries in this  income group had a substantially larger share of employment in the  private sector. Of the 16 comparable countries that we reviewed, Belarus  had the next lowest percentage of its workforce in the private sector after  Cuba, with 61 percent of its workforce in the private sector. The  percentage of the Cuban workforce in the private sector was also smaller  than Vietnam, the only other communist country for which the ILO had  data. As of 2014, approximately 89 percent of Vietnam\u2019s workforce was  in the private sector."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Cuban Private Sector Is Still Highly Constrained and Faces Many Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Although Cuban government reforms in recent years have created  additional space for private sector activity, various sources noted that  legal private sector activity is still highly constrained and circumscribed by  the state. For example, in the 2016 Index of Economic Freedom,  compiled by The Heritage Foundation and The Wall Street Journal, Cuba  ranked 177 out of the 178 countries assessed, with only North Korea  rated as less economically free. As described previously, the Cuban  government authorizes private sector activity only in certain prescribed  areas, with many sectors of the economy exclusively reserved for state- owned enterprises or government ministries. Even within authorized  areas, the Cuban private sector faces many limits on its operations and  an array of challenges, given the nature of the Cuban economic system.  Some experts on Cuba have thus questioned the extent to which it is  accurate to consider Cuba\u2019s private sector as being truly private.", "Based on analyses we reviewed and interviews we conducted with U.S.  officials, Cuba experts, and representatives of the Cuban private sector,  we identified a number of challenges that the Cuban private sector faces.  These include the following, among others:", "Lack of access to inputs. According to State and Cuban private  sector representatives, the Cuban government monopolizes the  country\u2019s wholesale distribution system and significantly limits the  Cuban private sector\u2019s access to it. As a result, the Cuban private  sector must frequently purchase inputs in retail rather than wholesale  markets. In addition, the Cuban private sector frequently experiences  challenges obtaining needed inputs for their operations or finds that  the inputs they are able to obtain through official distribution channels  are not of sufficient quality. These challenges extend to a range of  supplies and equipment. For example, Cuban private restaurant  owners have difficulty obtaining a range of items, from fresh produce,  to coffee makers, to lighting fixtures. One cooperative representative  we interviewed stated that private construction workers face  challenges obtaining building materials and construction equipment.", "Inability to directly import or export. The Cuban government  controls all imports and exports in the country. Thus, the Cuban  private sector does not have the ability to directly import or export  items. For example, one representative from the Cuban private sector  we interviewed noted that her company must go through a specific  state trading agency to obtain needed inputs for her business. She  said that her overseas suppliers have at times backed out of  transactions due to this state trading agency\u2019s delays in arranging  procurements. Given these restrictions, many in the private sector  travel abroad themselves or rely on other individuals to bring back  needed items.", "Limited access to financing. The Cuban private sector is also  challenged by its limited ability to access financing. According to State  and USITC reporting and other analyses of the Cuban economy we  reviewed, the Cuban government does not allow private banking, and  the Cuban private sector does not have access to capital markets to  raise funds. As part of reforms announced in 2011, the Cuban  government authorized state banks to make loans to private  businesses; however, these loans are capped at $400. In addition, the  Cuban government prohibits foreign investors from extending loans to  private Cuban businesses.", "Limited legal protection and other legal uncertainties. The Cuban  private sector also faces challenges due to limited legal protections  and other legal uncertainties. For example, U.S. officials, Cuba  experts, and Cuban private sector representatives we interviewed  noted that cuentapropistas do not have legal status as companies and  are treated as individuals under Cuban law, even if they have multiple  employees. The Cuban government also considers nonagricultural  cooperatives to be experimental, with approvals for new  nonagricultural cooperatives taking place at the highest levels of the  state.", "Unfavorable tax structure. According to various sources, the Cuban  government maintains an onerous tax system that discourages private  sector investment and hiring. For example, while cuentapropistas are  allowed to hire workers, their tax rates increase significantly when  hiring more than five workers, which creates disincentives for  business growth, according to State reporting and other sources. In  addition, Cuba\u2019s tax system does not allow cuentapropistas to itemize  their expenses and instead sets standard deductions depending on  the job category, according to U.S. officials and Cuba experts we  interviewed.", "Lack of access to the Internet and other technology. The Cuban  private sector is also challenged by limited access to the Internet,  slow Internet connection speeds, and other technology issues. For  example, the Brookings Institution has reported that fewer than 5  percent of Cubans have regular access to the Internet.", "Infrastructure and other capacity issues. Cuba also faces a range  of infrastructure and capacity issues that affect the private sector. For  example, Cuba has recently implemented power cuts as electricity  demand across the island has surged and fuel supplies from  Venezuela have reportedly declined. In addition, Cuba lacks  refrigerated storage space and refrigerated trucks, which results in  frequent food spoilage.", "Despite these challenges, various analyses of the private sector that we  reviewed and experts and U.S. officials we interviewed noted that many  Cubans in the private sector have successfully created dynamic  businesses that have flourished. For example, officials from one  nonagricultural cooperative reported that earnings for workers had gone  from approximately $100 a month to $2,000 a month after transitioning  from a state-owned enterprise to a cooperative."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "U.S. Regulatory Changes Have Created Some New Opportunities in Cuba, but Economic Engagement Is Still Limited by the Embargo and Cuban Government Restrictions", "paragraphs": ["U.S. regulatory changes have created some new opportunities in Cuba,  but economic engagement is still limited.

These regulatory changes have eased restrictions on travel,  remittances, financial services, and trade with Cuba and have also  allowed for some limited forms of investment by U.S. companies in Cuba.  Key changes include the following:  Travel. Treasury has expanded the scope of travel that is allowed under  some of the 12 categories of travel authorized by TSRA and has  amended the regulations to allow U.S. travelers to use a general license,  which requires no advance approval, for all 12 travel categories rather  than having to apply for a specific license from Treasury prior to travel.  For example, under the revised regulations, U.S. travelers may now travel  to Cuba for people-to-people educational activities under a general  license and without having to travel under the auspices of an organization  that sponsors and organizes such programs. In addition, U.S. travelers  may now travel under a general license to provide certain types of training  to the Cuban private sector.", "Remittances. Treasury has made regulatory changes to the CACR that  removed caps on remittances to Cuban nationals that had been  previously set at $500 a quarter. There are now no limits on the amount  of remittances given as a donation that can be sent to Cuban nationals.", "Financial services. Treasury has made a number of revisions to the  CACR related to financial services. For example, Treasury has modified  the CACR to remove financing restrictions on most types of exports and  has modified the definition of \u201ccash in advance,\u201d a requirement for  exportation of agricultural products, from \u201ccash before shipment\u201d to \u201ccash  before transfer of title and control.\u201d In addition, Treasury has allowed  credit and debit cards issued by U.S. banks to be used in Cuba. Treasury  has also modified the regulations to allow U.S. banking institutions to  open and maintain bank accounts in the United States for Cuban  nationals in Cuba to use for authorized transactions.", "Trade. Commerce has revised the EAR to create a new \u201cSupport for the  Cuban People\u201d export license exception that authorizes exports (1) to  improve living conditions and support independent economic activity in  Cuba, (2) to strengthen civil society (3) to improve the free flow of  information among, and with, the Cuban people, and (4) of items sold  directly to individuals in Cuba for their personal use or their immediate family\u2019s personal use. In addition, Commerce has made regulatory  changes to broaden existing license exceptions available for Cuba. For  example, Commerce modified the license exception \u201cConsumer  Communications Devices\u201d to allow for the commercial sale, lease, or loan  of authorized items; previously, items covered by the exception could only  be donated. Commerce has also modified its licensing policy to allow for  the general approval of export licenses to Cuba for certain items,  including telecommunications items and items that will support  environmental protection. As part of the regulatory revisions, the U.S.  government has also developed a list of items that are allowed for import  into the United States from Cuba, if produced by independent Cuban  entrepreneurs.", "According to various agency officials, the U.S. government has sought to  refine the regulations over time to reflect input from U.S. businesses and  to reflect the realities of the Cuban system. For example, Treasury  officials stated that as part of the third set of regulatory revisions,  Treasury modified the CACR to allow U.S. businesses to procure legal  services in Cuba after hearing from the U.S. business community that to  successfully operate in Cuba they needed to be able to obtain such  services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changes to U.S. Regulations Have Generated Interest among U.S. Businesses, but a Limited Number of Deals Have Been Completed, and U.S. Trade with Cuba Has Continued to Decline", "paragraphs": ["U.S. regulatory changes have generated a significant amount of interest  and exploratory work among U.S. businesses.

There have also been several state and local U.S. trade missions  to Cuba. For example, the Governor of New York led a trade mission to  Cuba in April 2015 that included more than a dozen business leaders  from the state.

Additionally, Stonegate Bank has begun to issue MasterCards, which are  the first U.S. debit card to be used in Cuba.", "Despite the loosening of some embargo restrictions, agency officials and  U.S. business representatives stated that the regulatory changes have  not created significant new opportunities for agricultural exports, which  are the vast majority of U.S. exports to Cuba and have been authorized  since the passage of TSRA in 2000. Driven by declining agricultural  exports, U.S. trade with Cuba has decreased since the regulatory  changes. U.S. exports of goods and services to Cuba declined from $299  million in 2014 to $180 million in 2015. As shown in figure 9, this decline  is a continuation of a longer-term downward trend from a high of $712  million in U.S. exports to Cuba in 2008. Over time, Cuba has increasingly  shifted its agricultural purchases to the European Union and other  countries such as Brazil, Argentina, and Canada. According to U.S.  government analyses and officials, these countries are able to offer more  favorable credit terms than U.S. producers given embargo-related  restrictions on U.S. credit financing of agricultural exports. In addition,  U.S. officials noted that the Cuban government is potentially making a  political decision to purchase fewer U.S. exports to push for additional  U.S. legal and regulatory changes.", "While overall exports have declined, U.S businesses have conducted  trade using some of the new authorities provided by the regulatory  changes. For example, trade data from the U.S. Census indicate that  approximately $800,000 worth of goods had been exported to Cuba  under the Support the Cuban People license exception from January  2015, when the license was created, to March 2016. However, until the  most recent changes in October 2016, the regulatory revisions had  involved a relatively narrow set of U.S. goods and services that could be  newly exported. U.S. officials acknowledged that this has contributed to a  relatively limited number of new commercial deals completed since the  administration\u2019s policy change. With the October 2016 regulatory  revisions, U.S. exporters are now generally authorized to sell a variety of  consumer goods online or directly through other means to individual  Cubans for their personal use or the use of their immediate family.", "Even in those areas where the regulatory changes have created new  trade opportunities, Commerce officials anticipate that there will likely be  lags before any increases in exports are fully realized because exporters  need time to become familiar with the new regulations, identify potential  trading partners in Cuba, and arrange deals. Commerce export licensing  data indicate that there has been an increase in the dollar value of U.S.  goods approved for export to Cuba since the administration\u2019s policy  change in December 2014. For example, Commerce approved $2.1  billion worth of licenses for exports to Cuba in fiscal year 2015, compared  to $1 billion in fiscal year 2014. As of June 30, 2016, Commerce had  already approved $2 billion in export licenses to Cuba in fiscal year 2016.

Pursuant to the  LIBERTAD Act, the President is authorized to suspend the embargo if he  or she determines that a transition Cuban government is in power and is  required to terminate the embargo if he or she determines that a  democratically elected Cuban government is in power. Consequently,  U.S. law still limits U.S. businesses\u2019 ability to engage with the Cuban  private sector or pursue other economic opportunities in Cuba. For  example, as part of its implementation of the embargo, Commerce  maintains a general policy of denial on most exports other than those  covered by license exceptions or otherwise specifically identified in the  EAR. In addition, most U.S. investment in Cuba continues to be  prohibited under the CACR. U.S. law also places a number of other  restrictions on U.S. citizens. For example, although U.S. businesses may  now offer financing on most types of goods authorized for export to Cuba,  credit financing of agricultural exports to Cuba remains prohibited under  TSRA. Various sources note that this prohibition significantly limits the  competitiveness of U.S. agricultural producers given the generous credit  terms other countries, such as Vietnam, provide to Cuba.

The directive stated that the National Security Council will  convene interagency meetings to monitor implementation and resolve obstacles to progress on the administration\u2019s goals and objectives.

After more than 50 years of  U.S. policy designed to isolate Cuba\u2019s communist government, the  President called for a new strategy of engagement. In particular, in setting  out his policy, the President stated that the U.S. government would seek  to support Cuba\u2019s nascent private sector and create new openings for  U.S. businesses to engage in Cuba. Since the policy change, agencies  have conducted a range of activities to support increased economic  engagement. However, there are still significant limits on such  engagement. U.S. law prohibits many forms of assistance to Cuba that  might be used to support the Cuban private sector or U.S. businesses  that want to pursue economic opportunities in Cuba. In addition, agency  officials stated that resource constraints at the U.S. embassy in Havana  and Cuban government priorities affect the ability of the U.S. government  to support the Cuban private sector. U.S. agencies have noted the  importance of having quality information to support their efforts,  particularly given the opacity of the Cuban economy and a lack of  authoritative data sources. However, U.S. agencies have not taken steps  to collect or document key information that could be used to monitor  changes in economic engagement, including with the private sector, and  address obstacles to progress.

We also  conducted a literature review to identify relevant studies on the Cuban  private sector completed by academics, think tanks, and other relevant  organizations. To further assess the size of the Cuban private sector and  how it has changed over time, we analyzed labor force data for 2008  through 2015 published by the Cuban government\u2019s National Statistics  Office (Oficina Nacional de Estad\u00edsticas de Cuba). To assess the  reliability of Cuban employment data, we interviewed U.S. officials and  Cuba experts who were familiar with the data. In addition, we examined  how the data had been used in a number of other assessments of the  Cuban economy, including any relevant limitations that these  assessments identified. We determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report. Using International Labour  Organization (ILO) data on employment by institutional sector that it has  collected from national statistical agencies, we also compared the relative  size of Cuba\u2019s public and private sectors to 16 other countries that fell into  the same World Bank income category. To assess the reliability of ILO  data, we obtained written responses from the ILO regarding its process  for compiling data, how it defined employment categories, and other  relevant information. We determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report. To gather further information on  the Cuban private sector, we conducted fieldwork in Havana, Cuba, in  July 2016. During our fieldwork, we interviewed officials from the U.S.  embassy in Havana, representatives from the Cuban private sector,  representatives from Cuban organizations that provide training and other  support to the Cuban private sector, and representatives from selected  foreign embassies that have established commercial ties with Cuba. In  addition, we conducted observations of a range of private Cuban  businesses. As part of our fieldwork, we requested meetings with several  Cuban ministries and academics at the University of Havana; however,  the Cuban government denied our request for all of these meetings. After  the completion of our trip, we were able to meet with officials from the  Cuban embassy in Washington, D.C. In July 2016, we also attended the  annual conference of the Association for the Study of the Cuban  Economy in Miami, Florida, to obtain further information from a range of  U.S. and Cuban experts on the status of the Cuban economy, recent and  planned economic reforms in Cuba, and the size and composition of the  Cuban private sector.

We  also reviewed the two principal sets of regulations pertaining to the  embargo: the Cuban Assets Control Regulations (CACR) and the Export  Administration Regulations (EAR). In doing so, we assessed what  changes U.S. agencies have made to the CACR and the EAR since  December 2014, when the Obama administration announced the new  U.S. policy on Cuba. To obtain further information on the six sets of  regulatory changes that U.S. agencies have made since December 2014,  we reviewed documents produced by Commerce and Treasury  discussing the regulatory changes, including fact sheets, frequently asked  questions documents, and briefings to U.S. companies.

In addition, we  analyzed data on trade between the United States and Cuba from  Commerce\u2019s Trade Policy Information System. To assess the reliability of  these data, we reviewed Commerce documentation on the Trade Policy  Information System, an interface for accessing U.S. Census data on U.S.  imports and exports, and prior GAO work using U.S. Census data. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report. Finally, we analyzed Commerce licensing data to assess any  trends in license applications to pursue authorized transactions related to  Cuba under the EAR.
