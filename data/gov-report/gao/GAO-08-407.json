Some DOD trainers instruct units to pretend restricted training areas are holy grounds, mine fields, or other restricted areas in theater, simulating the need to avoid specific areas and locations when deployed. GAO's review of readiness data for active duty combat units did not confirm that compliance with environmental laws hampers overall military readiness. Since 2006, the Navy has twice invoked the Marine Mammal Protection Act exemption to continue using mid-frequency active sonar in training exercises that would otherwise have been prevented. DOD's exemption from the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, authorizing the taking of migratory birds, eliminated the possibility of having to delay or cancel military training exercises, such as Navy live-fire training at the Farallon de Medinilla Target Range. The exemption to the Endangered Species Act, which precludes critical habitat designation on DOD lands, enables DOD to avoid potential training delays by providing greater autonomy in managing its training lands. On the basis of meetings with officials within and outside DOD and visits to 17 training ranges, GAO found no instances where DOD's use of exemptions from the Endangered Species Act or Migratory Bird Treaty Act has adversely affected the environment, but the impact of the Marine Mammal Protection Act exemption has not yet been determined. The services employ a variety of measures and conservation activities to mitigate the effects of training activities on the natural resources located on DOD lands. Additionally, regulatory officials GAO spoke to said DOD has done an effective job protecting and preserving endangered species and habitats on its installations. However, some nongovernmental organizations have expressed concern that the Endangered Species Act exemption allowing DOD to avoid critical habitat designations may weaken oversight from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. DOD has not presented a sound business case demonstrating the need for the proposed exemptions from the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. Best practices and prior GAO work recommend that agencies develop a business case that includes, among other things, expected benefits, costs, and risks associated with a proposal's implementation. However, DOD has not provided any specific examples showing that training and readiness have been hampered by requirements of these laws. Meanwhile some federal, state, and nongovernmental organizations have expressed concern that the proposed exemptions, if granted, could harm the environment. Until DOD develops a business case demonstrating the need for these exemptions, Congress will lack a sound basis for assessing whether to enact requested exemptions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["A fundamental principle of military readiness is that the military must train  as it intends to fight, and military training ranges provide the primary  means to accomplish this goal. New advances in technology, coupled with  the ongoing shift in force posture, mean that the Department of Defense  (DOD) needs to continually update and maintain its training ranges.  Military training ranges vary in size from a few acres for small arms  training to over a million acres for large maneuver exercises and weapons  testing, as well as broad open ocean areas that provide for offshore  training and testing. Like other federal, state, local, and private facilities,  DOD installations are required to comply with environmental and other  laws that are intended to protect human health and the environment from  harm. However, according to DOD officials, a slow but steady increase in  restrictions affecting the use of these areas, such as heightened focus on  the application of environmental statutes and other encroachment  pressures, has limited the use of military training areas for realistic  training activities. DOD officials report that the gradual accumulation of  these limitations will increasingly threaten readiness.", "Most existing environmental laws allow for national security exemptions,  which DOD may request on a case-by-case basis when compliance with  specific environmental requirements is shown to have an impact on the  paramount interests of the United States. However, DOD has seldom  invoked these case-by-case exemptions, asserting that the number of  training exercises it conducts and the need to periodically reapply for  most exemptions makes obtaining them on a case-by-case basis onerous  and time consuming. In 2002, DOD submitted to Congress an eight- provision legislative package known as the Readiness and Range  Preservation Initiative, which contained six provisions that sought to  modify the applicability of certain environmental statutory requirements to  DOD, in light of concern that these statutes could limit realistic  preparations for combat and negatively affect military readiness. Pursuant  to the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003  and the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, the  Readiness and Range Preservation Initiative provisions revising the  Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Endangered Species Act and the Marine  Mammal Protection Act were enacted into law. Since 2002, DOD has  repeatedly but unsuccessfully sought enactment of the three remaining  provisions, which would exempt DOD from certain requirements of the  Clean Air Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); and  the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability  Act (CERCLA). The case-by-case exemptions and each of the Readiness  and Range Preservation Initiative provisions are discussed in greater detail  in the background section of this report.", "Over the past several years, we have produced a body of work describing  the effects of encroachment on DOD\u2019s training activities, including  encroachment from endangered species. For example, in 2002 we reported  that DOD\u2019s readiness reports did not indicate the extent to which  environmental requirements restricted training activities and that these  reports indicated a high level of military readiness overall. We also noted  individual instances of environmental requirements affecting training at  some military installations and recommended that DOD\u2019s readiness  reporting system be improved to more accurately identify problems for  training that might be attributed to the need to comply with statutory  environmental requirements. In 2003, we testified that environmental  requirements were only one of several factors that affected DOD\u2019s ability  to carry out training activities but that DOD was still unable to broadly  measure the effects of encroachment on readiness. In a 2005 report, we  found that DOD continued to face various difficulties in carrying out  realistic training at its ranges.", "House Armed Services Committee Report 110-146, which accompanies the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, directed us to  review the extent to which environmental laws, regulations, and  exemptions are affecting DOD\u2019s training activities, military readiness, and  the environment. This report discusses the effects, if any, of (1)  environmental laws on DOD\u2019s training activities and military readiness, (2)  DOD\u2019s use of exemptions from environmental laws on training activities,  and (3) DOD\u2019s use of exemptions on the environment. Lastly, the report  evaluates the extent to which DOD has demonstrated the need for its  proposed exemptions from the Clean Air Act, RCRA, and CERCLA as  means of achieving its training and readiness goals.", "In performing this review, to directly observe the effects, if any, of  environmental laws and DOD\u2019s use of exemptions to the Migratory Bird  Treaty Act, Endangered Species Act, and the Marine Mammal Protection  Act on training activities, military readiness, and the environment, we  judgmentally selected 17 military training installations which included  training sites from each military service component. The installations we  selected were identified based on our previous work involving some  installations experiencing encroachment and sustainable training range  issues. DOD concurred that the installations we selected continue to have  problems in this area and stated that these locations would provide an  important perspective of some of the challenges DOD faces to comply  with environmental laws. Because the installations were judgmentally  selected, the specific challenges faced at these selected locations cannot  be generalized across all of DOD. We also obtained and reviewed  documents and reports describing the effects of environmental laws and  statutory exemptions on training and readiness and the need for  workarounds to meet training requirements from DOD and military service  officials responsible for managing military training. In addition, we  reviewed unit readiness data for fiscal years 2006 and 2007, which  included some commander comment summaries describing, when  applicable, why a unit had not met its unit training requirements. Our  review of these data allowed us to assess whether environmental  restrictions imposed on DOD installations had an impact on unit  readiness. To determine the effect of DOD\u2019s use of the exemptions on the  environment, we reviewed related reports and studies, and some  installation management plans to determine how natural resources, such  as migratory birds, marine mammals, and endangered species and their  habitats are protected on DOD lands during military training exercises. We  also interviewed officials from nongovernmental organizations (NGO) that  are involved in endangered species protection efforts and wildlife  oversight issues to obtain their perspectives on how well DOD has done to  protect the natural resources on its lands. We interviewed officials from  the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD); the Departments of the  Army, the Navy, and the Air Force; the Marine Corps; other federal  agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the  National Marine Fisheries Service, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  (FWS) to discuss the effects of environmental laws and statutory  exemptions on military training activities. We also discussed with these  officials the potential benefits and problems associated with the proposed  statutory exemptions to the Clean Air Act, RCRA, and CERCLA on training  activities, military readiness, and the environment. In addition, we  reviewed documents that provided the perspectives of NGOs and federal  and state regulatory agencies on the potential impact of the proposed  exemptions on the environment.", "On the basis of information obtained from the military services on the  reliability of their unit readiness data, our discussions with DOD, military  service, and NGO officials, and our review and analysis of documents and  reports describing the effects of environmental requirements and statutory  exemptions on training activities, military readiness, and the environment,  we believe that the data used in this report are sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. The time periods encompassed by the data used in this report  vary for each of our objectives depending on the date ranges for which  each type of data was available.

DOD  also requested two additional provisions that would allow DOD to  cooperate more effectively with third parties on land transfers for  conservation purposes. To date, Congress has enacted five of the  Readiness and Range Preservation Initiative provisions.", "The fiscal year 2003 defense authorization act directed the Secretary of  the Interior to prescribe regulations for issuing permits for the \u201cincidental  takings\u201d of migratory birds during military training exercises authorized by  the Secretary of Defense and provided an interim exemption from the  Migratory Bird Treaty Act\u2019s prohibition against taking, killing, or  possessing any migratory birds except as permitted by regulation, until the  implementation of new regulations. DOD had been concerned about the  effects of a court decision holding that certain military readiness activities  resulting in migratory bird takings violated the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.", "Interior department regulations published in February 2007 allow for the  Armed Forces to take migratory birds incidental to military readiness  activities, provided that for those activities the Armed Forces determine  may result in a significant, adverse effect on a population of migratory bird  species, they must confer with the FWS to develop and implement  appropriate conservation measures to minimize or mitigate those effects.  The Secretary of the Interior retains the power to withdraw or suspend the  authority for incidental takings of migratory birds for particular activities  under certain circumstances. Two additional provisions enacted in the  fiscal year 2003 defense authorization act authorized the Secretary of a  military department to enter into an agreement with a state or local  government or any private organization committed to the conservation,  restoration, or preservation of land and natural resources to address  encroachment issues and to convey any surplus real property under the  Secretary\u2019s administrative control that is suitable and desirable for  conservation purposes to any state or local government or nonprofit  organization committed to conservation of natural resources on real  property.", "The fiscal year 2004 defense authorization act enacted two of the five  remaining Readiness and Range Preservation Initiative provisions by  authorizing DOD exemptions from the Endangered Species Act and the  Marine Mammal Protection Act. One of the revisions to the Endangered  Species Act precluded the Secretary of the Interior from designating as  critical habitat DOD lands that are subject to an approved integrated  natural resources management plan, if the Secretary makes a written  determination that such a plan provides a benefit to the species being  designated. DOD, like other federal agencies, is still required to consult  with the FWS and the National Marine Fisheries Service, as appropriate, to  ensure that actions it performs, authorizes, funds, or permits are not likely  to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species or adversely  modify its critical habitat. In DOD\u2019s view, this statutory revision was  needed to avoid the potential of any future critical habitat designations  that could restrict the use of military lands for training. The other revision  to the Endangered Species Act requires the Secretary of the Interior to  consider effects on national security when deciding whether to designate  critical habitat, but does not remove DOD from being subject to all other  protections provided under the act. The revision to the Marine Mammal  Protection Act authorized the Secretary of Defense to exempt for a  specific period, not to exceed 2 years, any action or category of actions  undertaken by DOD or its components from compliance with the act\u2019s  prohibition against illegal takings of marine mammals, if the Secretary  determines it is necessary for national defense. The revision also amended  the definition of \u201charassment\u201d of marine mammals, as it applies to military  readiness activity, to require evidence of harm or a higher threshold of  potential harm, and required the Secretary of the Interior to consider the  impact on the effectiveness of the military readiness activity in the  issuance of permits for incidental takings. In DOD\u2019s view these  amendments were needed to prevent restrictions on the use of the Navy\u2019s  sonar systems.", "Similar to previous years since fiscal year 2003, DOD included in its  proposed National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 the  three remaining Readiness and Range Preservation Initiative provisions  which provide exemptions from certain requirements of the Clean Air Act,  RCRA, and CERCLA. As with previous Congresses, the 110th Congress did  not include these provisions in the version of the bill that went before both  houses for final vote. Descriptions of the three remaining proposals  follow:    First, the proposed revision to the Clean Air Act would have deferred  emissions generated by military readiness activities from conforming to  applicable state clean air implementation plans for achieving federal air  quality standards and allowed DOD up to 3 years to satisfy these  requirements. To be in conformity, a federal action must not contribute  to new violations of the standards for ambient air quality, increase the  frequency or severity of existing violations, or delay timely attainment  of standards in the area of concern. DOD proposed this revision to  provide flexibility for transferring training operations to areas with  poor air quality without restrictions on these operations due to  generated emissions. In addition, the revision would have required EPA  to approve a state plan even if emissions from military readiness  activities would prevent a given area within the state from achieving  clean air standards.", "Second, DOD\u2019s proposed revision to RCRA would have amended the  definition of \u201csolid waste\u201d to exclude munitions that are on an  operational range incident to their normal use, thereby excluding such  munitions from regulation under RCRA. RCRA governs, among other  things, the management of hazardous wastes, including establishing  standards for treatment, storage, and disposal facilities.", "Third, the proposed revision to CERCLA, under which entities  responsible for releases of hazardous substances are liable for  associated cleanup costs, would have similarly amended the definition  of \u201crelease.\u201d CERCLA defines release as any spilling, leaking, pumping,  pouring, emitting, emptying, discharging, injecting, escaping, leaching,  dumping, or disposing into the environment (including the  abandonment or discarding of barrels, containers, and other closed  receptacles containing any hazardous substance or pollutant or  contaminant).", "DOD\u2019s view is that the proposed revisions to RCRA and CERCLA would  clarify existing regulations EPA finalized in its 1997 Military Munitions  Rule, pursuant to which \u201cused\u201d or \u201cfired\u201d munitions on a range are  considered solid waste, subject to disposal requirements, only when they  are removed from their landing spot.

DOD defines readiness as the ability of  U.S. military forces to fight and meet the demands of the national military  strategy. Readiness is the synthesis of two distinct but interrelated levels:  unit readiness (the ability of each unit to provide capabilities required by  the combatant commanders to execute their assigned missions) and joint  readiness (the combatant commander\u2019s ability to integrate and  synchronize ready combat and support forces to execute his or her  assigned missions).", "DOD has stated that the goal of any readiness reporting or assessment  system is to reveal whether forces can perform their assigned missions.  Historically, DOD has inferred this ability from the status of unit resources  via the Global Status of Resources and Training System. This system is the  primary means for units to report readiness against designed operational  goals. The system\u2019s database indicates, at selected points in time, the  extent to which units possess the required resources and training to  undertake their wartime missions. DOD found, however, that these input- based assessments do not yield direct information on whether a force can  actually perform an assigned mission despite potential resource shortfalls.", "In the spring of 2002, DOD announced plans to create a new Defense  Readiness Reporting System that would provide commanders with a  comprehensive assessment of the ability of capable entities to conduct  operations without the command having to research and examine  numerous databases throughout DOD, such as the Global Status of  Resources and Training System and the service-specific readiness  reporting systems. According to DOD, this new system is expected to be  able to seamlessly integrate readiness data with planning and execution  tools, providing a powerful means for rapidly assessing, planning, and  executing operations. This system expands the readiness reporting  process from simple resource-based reporting to the use of near real-time  readiness information and dynamic analysis tools to determine the  capability of an organization to execute tasks and missions. Specifically,  the system represents a shift from (1) resources to capabilities\u2014inputs to  outputs; (2) deficiencies to their implications; (3) units to the combined  forces; and (4) frontline units to all units contributing to front line  operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Our Prior Work", "paragraphs": ["This report is a continuation of a series of reports that we have issued on  matters related to training constraints as a result of encroachment factors  on DOD\u2019s training ranges.

Two of  the environmental restrictions cited were for the threatened San Diego  fairy shrimp, the endangered Coastal California gnatcatcher and its  habitat. Another restriction involved the nesting season for the  endangered bird called the California least tern (see fig. 1).

For the 2005 base closure round, OSD  asked the services if moving activities into nonattainment areas would be  an issue, and the answer was that it would not be. In its 2006 report on  sustainable ranges, DOD stated that, while the Clean Air Act\u2019s general  conformity requirement had the potential to threaten the deployment of  new weapon systems, the requirement had not yet prevented any military  readiness activities.", "Officials of state and local agencies, and NGOs, such as the Center for  Public Environmental Oversight (CPEO), NRDC, and PEER, have  expressed concern that the proposed exemptions could increase air  pollution and potentially result in greater contamination, higher cleanup  costs, and a threat to human health. Opponents of DOD\u2019s proposed  exemptions from the Clean Air Act include state and local air pollution  control program officials, state environmental commissioners, state  attorneys general, county and municipal governments, and environmental  advocates. They contended that granting the exemption could increase air  pollution, posing a threat to human health. Opponents also claimed that  the proposed exemption is unnecessary as the Clean Air Act already  contains a provision that would allow DOD to request a case-by-case  exemption if necessary, which DOD has never invoked. In addition, an  EPA official we spoke with expressed similar concerns about the  proposed Clean Air Act exemption. He also stated that because DOD has  an extensive planning process, and readiness activities are generally  planned ahead, DOD should have time to mitigate the emissions, or work  with the states to establish a budget within the states\u2019 implementation  plans so that an exemption to the Clean Air Act would not be needed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Proposed RCRA Exemption", "paragraphs": ["According to DOD\u2019s 2006 sustainable ranges report, existing ambiguity  over whether the RCRA definition of \u201csolid waste\u201d is applicable to military  munitions located on operational ranges had generated litigation by  private plaintiffs seeking to curtail or terminate munitions-related training  at operational ranges. The report also asserted that future litigation of this  nature, if successful, could force remediation at operational ranges,  effectively precluding live-fire training. However, DOD was not able to  provide any examples of where a private citizen\u2019s RCRA lawsuit had  affected training on an operational range. Although live-fire training  restrictions have been imposed at the Eagle River Flats Impact Area at  Fort Richardson, Alaska, the restrictions were not the result of any  litigation. The Army imposed the firing restrictions in 1991 following  completion of an environmental assessment that established a link  between firing munitions containing white phosphorus and waterfowl  mortality at Eagle River Flats. We discussed DOD\u2019s concerns about RCRA  and the definition of \u201csolid waste\u201d with officials of EPA\u2019s Office of Federal  Facilities Enforcement and Office of Federal Facilities and Restoration.  These officials told us that, to address DOD\u2019s concerns, EPA developed  the 1997 Military Munitions Rule, which states that military munitions are  not considered to be solid waste when they are used for their intended  purpose on an operational range. The EPA officials also said that to date  they have never required DOD to clean up an operational range, unless  contamination is migrating off the range, which could occur through  polluted groundwater.", "With regard to the proposed exemption from RCRA, opponents have  included state attorneys general and NGOs such as CPEO, NRDC, and  PEER. They have asserted that granting DOD the exemptions could  weaken federal and state oversight. Specifically, in written comments to  the Office of Management and Budget on DOD\u2019s 2004 legislative proposals  for the National Defense Authorization Act, EPA stated that it was  concerned that the exemptions would result in states\u2019 oversight agencies  having to wait for human health and environmental effects to occur  beyond the boundaries of the operational range before taking action. This  delay could increase the costs and time to respond. Other organizations  expressed similar concerns about the exemptions preempting federal or  state authority. The opponents also noted that the exemptions were not  needed, as RCRA contains national security provisions allowing the  President to exempt DOD facilities from any statutory or regulatory  authority on a case-by-case basis.

On the contrary, DOD officials told us that EPA and the states  generally do not seek to regulate the use of munitions on operational  ranges under RCRA or CERCLA. Cognizant EPA officials also told us that  EPA generally did not impose regulatory requirements on operational  ranges. Further, EPA, in written comments to the Office of Management  and Budget on DOD\u2019s 2004 legislative proposals for the National Defense  Authorization Act, stated that it had been judicious in the use of the  various authorities it has over operational ranges.", "Opponents from states and NGOs such as CPEO, NRDC, and PEER, have  similar concerns with DOD\u2019s proposed exemption from CERCLA as they  do with the RCRA exemption discussed previously.

These locations included Aberdeen Proving Ground,  Maryland; Fort Lewis, Washington; Fort Stewart, Georgia; Naval Station  Norfolk, Naval Air Station Oceana, and Dam Neck Annex, Virginia; Naval  Air Station Fallon, Nevada; Fort Irwin, Naval Base Coronado, Naval Air  Station North Island, Naval Auxiliary Landing Field San Clemente Island,  and Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California; Marine Corps Base  Camp Lejeune, North Carolina; Avon Park Air Force Range and Eglin Air  Force Base, Florida; and Luke Air Force Base and Barry M. Goldwater  Range, Arizona. These installations were identified and selected based on  our previous work involving some installations experiencing  encroachment and sustainable training range issues. DOD concurred that  the installations we selected continue to have problems in this area and  stated that these locations would provide an important perspective of  some of the challenges DOD faces to comply with environmental laws.  Because the installations were judgmentally selected, the specific  challenges faced at these selected locations can not be generalized across  all of DOD. We obtained documents and reports describing the effects of  environmental laws and exemptions on training and readiness and the  need for workarounds to meet training requirements from DOD officials  responsible for managing military training. We compared and contrasted  data on training requirements with actual training activities to identify  examples\u2014in terms of the number of training days, types of training  activities, unit readiness ratings, and costs\u2014where training was affected  by environmental requirements and DOD\u2019s use of environmental  exemptions. We also met with service officials responsible for managing  readiness data for each service. These officials provided us with unit  readiness data for fiscal years 2006 and 2007, which included some  commander comment summaries describing, when applicable, why a unit  had not met its unit training requirements. Our review of these data  allowed us to assess whether environmental restrictions imposed on DOD  installations had an impact on unit readiness. Furthermore, we conducted  literature searches, and reviewed studies completed by other audit  agencies and research companies such as the Congressional Research  Service, the Center for Naval Analysis, and the RAND Corporation, to  review previous findings and conclusions of how environmental laws may  have affected military training and readiness. In addition, we met with  officials responsible for planning, managing, and executing unit training to  gain an understanding of how these officials assisted military units to meet  training requirements while addressing environmental laws.
