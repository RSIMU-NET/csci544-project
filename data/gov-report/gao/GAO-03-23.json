Under the Endangered Species Act, listing and critical habitat decisions must be based on the best available scientific and commercial data. These decisions and the recovery plan recommendations were based on sources that reflected existing knowledge about desert tortoises. To protect the tortoise, government agencies have restricted grazing and off-road vehicle use and taken other protective actions in desert tortoise habitat, but the effectiveness of these actions is unknown. Research is underway in several areas, including tortoise disease, predation, and nutrition, but the research has not assessed the effectiveness of the protective actions. Furthermore, the status of desert tortoise populations is unclear because data are unavailable to demonstrate population trends. Before the tortoise may be delisted, populations must increase or remain stable for at least 25 years--one generation of desert tortoises. Determining the trends will cost an estimated $7.5 million in the first 5 years, plus additional monitoring every 3 to 5 years at a cost of about $1.5 million per year of monitoring. The Fish and Wildlife Service depends on other agencies and organizations to assist with funding and monitoring, but these agencies and organizations cannot guarantee assistance from year to year because of other priorities. Expenditures on desert tortoise recovery since the species' first listing in 1980 exceed $100 million, but the exact investment is unknown. The investment includes $92 million in \"reasonably identifiable\" expenditures for the tortoise, plus staff time valued at about $10.6 million. The overall economic impact of the tortoise recovery program--including benefits as well as the costs incurred by local governments, landowners, and developers as a result of restrictions--is unknown."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the 1980s, biologists have been concerned about apparent declines in populations of the Mojave desert tortoise, a species that is considered to be an indicator of the health of the desert environment. The desert tortoise ranges through millions of acres in Arizona, California, Nevada and Utah.Population declines in the species may be caused in part by a contagious, and sometimes fatal, upper respiratory tract disease and by other factors such as drought, predation, illegal collection, and habitat degradation or loss associated with human activities such as development, livestock grazing, and recreation. Together, these conditions led the Department of the Interior\u2019s Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) to protect the desert tortoise under the Endangered Species Act. In 1980, the Service designated, or \u201clisted,\u201d a portion of the desert tortoise population in Utah as \u201cthreatened.\u201d In 1989, the Service temporarily listed the rest of the Mojave population of desert tortoises as \u201cendangered\u201d on an emergency basis because of an outbreak of upper respiratory tract disease. In 1990, the Service issued its final determination that the Mojave population of desert tortoises was \u201cthreatened\u201d throughout its range.", "The goal of the Endangered Species Act is to restore species that are at risk of extinction so that they can live in self-sustaining populations. At the time a species is listed, the act generally requires the Service to designate critical habitat essential to the conservation of the species. In 1994, the Service designated critical habitat covering 6.4 million acres in the desert tortoise\u2019s range. The critical habitat encompasses federal land managed by the Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and National Park Service, as well as Department of Defense installations, and state- and privately-owned land. Shortly after designating critical habitat, the Service published a recovery plan for the desert tortoise. To protect desert tortoises, the plan recommends restrictions, among other things, on off-road vehicle access, military maneuvers that destroy habitat, clearing for agriculture and development, and livestock grazing. Some of these restrictions have been controversial, and some users question whether the restrictions are necessary to the desert tortoise\u2019s recovery. The plan also recommends monitoring to determine the status of desert tortoise populations and track their population trends. Under the act, when a population is considered stable and no longer needs the act\u2019s protection, the species may be removed from the threatened or endangered list.", "In this report, we (1) evaluate the scientific basis for the 1990 listing, the critical habitat designation, and the recovery plan recommendations for the desert tortoise; (2) assess the effectiveness of actions taken by federal agencies and others to conserve desert tortoises; (3) describe what is known about trends in tortoise populations; and (4) identify costs and benefits associated with desert tortoise recovery actions since the desert tortoise was first listed in 1980, to the extent that data were available.", "To evaluate the scientific basis for the listing decision, critical habitat designation, and recovery plan recommendations, we contracted with the National Academy of Sciences to identify and assist in the selection of scientists with expertise in relevant areas, such as conservation biology and desert ecology, to provide technical assistance in reviewing the reasonableness of those key decisions in light of the scientific information on which they were based. The scientists we consulted and other details on the scope and methodology of our review are presented in appendix II."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Mojave Desert tortoise is a relatively large reptile, with adults measuring up to 15 inches in shell length (see fig. 1). Desert tortoises live in creosote bush and Joshua tree habitats in valleys, plains, and washes at elevations generally ranging up to 4,000 feet above sea level. In these habitats, desert tortoises construct and live in burrows and spend a majority of their life below ground. Desert tortoises may live for 50 years or more in the wild, and females do not breed until they are at least 15 years old. They usually lay one or more clutches of about 6 to 8 eggs between mid-April and the first week of July. Although desert tortoises can withstand prolonged periods of drought, females may not lay eggs if forage is unavailable. Survival of juveniles is thought to be low; some researchers estimate that only 2 to 3 per 100 hatched may live to become adults.", "The Mojave Desert tortoise\u2019s range lies north and west of the Colorado River in California, southern Nevada, southwestern Utah, and northwestern Arizona (see fig. 2).", "Apparent declines in tortoise populations have been attributed to many factors including habitat loss or degradation, drought, and predation on juvenile tortoises by ravens, coyotes, domestic dogs, and other animals (see fig. 3). According to the Service, habitat loss has occurred as a result of increasing amounts of urban development, military operations, and recreational uses such as off-road vehicle use, in the tortoise\u2019s range. Habitat degradation has been attributed to domestic livestock grazing, particularly in livestock watering and loading areas. Other factors that may have caused population declines include mortality through vandalism or accidental road kill and removal of tortoises from their habitat for pets, food, or commercial purposes. Respiratory and shell diseases have also been observed in desert tortoise populations.", "Before a species, such as the desert tortoise, can receive protection under the Endangered Species Act, the Secretary of the Interior, through the Fish and Wildlife Service, is required to use the best available scientific and commercial data (e.g., biological or trade data obtained from scientific or commercial publications, administrative reports, maps or other graphic materials, or experts on the subject) to decide whether the species is at risk of extinction. The Endangered Species Act specifies the following five factors for identifying at-risk species, any one of which is sufficient to determine that a species qualifies for the act\u2019s protections:   present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of a species habitat or range;   overuse for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes;   disease or predation;  inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; or   other natural or manmade factors affecting a species\u2019 continued existence.", "Once the Service determines that a species should receive the act\u2019s protection, it can list the species as threatened or endangered. As of July 2002, 517 animal species and 744 plant species were listed as threatened or endangered in the United States.", "The act prohibits the \u201ctaking\u201d of any listed species of animal and defines \u201ctake\u201d as to harass, harm, pursue, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct. However, under the act the Service may issue permits that allow the taking of a listed species if the taking is incidental to, rather than the purpose of, an otherwise legal activity. In most cases, the Service must develop a recovery plan for listed species that specifies actions needed to recover the species so that it can be removed from the list of protected species under the act, or \u201cdelisted.\u201d", "Federal agencies must comply with prohibitions against taking a threatened or endangered species and must consult with the Service to determine the effect, if any, that their activities may have on listed species. In particular, federal agencies must ensure that their activities do not jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species, or result in destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.If any proposed activities will jeopardize a species or adversely modify its critical habitat, the Service will identify reasonable and prudent alternative activities. In addition, federal agencies have a broader directive under the act to use their authorities to carry out programs to conserve threatened and endangered species."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Listing, Critical Habitat Designation, and Recommendations for Recovery Were Reasonable", "paragraphs": ["Scientists we consulted agreed that the listing of the desert tortoise in 1990, the critical habitat designation, and the recommendations in the recovery plan were reasonable, based on the limited data available on the desert tortoise when the relevant decisions were made. These decisions were made on the basis of a variety of information, including published and unpublished research and government studies. The scientists we consulted recognized that, as is often the case when making such decisions, little published data on the species were available. However, they agreed that the Service\u2019s decisions were appropriate and consistent with their understanding of the agency\u2019s responsibilities under the act."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Listing and Critical Habitat Decisions Were Based on the Best Science Available at the Time", "paragraphs": ["The Endangered Species Act requires that listing decisions be based solely on the best scientific and commercial data available without taking into account economic factors. Although the Service is required to seek out the best data available at the time, it is not required to generate additional data. The listing decision for the desert tortoise was based on a variety of information, including published research, meeting and symposium proceedings, and government reports. Generally, published, peer-reviewed research is considered the most reliable information source because the research methods and conclusions have been reviewed by other scientists before publication. However, other sources such as unpublished research, meeting proceedings, and government reports can provide important information for making listing and other decisions. Moreover, several scientists said that listing decisions are often necessarily based on limited data, because funding for research on a species is typically scarce until after that species is listed.", "The listing decision describes how each of the five listing criteria that make a species eligible for protection under the act applies to the desert tortoise, with habitat loss and disease cited as threatening the tortoise\u2019s continued existence. The scientists we consulted agreed that, despite the limited amount of quantitative data on the desert tortoise that was available at the time of its listing, the decision to list it as threatened was reasonable. In particular, they cited increases in threats such as diseases and habitat loss as important factors making listing necessary. In addition, researches noted declines in numbers. For example, in the western Mojave Desert in California, researchers found that some populations decreased by as much as 90 percent between the 1970s and the mid-1990s; in Nevada, study plots also generally showed declines ranging from 10 to 39 percent since the late 1970s. The scientists we consulted also noted that desert tortoise populations appear to continue to decline. Some said that the listing of the desert tortoise was an unusual step by the Service because, at the time of the listing, there were still desert tortoises occurring across a large range; yet they recognized that listing it as threatened was consistent with their understanding of the act\u2019s intent to protect species whose numbers are declining and are at risk of becoming endangered.", "When designating critical habitat, the Service must also use the best scientific and commercial information available. Unlike for listings, however, the Service must also consider the economic impact of the critical habitat designation. The primary source of information for the designation was a draft of the recovery plan for the tortoise that recommended protection for 14 separate areas of habitat. The Service adjusted the boundaries for these 14 areas to generally follow legal property boundaries and elevation contours in order to remove as much unsuitable habitat as possible and to reflect additional biological information. Some areas that were already protected, such as Joshua Tree National Monument and the Desert National Wildlife Range, were intended to be excluded from critical habitat because the habitat within them was already receiving protection as desert tortoise habitat. After making these adjustments, the Service identified 12 areas in its final critical habitat designation\u2014seven in California, one in Nevada, one in Utah, and three that span more than one state\u2014that total about 6.4 million acres (see table 1).", "The scientists we consulted said the size and number of the areas designated as critical habitat were reasonable given the available data, but found that the rationales for drawing the specific boundaries were not well explained in the decision documents. The size of the areas was determined based on estimates of how dense a desert tortoise population should be to ensure the population\u2019s continued existence\u2014estimates that the scientists noted were based on limited quantitative research. Several of the scientists we consulted observed that the critical habitat areas appear to have been designated where desert tortoise populations were found at the time. One scientist suggested that the designation of the areas of critical habitat may have been conservative, and that if the designation was done today, the protected areas might be even larger."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Recovery Plan\u2019s Recommendations Reflected Available Scientific Information", "paragraphs": ["In contrast with the requirements for listing and critical habitat, the Endangered Species Act does not specify the type of information that should be used to develop recovery plans. Instead, the act requires that recovery plans contain three specific elements: (1) a description of site- specific management actions necessary for the conservation and survival of the species; (2) objective, measurable criteria that, when met, would result in the removal of the species from the threatened or endangered species list, or delisting; and (3) estimates of the time and cost required to carry out the plan. However, Service policy dictates that recovery plans should seek the best information to achieve recovery of a species. While not in effect at the time the tortoise recovery team was founded, Service policy is that teams developing recovery plans should have diverse areas of expertise and may include personnel from many different organizations, including officials from other federal agencies and states, and other recognized experts. According to the Service, recovery plans impose no obligations on any agency, entity, or persons to implement the various tasks contained within them.", "The recovery plan for the desert tortoise addresses each of the three required elements. The plan describes site-specific management actions for the 14 separate areas that it recommends be established such as discontinuing livestock grazing, constructing fencing along highways to reduce tortoise road kill, monitoring the health of desert tortoises within the areas, eliminating raven nest and perch sites, constructing signs to delineate the boundaries of the protected areas, and restricting off-road vehicle use. The plan also recommends that agencies develop programs and facilities to educate the public about the status and management needs of the desert tortoise and its habitat, and that research be conducted to monitor and guide recovery efforts. In addition, the plan includes estimates of the time frame and costs for implementation. Lastly, as the act requires, the plan describes the criteria that must be met before the desert tortoise population may be considered for delisting. The criteria are:   as determined by a scientifically credible monitoring plan, the population within a recovery unit must exhibit a statistically significant upward trend or remain stationary for at least 25 years (one desert tortoise generation);   enough habitat must be protected within a recovery unit, or the habitat and desert tortoise populations must be managed intensively enough to ensure long-term population viability;   provisions must be made for population management within each recovery unit so that population growth rates are stable or increasing; regulatory mechanisms or land management commitments must be implemented that provide for long-term protection of desert tortoises and their habitat; and the population in a recovery unit is unlikely to need protection under the Endangered Species Act in the foreseeable future.", "The scientists we consulted agreed that the recommendations in the recovery plan describing site-specific management actions are reasonable, and reflect the best information available at the time. They observed that because much was still unknown about the severity of specific threats to desert tortoises at the time the plan was developed, its recommendations were made without establishing priorities that would reflect differences in the seriousness of the threats. For example, the plan does not differentiate among the seriousness of the threats from uncontrolled vehicle use off designated roads as compared to livestock grazing or dumping and littering. Nonetheless, the scientists commented that the plan was a significant, resource-intensive effort; indeed, one scientist commented that the expertise of the scientists comprising the recovery team was unprecedented. The team included experts in reptile and tortoise biology, desert ecosystems, population analyses, and conservation biology. The team also coordinated with numerous people and organizations, including federal and state agencies and officials, and others with expertise in desert tortoise and land management issues."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Actions Have Been Taken to Protect the Desert Tortoise, but Their Effectiveness Is Unknown", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies and others have taken a variety of actions to benefit desert tortoises, reflecting recommendations in the recovery plan or efforts to minimize the effects of potentially harmful activities, but the effectiveness of those actions is not known because the necessary analyses to measure their effectiveness have not been done. Federal, state, and local agencies and others have acquired habitat, restricted certain uses, and promote education programs about the species, and research has been conducted or is underway on such topics as the causes of disease in tortoises, their nutritional needs, and the effects of human activities on tortoises. However, no process has been established for integrating agencies\u2019 management decisions regarding the desert tortoise with research results. As a result, Service and land managers cannot be certain that they are focusing their limited resources on the most effective actions. In addition, the recovery plan recommends that its recommendations be reassessed every 3 to 5 years, but the plan has not been reassessed since its 1994 issuance. Such a reassessment would allow the Service to evaluate whether the plan\u2019s recommendations are still sound or should be revised in light of more recent research."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Many Actions Have Been Taken or Are Underway to Protect Tortoises", "paragraphs": ["The recovery plan recommends securing habitat to aid in the recovery and continued existence of the desert tortoise. In addition to managing land they already own, federal and state agencies\u2014which collectively manage over 80 percent of tortoise critical habitat\u2014and private groups have made efforts to acquire privately owned land for desert tortoise habitat through land exchanges, purchases, or donations. Much of the acquired land is surrounded by or adjacent to federally or state-owned tortoise habitat, and its acquisition makes management easier by consolidating acres needing protection. These land acquisitions have occurred primarily in California and Utah, as almost all tortoise critical habitat in Nevada and Arizona is already federally owned. For example, from 1995 through 2001, BLM acquired approximately 337,000 acres in California, valued at almost $38 million, primarily for the benefit of the desert tortoise. Land acquisition has also been an important feature in Utah, where BLM and the State of Utah have acquired, through purchase and exchange, more than 7,700 acres of nonfederal land valued at almost $62 million, for the benefit of the tortoise. In addition to these acquisitions, the Desert Tortoise Preserve Committee, a nonprofit organization, acquired more than 175 acres of privately owned lands within the 39.5-square-mile Desert Tortoise Natural Area in California. The Committee, in cooperation with another conservation organization, also purchased 1,360 acres of privately owned land in desert tortoise critical habitat in the central Mojave Desert. The Committee has historically donated or sold land it acquires to the federal government or the state of California.", "The recovery plan for the desert tortoise also recommends specific land use restrictions such as restricting livestock grazing, harmful military maneuvers, and excessive and destructive recreational uses. The responsibility for implementing many of these actions falls to the entities that manage land in desert tortoise habitat, including the Bureau of Land Management, the National Park Service, the Department of Defense, and state agencies. These agencies have restricted some permitted uses on lands with tortoise habitat and taken protective steps to aid in the species\u2019 recovery. For example, Washington County, Utah, purchased permits allowing livestock grazing on 30,725 acres of federal land in tortoise habitat in Utah at a cost of $114,000 from ranchers who were willing to sell their land. BLM then retired these permits from use. In addition, since 1991, BLM has prohibited sheep grazing on more than 800,000 acres of tortoise habitat in California; the agency has also restricted cattle grazing in all or part of several other grazing allotments in California either entirely or seasonally when tortoises are active, as part of a settlement agreement with conservation groups. The recovery plan\u2019s recommended restrictions on livestock grazing are controversial because they affect a large number of acres and were recommended on the basis of limited published data. Other significant restrictions that benefit the tortoise include those addressing off-highway vehicles. For example, BLM\u2019s off- highway vehicle management plan limits off-highway vehicle use to existing approved areas, specific courses for competitive events, or designated roads and trails to protect sensitive habitats, species, and cultural resources. However, officials note that enforcing compliance among individual users has proven to be difficult.", "Agencies have also undertaken projects on their lands to control random events such as road kill on highways and human vandalism, and other threats that are associated with human development, such as disease (which may be spread when captive tortoises are released into the wild) and predation by ravens and other animals (which are aggravated by humans through the presence of landfills and other sources of food and water). For example, agencies and others have installed hundreds of miles of fencing to keep tortoises away from roads and other hazardous areas. Joshua Tree National Park installed breaks, or \u201ctortoise cuts,\u201d in the curbs along more than 5 miles of newly constructed park roads in 2001 to avoid trapping desert tortoises in roads. To reduce raven populations and thus discourage predation on juvenile tortoises, Mojave National Preserve has cleaned up approximately 50 acres of illegal garbage dumps, and Joshua Tree National Park has removed a total of almost 550,000 pounds of garbage from 23 sites. The Army\u2019s National Training Center at Fort Irwin also tries to reduce raven populations by covering its landfill with three times as much dirt as it would otherwise in order to reduce its attractiveness to the birds. In 2000 and 2001, Edwards Air Force Base closed 42 \u201cpitfalls\u201d (such as mine shafts, wells, and irrigation pipes) in critical habitat that were potentially hazardous to desert tortoises.", "Protective actions may also be required to offset, or mitigate, the effects of potentially harmful activities. For example, development may occur on nonfederal lands with desert tortoises, but before the Service will issue a permit allowing tortoises to be taken or habitat to be disturbed, the applicant must develop a plan describing mitigating actions\u2014such as timing a project to minimize the likelihood of disturbing tortoises, acquiring replacement habitat to compensate for the disturbed acreage, or the payment of fees to be used for tortoise conservation. Some local governments have obtained permits that allow tortoises to be taken so that habitat within their jurisdictions can be developed. For example, Clark County, Nevada\u2014which includes Las Vegas\u2014has obtained a 30\u2013year permit from the Fish and Wildlife Service that allows listed species, including tortoises, to be taken incidental to development in the county. The permit allows development of up to 145,000 acres of desert tortoise habitat on nonfederal land and requires that land developers pay $550 to a mitigation fund for every acre developed within the county. The mitigation fees are used to pay for conservation projects in the county to offset the effects of development on desert tortoises and other species. Similarly, Washington County, Utah, has a 20-year permit authorizing the take of 1,169 tortoises incidental to land development in the county. Washington County\u2019s primary means of mitigating the effects of development on desert tortoises was to establish the 61,000-acre Red Cliffs Reserve in which no development is allowed; approximately 39,000 acres are occupied desert tortoise habitat. BLM and the state of Utah manage most of the land within the reserve. Elsewhere in the county, development is allowed on approximately 12,000 acres of nonfederal land. Developers pay $250 plus 0.2 percent of the development costs for each acre they develop; the fees are used to manage the reserve.", "Agencies and others also rely on education to reduce threats to tortoises. For example:   Department of Defense installations in tortoise habitat require all soldiers to attend training that raises their awareness about the status of the tortoise and teaches them what to do if they encounter a tortoise,   BLM\u2019s Statewide Desert Tortoise Management Policy includes a detailed   Joshua Tree National Park and the Mojave National Preserve have developed educational kits for use in schools, and   Clark County, Nevada, uses radio and newspaper announcements to target desert users, reminding them to deposit garbage only at garbage dumps in order to control raven populations, shoot responsibly, and drive on roads.", "Appendix I discusses specific actions agencies have taken in more detail."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effectiveness of Recovery and Mitigation Actions Is Unclear Because Research and Management Decisions Are Not Integrated", "paragraphs": ["The recovery plan recommends that research be conducted to guide and monitor desert tortoise recovery efforts and states that as new information continues to become available, these new data should influence management practices. The recovery plan recommends research on threats to tortoises including diseases and other sources of mortality, the long-term effects of road density and activities like livestock grazing on desert tortoise populations, and the effectiveness of protective measures in reducing human-caused desert tortoise mortality; it also recommends that a comprehensive model of the life history of the desert tortoise be developed, as such information is helpful in understanding how various factors influence a species\u2019 survival. The scientists we consulted emphasized the importance of research for assessing the effectiveness of recovery actions, not only for determining whether delisting is appropriate, but also for allocating scarce resources to those actions with the most positive effects on desert tortoise populations.", "Research is underway in several of the recommended areas, including diseases and how they are transmitted, desert tortoise habitat and health, nutrition, predation, the effects of climate variability on tortoises, and survival of juvenile desert tortoises. Scientists from many different organizations, including the U.S. Geological Survey, the Service, the National Park Service, military installations, military laboratories, states, universities, and private consulting groups, perform this research. According to information compiled by researchers at the Redlands Institute at the University of Redlands, research presented since 1989 at the Desert Tortoise Council\u2019s annual symposia\u2014where scientists, land managers, and others gather to share information on desert tortoise issues\u2014has covered more than 20 areas, with disease, livestock grazing, roads, and off-highway vehicle use emerging as the four most commonly presented topics (see fig. 4).", "Despite the relatively extensive desert tortoise research efforts, there is no overall coordination of the research to ensure that questions about the effectiveness of protective actions are answered. Such a coordinated program would direct research to address management needs and ensure that managers are aware of current research as they make decisions. More importantly, such a program would allow managers to adapt land management decisions on the basis of science. Unless research is focused on determining if restrictions and other protective actions are effective, managers cannot demonstrate a scientific basis for deciding whether restrictions should remain unchanged, be strengthened, or if other actions would be more appropriate. For example, since the Bureau of Land Management eliminated sheep grazing on more than 800,000 acres in California, neither the Bureau nor the Service has assessed whether this action has benefited desert tortoises or their habitat. Despite ongoing research into how livestock grazing affects the soils and plants upon which desert tortoises depend, few data are available to show the extent of its impacts and the effectiveness of restrictions in reducing adverse effects. One scientist discussed recent research that could influence future priorities for protective actions. Specifically, this research suggests that tortoise fencing may be more effective along roads with intermittent traffic than along highways, as the heavier highway traffic may itself deter tortoises from attempting to cross. However, we recognize that in some cases obtaining definitive data regarding management actions may take many years for long-lived species like the desert tortoise.", "While no overall process exists for integrating research and management decisions, several efforts are underway to aggregate scientific information about tortoises and the desert ecosystem and identify information gaps.", "The Desert Tortoise Management Oversight Group was established in 1988 to coordinate agency planning and management activities affecting the desert tortoise, and to implement the management actions called for in BLM's Desert Tortoise Rangewide Plan. The group consists of BLM's state- office directors from Arizona, California, Nevada, and Utah and a Washington office representative; the four states' fish and game directors; regional directors of the three Fish and Wildlife Service offices with desert tortoise management responsibilities; it also includes representatives of the National Park Service, the U. S. Geological Survey, and the military installations with desert tortoise habitat. The Management Oversight Group is intended to provide leadership in implementation of the recovery plan, consider funding and research priorities, help ensure data analysis procedures are standardized, and review plans related to the desert tortoise. In 1990, a Technical Advisory Committee was formed to provide technical assistance to the group. The Desert Tortoise Research Project, a group of U.S. Geological Survey biologists conducting research on the desert tortoise, works with the Technical Advisory Committee to help establish research priorities.", "The Mojave Desert Ecosystem Program, a cooperative effort among several agencies that is led by the Department of Defense, has aggregated large amounts of data on elevation, geology, climate, and vegetation in the Mojave Desert ecosystem and has made them available as a shared scientific database through the Internet. This shared database is intended to allow land managers to make data-driven land management decisions.", "The California Desert Managers Group, comprised of managers from agencies of the Departments of Defense and Interior and the State of California, is chartered to develop and integrate the databases and scientific studies needed for effective resource management and planning for the California desert. Currently, the group is compiling a list of the major ongoing scientific activities in the Mojave Desert to identify significant research gaps, opportunities to collaborate, and opportunities to solicit support for scientific research needed to fill those gaps.", "The Redlands Institute at the University of Redlands has begun a project, funded by the Department of Defense, to compile, organize, and store desert tortoise monitoring information and develop a database of desert tortoise-specific research, which the Institute will make available to land managers.", "In addition, during our review, the Service official with lead responsibility for the desert tortoise program made a proposal to the Service\u2019s regional office to establish a science office and a permanent science advisory committee that would work with managers to ensure that future desert tortoise research is responsive to the managers\u2019 needs for information. The proposed science office would coordinate research and would work with the Mojave Desert Ecosystem Program, the University of Redlands, and others to establish and centralize data and procedures. The proposed science committee, which would be composed of unbiased, recognized experts in disciplines relevant to tortoise recovery, would work with the science office and land managers to set priorities for desert tortoise recovery actions and review agencies\u2019 documents for their scientific soundness. The official anticipates that the proposed committee would provide a scientific context to support decisions that are, in some cases, difficult and controversial."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Service Has Not Reassessed the Recovery Plan in Light of Recent Research", "paragraphs": ["The recovery plan recognizes that few of the data available at the time the plan was developed were useful for recovery planning; accordingly, it recommends that the plan be reassessed every 3 to 5 years in light of newer findings. Service guidance also recommends that recovery plans be reviewed periodically to determine if updates or revisions are needed. Recovery team members and the scientists we consulted agreed that the Service should assess new research and determine if the recovery plan needs to be revised or updated to accommodate new or different findings.", "However, although the plan was issued 8 years ago, the Service has not yet reassessed it for several reasons. First, because the Service has limited resources for meeting its continuing obligations to designate critical habitat and develop recovery plans for other listed species, resources are not readily available for recovery plan revisions. In addition, some Service officials believe that new research has not indicated that significant changes are needed in the tortoise recovery plan. Finally, some Service officials believe that as new information is developed, it can be and sometimes is incorporated into ongoing land management decisions.", "Given the controversy surrounding some of the recovery plan\u2019s recommendations and the resulting management actions, periodic reassessment of the plan in view of ongoing research could provide evidence for either retaining or revising the existing recommendations. For example, according to a recent review of scientific literature on threats to desert tortoise populations, research has shown that heavy, uncontrolled off-road vehicle use severely damages vegetation that desert tortoises rely on for food and reduces population densities, a finding that supports restrictions on such use. In contrast, the effects of livestock grazing on desert tortoises\u2014effects that the recovery team identified as a significant threat\u2014are still hotly debated, and research has not yet established that livestock grazing has caused declines in desert tortoise populations. In addition, reassessing the plan based on new research could also indicate whether or not the critical habitat boundaries\u2014which were based on a draft of the recovery plan\u2014should be revised."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Data Are Insufficient to Determine the Status of the Desert Tortoise Rangewide, and Continued Funding for Monitoring Is Uncertain", "paragraphs": ["Data on trends in tortoise populations that would indicate whether or not the species is recovering and can be delisted are not available because population monitoring efforts have only recently begun and will need to continue for at least 25 years (one generation of desert tortoises).

Under the plan, before the desert tortoise can be delisted, tortoise populations must become stable or increase, as shown by at least 25 years of population monitoring. In order to monitor population trends, it is necessary to have baseline population data. While land managers have been concerned about the desert tortoise for over 2 decades, such baseline data are not available rangewide because most population monitoring has been done in specific areas for other purposes and cannot be extrapolated to the entire population. For example, information on the health and status of desert tortoise populations in certain areas\u2014primarily in California\u2014has been collected from permanent study plots, some since the 1970s. These study plots were established to provide data on attributes of tortoise populations and their relationships to the condition of the habitat and land-use patterns. However, the locations of these plots were judgmentally selected and are therefore insufficient to allow scientists to project their status to that of the entire desert tortoise population.", "Development of a baseline population estimate has been delayed in part by difficulty in determining an acceptable methodology. The recovery plan recommended a technique for estimating desert tortoise populations, but that technique was discarded after federal land managers agreed in 1998 to a different, more suitable population monitoring technique that they believed would provide more reliable data on the population rangewide. However, efforts to implement the agreed-upon rangewide monitoring technique were hampered by a lack of funding and the absence of a designated coordinator. In 2001, the Fish and Wildlife Service began coordinating the collection of population data throughout the desert tortoise\u2019s range using the agreed-upon technique. Establishing a complete baseline population estimate is expected to take 5 years. Service officials estimate that after the baseline is established, additional monitoring will need to occur every 3 to 5 years to determine how populations are changing over time. According to land managers and tortoise experts, counting tortoises is difficult because populations are widespread and spend much of their time underground. In addition, there are differences in peoples\u2019 abilities to locate individual desert tortoises, especially juveniles, which can be as small as a silver dollar coin."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Continued Funding for Population Monitoring Is Uncertain", "paragraphs": ["A major concern for the tortoise recovery effort is continued funding for rangewide population monitoring.

For example, a Bureau of Land Management official in California made an informal commitment to provide $200,000 for monitoring in fiscal year 2002, anticipating that the Bureau would continue to receive funding for management in the California Desert as it had in previous years. However, the funding did not materialize, and the Bureau determined that because of budget constraints it would be unable to fund the effort.

From fiscal years 1989 through 1998, agencies reported spending a total of about $92 million on behalf of the desert tortoise, including about $37 million for land acquisition. Comprehensive expenditure data do not exist for fiscal years 1980 through 1988, because the reporting requirement had not yet been enacted, or for 1999 through 2001, because of delays issuing the report.

These expenditures cover a myriad of activities related to the conservation and recovery of threatened and endangered species, such as funding and conducting research, maintaining species\u2019 habitats, surveying species\u2019 populations, developing plans, and implementing conservation measures. Expenditures for land acquisition are also reported, although they were not reported as a separate category until fiscal year 1993.", "The purpose of the reporting requirement, according to the Service, was to obtain information with which to assess claims that a disproportionate effort was being made to conserve a few, highly visible species at the expense of numerous, less well-known species. Through discussions with congressional staff and language contained in the conference report for the 1988 amendment, the Service determined that it and other federal and state agencies were expected to cooperate and to make a \u201cgood faith effort\u201d to collect and report expenditure data that are \u201creasonably identifiable\u201d to species. The reporting provision, however, was not to become unduly burdensome. That is, agencies were not expected to undertake extensive or extraordinary measures, such as creating species- specific cost accounting systems, to develop exceptionally precise data; nor were agencies expected to pro-rate staff salaries and other normal operational and maintenance costs not directed toward a particular species. According to the Service, a significant portion of conservation activities benefiting threatened and endangered species are not easily identified to individual species such as law enforcement, consultation, and recovery coordination, and are, therefore, not included in the annual report.", "Based on its understanding of the reporting purpose, the Service issues guidance to federal and state agencies each year on the types of expenditures to report, which include research, habitat management, recovery plan development or implementation, mitigation, status surveys, and habitat acquisition, as well as the salary costs of employees who work full-time on a single species or whose time devoted to a particular species can be readily identified. The guidance states that salary costs of staff that are not assigned to work on particular species, expenditures on unlisted species or state-listed species (unless they are also federally listed), and expenditures on formal consultations dealing with multiple species should not be reported. The Service also does not include agencies\u2019 unrealized revenues from unsold water, timber, power, or other resources resulting from actions taken to conserve threatened or endangered species.", "Reported federal and state expenditures on behalf of the desert tortoise totaled about $92 million, including about $37 million for land acquisition, from fiscal years 1989 through 1998\u2014the latest year for which comprehensive data were available. Of all the agencies reporting desert tortoise expenditures, the Bureau of Land Management spent the most by far\u2014about 5 times more than the Service spent (see table 2).", "Over the 10-year fiscal period from 1989 through 1998, federal and state expenditures on the desert tortoise increased more than 40-fold, from about $719,000 in fiscal year 1989 to nearly $31.7 million in fiscal year 1998 (see fig. 5).", "The sharp increases in tortoise expenditures in fiscal years 1997 and 1998 are associated with significant expenditures for land acquisition. In fiscal year 1997, nearly $8 million\u2014or 56 percent of the $14 million in expenditures on the tortoise that year\u2014was for land acquisition. Similarly, in fiscal year 1998, about $26.5 million\u2014or 84 percent of the $31.7 million spent on the tortoise\u2014was for land. All of the land acquisition expenditures for the tortoise in 1998 were made by the Bureau of Land Management, as was all but about $800,000 of the 1997 land acquisition expenditures (the Service made the remainder).", "The $92 million that federal and state agencies reported spending on the desert tortoise accounted for about 2.8 percent of the total $3.3 billion they reported spending on all threatened and endangered species from fiscal years 1989 through 1998. During this period, 13 species, including the desert tortoise, each had total expenditures of more than $50 million; these species accounted for about 43 percent of total expenditures during this period (see fig. 6).", "Comprehensive data on expenditures on endangered species have not been available since fiscal year 1998 because the Service has not been issuing its reports annually, as required. The latest report was published on August 30, 1999, and was for expenditures in fiscal year 1997. Service officials also provided us a draft of the report on the fiscal year 1998 expenditures, which we included in our analysis. Also, although comprehensive expenditure data were not available since fiscal year 1999, the Service shared with us the data it had received as August 19, 2002. By that date, all but a few agencies had reported their 1999 expenditures. Five agencies and the states, however, had not reported their 2000 expenditures, and only two agencies had reported their 2001 expenditures. For these 3 fiscal years, federal and state agencies had reported a total of about $12.4 million in additional desert tortoise expenditures. (This amount is not included in the $92 million in reported tortoise expenditures.)", "The Service official responsible for the report admitted that the agency has not been complying with the annual reporting requirement for several reasons. First, the Service has not always been timely in requesting the needed information from federal and state agencies. Second, several agencies have not submitted their information on time, and the Service has chosen to wait to issue the report until all agencies have done so. In some cases, agencies have been more than a year late in providing information to the Service. And third, competing priorities within the Service have delayed the report\u2019s preparation. For example, the staff responsible for preparing the expenditures report had concurrent responsibilities such as outreach, interagency coordination, Endangered Species Act listings, and critical habitat determinations. For future reports, the Service plans to develop a web-based reporting system and use an intern to compile the data in order to issue its report more timely.", "Without timely issuance of the annual reports, decision makers and the public have an incomplete picture of the expenditures made on threatened and endangered species, both individually and in total. These reports constitute the only readily available, consolidated source of federal and state expenditures on a species-by-species basis. Accordingly, they can serve as a valuable tool\u2014for the Congress, agency officials, and other interested parties\u2014for assessing trends in spending over time, whether for all species or for any one species of interest. For example, the reports allow the Congress to assess whether a few species are receiving a disproportionate amount of funding at the expense of numerous other species. Additionally, the reports allow one to discern spending patterns that could, in turn, indicate regions or ecosystems that may be receiving more or less attention.", "Because the Service\u2019s annual report does not account for many years during which tortoise work was being done, we requested staff-time estimates from five key agencies involved in desert tortoise activities\u2014the Bureau of Land Management, the Department of Defense, the National Park Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the U.S. Geological Survey. These agencies estimated that they spent the equivalent of 471 staff years, worth about $29.6 million (in 2001 dollars), on tortoise activities from fiscal years 1980 through 2001. Agencies developed their staff-time estimates based on staff memory, judgment, and anecdotal evidence, supplemented by personnel records reviews. These estimates cannot be combined with the annual expenditures that are reported because some agencies include staff time in their reports and others do not. We can, however, add to the reported expenditures the value of the five agencies\u2019 staff-time estimates for the 9-year period for which annual expenditure data have not been compiled (fiscal years prior to 1989 and after 1998). The five agencies\u2019 total staff-time estimate for these pre- and post-reporting periods is valued at about $10.6 million (in addition to the $92 million in expenditures reported by federal and state agencies).", "Of the five agencies estimating staff time devoted to tortoise-related activities over the 22-year fiscal period from 1980 through 2001, the Bureau of Land Management reported the greatest staff-time investment\u2014about $16.2 million, more than the four other agencies combined. The Service was a distant second, with a staff-time investment of about $5.5 million\u2014 about a third that of the Bureau\u2019s. Overall, the agencies\u2019 staff-time investment steadily increased from 1980 through 1989, and then rose sharply following the tortoise\u2019s rangewide listing as a threatened species (see fig. 7)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Overall Economic Impact Associated with Tortoise Recovery Is Unknown", "paragraphs": ["Aside from the reported expenditures and staff-time cost estimates, the overall economic impact associated with the tortoise recovery effort is unknown, although some limited analyses have been done. For example, while it is known that restrictions on residential and commercial development in tortoise habitat have resulted in foregone opportunities, the extent and economic value of such lost opportunities has not been quantified. City and county governments, individual landowners, developers, and recreationists have incurred costs to comply with the requirements to protect tortoises, but no consolidated source of information exists to determine the full extent of such costs, and some are difficult to quantify. These requirements include training employees to correctly handle tortoises they encounter, facing project or event delays or restrictions associated with tortoise conservation, and preparing mitigation plans.", "Although various publications have estimated some costs and discussed benefits, none provides a comprehensive analysis of the economic impact of restrictions on land use to protect the desert tortoise. The most comprehensive analysis we reviewed was prepared by the Service in conjunction with its 1994 designation of critical habitat for the desert tortoise. This analysis evaluated the impact of potential restrictions on federal land use in the seven counties that would be affected by the designation of critical habitat for the tortoise. The analysis concluded that the restrictions stemming from the designation could significantly affect small rural communities, but they would have little effect on the regional or national economy. According to the economic analysis, the critical habitat designation would primarily affect three activities: ranching, mineral extraction, and recreation. For example, the analysis estimated a loss of no more than 425 jobs in the seven affected counties, with 340 of those in the ranching industry. Ranching profits were expected to be the hardest hit, with a reduction of about $4.5 million. About 51 permits\u2014covering about 1.7 percent of all grazing units allowed on federal land in Arizona, California, Nevada, and Utah\u2014would be affected.", "It is important to note that the Service\u2019s analysis considered only the effects of restrictions on federal land. The analysis recognized that many restrictions had already been put in place on federal and nonfederal land as a result of the tortoise\u2019s listing. For example, it cited restrictions on grazing and off-road vehicle use in California and Nevada and indicated that the critical habitat designation could result in additional restrictions in those areas. For Utah, however, the report stated that little or no additional restrictions would likely be associated with the designation, as critical habitat had previously been designated for the small portion of the population of the tortoise in the state.", "An analysis conducted by the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Economic Research Service substantiated some of the results of the Service\u2019s economic analysis for the critical habitat designation. This analysis estimated the direct and total economic effects of different levels of reductions in grazing rights in counties with known populations of desert tortoises and in counties with designated habitat areas. The estimated effects of grazing restrictions on federal land ranged from $3 million to $9 million. This analysis also concluded that grazing restrictions may have a significant impact on individual ranchers, but their impact on regional economies was not as significant. Under every scenario, the relative cost of total impacts from restrictions was less than 0.08 percent of the gross domestic product of the economic region. Lost livestock sales were the single largest cost associated with grazing restrictions; however, grazing restrictions were not likely to affect national livestock production or prices. Other kinds of restrictions can similarly have an economic cost. For example, restrictions on development, mining, and off-road vehicle use can result in foregone revenue and recreation opportunities. Such costs, however, have not been quantified.", "An analysis prepared by Washington County, Utah, in 1995 examined the costs and benefits associated with protective actions for the desert tortoise. Specifically, the county analyzed the costs and benefits of obtaining a permit from the Service that would allow the county to approve development projects in desert tortoise habitat. Under this permit, the county would establish a 61,000-acre reserve for desert tortoises to mitigate potential harm to tortoises from the projects. The analysis concluded that the benefits of establishing the reserve would be more than the benefits associated with having individual developers obtain permits and carry out their own mitigation actions. Property tax revenue were estimated at about $48 million more with the county obtaining the permit because if individual developers had to obtain their own permits, they would not likely develop as much land. Creating the reserve was expected to have little effect on mining and no effect on farmland. The analysis did not quantify the reserve\u2019s economic impact on livestock grazing, although it noted that the county would extend purchase offers to holders of grazing permits on reserve land. Finally, the analysis concluded that the reserve would result in many benefits. These benefits include the aesthetic value of the open space within the reserve, the increased value of private property adjacent to the reserve (and the associated increase in property taxes), and annual expenditures of about $17.5 million a year by local and regional visitors to the reserve and its associated education center.", "Clark County, Nevada, also analyzed, in 2000, costs and benefits for a permit that would allow development similar to that in Washington County. However, Clark County\u2019s permit addresses potential impacts to 79 species including the desert tortoise, and the economic impact associated with the tortoise cannot be identified separately. In addition to the county\u2019s analysis, agencies that manage land in Clark County have prepared their own economic analyses, as part of environmental impact statements for their individual management plans. For example, BLM identified negative fiscal impacts from restrictions on cattle grazing in desert tortoise habitats in Clark County. As a result, the county has obtained grazing and water rights from willing sellers rather than restricting grazing outright. In contrast, the Forest Service found positive socioeconomic impacts from tortoise protections included in its management plan for the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area.These positive impacts were associated with increased recreation that could provide business opportunities for the surrounding communities.", "As the Washington County and Spring Mountains analyses indicate, tortoise recovery efforts can lead to measurable economic benefits. Other economic benefits clearly derive from efforts to protect the desert tortoise, but generally have not been estimated. These benefits are intangible and include such things as aesthetic values associated with protected areas, the knowledge that the tortoise continues to exist and may be available for future generations, and the corollary benefits that other species enjoy as a result of protections extended to the tortoise. Also, according to agency officials, the tortoise recovery effort has resulted in improved communication and coordination among federal, state, and local government officials, as well as private groups such as environmental advocates and off-highway vehicle clubs. Agency officials believe that education and communication efforts ultimately achieve greater protections for not only the tortoise but for the desert ecosystem as a whole."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Many scientists consider the desert tortoise to be an indicator of the health of the desert ecosystem, and to date, over $100 million has been spent on efforts to protect and recover the species. Despite the significant expenditures made and actions taken to conserve the tortoise, land managers and the Service lack critical management tools and measures needed to assess the status of the species and to determine the effectiveness of protections and restrictions that have been taken. Specifically, the lack of a strategy for integrating research with management decisions prevents the Service and land managers from ensuring that research is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of protective actions taken and to identify additional actions that could assist in the recovery effort. While several efforts are underway to consolidate scientific information about the tortoise and its habitat, and a recent proposal has been made for integrating science with management, it is unclear how and to what extent these efforts will be used to direct research and management actions, and the efforts may be duplicative if not properly coordinated. In addition, the original recovery plan for the tortoise has not been reviewed to determine whether recommended actions are still valid or whether recent scientific information would suggest more effective recovery actions. Such a review is important given the continued uncertainties surrounding some of the plan's original recommendations. Also, a lack of funding assurances may hamper efforts to collect rangewide population monitoring information needed to assess the current status of the desert tortoise and to track the future growth or decline in the species. Finally, late and incomplete expenditure reporting precludes the Congress and the public from knowing the type and extent of expenditures involved in the desert tortoise recovery effort.

The persons we selected have recognized expertise in the areas of conservation biology, herpetology, desert ecosystems, and federal land management policy, and collectively represent a range of perspectives and views on the conservation of threatened and endangered species. The selection involved a two-step process. First, the academy identified, and provided to GAO, an extensive candidate pool of individuals for possible participation. We selected a smaller pool of scientists from which the final selections were made, based on the scientists\u2019 availability to participate. The academy\u2019s staff administered a questionnaire to identify potential conflicts of interest; no disqualifying conflicts of interest were identified. The scientists participating in the discussion were: Dr. Roy C. Averill-Murray Amphibians and Reptiles Program Manager Nongame Branch, Arizona Game and Fish Department Phoenix, Arizona Dr. Perry R. Hagenstein Institute for Forest Analysis, Planning, and Policy Wayland, Massachusetts Dr. Jay D. Johnson University Animal Hospital Tempe, Arizona Dr. James A.

O\u2019Brien Senior Research Scientist Chevron Texaco Energy Research and Technology Company Richmond, California Dr. Frederic H. Wagner Professor of Wildlife and Fisheries Utah State University Logan, Utah GAO provided the scientists with the listing decision, the critical habitat designation, the recovery plan, and key supporting documents. GAO also provided access to other materials referenced in the key decision documents. In a 2-day, facilitated discussion, the scientists provided their views on five questions:   Overall, do the listing decision and critical habitat designation seem reasonable, given the scientific studies and other information that were considered? Where do you agree and what concerns, if any, do you have?", "Do the recommended numbers, sizes, and configurations of recovery areas and desert wildlife management areas seem reasonable? What are the strengths and weaknesses of the population viability analysis?", "Do the recovery plan\u2019s recommendations about activities that should be prohibited within protected areas (e.g., grazing, mining, off-road vehicle use) and mitigative actions that should be taken (e.g., fencing or installing culverts underneath heavily traveled roads) seem supported by the scientific studies? Where do you agree and what concerns, if any, do you have?", "To what extent do the decision documents acknowledge and accommodate uncertainties in the scientific studies? Do the accommodations seem reasonable?", "Do any of the issues addressed in the recovery plan need to be reassessed from time to time? If so, describe. How often do you think such issues should be reassessed, and under what conditions?", "To further our understanding of the process used to develop listing decisions, critical habitat designations, and recovery plan recommendations for the desert tortoise, we interviewed officials and collected pertinent documentation from numerous federal agencies, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Geological Survey, the Bureau of Land Management, the National Park Service, and military installations of the Department of Defense; state and local governments in California, Nevada, and Utah; nongovernmental organizations, such as the Desert Tortoise Preserve Committee, the High Desert Multiple Use Coalition, and the QuadState Coalition; academic scientists; and six of the eight members of the desert tortoise recovery team.", "To assess the effectiveness of actions taken by federal agencies and others to conserve the desert tortoise and to assess what is known about trends in tortoise populations, we collected relevant land use planning documents, habitat conservation plans, and other official documents, published and unpublished scientific studies, desert tortoise population monitoring reports, survey data collected and compiled by the Management Oversight Groups\u2019 Technical Advisory Committee regarding recovery actions, and other reports. We interviewed officials from federal and state agencies and other organizations involved with the tortoise, and conducted several site visits to observe tortoise habitat and implementation of conservation actions. Specifically, we made site visits to the Desert Tortoise Conservation Center in Las Vegas, Nevada; the Desert Tortoise Natural Area in California; Joshua Tree National Park; the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center at Twentynine Palms, California; the Army\u2019s National Training Center at Fort Irwin, California; and the Red Cliffs Reserve in Washington County, Utah. We also attended the annual symposium of the Desert Tortoise Council in Palm Springs, California, which featured presentations on actions taken to conserve the desert tortoise and results of tortoise recovery efforts and research projects.", "To identify costs and benefits associated with desert tortoise recovery actions since the tortoise was first listed in 1980, we examined the annual expenditure reports the Service is required to submit to the Congress; these reports compile and summarize federal and state agencies\u2019 annual expenditures on threatened and endangered species, by species. The reports contain expenditure data for land acquisition and for general activities (e.g., conducting research, monitoring species\u2019 populations, developing and implementing recovery plans, and constructing fences). The reporting requirement began for expenditures made in fiscal year 1989, and the last report the Service submitted to the Congress was for expenditures made in fiscal year 1997. We obtained all nine of these reports, as well as the draft report for fiscal year 1998 and the more recent expenditure data (for fiscal years 1999 through 2001) that the Service had compiled as of August 19, 2002, but had not published.", "Although the Service summarizes and reports data on a species-by-species basis, it does not summarize and report data on an agency-by-agency basis. Rather, the Service reports, in addition to its own expenditures, one lump sum for expenditures by other federal agencies. Accordingly, we reviewed and analyzed the agencies\u2019 individual expenditure reports, which are reproduced in an appendix in each report. We were thus able to compare and report information, year by year and in total, on individual agencies\u2019 expenditures on the tortoise and on other species. We excluded from the agencies\u2019 data those expenditures that clearly did not meet the intent of the report, such as expenditures that could not be broken out by species, expenditures made on behalf of sensitive or candidate species (species in need of protection but not listed as threatened or endangered), and power purchases and revenue foregone as a result of actions taken to protect listed species. Nevertheless, our sums did not always match those in the reports because the Service also excluded from its sums expenditures made on certain species, including species that were state listed but not federally listed, species that were listed after the fiscal year for which the expenditures were reported, and species that were in need of protection but were not listed. Although a few of the reports showed which expenditures the Service had excluded from its sums, most did not. In such cases, the total expenditures shown in the report for \u201cother federal agencies\u201d were less than the totals we calculated. Further, because the Service sometimes included land acquisition expenditures in its reported totals and sometimes excluded them, we recalculated the totals to consistently include land acquisition expenditures. We were thus able to consistently depict trends in total expenditures, whether by species, by agency, or by year.", "We did not verify the accuracy of the expenditures reported by the individual agencies or by the Service, but we checked the consistency of the information we were given, to the extent possible. We reviewed the guidance the Service provides to agencies on the types of expenditure data to submit, and we discussed with Service officials the criteria and methods by which the expenditure data are reviewed and edited. Additionally, we discussed with several agency officials the type of expenditure data they submit and the methods by which they estimate their expenditures. We adjusted all the expenditures to constant 2001 dollars.", "Because tortoise-related expenditures were not collected prior to the 1989 annual report, and because comprehensive and current expenditure data were not available for the years since 1998, we requested estimates of staff time devoted to the tortoise from the five key federal agencies involved in the tortoise\u2019s recovery: the Bureau of Land Management, Department of Defense, Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, and U.S. Geological Survey. We asked these agencies to provide, for each employee who worked on tortoise-related activities, the employee\u2019s name, grade level, area of expertise, and percent of time devoted to tortoise- related activities during each fiscal year from 1980 through 2001. Through discussions with various agency officials, we determined that the request was reasonable and that the agencies would be able to provide us with fairly reliable staff-time estimates by consulting various staff members, personnel records, and historical data. Based on these discussions, we provided each of the five agencies with instructions, guidance, and examples of the information sought. We received staff-time estimates from all but two of the pertinent agency offices (e.g., those offices likely to have extensive experience and involvement in desert tortoise issues). We did not receive estimates from Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, or the Chocolate Mountain Aerial Gunnery Range, California.", "To analyze the estimates, we used the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s historical salary tables to calculate the salary for each grade level in each year. In accordance with guidance contained in Circular A-76, issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), we used step 5 of each grade level to calculate salaries, except when the agency\u2019s data included the step. For staff that were members of the military, we asked the installation to convert the military pay grade to the equivalent general schedule grade. Finally, based on A-76 guidance and our discussions with officials of OMB and MEVATEC Corporation (a contractor that advises and assists the Department of Defense with A-76 cost comparisons), we determined, for each year, the salary percentage that represented the value of the federal benefits package (i.e., health insurance, life insurance, pension plans, and workman\u2019s compensation). We adjusted the staff-time values to constant 2001 dollars.", "We obtained staff-time estimates from the following federal agencies and offices.", "Bureau of Land Management\u2014California Desert District (District Office and five field offices: Ridgecrest, Palm Springs, El Centro, Barstow, and Needles); Las Vegas Field Office; St. George Field Office; Utah State Office; and Cedar City District Office.", "Department of Defense\u2014National Training Center, Fort Irwin; Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center, Twentynine Palms; Edwards Air Force Base; and Naval Air Weapons Station, China Lake.", "U.S. Geological Survey\u2014Mid Continent Ecological Science Center, Fort Collins; Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center; Western Ecological Research Center Field Stations in Las Vegas, Nevada; Riverside, California; and St. George, Utah (this field station no longer exists).", "Fish and Wildlife Service\u2014Laguna Niguel/Carlsbad Field Office, Ventura Field Office, Barstow Field Office, Salt Lake City Office, Phoenix Office, Reno Office, Las Vegas Office, and Portland Regional Office.", "National Park Service\u2014Joshua Tree National Park, Mojave National Preserve, Lake Mead National Recreation Area, and Zion National Park.", "To obtain a perspective on potential economic effects associated with the tortoise recovery effort, we reviewed the economic analyses contained in various documents, such as the critical habitat designation for the tortoise, environmental impact statements prepared by federal agencies, and habitat conservation plans. To gauge the potential economic effects of grazing restrictions in tortoise habitat, we requested that the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Economic Research Service (ERS) calculate county-level economic effects, using a recently published analytical method. The authors had developed this method to estimate both the direct and indirect effects of grazing restrictions. Estimates of the direct (ranch-level) effects were based on the value of county cattle and sheep sales that would be lost if grazing restrictions were imposed. Estimates of the indirect (and induced) effects of grazing restrictions were then derived from an input-output model, using the estimates of the direct effects. The indirect effects include the effects in all industries that supply inputs to cattle and sheep producers; the induced effects include changes in farm purchases due to changes in farm income.", "At our request, the Economic Research Service estimated hypothetical 10- and 20-percent reductions in grazing owing to restrictions imposed to protect the desert tortoise. Such levels of reduction were deemed reasonable by the ERS researchers, given that not all land in the counties evaluated was federally owned or within critical habitat for the tortoise. (These hypothetical reduction levels are similar to those used in the authors\u2019 original analysis.) The counties included in the study were those with known populations of desert tortoises and those with critical habitat for the species. Other counties were also included as part of a regional economic analysis. The study included Mohave County in Arizona; Kern, Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Inyo Counties in California; Clark, Esmeralda, Nye, and Lincoln Counties in Nevada; and Washington County in Utah. It relied on data on grazing activity from the National Agricultural Statistical Service\u2019s Census of Agriculture, the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Forest Service, and the Bureau of Land Management. General economic data and regional economic data were supplied through IMPLAN\u2014the input-output modeling framework, software, and database developed by the authors and discussed in the referenced article.", "We performed our work from November 2001 through September 2002 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition, Carol Bray, Jennifer Duncan, Kathleen Gilhooly, Tim Guinane, Jaelith Hall-Rivera, Cynthia Norris, Judy Pagano, and Pamela Tumler made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
