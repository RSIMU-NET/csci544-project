The guidance most frequently relates to the comment intake or response to comment phases of the public comment process.", "With the discretion afforded by the APA, selected agencies' treatment of commenters' identity information varies, particularly when posting duplicate comments (identical or near-identical comment text but varied identity information). Generally, officials told GAO that their agencies (1) post all comments within the comment system; or (2) maintain some comments outside of the system, such as in email file archives. For instance, one agency posts a single example of duplicate comments and indicates the total number of comments received. However, within these broad categories, posting practices vary considerably\u2014even within the same agency\u2014and identity information is inconsistently presented on public websites.", "Selected agencies do not clearly communicate their practices for how comments and identity information are posted. GAO's key practices for transparently reporting government data state that federal government websites should disclose data sources and limitations to help public users make informed decisions about how to use the data.

Typically, regulations require regulated parties to take specified actions or  prohibit them from taking certain actions. Agencies use regulations to  carry out statutory directives to achieve public policy goals such as  protecting the health and safety of the public and the environment and  facilitating the effective functioning of financial markets. The  Administrative Procedure Act (APA) governs the process by which many  federal agencies develop and issue regulations. The APA establishes  procedures and broadly applicable federal requirements for informal  rulemaking, also known as notice-and-comment rulemaking. Federal  agencies publish an average of 3,700 proposed rules, or Notices of  Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), each year as part of informal rulemaking  pursuant to the APA.", "Among other things, the APA generally requires agencies to publish an  NPRM in the Federal Register and provide interested persons  (commenters) an opportunity to comment on the proposed rule.  Agencies must give consideration to any significant comments submitted  during the comment period when drafting the final rule. This process  provides, among other things, the public an opportunity to present  information to agencies on the potential effects of a rule, or to suggest  alternatives. To fulfill the notice-and-comment process requirements of  the APA, agencies may rely on Regulations.gov or their own comment  websites to receive public input on proposed rules. During the course of  the notice-and-comment process, agencies may choose to collect  information associated with the identity of the commenters, such as  name, email, or address (identity information).", "In recent years, some high-profile rulemakings have received extremely  large numbers of comments.

Similarly, during the public comment  period for the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s (FCC) 2017  Restoring Internet Freedom NPRM, FCC received more than 22 million  comments through its public comment website. Subsequently, media  and others reported that some of the comments submitted to FCC were  suspected to have been submitted using false identity information.", "You asked us to review issues related to identity information associated  with public comments on proposed rulemakings.

At the time our review began, 2017 was the most recent  complete calendar year. The selected agencies represent a  nongeneralizable sample, and findings from this report cannot be  generalized to all agencies that receive public comments as part of their  rulemaking proceedings. However, as reported by Regulations.gov, the  comments submitted to the eight participating agencies we selected  represent more than 90 percent of all comments submitted to all  participating agencies during the 5-year period.", "To select participating agencies, we obtained publicly available data from  Regulations.gov for all agencies that had rulemaking dockets\u2014the  repository of documents related to a particular rulemaking\u2014where  comments were submitted from January 1, 2013, through December 31,  2017. On the basis of the comment numbers reported by the website,  we selected the eight participating agencies with more than 500,000  comments submitted to dockets that accepted comments during this time.  As of March 2018, there were 128 nonparticipating agencies, most of  which issued less than one NPRM per year during the 5-year period. To  identify nonparticipating agencies that received a high volume of  comments, we obtained a list of rules submitted to GAO for review under  the Congressional Review Act from January 1, 2007, through December  31, 2017. We identified four agencies with more than 10 rules submitted  during the period (at least one rule per year).

Two of the four agencies were unable to provide us with the  total number of comments received over the 5-year period; accordingly,  we selected the two that provided us with comment numbers, FCC and  SEC. Both FCC and SEC received a number of comments comparable to  the selected participating agencies. Within the 10 selected agencies, we  identified 52 program offices with regulatory responsibilities and sent  them survey questionnaires related to the public comment process in  October 2018.

We reviewed relevant system documentation for  Regulations.gov and the agency-specific comment systems, such as user  guides, system architecture documentation, and system logs. We also  reviewed documentation associated with system modernization or  reengineering efforts. In addition, we interviewed relevant information  technology officials from the eRulemaking Program Management Office  (PMO), FCC, and SEC and surveyed program offices about the  information that is collected from public users of the comment systems as  well as agency practices associated with anonymous comments.

For those agencies that did, we  reviewed these documents to determine whether they explicitly included  requirements associated with identity information. We also included  questions about guidance in our survey of program offices.

We obtained comment data for all rulemakings within the 10 selected  agencies that accepted comments from January 1, 2013, through  December 31, 2017, and reviewed them to determine the ways in which  agencies treat the identity information submitted with comments. To  assess the reliability of these data, we reviewed related documentation,  interviewed knowledgeable agency officials, and traced selections to the  source documents. We determined these data to be reliable for the  purposes of selecting case study agencies and identifying comments that  could help us understand how the selected agencies publicly post  comments.

Comment Analysis: During this phase, subject-matter experts  analyze and consider submitted comments. This may include the use  of categorization tools within FDMS or outside software systems.  3.  Comment Response: During this phase, agencies prepare publicly  available responses to the comments in accordance with any  applicable requirements.

Agencies  therefore have no obligation under the APA to verify the identity of such  parties during the rulemaking process. Instead, the APA and courts  require agencies to consider relevant and substantive comments, and  agencies must explain their general response to them in a concise overall  statement of basis and purpose, which in practice forms part of the  preamble of the final rule. Courts have explained that significant  comments are comments that raise relevant points and, if true or if  adopted, would require a change in the proposed rule. However, courts  have held that agencies are not required to respond to every comment  individually. Agencies routinely offer a single response to multiple  identical or similar comments. As explained by Regulations.gov\u2019s \u201cTips for  Submitting Effective Comments,\u201d \u201cthe comment process is not a vote,\u201d  and \u201cagencies make determinations for a proposed action based on  sound reasoning and scientific evidence rather than a majority of votes.

While  all of the comments are included within 10 separate attachments, none of  the identity information included with these comments can be easily found  without opening and searching all 10 attachments, most of which contain  approximately 2,000 individual comments.

As discussed previously, neither BLM nor FWS have internal  guidance or policy associated with comment intake. For CFPB, EBSA,  EPA, and SEC, the agency may post a single example along with the  total count of all duplicate comments, but does not necessarily post all  duplicate comments online.

While the APA does  not include requirements for commenters to provide identity information,  or for agency officials to include commenter identity as part of their  consideration of comments, key practices for transparently reporting open  government data state that federal government websites\u2014like those used  to facilitate the public comment process\u2014should fully describe the  publicly available data, to include disclosing data sources and limitations.  Without clearly communicating how comments and their associated  identity information are presented in the data, public users could draw  inaccurate conclusions about public comments during the rulemaking  process, limiting their ability to participate in the rulemaking process.", "Five selected agencies do not have a policy for posting comments, and  the selected agencies generally do not clearly communicate to public  users about the way in which they publicly post comments and their  associated identity information. In addition, one agency fully duplicates  rulemaking dockets on its own website, without informing users that the  information may be found in a searchable database on Regulations.gov.  Regulations.gov does not provide detailed information about posting  policies, and seven of the eight participating agencies in the scope of our  review direct public users back to Regulations.gov or the Federal Register  on their own websites. Further, the available information is provided on  the comment form, so public users seeking to review comment data that  had been previously submitted may not encounter it. Because all of the  participating agencies in our review vary in the way in which they post  identity information associated with comments\u2014particularly duplicate  comments\u2014the lack of accompanying disclosures may potentially lead  users to reach inaccurate conclusions about who submitted a particular  comment, or how many individuals weighed in on an issue. As a result,  public users of Regulations.gov do not have information related to data  sources and limitations that could affect their ability to effectively use the  comment data and, consequently, participate in the rulemaking process.  Similarly, users of SEC.gov do not have information related to data  sources and limitations needed to determine whether and how they can  use the data associated with public comments, because the agency lacks  a policy for posting duplicate comments and associated identity  information to the public. In short, more clearly communicated information  about posting policies, particularly with regard to identity information and  duplicate comments, could help public users make informed decisions  about how to use the comment data these agencies provide, and how  comments may have informed the rulemaking process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following eight recommendations to the Directors of  BLM, CFPB, and FWS; the Administrators of CMS, EPA, and WHD; the  Assistant Secretary of Labor for EBSA; and the Chairman of the SEC,  respectively:  The Director of BLM should create and implement a policy for standard  posting requirements regarding comments and their identity information,  particularly for duplicate comments, and should clearly communicate this  policy to the public on the BLM website.
