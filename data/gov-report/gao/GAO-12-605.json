While this can enhance efficiency and accuracy, it also raises privacy and security concerns. Federal law establishes the authority for the Secretary of HHS to develop standards for protecting individuals\u0092 health information (which includes Medicare beneficiaries) and to ensure that covered entities (such as health care providers and pharmacies) and their business associates comply with these requirements.", "The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 required GAO to report on prescription drug use data protections. GAO\u0092s specific objective for this review was to determine the extent to which HHS has established a framework to ensure the privacy and security of Medicare beneficiaries\u0092 protected health information when data on prescription drug use are used for purposes other than direct clinical care. To do this, GAO reviewed HHS policies and other related documentation and interviewed agency officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has established a framework for protecting the privacy and security of Medicare beneficiaries\u0092 prescription drug use information when used for purposes other than direct clinical care through its issuance of regulations, outreach, and enforcement activities, it has not issued all required guidance or fully implemented required oversight capabilities. HHS has issued regulations including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules to safeguard protected health information from unauthorized use and disclosure. Through its Office for Civil Rights (OCR), HHS has undertaken a variety of outreach and educational efforts to inform members of the public and covered entities about the uses of protected health information. Specifically, OCR has made available on its website guidance and other materials informing the public about the uses to which their personal information may be put and the protections afforded to that information by federal laws. It has also made available guidance to covered entities and their business associates that is intended to promote compliance with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules.", "However, HHS has not issued required implementation guidance to assist entities in de-identifying personal health information including when it is used for purposes other than directly providing clinical care to an individual. This means ensuring that data cannot be linked to a particular individual, either by removing certain unique identifiers or by applying a statistical method to ensure that the risk is very small that an individual could be identified. According to OCR officials, the completion of the guidance, required by statute to be issued by February 2010, was delayed due to competing priorities for resources and internal reviews. Until the guidance is issued, increased risk exists that covered entities are not properly implementing the standards set forth by federal regulations for de-identifying protected health information.", "Additionally, in enforcing compliance with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules, OCR has established an investigations process for responding to reported violations of the rules. Specifically, the office annually receives thousands of complaints from individuals and notices of data breaches from covered entities, and initiates investigations as appropriate. If it finds that a violation has occurred, the office can require covered entities to take corrective action and pay fines and penalties.", "HHS was also required by law to implement periodic compliance audits of covered entities\u0092 compliance with HHS privacy and security requirements; however, while it has initiated a pilot program for conducting such audits, it does not have plans for establishing a sustained audit capability. According to OCR officials, the office has completed 20 audits and plans to complete 95 more by the end of December 2012, but it has not established plans for continuing the audit program after the completion of the pilots or for auditing covered entities\u0092 business associates.

This can  make the prescription process more efficient and accurate; however, the  transmission and sharing of individuals\u2019 personal information raises  concerns about protecting the privacy and security of that information.", "The capacity of organizations that exchange health information to store  and manage a large amount of electronic health information also  increases the risk that a breach in security could expose the personal  health information of numerous individuals. In recent years, a number of  entities\u2014including health plans, hospitals, universities and medical  centers\u2014have reported the loss or theft of large amounts of sensitive  personal information, such as health information. Such compromises can  leave personal health information vulnerable to inadvertent or deliberate  misuse, loss, or improper disclosure. For example, the Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS) reported that more than 5.4 million  individuals were affected by a breach of their personal health information  in 2010. While information technology can provide the means to protect  the privacy of electronically stored and exchanged health information, the  increased risk of inappropriate access and disclosure heightens the  importance of implementing adequate privacy protections and security  mechanisms in health information exchange systems.", "The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008  (MIPPA) requires us to report, by September 1, 2012, on prescription  drug use data protections.

In contrast, use of an electronic prescribing system consists of a licensed  health care provider using a computer or hand-held device to write and  transmit a prescription directly to the dispenser. Before doing so, the  health care provider can request the beneficiary\u2019s eligibility, formulary,  benefits, and medication history. Figure 1 illustrates an example of the  flow of information during the electronic prescribing process.", "In order to transmit a prescription electronically, multiple entities need to  have access to an individual\u2019s identifiable health information in an  electronic format.

These activities include treatment, payment, health care  operations, and\u2014provided certain conditions are met\u2014public health or  research purposes. For example, electronic health information can be  held by covered entities that perform treatment functions for directly  providing clinical care to a patient through electronic prescribing. These  covered entities and business associates, such as medical professionals,  pharmacies, health information networks, and pharmacy benefit  managers, work together to gather and confirm patients\u2019 electronic health  information for prescribing, such as a beneficiary\u2019s eligibility, formulary,  benefits, and medication history. To electronically transmit prescription  drug data between a health care provider and a pharmacy, an electronic  health record can be used to obtain information about the health of an  individual or the care provided by a health practitioner.", "In both paper-based and electronic prescribing, information is also  provided to the individual\u2019s health plan for payment, which would include  the identification of the beneficiary, the pharmacy, and the drug cost  information. In the case of Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 prescription drug data,  the information is provided to CMS for Part D payment calculations.  Every time a beneficiary fills a prescription under Medicare Part D, a  prescription drug plan sponsor must submit a summary record called  prescription drug event data to CMS. The prescription drug event data  record contains PHI, such as date of birth, the pharmacy that filled the  prescription, and the drug dispensed, that enables CMS to make  payments to plans.

Further, the Privacy  Rule establishes methods for de-identifying PHI. Under the rule, once  identifiers are removed from a data set, it is no longer considered  individually identifiable health information and the HIPAA protections no  longer apply. De-identification provides a mechanism for reducing the  amount of PHI used and disclosed. The Privacy Rule establishes two  ways in which PHI can be de-identified. The Safe Harbor Method requires  the removal of 18 unique types of identifiers from a data set coupled with  no actual knowledge that the remaining data could be used to reidentify  an individual, either alone or in combination with other information.

The  eight resolution agreements entered into with the investigated entities all  included a payment of a resolution amount, and the development or  revision of policies and procedures. In six of these cases further  submission of compliance reports or compliance monitoring was required  for 2 to 3 years. For example, in response to complaints that several  patients\u2019 electronic PHI was viewed without permission by university  health system employees, OCR initiated an investigation which revealed  that unauthorized employees repeatedly looked at the electronic PHI for  numerous patients.

In January 2012, OCR officials stated that the target for  audits to complete was revised to 115.", "According to OCR documentation, during the pilot each audit is  conducted based on the following steps:  1.  An audit is initiated with the selected covered entity being informed by  OCR of its selection and asked to provide documentation of its  privacy, security, and breach notification compliance efforts to the  contracted auditors.  2.  Contracted auditors use the audit procedures developed to assess the  compliance activities of the covered entity. According to officials and  documentation provided, these procedures correspond to the  requirements of the Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules.  In this pilot phase, every audit will include a documentation review  and site visit.  3.  Contracted auditors will provide the audited covered entity the draft  findings within 30 days after conclusion of the field work.  4.  Audited entities will have 10 days to provide the audit contractor with  comments and outline corrective actions planned or taken.  5.  Contracted auditors will develop a final audit report to submit to OCR  within 30 days of receipt of the comments.

Further, OCR has established and  implemented a process to enforce provisions of the HIPAA Privacy and  Security Rules through investigations. However, it has not issued required  implementation guidance to assist entities in de-identifying PHI. By not  issuing the guidance, increased risk exists that covered entities are not  properly implementing the standards set by the HIPAA Privacy Rule and  that PHI is not properly stripped of all identifiers that would identify an  individual. In addition, OCR has not fully established a capability to  proactively monitor covered entities\u2019 compliance through the use of  periodic audits as required by the HITECH Act. Specifically, OCR has yet  to establish plans for a sustained audit capability upon completion of its  pilot program at the end calendar year 2012 and has yet to determine  how to include auditing business associates. Without a plan for deploying  a sustained audit capability on an ongoing basis, OCR will have limited  assurance that covered entities and business associates are complying  with HIPAA regulations, including whether Medicare beneficiaries\u2019  prescription drug use information, when used for purposes other than  directly providing clinical care, is being appropriately safeguarded from  compromise."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve the department\u2019s guidance and oversight efforts for ensuring  the privacy and security of protected health information, including  Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 prescription drug use information, we recommend  that the Secretary of HHS direct the Director of the Office for Civil Rights  to take the following two actions:  Issue guidance on properly implementing the HIPAA Privacy Rule  requirements for the de-identification of protected health information.  \uf0b7  Establish plans for conducting periodic audits to ensure covered  entities and business associates are complying with the HIPAA  Privacy and Security Rules and breach notification standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of the report, the HHS Assistant Secretary  for Legislation agreed with our two recommendations, but provided  qualifying comments for both.

The  Assistant Secretary noted that covered entities have been operating  under these existing de-identification standards for almost 10 years and  that OCR has not found that the standards have been the subject of  significant or frequent compliance issues by covered entities. The  Assistant Secretary noted that OCR\u2019s purpose in issuing the de- identification guidance was to provide covered entities with the current  options and approaches available for de-identifying health information.", "We agree that the existing agency information on the de-identification  standards provide a level of assurance that covered entities have the  parameters and requirements needed to properly remove identifiers from  PHI and have clarified this in our report. However, the HITECH Act  requires HHS to issue de-identification implementation guidance that  addresses how covered entities should implement the de-identification  standards. OCR officials stated that the planned guidance will explain and  answer questions about de-identification methods as well as clarify  guidelines for conducting the expert determination method of de- identification to reduce entities\u2019 reliance on the Safe Harbor method. Such  information could assist covered entities in determining how to properly  implement the de-identification methods.

Specifically, he stated that our  conclusion did not adequately take into account the considerable impact  of the thousands of complaint investigations, compliance reviews, and  other enforcement activities OCR conducts annually to ensure covered  entities are complying with the rules. He noted that although the audit  function is a critical compliance tool for identifying vulnerabilities, the  importance of the audit function should not be understood to diminish the  effectiveness of OCR\u2019s other enforcement activities for bringing about and  enforcing compliance with the HIPAA rules.", "As our report highlighted, OCR has developed and implemented an  enforcement process that is focused on responding to actions that  potentially violate the Privacy and Security Rules. OCR conducts this  reactive process through processing complaints and conducting  thousands of investigations each year. An audit program is an important  addition to OCR\u2019s compliance program as it is a tool to identify  vulnerabilities before they cause breaches and other incidents.
