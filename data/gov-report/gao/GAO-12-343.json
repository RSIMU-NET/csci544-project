To supplement the LMR systems, in 2007, radio frequency spectrum was dedicated for a nationwide public safety broadband network. Presently, 22 jurisdictions around the nation have obtained permission to build public safety broadband networks on the original spectrum assigned for broadband use. This requested report examines (1) the investments in and capabilities of LMR systems; (2) plans for a public safety broadband network and its expected capabilities and limitations; (3) challenges to building this network; and (4) factors that affect the prices of handheld LMR devices.

For public safety, mission critical voice communications must meet a high standard for reliability, redundancy, capacity, and flexibility. Although these LMR systems provide some data services, such as text and images, their ability to transmit data is limited by the channels on which they operate. According to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), interoperability among LMR systems has improved due to its efforts, but full interoperability of LMR systems remains a distant goal.", "Multiple federal entities are involved with planning a public safety broadband network and while such a network would likely enhance interoperability and increase data transfer rates, it would not support mission critical voice capabilities for years to come, perhaps even 10 years or more. A broadband network could enable emergency responders to access video and data applications that improve incident response. Yet because the technology standard for the proposed broadband network does not support mission critical voice capabilities, first responders will continue to rely on their current LMR systems for the foreseeable future. Thus, a broadband network would supplement, rather than replace, current public safety communication systems.", "There are several challenges to implementing a public safety broadband network, including ensuring the network\u0092s interoperability, reliability, and security; obtaining adequate funds to build and maintain it; and creating a governance structure. For example, to avoid a major shortcoming of the LMR systems, it is essential that a public safety broadband network be interoperable across jurisdictions and devices by following five key elements to interoperable networks: governance, standard operating procedures, technology, training, and usage. With respect to creating a governance structure, pending legislation\u0097the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, among other things\u0097establishes a new entity, the First Responder Network Authority, with responsibility for ensuring the establishment of a nationwide, interoperable public safety broadband network.", "The price of handheld LMR devices is high\u0097often thousands of dollars\u0097in part because market competition is limited and manufacturing costs are high. Further, GAO found that public safety agencies cannot exert buying power in relationship to device manufacturers, which may result in the agencies overpaying for LMR devices. In particular, because public safety agencies contract for LMR devices independently from one another, they are not in a strong position to negotiate lower prices and forego the quantity discounts that accompany larger orders. For similar situations, GAO has recommended joint procurement as a cost saving measure because it allows agencies requiring similar products to combine their purchase power and lower their procurement costs. Given that DHS has experience in emergency communications and relationships with public safety agencies, it is well-suited to facilitate joint procurement of handheld LMR devices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) should work with partners to identify and communicate opportunities for joint procurement of public safety LMR devices.

Currently, the public safety community  uses radio frequency spectrum to transmit and receive critical voice  communications through land mobile radio (LMR) systems that are  operated by and licensed to state and local jurisdictions. However, such  LMR systems can have issues with compatibility, continuity, and capacity  in times of large scale emergencies or disasters. In particular, LMR  systems often lack \u201cinteroperability\u201d\u2014that is, they lack the capabilities that  allow first responders to communicate with their counterparts in other  agencies and jurisdictions as authorized. Notably, during the terrorist  attacks of September 11, 2001, and Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the lack of  interoperable public safety communications hampered rescue efforts and  the overall effectiveness of public safety operations. Indeed, public safety  communication systems are fragmented across thousands of federal,  state, and local jurisdictions. This fragmentation hampers operations and  puts emergency responders and the public at risk when the responders  cannot talk to one another. More than 7 years after the bipartisan 9/11  Commission reported that compatible and adequate communications  among public safety organizations at the local, state, and federal levels  need to be addressed, the United States still lacks interoperable public  safety communications despite substantial investment by emergency  response agencies to improve their LMR systems.contributing to continued interoperability issues between jurisdictions is   One factor  the slow progress in developing standards for the communication devices  that operate on these LMR systems.", "LMR systems currently have the capacity to handle only minimal data  transmissions. To supplement the current LMR systems, plans for a  second communication system that would provide nationwide broadband  services are underway. Such a network would operate on a different  portion of the radio frequency spectrum from the LMR systems. In 2007,  the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) assigned a portion of  spectrum in the upper 700 megahertz (MHz) band exclusively to public  safety for broadband use. Some stakeholders advocated for an  additional block of spectrum\u2014known as the \u201cD Block\u201d\u2014to be dedicated to  public safety. In March 2008, FCC attempted to auction the D Block with  public safety encumbrances but failed to attract a winning commercial  bidder. Pending legislation, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job  Creation Act of 2012, includes a provision reallocating the D Block to  public safety. Public safety officials believe a public safety broadband  network would support important data transmission during emergencies,  provide first responders with information not currently available (such as  vital signs of critically injured people), and foster greater interoperability.  However, FCC has estimated that a stand-alone broadband network  would cost approximately $15 billion to construct. Furthermore, due to its  technical limitations, the broadband network would not replace the LMR  systems for the foreseeable future. A number of jurisdictions sought  permission from FCC to begin constructing local or regional public safety  broadband networks, and since May 2010, FCC has granted permission  to 22 jurisdictions.", "Given the important issues surrounding the development of a public  safety broadband network, you asked us to provide information about  current and planned public safety communication networks and the  progress being made to support both voice and data needs. We  examined (1) the resources that have been provided for current public  safety communication systems and their capabilities and limitations, (2)  how a nationwide public safety broadband network is being planned and  its anticipated capabilities and limitations, (3) the challenges to building a  nationwide public safety broadband network, and (4) the factors that  influence competition and cost in the development of public safety  communication devices and the options that exist to reduce prices.", "To address these objectives, we met with officials and reviewed  documentation from 6 of the 22 jurisdictions that received permission  from FCC to begin deploying a 700 MHz public safety broadband  network, including the San Francisco Bay area, California; Adams  County, Colorado; Iowa; Boston, Massachusetts; Mississippi; and Texas.  We selected locations based on several criteria, including whether they  received federal funding and the size of the planned broadband network.  In all of the locations, we interviewed government agencies involved with  planning a broadband network, and in locations where planning had  progressed, we also interviewed emergency responders who were part of  the planning process and vendors selected to build the network, among  others. We also interviewed federal agencies involved in public safety  communications issues, including entities within the Department of  Commerce (Commerce)\u2014the National Institute of Standards and  Technology (NIST), the National Telecommunications and Information  Administration (NTIA), and the Public Safety Communications Research  (PSCR) program; the Departments of Homeland Security (DHS) and  Justice; and FCC. In addition, we reviewed relevant documents from  these federal entities, including several FCC rulemakings related to  developing a broadband network and public safety device competition.  We reviewed relevant legislation and conducted a literature review of 43  articles from governmental and academic sources related to emergency  communication networks and devices. We interviewed representatives of  public safety associations, researchers and consultants recognized for  their expertise in public safety communications, and manufacturers of  public safety devices, as well as private sector analysts who track this  industry.

A network is  required to connect base stations to the same communication system.", "Repeaters increase the effective communication range of handheld  portable radios, mobile radios, and base station radios by  retransmitting received radio signals.", "Figure 1 illustrates the basic components of an LMR system.", "LMR systems are generally able to meet the unique requirements of  public safety agencies. For example, unlike commercial cellular networks,  which can allow seconds to go by before a call is set up and answered,  LMR systems are developed to provide rapid voice call-setup and group- calling capabilities. When time is of the essence, as is often the case  when public safety agencies need to communicate, it is important to have  access to systems that achieve fast call-set up times. Furthermore, LMR  systems provide public safety agencies \u201cmission critical\u201d voice  capabilities\u2014that is, voice capabilities that meet a high standard for  reliability, redundancy, capacity, and flexibility. Table 1 describes the key  elements for mission critical voice capabilities, as determined by the  National Public Safety Telecommunications Council (NPSTC).", "According to NPSTC, for a network to fully support public safety mission  critical voice communications, each of the elements in table 1 must  address part of the overall voice communications services supported by  the network. In other words, NPSTC believes a network cannot be a  mission critical network without all of these elements. Furthermore, unlike  commercial networks, mission critical communication systems rely on  \u201chardened\u201d infrastructure, meaning that tower sites and equipment have  been designed to provide reliable communications even in the midst of  natural or man-made disasters. To remain operable during disasters,  mission critical communications infrastructure requires redundancy, back- up power, and fortification against environmental stressors such as  extremes of temperature and wind.", "Nationwide, there are approximately 55,000 public safety agencies.  These state and local agencies typically receive a license from FCC to  operate and maintain their LMR voice systems. Since these systems are  supported by state and local revenues, the agencies generally purchase  equipment and devices using their own local budgets without always  coordinating their actions with nearby agencies, which can hinder  interoperability. Since 1989, public safety associations have collaborated  with federal agencies to establish common technical standards for LMR  systems and devices called Project 25 (P25). The purpose of these  technical standards is to support interoperability between different LMR  systems, that is, to enable seamless communication across public safety  agencies and jurisdictions. While the P25 suite of standards is intended to  promote interoperability by making public safety systems and devices  compatible regardless of the manufacturer, it is a voluntary standard and  currently incomplete. As a result, many LMR devices manufactured for  public safety are not compatible with devices made by rival  manufacturers, which can undermine interoperability.", "The federal government plays an important role in public safety  communications by providing funding for emergency communication  systems and working to increase interoperable communication systems.  Congress, in particular, has played a critical role by designating radio  frequency spectrum for public safety use. Furthermore, Congress can  direct action by federal agencies and others in support of public safety.  For example, through the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Congress  established DHS and required the department, among other things, to  develop a comprehensive national incident management system  comprising all levels of government and to consolidate existing federal  government emergency response plans into a single, coordinated  national response plan.", "The number of licenses excludes the 700 MHz public safety broadband license, the 4.9  GHz band, and public safety point-to-point microwave licenses. for public safety broadband use.its Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau (PSHSB), which is  responsible for developing, recommending, and administering FCC\u2019s  policies pertaining to public safety communications issues.

However, when FCC presented the D Block for auction in 2008 under  these conditions, it received no qualifying bids and thus was not  licensed. Subsequently it was found that the lack of commercial  interest in the D Block was due in part to uncertainty about how the  public/private partnership would work. Although many stakeholders  and industry participants called for the D Block to be reallocated to  public safety, an alternate view is that auctioning the D Block for  commercial use would have generated revenues for the U.S.  Treasury. As noted previously, a provision in pending legislation, the  Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, reallocates the  D Block to public safety.", "In 2007, FCC licensed the 10 MHz of spectrum that FCC assigned for  public safety broadband use to the Public Safety Spectrum Trust  (PSST), a nonprofit organization representing major national public  safety associations. This 10 MHz of spectrum, located in the upper  700 MHz band is adjacent to the spectrum allocated to public safety  for LMR communications. As the licensee, the PSST\u2019s original  responsibilities included representing emergency responders\u2019 needs  for a broadband network and negotiating a network sharing  agreement with the winner of the D Block auction. However, since the  D Block was not successfully auctioned, FCC stayed the majority of  the rules guiding the PSST.", "In 2009, public safety entities began requesting waivers from FCC\u2019s  rules to allow early deployment of broadband networks in the 10 MHz  of spectrum licensed to the PSST, and since 2010, FCC granted  waivers to 22 jurisdictions for early deployment.

Mississippi, another  jurisdiction we visited that is constructing a statewide broadband network,  has spent about $214 million on its LMR network, including $57 million in  general revenue bonds and $157 million in federal grants. Officials in  the jurisdictions we contacted stressed the importance of investing in the  infrastructure of their LMR networks to maintain the reliability and  operability of their voice systems, since it was unclear at what point the  broadband networks would support mission critical voice  communications.

Since different  frequencies of radio waves have different propagation characteristics,  jurisdictions typically use the spectrum that is best suited to their  particular location. For example, very high frequency (VHF) channels\u2014 those located between 30 and 300 MHz\u2014are more useful for  communications that must occur over long distances without obstruction  from buildings, since the signals cannot penetrate building walls very well.  As such, VHF signals are well suited to rural areas. On the other hand,  ultra high frequency (UHF) channels\u2014those located between 300 MHz  and 3 GHz\u2014are more appropriate for denser urban areas as they have  more capacity and can penetrate buildings more easily. When we visited  Adams County, Colorado, we learned that public safety officials in the  mountainous areas of Colorado use the 150 MHz and 450 MHz bands  because of the range of the signals and their ability to navigate around  the natural geography. However, public safety officials in the Denver,  Colorado, metropolitan area operate on the 700 and 800 MHz frequency  bands which can support more simultaneous voice transmissions, such  as communications between fire, police, public utility, and transportation  officials."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Public Safety Communications Capabilities", "paragraphs": ["The current public safety LMR systems use their allocated spectrum to  facilitate reliable mission critical voice communications.

The firefighters are able to communicate on  an LMR system because their handheld devices operate on as well as off  network. Currently, emergency response personnel rely exclusively on  their LMR systems to provide mission critical voice capabilities. One  waiver jurisdiction we visited, Mississippi, is constructing a new statewide  LMR system and officials there noted a high degree of satisfaction with  the planned LMR system.

According to DHS, it has worked with states to help them evaluate and  improve their emergency communications abilities. DHS also helped to  develop the Interoperability Continuum, which identifies five critical  success elements to assist emergency response agencies and policy  makers to plan and implement interoperability solutions for data and voice  communications. Furthermore, DHS created guidance to ensure a  consistent funding strategy for federal grant programs that allow  recipients to purchase communications equipment and enhance their  emergency response capabilities. As we have reported in the past,  interoperability has also improved due to a variety of local technical  solutions. For example, FCC established mutual aid channels, whereby  specific channels are set aside for the sole purpose of connecting  incompatible systems. Another local solution is when agencies maintain a  cache of extra radios that they can distribute during an emergency to  other first responders whose radios are not interoperable with their own.", "However, despite decades of effort, a significant limitation of current LMR  systems is that they are not fully interoperable. One reason for the lack of  interoperability is the fragmentation of spectrum assignments for public  safety, since existing radios are typically unable to transmit and receive in  all these frequencies. Therefore, a rural area using public safety radios  operating on VHF spectrum will not be interoperable with radios used in  an urban area that operate on UHF spectrum. While radios can be built to  operate on multiple frequencies, which could support greater  interoperability, this capability can add significant cost to the radios and  thus jurisdictions may be reluctant to make such investments. In addition,  public safety agencies historically have acquired communication systems  without concern for interoperability, often resulting in multiple, technically  incompatible radio systems. This is compounded by the lack of  mandatory standards for the current LMR systems or devices. Rather, the  P25 technical standards remain incomplete and voluntary, creating  incompatibility among vendors\u2019 products.

As shown in figure 3, moving from lower bandwidth voice  communications to a higher bandwidth broadband network unleashes the  potential for the development of a range of public safety data applications.", "Besides new applications, a public safety broadband network has the  potential to provide nationwide access and interoperability. Nationwide  access means emergency responders and other public safety officials  could access their home networks from anywhere in the country, which  could facilitate a better coordinated emergency response. Interoperability  on a broadband network could allow emergency responders to share  information irrespective of jurisdiction or type of public safety agency. For  example, officials from two waiver jurisdictions indicated that forest fires  are a type of emergency that brings together multiple jurisdictions, and in  these situations a broadband network could facilitate sharing of response  plans. However, an expert we contacted stressed that broadband  applications should be tailored to the bandwidth needs of the response  task. For example, responders should not use high-definition video when  grainy footage would suffice to enable them to pursue a criminal suspect."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limitations of Broadband Results in Continued Reliance on LMR Voice Systems", "paragraphs": ["A major limitation of a public safety broadband network is that it would not  provide mission critical voice communications for many years. LTE, the  standard FCC identified for the public safety broadband network, is a  wireless broadband standard that is not currently designed to support  mission critical voice communications. Commercial wireless providers are  currently developing voice over LTE capabilities, but this will not meet  public safety\u2019s mission critical voice requirements because key elements  needed for mission critical voice, such as push-to-talk, are not part of the  LTE standard. While one manufacturer believes mission critical voice  over LTE will be available as soon as 5 years, some waiver jurisdictions,  experts, government officials, and others told us it will likely be 10 years  or more due to the challenges described in table 3.", "Absent mission critical voice capabilities on a broadband network,  emergency responders will continue to rely on their current LMR voice  systems, meaning a broadband network would supplement, rather than  replace, LMR systems for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, until  mission critical voice communications exist, issues that exacerbated  emergency response efforts to the terrorist attacks on September 11,  2001\u2014in particular, that emergency responders were not able to  communicate between agencies\u2014will not be resolved by a public safety  broadband network. As a result, public safety agencies will continue to  use devices operating on the current LMR systems for mission critical  voice communications, and require spectrum to be allocated for that  purpose. Additionally, public safety agencies may be reluctant to give up  their LMR devices, especially if they were costly and are still functional.  As jurisdictions continue to spend millions of dollars on their LMR  networks and devices, they will likely continue to rely on such  communication systems until they are no longer functional.", "In addition to not having mission critical communications, emergency  responders may only have limited access to the public safety broadband  network from the interior of large buildings. While the 700 MHz spectrum  provides better penetration of buildings than other bands of the spectrum,  if emergency responders expect to have access to the network from  inside large buildings and underground, additional infrastructure will need  to be constructed. For example, antennas or small indoor cellular stations  could be installed inside buildings and in underground structures to  support access to the network. FCC is seeking comment on this issue as  part of its most recent proceeding. Without this added infrastructure,  emergency responders using the broadband network may not have  access to building blue prints or fire response plans during building  emergencies, such as a fire. In fact, one jurisdiction constructing a  broadband network that we visited told us their network would not support  in-building access in one city of the jurisdiction because the plan did not  include antennas for inside the buildings.", "A final limitation to a public safety broadband network could be its  capacity during emergencies. Emergencies tend to happen in localized  areas that may be served by a single cell tower or even a single cellular  antenna on a tower. With emergency responders gathering to fight a fire  or other emergency, the number of responders and the types of  applications in use may exceed the capacity of the network. If the network  reaches capacity it could overload and might not send life saving  information. Therefore, the network would have to be managed during  emergencies to ensure that the most important data are being sent, which  could be accomplished by prioritizing data. Furthermore, capacity could  be supplemented through deployable cell sites to emergency locations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Various Challenges Could Jeopardize the Implementation and Functionality of a Public Safety Broadband Network", "paragraphs": ["Although the federal agencies have taken important steps to advance the  broadband network, challenges exist that may slow its implementation.  Specifically, stakeholders we spoke with prioritized five challenges to  successfully building, operating, and maintaining a public safety  broadband network. These challenges include (1) ensuring  interoperability, (2) creating a governance structure, (3) building a reliable  network, (4) designing a secure network, and (5) determining funding  sources. FCC, in its Fourth Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,  sought comment on some of these challenges, and as explained further,  the challenge of creating a governance structure has been addressed by  recent law. However, the other challenges currently remain unresolved  and, if left unaddressed, could undermine the development of a public  safety broadband network.", "Ensuring interoperability. To avoid a major shortcoming of the LMR  communication systems, it is essential that a public safety broadband  network be interoperable across jurisdictions and devices. DHS, in  conjunction with its SAFECOM program, developed the Interoperability  Continuum which identifies five key elements to interoperable networks\u2014 governance, standard operating procedures, technology, training, and  usage\u2014that waiver jurisdictions and other stakeholders discussed as  important to building an interoperable public safety broadband network,  as shown in figure 4. For example, technology is critical to interoperability  of the broadband network and most stakeholders, including public safety  associations, experts, and manufacturers believe that identifying LTE as  the technical standard was a good step towards interoperability. To  further promote interoperability, stakeholders indicated that additional  technical functionality, such as data sharing and roaming capabilities,  should be part of the technical design. If properly designed to the  technical standard, broadband devices will support interoperability  regardless of the manufacturer. Testing devices to ensure they meet the  identified standard could help eliminate devices with proprietary  applications that might otherwise limit interoperability. In its Fourth Further  Notice, FCC solicited input on the technical design of the network and  testing of devices to ensure interoperability.", "Creating a governance structure. As stated previously, governance is a  key element for interoperable networks. A governance authority can  promote interoperability by bringing together federal, state, local, and  emergency response representatives. Each of the waiver jurisdictions we  contacted had identified a governance authority to oversee its broadband  network. Jurisdictions we visited, as well as federal agencies, told us that  any nationwide network should also have a nationwide governance entity  to oversee it. Although several federal entities are involved with the  planning of a public safety broadband network, at the time we conducted  our work no entity had overall authority to make critical decisions for its  development, construction, and operation. According to stakeholders,  decisions on developing a common language for the network,  establishing user rights for federal agencies, and determining network  upgrades, could be managed by such an entity. Pending legislation, the  Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, establishes a First  Responder Network Authority as an independent authority within NTIA  and gave it responsibility for ensuring the establishment of a nationwide,  interoperable public safety broadband network. Among other things, the  First Responder Network Authority is required to (1) ensure nationwide  standards for use and access of the network; (2) issue open, transparent,  and competitive requests for proposals to private sector entities to build,  operate, and maintain the network; (3) encourage that such requests  leverage existing commercial wireless infrastructure to speed deployment  of the network; and (4) manage and oversee the implementation and  execution of contracts and agreements with nonfederal entities to build,  operate, and maintain the network.", "Building a reliable network. A public safety broadband network must be  as reliable as the current LMR systems but it will require additional  infrastructure to do so. As mentioned previously, emergency responders  consider the current LMR systems very reliable, in part because they can  continue to work in emergency situations. Any new broadband network  would need to meet similar standards but, as shown in figure 5, such a  network might require up to 10 times the number of towers as the current  system. This is because a public safety broadband network is being  designed as a cellular network, which would use a series of low powered  towers to transmit signals and reduce interference. Also, to meet robust  public safety standards, each tower must be \u201chardened\u201d to ensure that it  can withstand disasters, such as hurricanes and earthquakes. According  to waiver jurisdictions and other stakeholders, this additional  infrastructure and hardening of facilities may be financially prohibitive for  many jurisdictions, especially those in rural areas that currently use  devices operating on VHF spectrum\u2014spectrum that is especially well  suited to rural areas because the signals can travel long distances.", "Designing a secure network. Secure communications are important.  Designing a protected and trusted broadband network will encourage  increased usage and reliance on it. Security for a public safety network  will require authentication and access control. By defining LTE as the  technical standard for the broadband network, a significant portion of the  security architecture is predetermined because the standard governs a  certain level of security. Given the importance of this issue, FCC required  waiver jurisdictions to include some security features in their networks  and FCC\u2019s most recent proceeding seeks input on security issues.  Furthermore, FCC\u2019s Public Safety Advisory Committee has issued a  report making several security-related recommendations. For example, it  recommended that standardized security features be in place to support  roaming to commercial technologies. However, one expert we contacted  expressed concern that the waiver jurisdictions were not establishing  sufficient network security because they had not received guidance. He  believes this would result in waiver jurisdictions using security standards  applied to previous networks.", "Determining funding sources. It is estimated that a nationwide public  safety broadband network could cost up to $15 billion or more to  construct, which does not take into account recurring operation and  maintenance costs. As noted previously, of the 22 waiver jurisdictions, 8  have received federal grants to support deployment of a broadband  network. Some of the other waiver jurisdictions have obtained limited  funding from nonfederal sources, such as through issuing bonds. Several  of the jurisdictions we spoke with stressed that in addition to the upfront  construction costs, the ongoing costs associated with operating,  maintaining, and upgrading a public safety broadband network would  need to be properly funded. As previously indicated, the ECPC and  SAFECOM have updated grant guidance to reflect changing technologies  but this does not add additional funding for emergency communications.  Rather, it defines broadband as an allowable purpose for emergency  communications funding grants that may currently support the existing  LMR systems. Since the LMR systems will not be replaced by a public  safety broadband network, funding will be necessary to operate, maintain,  and upgrade two separate communication systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Competition and High Manufacturing Costs Increase the Price of Handheld LMR Devices, but Options Exist to Reduce Prices", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Competition for Handheld LMR Devices is Limited", "paragraphs": ["Handheld LMR devices often cost thousands of dollars, and many  stakeholders, including national public safety associations, state and local  public safety officials, and representatives from the telecommunications  industry, attribute these high prices to limited competition. Industry  analysts and stakeholders estimate that the approximately $4 billion U.S.  market for handheld LMR devices consists of one manufacturer with  about 75 to 80 percent market share, one or two strong competitors, and  several device manufacturers with smaller shares of the market.  According to industry stakeholders, competition is weak because of  limited entry by device manufacturers; this may be due to (1) the market\u2019s  relatively small size and (2) barriers to entry that confront nonincumbent  device manufacturers.", "Small size of the public safety market. The market for handheld LMR  devices in the United States includes only about 2 to 3 million customers,  or roughly 1 percent of the approximately 300 million customers of  commercial telecommunication devices. According to an industry  estimate in 2009, approximately 300,000 handheld LMR devices that are  P25 compliant are sold each year. Annual sales of handheld LMR devices  are small in part because of low turnover. For example, device  manufacturers told us that public safety devices are typically replaced  every 10 to 15 years, suggesting that less than 10 percent of handheld  LMR devices are replaced annually. In contrast, industry and public safety  sources indicate that commercial customers replace devices roughly  every 2 to 3 years, suggesting that about 33 to 50 percent are replaced  annually. Together, low device turnover and a small customer base  reduce the potential volume of sales by device manufacturers, which may  make the market unattractive to potential entrants.", "The size of the market is reduced further by the need for manufacturers to  customize handheld LMR devices for individual public safety agencies.  Differences in spectrum allocations across jurisdictions have the effect of  decreasing the customer base for any single device. As previously  discussed, public safety agencies operate on different frequencies  scattered across the radio spectrum. For example, one jurisdiction may  need devices that operate on 700 MHz frequencies, whereas another  jurisdiction may need devices that operate on both 800 MHz and 450  MHz frequencies. Existing handheld LMR devices typically do not  transmit and receive signals in all public safety frequencies. As a result,  device manufacturers cannot sell a single product to customers  nationwide, and must tailor devices to the combinations of frequencies in  use by the purchasing agency.", "Barriers to entry by nonincumbent manufacturers. Device  manufacturers wishing to enter the handheld LMR device market face  barriers in doing so, which further limits competition. The use of  proprietary technologies represents one barrier to entry. The inclusion of  proprietary technologies often makes LMR devices noninteroperable with  one another. This lack of interoperability makes it costly for customers to  switch the brand of their devices, since doing so requires them to replace  or modify older devices. These switching costs may continually compel  customers to buy devices from the incumbent device manufacturer,  preventing less established manufacturers from making inroads into the  market. For example, in a comment filed with FCC, one of the  jurisdictions we visited said that device manufacturers offer a proprietary  encryption feature for free or at only a nominal cost. When a public  safety agency buys devices that incorporate this proprietary encryption  feature, the agency cannot switch its procurement to a different  manufacturer without undertaking costly modifications to its existing fleet  of devices. Switching costs are particularly high when a device  manufacturer has installed a communication system that is incompatible  with competitors\u2019 devices. In this scenario, a public safety agency cannot  switch to a competitor\u2019s handheld device without incurring the cost of new  equipment or a patching mechanism to resolve the incompatibility. Even  where devices from different manufacturers are compatible, a fear of  incompatibility may deter agencies from switching to a nonincumbent  brand. According to industry stakeholders\u2014and as we have confirmed in  the past\u2014devices marketed as P25 compliant often are not interoperable   This lack of confidence in the P25 standard may encourage  in practice.agencies to continue buying handheld LMR devices from their current  brand, placing less established device manufacturers at a disadvantage  and thus discouraging competition.", "At the same time that less established manufacturers are at a  disadvantage, the market leader enjoys distinct \u201cincumbency  advantages.\u201d These advantages refer to the edge that a manufacturer  derives from its position as incumbent, over and above whatever edge it  derives from the strength of its product:", "According to an industry analyst, some public safety agencies are  reluctant to switch brands of handheld LMR devices because their  emergency responders are accustomed to the placement of the  buttons on their existing devices.", "According to another industry analyst, the extensive network of  customer representatives that the market leader has established over  time presents an advantage. According to this analyst, less  established device manufacturers face difficulty winning contracts  because their networks of representatives are comparatively thin.", "The well-recognized brand of the market leader also represents an  advantage. According to one stakeholder, some agencies mistakenly  believe that only the market leader is able to manufacturer devices  compliant with P25, and thus conduct sole-source procurements with  this manufacturer. Even where procurements are competitive, the  market leader is likely to enjoy an upper hand over its competitors;  according to an industry analyst, local procurement officers prefer to  buy handheld LMR devices from the dominant device manufacturer  because doing so is an uncontroversial choice in the eyes of their  management."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "High Manufacturing Costs and Lack of Buying Power Increase Device Prices", "paragraphs": ["Competition aside, handheld LMR devices are costly to manufacture, so  their prices will likely exceed prices for commercial devices regardless of  how much competition exists in the market. First, this is in large part  because these devices need to be reinforced for high-pressure  environments. Handheld LMR devices must be able to withstand  extremes of temperature as well physical stressors such as dust, smoke,  impact, and immersion in water. Second, they also have much more  robust performance requirements than commercial devices\u2013\u2013including  greater transmitter and battery power\u2013\u2013to enable communication at  greater ranges and during extended periods of operation. Third, the  devices are produced in quantities too small to realize the cost savings of  mass production. Manufacturers of commercial telecommunication  devices can keep prices lower simply because of the large quantities they  produce. For example, one industry stakeholder told us that economies of  scale begin for commercial devices when a million or more devices are  produced per manufacturing run. In contrast, LMR devices are commonly  produced in manufacturing runs of 25,000 units. Fourth, the exterior of  handheld LMR devices must be customized to the needs of emergency  responders. For example, the buttons on these devices must be large  enough to press while wearing bulky gloves.", "In addition, given that the P25 standard remains incomplete and  voluntary, device manufacturers develop products based on conflicting  interpretations of the standard, resulting in incompatibilities between their  products. Stakeholders from one jurisdiction we visited said that agencies  can request add-on features\u2013\u2013such as the ability to arrange channels  according to user preference or to scan for radio channels assigned for  particular purposes\u2014which fall outside the P25 standard. These features  increase the degree of customization required to produce handheld LMR  devices, pushing costs upward.", "Furthermore, public safety agencies may be unable to negotiate lower  prices for handheld LMR devices because they cannot exert buying  power in relationship with device manufacturers. We found that public  safety agencies are not in an advantageous position to negotiate lower  prices because they often request customized features and negotiate with  device manufacturers in isolation from one another. According to a public  safety official in one jurisdiction we contacted, each agency has unique  ordinances, purchasing mechanisms, and bidding processes for devices.  Because public safety agencies contract for handheld LMR devices in this  independent manner, they sacrifice the quantity discounts that come from  placing larger orders. Moreover, they are unlikely to know what other  agencies pay for similar devices, enabling device manufacturers to offer  different prices to different jurisdictions rather than set a single price for  the entire market. One public safety official told us that small jurisdictions  therefore pay more than larger jurisdictions for similar devices. As we  have reported in the past, agencies that require similar products can  combine their market power\u2014and therefore obtain lower prices\u2014by  engaging in joint procurement.procurement at the state, regional, or national level are likely to increase  the buying power of public safety agencies and help bring down prices.", "Therefore, wider efforts to coordinate  Although these factors drive up prices in the current market for handheld  LMR devices, industry observers said that many of these factors diminish  in the future market for handheld broadband devices. As described  earlier, FCC has mandated a commercial standard, LTE, for devices  operating on the new broadband networks. The use of this standard may  reduce the prevalence of proprietary features that inhibit interoperability.  In addition, the new broadband networks will operate on common 700  MHz spectrum across the nation, eliminating the need to customize  devices to the frequencies in use by individual jurisdictions. Together, the  adoption of a commercial standard and the use of common spectrum are  likely to increase the uniformity of handheld public safety devices, which  in turn is likely to strengthen competition and enable the cost savings that  come from bulk production. In addition, industry analysts and federal  officials told us that they expect a heightened level of competition in the  market for LTE devices because multiple device manufacturers are  expected to develop them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Options Exist to Reduce the Prices of Handheld LMR Devices", "paragraphs": ["Options exist to reduce prices in the market for handheld LMR devices by  increasing competition and the bargaining power of public safety  agencies. One option is to reduce barriers to entry into the market. As  described above, less established manufacturers may be discouraged  from entering the market for handheld LMR devices because of the lack  of interoperability between devices produced by different manufacturers.  Consistent implementation of the P25 standard would increase  interoperability between devices, enabling public safety agencies to mix  and match handheld LMR devices from different brands. As we have  reported in the past, independent testing is necessary to ensure  compliance with standards and interoperability among products.past several years, NIST and DHS have established a Compliance   In the  Assessment Program (CAP) for the P25 standard. CAP provides a  government-led forum in which to test devices for conformance with P25  specifications. If the CAP program succeeds in increasing  interoperability, it may reduce switching costs\u2014that is, the expense of  changing manufacturers\u2014and thus may open the door to greater  competition. Although CAP is a promising means to lower costs in this  way, it is too soon to assess its effectiveness.", "A second option is for public safety agencies to engage in joint  procurement to lower costs. Joint procurement of handheld LMR devices  could increase the bargaining power of agencies as well as facilitate cost  savings through quantity discounts.

In  addition, we reviewed FCC orders and notices of proposed rulemaking  relating to broadband for public safety, as well as comments on this topic  submitted to FCC.", "To determine the federal role in the public safety broadband network, we  interviewed multiple agencies involved in planning this network. Within  FCC, we interviewed officials from the Public Safety and Homeland  Security Bureau (PSHSB), the mission of which is to ensure public safety  and homeland security by advancing state-of-the-art communications that  are accessible, reliable, resilient, and secure, in coordination with public  and private partners. Within Commerce, we interviewed officials from  NTIA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), two  agencies that develop, test, and advise on broadband standards for  public safety. We also interviewed officials from the Public Safety  Communications Research (PSCR) program, a joint effort between NIST  and NTIA that works to research, develop, and test public safety  communication technologies. Within DHS, we interviewed officials from  the Office of Emergency Communications (OEC) and the Office of  Interoperability and Compatibility (OIC), two agencies that provide input  on the public safety broadband network through their participation on  interagency coordinating bodies.", "To determine the technological, historical, and other factors that affect  competition in the market for public safety devices, as well as what  options exist to reduce the cost of these devices, we reviewed the  responses to FCC\u2019s notice seeking comment on competition in public  safety communications technologies. In addition, we reviewed our prior  reports and correspondence on this topic between FCC and the House of  Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce that occurred in  June and July of 2010 and April and May of 2011. We also conducted an  economic literature review that included 13 academic articles examining  markets for communications technology and, in particular, how issues of  standards, compatibility, bundling, and price discrimination affect entry  and competition in these markets. These articles provided a historical and  theoretical context for communication technology markets, which helped  shape our findings. We asked about factors affecting the price of public  safety devices, as well as how to reduce these prices, during our  interviews with national public safety organizations, local and regional  public safety jurisdictions, and the federal agencies we contacted during  our audit work. We also interviewed two researchers specifically identified  for their knowledge of communication equipment markets based on their  congressional testimony or publication history. In addition, we interviewed  representatives from four companies that produce public safety devices  or network components, as well as two financial analysts who track the  industry.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2011 to February 2012  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Federal Grant Programs for Emergency Communications", "paragraphs": ["SAFECOM, a program administered by DHS, has identified federal grant  programs across nine agencies, including the Departments of Agriculture,  Commerce, Education, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security,  Interior, Justice, Transportation, and the U.S. Navy that allow grant funds  to fund public safety emergency communications efforts.
