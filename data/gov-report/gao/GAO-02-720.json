In 26 states, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has determined that a concealed carry permit may exempt permit holders from an NICS background check when they are buying a firearm. This situation underscores the need to carefully screen applications and monitor permit holders to ensure their eligibility to own firearms.

The National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS)\u2014used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and states to perform presale firearms background checks\u2014relies largely on searching state criminal history records to prevent the sale of firearms to prohibited persons. The states\u2019 firearms-related laws and procedures\u2014such as those mentioned above\u2014may affect how such records are used by NICS in preventing the sale of firearms to persons who are ineligible under applicable federal and state law.", "As agreed with your office, this report presents information on the following topics:   Restoration of gun ownership rights, including any differences among the states in how such rights may be restored to persons with criminal convictions and the extent to which persons who had their gun ownership rights restored subsequently committed new crimes.

For more detailed or specific analyses, as agreed with your office, we focused our work on six states\u2014California, Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, Texas, and Utah\u2014which we judgmentally selected to illustrate a variety of applicable state laws and procedures. In visiting these states, we discussed applicable laws and procedures with responsible state and local officials and reviewed relevant statistics and other firearms-related information.

These background checks generally are to be conducted using NICS, a computerized system which is managed by the FBI. Under NICS, firearms are not to be transferred until a background check determines that the transfer will not violate applicable federal and state laws.", "However, if the background check is not completed within 3 business days, the transfer is allowed to proceed by default.", "A NICS background check provides an automated search of criminal and noncriminal records\u2014including records in both state and national databases\u2014to determine a person\u2019s eligibility to purchase a firearm. Specifically, a NICS check queries the following three information sources: (1) the National Crime Information Center, which provides access to fugitive arrest warrants and protective orders and information about deported felons; (2) the Interstate Identification Index, an index-pointer system that provides access to state criminal history records and FBI criminal history databases; and (3) the NICS Index, which maintains records about other persons\u2019 ineligible to possess firearms, including mental defectives, illegal and unlawful aliens, and persons dishonorably discharged from the military. In practice, however, most NICS decisions about eligibility to purchase firearms are based on state criminal history records. During the first 3 years of NICS operations, over 90 percent of all firearms purchase denials were due to a disqualifying criminal history\u2014 primarily felony convictions (64 percent) and domestic violence misdemeanor convictions (14 percent). Because the vast majority\u2014about 95 percent\u2014of all criminal history records are state records, the capability of NICS to effectively screen firearms purchasers depends largely on the ability to access and interpret these state records.", "As part of interpreting state criminal history records, NICS background check examiners consider post-conviction actions that may affect gun ownership rights. For example, persons prohibited from possessing firearms due to state criminal convictions may subsequently apply to the states for relief from these disabilities, and state actions to provide such relief may be recognized under federal law as restoring gun ownership rights. This avenue of relief arises out of the meaning of the term \u201cconviction,\u201d which is found within the federal definitions of felony and domestic violence misdemeanor. Federal firearms law generally provides that a conviction will not be considered for purposes of determining firearms eligibility if the conviction \u201chas been expunged, or set aside or [is an offense] for which a person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored \u2026 unless such pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rights expressly provides that the person may not \u2026 possess, or receive firearms.\u201d Prior to October 1992, relief from firearms disabilities imposed by federal laws could be granted, based on a petition to the Treasury Department, under provisions enacted at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 925(c). However, beginning with the fiscal year 1993 Treasury appropriations act, Congress has prohibited Treasury from expending any appropriated funds to act upon such applications for relief.", "The Brady Act, in general, provides that any transaction in which a person presents to a licensed gun dealer a valid state permit that allows the purchaser to possess or acquire a firearm is exempt from a NICS check when purchasing firearms. Specifically, a firearms purchase is exempt from NICS if the purchaser presents a state permit that (1) allows the permit holder to possess or acquire a firearm and (2) was issued not more than 5 years earlier by the state in which the transfer is to take place. NICS regulations specify further that the purchaser must present a valid permit that was issued only after verifying that the permit holder was not ineligible to possess firearms under federal, state, and local law. In addition, after November 30, 1998, permits would qualify as exempt only if the information available to the state authority that issued the permit included NICS. In developing the NICS regulations, ATF concluded that a \u201cpermit to possess\u201d a firearm would include a permit to carry concealed weapons. Thus, if a concealed carry permit meets the criteria described above, the permit holder would be exempt from a NICS background check when purchasing firearms, unless state law otherwise required such a check.", "As noted previously, NICS denials are based largely on criminal history records\u2014not only felonies but certain misdemeanors as well. Most notably, in the so-called Lautenberg amendment, Congress banned the possession of firearms by individuals convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. As defined in the law, a domestic violence misdemeanor involves the use or attempted use of physical force or the threatened use of a deadly weapon by any of the following: a current or former spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim; a person with whom the victim shares a child in common; a person who is cohabiting with or has cohabited with the victim as a spouse, parent, or guardian; or a person similarly situated to a spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim. Implementing regulations provide that such definition includes any federal, state, or local misdemeanor that meets the criteria, irrespective of whether it is defined or labeled as \u201cdomestic violence.\u201d Federal law further provides that a person generally is not considered convicted of a domestic violence misdemeanor under the following circumstances: (1) if the person was not represented at trial by counsel (unless he or she waived the right to counsel); (2) if the person was entitled to a jury trial, but the case was not tried by jury (unless he or she waived the right to a jury trial); or (3) if the conviction was expunged or set-aside, or the person was pardoned or had civil rights restored; and the person is not otherwise prohibited from possessing firearms.", "Appendix II presents more information about the categories of persons ineligible to purchase firearms and the extent to which criminal history records are used to determine an individual\u2019s eligibility to purchase firearms.

For example:   Pardon \u2013 A pardon is, in general, an executive action that typically mitigates the punishment the law demands for an offense and restores any or all of the rights and privileges forfeited on account of the offense. Generally, the original criminal record is to be retained, with the pardon being noted on the record.", "Expungement \u2013 An expungement is a procedure in which the record of a criminal offense or conviction is typically destroyed or sealed. For example, arrest records may be expunged where the arrested person is acquitted at trial or the arrest is found to be unlawful; or expungement may be allowed after the passage of time. In some cases, expunged records may be retained and used by the state for certain limited purposes.", "Set-aside \u2013 A set-aside is an action that annuls or revokes a previously issued court judgment or order\u2014such as a criminal conviction. To set aside a judgment is to make it void or of no effect and to deprive it of all force and operation as to future transactions. Set-asides are generally noted in the criminal record, which is retained.", "Restoration of civil rights \u2013 States may have procedures to restore any civil rights or other privileges that were lost upon a criminal conviction.

Pardons were universally available in all six of the states we visited, while expungements were readily available in only one state\u2014Utah. The states\u2019 criteria for restoration typically required a certain waiting period before being eligible to apply for relief.

Texas and Utah fall into this category. In 8 states, only certain permits issued before the implementation of NICS exempt permit holders from NICS background checks. In these states, permits issued after NICS was implemented (Nov. 30, 1998) do not qualify as exempt.

This screening process included both name-based and fingerprint-based checks performed by the states and the FBI. In addition to federal and state sources of data, Texas and Michigan routinely reviewed local records as part of the screening process. Some of the states were limited in the amount of time allowed to complete the background check and issue or deny the concealed carry permit. In Florida, a concealed carry permit must be issued within 90 days unless the applicant is determined to be ineligible or has a potentially disqualifying arrest without disposition information.", "In addition to screening concealed carry permit applicants, the states monitored active permit holders to determine if and when any of them became ineligible to have a permit. For example, five of the six states (all except Massachusetts) had formal mechanisms in place for detecting whether permits holders had committed a disqualifying criminal offense. These methods included electronic matching of permit holders\u2019 names against state criminal records databases (Utah and Florida), as well as manual notifications to the state\u2019s permit authority by the courts when a concealed carry permit holder is convicted of a crime (Michigan). Once a permit holder is determined to be ineligible, all of the states have procedures in place for revoking the permit.

In the states where data on offense type were available (Michigan, Texas, and Utah), the vast majority of offenses that led to revocation were misdemeanors. Some states (Florida, Texas, and Utah) also reported a significant number of revocations due other disqualifying factors\u2014such as mental disability (in Florida and Utah) and delinquent taxes (in Texas). Only Florida and Utah tracked the number of revocations that involved firearms\u2014specifically, firearms-related offenses accounted for about 9 percent (145 out of 1,593) of Florida\u2019s revocations and about 7 percent (39 out of 584) of Utah\u2019s revocations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Revoked Permits Could Be Used by Ineligible Persons to Purchase Firearms", "paragraphs": ["More significant than the number of revocations, some states had no assurance of recovering permits from permit holders after revocation. As a result, revoked permits could be used by ineligible persons to purchase firearms without a NICS background check. As mentioned previously, among the six states, only California and Massachusetts actively seek out permit holders to recover revoked permits that have not been voluntarily surrendered. In addition, only Massachusetts has criminal penalties available for use against permit holders who do not surrender revoked permit. Regarding the other states, we noted the following issues regarding revoked permits: In Florida\u2014a state where grandfathered permits exempt permit holders from NICS background checks when purchasing firearms\u2014 state officials acknowledged they did not recover all revoked permits and the state had no civil or criminal authority to force the surrender of revoked permits. Between October 1987 and December 2001, Florida revoked 1,593 permits, the vast majority because of crimes committed by permit holders after the permits were issued.  Another 461 permits were revoked because of crimes committed before the permits were issued. Because permits issued prior to the implementation of NICS exempted permit holders from NICS background checks, permits that were revoked and not recovered could have been used by ineligible permit holders to purchase firearms without a NICS check. To illustrate the extent to which revoked permits are not recovered by the state, Florida officials provided data on permits revoked in fiscal year 2001 as a result of crimes committed before the permits were issued. Of the 18 permits that were revoked for that reason, state officials told us that 7 of the 18 permits were not recovered.", "In Texas\u2014a state where all concealed carry permit holders are exempt from a NICS check when purchasing firearms\u2014state officials also acknowledged they do not recover all revoked permits and have no civil or criminal authority to force the surrender of revoked permits. State officials estimated that about 2 out of every 10 revoked permits are not voluntarily surrendered back to the state. Thus, based on the total number of revocations reported (1,659) between January 1996 and October 2001, this represents an estimated 332 revoked permits that were not recovered upon revocation. These ineligible permit holders could have used their revoked permits to purchase firearms without having a NICS background check.", "Two other states\u2014California and Utah\u2014have laws or procedures in place that prevent persons from using revoked permits to purchase firearms without a NICS background check. In California, for example, state law requires concealed carry permit holders to have a separate NICS background check when purchasing a firearm, thus preventing ineligible permit holders from purchasing firearms regardless of the status of their permit. Utah\u2014another NICS-exempt state for permit holders\u2014requires gun dealers to verify the validity of a concealed carry permit by contacting the state issuing authority before approving a NICS-exempt gun purchase. Rather than requiring another background check at the time of purchase, this verification simply requires gun dealers to visually inspect the permit, and then call the state\u2019s Department of Public Safety to verify that the permit is still valid\u2014that is, that it has not been suspended or revoked. According to Utah officials, this process helps the state monitor the legal status of permit holders, and it prevents persons from using revoked permits to purchase firearms without a NICS background check.", "According to ATF officials, after the Brady Act was passed in 1993, the states became responsible for conducting firearms purchase background checks. Because some states already required permits and background checks in order to purchase firearms, it seemed redundant to require another identical state background check just to comply with Brady. As a result, the law exempted permit holders from having a separate background check when purchasing firearms. When NICS became operational in 1998, the FBI and the states began sharing responsibility for firearms background checks, but the permit exemption continued based on criteria laid out in the Brady Act and NICS regulations for exempting permit holders from NICS background checks. Even so, ATF officials noted that some states require their concealed carry permit holders to undergo a separate background check at the time they make a firearms purchase. The officials went on to say that permit holders may sometimes commit crimes that disqualify them from possessing firearms, although the state has not yet taken action to revoke the permits. In such instances, a NICS background check at the time of purchase serves to identify permit holders who may be disqualified from purchasing a firearm and prevent those persons from obtaining firearms simply by presenting their permits.", "Regarding Utah\u2019s permit-verification process that requires gun dealers to verify the current validity of concealed carry permits, ATF officials told us it is not clear whether ATF could require all states to have a similar process. Generally, ATF can set regulations for states to meet as prerequisites to exempting their permit holders from NICS background checks, provided these regulations are consistent with congressional intent. Among other things, ATF regulations already specify that exempt permits must be valid, issued no more than 5 years earlier, and must be issued only after verifying that the permit holder was not ineligible to possess firearms under federal, state, and local law. Regarding an additional regulation requiring point-of-purchase verification of the validity of exempt permits, ATF officials noted that this could raise concerns as an unfunded mandate, particularly in those states that do not participate in NICS and have no existing infrastructure at state agencies or licensed gun dealers for performing such verification. Nonetheless, ATF would consider such a regulation if there was compelling evidence to suggest that a problem did exist (e.g., data indicating that ineligible persons used revoked permits to purchase firearms without a NICS check), and that any new regulation was consistent with congressional intent under the Brady Act."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Domestic Violence Misdemeanor Convictions", "paragraphs": ["The six states we visited used various approaches to help ensure that domestic violence misdemeanor convictions were identified in state criminal history repositories and were accessible to NICS.

For example, two of the states we visited\u2014California and Michigan\u2014had enacted specific criminal offenses related to domestic violence, which clearly differentiates these offenses from other misdemeanor assaults. Four states\u2014California, Michigan, Texas, and Utah\u2014had amended general criminal statutes (such as assault or battery) to create a separate penalty enhancement when the circumstances involved a family member or other relation.

When this occurs, the sale is allowed to proceed\u2014that is, the gun dealer may legally transfer the firearm without a response from the FBI as to the purchaser\u2019s eligibility. The FBI continues to research these transactions, even after 3 days have passed, to ensure that the purchasers were not prohibited individuals. Regarding the referrals noted above, after the firearms were legally transferred the FBI discovered that the purchasers should have been denied. Once the FBI made these determinations, ATF was notified so steps could be taken to investigate the transactions, retrieve the firearms, and refer any appropriate cases for prosecution.", "As shown in table 3, about 26 percent of the firearm-retrieval actions referred to ATF during roughly the first 3 years of NICS were in the prohibited category of domestic violence misdemeanor. By comparison, in looking at all FBI NICS denials during approximately this same period,the category of domestic violence misdemeanor made up only about 14 percent of the total number of NICS denials. As shown by this comparison, the percentage of NICS firearm-retrieval actions involving domestic violence misdemeanors was disproportionately large\u2014almost double\u2014 when compared with the percentage of all NICS denials that involved domestic violence misdemeanors. These transactions create concerns because they represent domestic violence offenders who were allowed to purchase firearms and who may pose risks to public safety.", "It should be noted that the actual number of domestic violence offenders who purchased firearms under NICS may be larger than shown in table 3. We previously reported that roughly 1.7 percent of NICS background checks could not be completed within 21 days because the FBI was not able to obtain sufficient information to verify the purchaser\u2019s eligibility.Based on the number of NICS background checks processed by the FBI through fiscal year 2001, an estimated 204,000 transactions would have fallen into this unresolved category. Even if only 1.6 percent (the average NICS denial rate for this time period) of these transactions involved prohibited persons, this would represent an estimated 3,200 additional prohibited persons who purchased firearms without being identified by NICS\u2014over 800 of which would have been domestic violence offenders (based on the percentage of domestic violence misdemeanor firearm- retrieval actions shown in table 3). Furthermore, this number could be much higher, because the FBI has previously reported that delayed transactions are much more likely to involve prohibited persons than the average NICS checks.", "According to FBI officials, researching domestic violence offenses can often take more than the 3 days allowed under the Brady Act. In a typical transaction, the NICS background check identifies an arrest for a misdemeanor assault but no matching disposition. The NICS examiner must then go back\u2014in some cases to original police reports\u2014to verify what happened and who was involved, in order to determine whether the offense meets the federal criteria for domestic violence misdemeanor. Furthermore, the information needed to confirm the conviction may not be in the automated record, and manual research is then required. If the offense was tried in a so-called court of non-record (e.g., a magistrate or justice of the peace court), the case may not have been reported to the state repository. Thus, the FBI may have to contact the local court or the original arresting agency to document the outcome."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Barriers to the Timely Identification of Domestic Violence Convictions", "paragraphs": ["Various other factors contribute to the difficulty in identifying domestic violence convictions within 3 business days and, thus, preventing the associated firearm-retrieval actions.

However, this process has been ongoing since the early 1990s and is still far from complete. For example, BJS recently reported on the status of efforts to improve criminal history records for background check purposes. According to the report:   By mid-2001, a total of about 64 million records were held in state criminal history repositories. However, approximately 7 million (about 11 percent) of these were manual records and, thus, not instantly accessible to NICS.", "Of the remaining 57 million automated records, an estimated 16 million records (28 percent) were not accessible through the Interstate Identification Index for background check purposes. That is, these 16 million records were instantly accessible only to the state holding the respective records.", "Of the 41 million records that were automated and accessible through the Interstate Identification Index, the most recent BJS data indicate that perhaps 37 percent may not be fully useful for an instant check due to a lack of data on arrest dispositions.", "To assist BJS in reporting on the completeness of criminal records, the FBI analyzed a sample of delayed NICS background checks that resulted from an open arrest with no disposition. Overall, the FBI found that these delayed transactions typically involved older arrest records\u2014mostly ranging from over 5 years old to more than 15 years old. Specifically, more than 75 percent of the open arrests had occurred before 1995 and about 50 percent were found to have occurred before 1984. \u201cEven in states where the criminal history record on its face will indicate \u2026 an element of domestic violence, research \u2026 will still be necessary to determine if the offender was represented by counsel\u2026or had the opportunity for a jury trial [before firearms eligibility can be determined]. Because this type of information is not always recorded in original records of entry, it may simply never be possible in many states to obtain this information or to make this determination.\u201d", "The SEARCH representative concluded that there may be a certain, but unknown, percentage of misdemeanor convictions that resist any attempt to determine whether they meet the Lautenberg test, because records are not available or do not indicate whether the offender had access to counsel or the right to a jury trial.", "A third complicating factor is that misdemeanor criminal history records may not be clearly identified as domestic violence-related, thus requiring additional\u2014sometimes manual\u2014research. As BJS noted in a February 2000 report on improving criminal history records, identifying domestic violence misdemeanor convictions for purposes of a firearms background check presents a unique challenge. Domestic violence incidents have historically been categorized simply as assaults, making it difficult to segregate them from other criminal history records. Further, where additional research is necessary, misdemeanor criminal records may be more difficult to track down than felony records. In its recent report on the use and management of criminal history records, BJS noted that most state criminal repositories collect information only about the most serious classes of misdemeanor offenses. And, the general lack of comprehensive misdemeanor arrest and disposition data has previously been identified as one of the major deficiencies in state criminal history record systems.", "In response to passage of the Lautenberg amendment, the FBI\u2019s automated system for identifying persons with felony convictions was modified in May 2001 so that domestic violence offenders (and other ineligible persons) could be more readily identified. Under the new system, a \u201cflag\u201d can be set in the automated criminal history to indicate whether an individual is disqualified from purchasing firearms (signified by the letter D), cleared to purchase firearms (the letter C), or unknown or pending status (the letter X). When a firearms background check identifies a person with a disqualifying flag, the transaction can be immediately denied with no additional research required. Flags have historically been used to mark persons that have a felony conviction in their criminal record. However, for purposes of quickly identifying domestic violence misdemeanors, some questions remain. For example, while most states flag some or all felony convictions in their criminal history databases, only 19 states currently participate in the FBI\u2019s new flagging system for identifying domestic violence and other firearms disqualifiers. Also, as reported in a 1997 study sponsored by the Bureau of Justice Assistance,several state central repository officials expressed concern over the reliability and consistency of flags set in criminal history records, and one state official said he would not trust a flag set by another state and would need to look at the offender\u2019s rap sheet before determining the applicant\u2019s firearm eligibility. In Michigan, for example, an FBI NICS audit found that felony flags were not always removed from state criminal history records when individuals had their firearms rights restored. The audit also concluded that certain domestic violence offenses were flagged as disqualifying the individual from purchasing firearms, even though the offenses did not meet the criteria for disqualification."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Our Previous Observations on Delayed NICS Transactions", "paragraphs": ["In April 2000, we reported on the FBI\u2019s inability to complete certain NICS background checks within the 3 days allowed under the Brady Act. In our report, we presented to the Congress as a matter for consideration three options for minimizing the number of these transactions that occur\u2014(1) improve state criminal history records; (2) encourage states\u2019 participation in NICS; and (3) allow additional time for certain NICS background checks. These three options bear further discussion here in the context of preventing the sale of firearms to domestic violence offenders. However, given the long-term nature of improving state criminal records, and the reluctance of states to conduct their own NICS background checks, the third option\u2014amending the Brady Act to allow more time to complete NICS background checks before allowing firearms sales to proceed\u2014 would have a more immediate effect on reducing the incidence of firearm- retrieval actions\u2014including those involving domestic violence offenders.", "Improve state criminal history records. The first option was to continue providing grants to states for improving their criminal history records. During fiscal years 1995 through 2001, the National Criminal History Improvement Program (NCHIP) provided over $350 million in grant funds to assist states to improve the quality and accessibility of their criminal history records, in order to support the implementation of NICS and enhance the effectiveness of NICS background checks. Among the five program priorities for fiscal year 2002, three directly relate to NICS: (1) establishing infrastructure to support the full implementation of NICS, including full state participation in the Interstate Identification Index; (2) supporting state court efforts to improve the completeness of criminal history records; and (3) encouraging states to focus on developing domestic violence record systems that are complete and accessible to NICS. NCHIP is a long-term approach that has resulted in many improvements to state criminal history records. However, our analysis of NICS firearm-retrieval actions indicates that existing criminal records systems are still not sufficient to ensure that ineligible persons\u2014 particularly domestic violence offenders\u2014are prevented from purchasing firearms under NICS. Furthermore, in the most recent BJS summary of states\u2019 NCHIP grant programs, none of the six states we visited reported any specific activities or accomplishments on improving the access to or quality of domestic violence misdemeanor records.", "Encourage state participation in NICS. The second option was to encourage increased state participation in NICS. The FBI originally envisioned that most, if not all, states would conduct their own NICS background checks; however, half the states continue to rely on the FBI to conduct NICS checks for their states. In terms of access to records and expertise in interpreting criminal history records, FBI officials believe that states no longer necessarily have an advantage over FBI examiners. On the other hand, states typically have access to automated and manual records\u2014including arrest dispositions\u2014that are not accessible through NICS. Furthermore, states that conduct their own NICS background checks may have laws that make domestic violence (and other) firearm- retrieval actions less likely to occur. In Utah, for instance, state law prohibits gun dealers from selling a firearm until an affirmative response is provided by the state agency conducting the background check. In California, if background research reveals unresolved questions about a purchaser\u2019s eligibility, the transaction can be put on hold until these questions are resolved.", "Allow additional time for certain NICS background checks. The third option was to amend the Brady Act to allow more than 3 business days to research unresolved NICS background checks before allowing firearms sales to proceed. FBI data indicate that, depending on how much additional time is allowed, such a change could significantly reduce the incidence of firearm-retrieval actions\u2014including those involving domestic violence offenders. For example, data for roughly the first 3 years of NICS operations (Nov. 30, 1998 through Oct. 19, 2001) show that allowing up to 30 calendar days for background research would have reduced the number of firearm-retrieval actions by about 54 percent. Although this is somewhat less than the 77 percent reduction we previously reported based on the first year of NICS operations, it represents a significant improvement nonetheless. Furthermore, in terms of the burden on firearms purchasers, allowing more time to research unresolved transactions would affect a relatively small percentage of all NICS background checks. According to an FBI analysis of August 2001 NICS data, the vast majority\u2014over 96 percent\u2014of NICS background checks were completed in 5 calendar days or less. Because a significant number of firearm-retrieval actions involve domestic violence misdemeanors, reducing the total number of such actions would, in turn, help reduce the number of domestic violence offenders who are able to purchase firearms under NICS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As required under the Brady Act, a firearms purchase generally may not proceed until the gun dealer has contacted NICS to determine whether the transfer of the firearm would violate federal firearms law and any applicable state law. As a result, state laws and procedures\u2014such as those discussed previously\u2014can have a significant effect on NICS operations, particularly in how NICS examiners interpret state criminal history records to establish a purchaser\u2019s eligibility. Because of the variations in states\u2019 firearms laws, NICS examiners are challenged to identify the applicable federal and state laws for any particular transaction and make a decision to approve or deny the purchase within the 3 business days allowed under the Brady Act. In looking at the differences in how states restore gun ownership rights, issue concealed carry permits, and identify domestic violence convictions in their criminal history records, it is, therefore, important to consider how these actions may affect the operations of a federal program such as NICS.", "Regarding the restoration of gun ownership rights, there is little doubt that persons who have their gun ownership rights restored by a state action may sometimes commit subsequent crimes\u2014perhaps even crimes that would make them ineligible to possess firearms. Based on the limited number of cases we reviewed from the six selected states, we found few instances where such persons subsequently committed additional crimes. However, regarding how such actions may affect NICS, any such persons would, in all likelihood, be identified by a NICS background check if they later attempted to purchase a firearm. Although some observers may question whether it is appropriate to allow any restoration of gun ownership rights after such rights have been lost through commission of a crime, that issue is not relevant here for purposes of the potential effect on NICS\u2019 ability to screen prospective purchasers and prevent ineligible persons from purchasing firearms.", "On the other hand, state concealed carry permits\u2014because they may exempt the permit holder from a NICS background check when purchasing firearms\u2014can have a significant effect on NICS ability to prevent the purchase of firearms by ineligible persons. If states do not monitor their permit holders for continuing eligibility, and revoke the permits of persons who become ineligible to possess firearms, it is possible that ineligible persons could use revoked permits to purchase firearms\u2014avoiding a NICS check that might have prevented the sale. ATF has determined that four of the states we visited issue concealed carry permits that exempt permit holders from a NICS check when purchasing firearms. In two of these four states, state officials told us they do not recover all revoked permits and, in fact, they have no authority to force such recovery. In these states, revoked permits could used by ineligible persons to purchase firearms without a NICS check. States could avoid this potential problem by requiring all permit holders to have a separate background check at the time of purchase. A simpler solution\u2014which is practiced in one of these four states\u2014is to require gun dealers to verify the validity of the permit itself before approving a NICS-exempt gun purchase. This procedure allows the NICS exemption for active permit holders, while ensuring that ineligible persons cannot use revoked permits to avoid a NICS check when purchasing firearms.", "The inability of NICS to access domestic violence misdemeanor records in a timely manner is particularly troubling, since these offenses represent individuals who should be prevented from purchasing firearms. Yet, during roughly the first 3 years of NICS operations, the percentage of NICS firearm-retrieval actions involving domestic violence misdemeanors (representing over 2,800 persons) was disproportionately large\u2014almost double\u2014when compared with the percentage of all NICS denials involving domestic violence misdemeanors. Various factors make domestic violence misdemeanors difficult to identify in a timely manner. For example, while states continue to work to automate and improve the overall quality and accessibility of their criminal history records, this process has been ongoing since the early 1990s and is still far from complete. Also, domestic violence offenses may not always be clearly labeled as domestic violence, and the complex federal definition of domestic violence misdemeanor requires information that may not be immediately available in the state criminal history record. Allowing unresolved NICS transactions to proceed after 3 business days, when combined with these other factors, has resulted in numerous domestic violence offenders being able to purchase firearms without being identified by NICS. These are issues that have been known for years, yet they continue to pose problems for NICS.", "FBI data suggest that allowing additional time to research unresolved NICS background checks before allowing firearms sales to proceed would significantly reduce the number of firearm-retrieval actions\u2014including those involving domestic violence offenders. For example, based on data for roughly the first 3 years of NICS operations, firearm-retrieval actions would have been reduced by 54 percent if up to 30 days of research were allowed. And, based on the FBI\u2019s recent analysis of NICS transaction data, most background checks would not be affected by such a change\u2014in fact, over 88 percent of the background checks were completed within 1 hour, about 95 percent were completed within 3 calendar days, and over 96 percent were completed within 5 calendar days. Thus, allowing additional time to research unresolved NICS background checks would affect a relatively small percentage of firearms purchasers, while at the same time helping to minimize the number of firearm-retrieval actions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To minimize the possibility of ineligible persons using revoked concealed carry permits to purchase firearms without a NICS background check, we recommend that the Secretary of the Treasury consider developing regulations requiring states to implement point-of-purchase verification procedures, whereby the current validity of concealed carry permits must be verified by licensed gun dealers before transferring firearms to permit holders."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["To reduce the number of NICS firearm-retrieval actions and improve the ability of NICS to prevent domestic violence offenders from purchasing firearms, the Congress should consider amending the Brady Act to allow more than 3 business days to complete unresolved NICS background checks before firearms sales are allowed to proceed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Departments of Justice and the Treasury.

The comments did not specifically address our report\u2019s recommendation or the matter for congressional consideration. However, Justice acknowledged that the problem of NICS delayed denials (which can lead to firearm- retrieval actions) primarily stems from incomplete or inaccurate state criminal history records. Justice also identified steps it is taking, principally through the NCHIP grant program, to reduce the NICS error rate and achieve the most complete and accurate criminal history record system possible. These steps include (1) directing NCHIP grant funding to assist states to automate and improve their criminal history record systems, (2) encouraging states to use NCHIP funds to flag records of misdemeanor domestic violence convictions, and (3) directing BJS to study and recommend ways to target NCHIP grants to improve the accuracy of criminal history records, including those relating to domestic violence.", "We acknowledge that using NCHIP grant funds to improve the accuracy and completeness of state criminal history records is an appropriate and reasonable long-term strategy for reducing the number of NICS delayed denials and resulting firearm-retrieval actions. However, as we have noted in the report, these efforts have been ongoing since 1995, and yet significant numbers of firearm-retrieval actions have occurred during each year of NICS operations. Moreover, preliminary results from the BJS study noted above indicate that millions of state criminal history records remain incomplete or inaccessible by NICS. This suggests that a different approach is needed\u2014if not permanently, then at least in the short term\u2014 to immediately reduce the number of domestic violence offenders and other ineligible persons who are able to purchase firearms under NICS. Allowing additional time to research unresolved NICS background checks before firearms sales can proceed would significantly reduce the number of NICS firearm-retrieval actions. At the same time, Justice could continue working with the states to achieve the long-term goal of improving state criminal history records to the extent that delayed denials and firearm- retrieval actions no longer posed a significant problem.", "On June 24, 2002, Treasury provided us written comments by the Director of ATF. Generally, ATF agreed with the report\u2019s recommendation to consider developing regulations requiring states to verify the validity of concealed carry permits before allowing firearms transfers to proceed without a NICS background check. ATF noted, however, that it would first need to examine the extent to which persons with revoked permits have, in fact, been able to purchase firearms without NICS background checks. If a real problem is found to exist, then ATF would consider what options are available under current law to deal with the issue. The states that we studied were not maintaining data to facilitate determining to what extent, if any, that revoked permits have been used to purchase firearms without a NICS check. However, in our view, the fact that such a loophole exists and could be abused by persons legally prohibited from purchasing firearms is sufficient reason for ATF to take administrative action to foreclose the possibility of such transfers and, in turn, possibly prevent a firearm-related crime of violence.", "ATF also commented that certain language in the report could be misinterpreted to imply that ATF favors repeal of the permit alternative under NICS, that ATF believes the rationale for allowing permit holders to avoid a background check at the time of sale is weaker now than it was when the Brady Act was passed in 1993, or that ATF believes holders of valid permits should be required to undergo a separate NICS check at the time of purchase. ATF reiterated that its mandate is to enforce the statute as enacted by Congress and enforce the permit provisions of the Brady Act in a manner consistent with the plain language of the statute as well as congressional intent.

More importantly, federal law specifies that any conviction that has been expunged or set aside, or for which the person has been pardoned or has had his civil rights restored, is not considered a conviction for firearms eligibility purposes unless the expungement, pardon, or restoration expressly prohibits the person from possessing firearms.

The power to pardon for state crimes is generally vested in state governors or delegated to state pardon boards. An unconditional or full pardon generally absolves the offender from all legal consequences, direct or collateral, of the crime and conviction and generally restores civil rights. A conditional or partial pardon may require certain actions on the part of the offender or may absolve only a portion of the legal consequences of the crime. States vary in how they document pardon actions in their criminal history record systems. Most states retain records on the original offense, noting the pardon on the criminal history record, while some destroy or seal all records pertaining to the offense.", "Expungement \u2013 An expungement (or erasure) is a procedure whereby a court orders the annulment or destruction of arrest records or other court proceedings, such as a criminal conviction, provided certain conditions are met. When a conviction record is expunged, it may allow the offender to say, under certain circumstances, that he or she has never been convicted; expungement may not, however, automatically restore the offender\u2019s firearms rights. Expungement can also result in the sealing of a record, but whereas certain parties can still examine an erased record, a sealed record can generally be examined only by court order. Expungement and sealing of records are usually provided for by statute for juvenile records, but may also apply to less serious records, such as arrest records for persons acquitted at trial or whose arrest was deemed by a court to be unlawful. Some states require the passage of a certain period of time before an offender can apply for expungement.

The variation in procedures was so great that the Office of the Pardon Attorney characterized state laws as a national \u201ccrazy-quilt\u201d of disqualifications and restoration procedures. The report also identified disagreement among agencies as to how the laws in particular jurisdictions should be interpreted and applied. Moreover, the Office of the Pardon Attorney found that a restoration of civil rights under state law\u2014even through a governor\u2019s pardon\u2014does not necessarily restore firearms privileges.", "Despite considerable variation among states, the Office of the Pardon Attorney determined that state laws regarding the loss and restoration of civil rights could be characterized in terms of the following five patterns:   Civil rights are not lost upon conviction, or civil rights are lost when the offender is incarcerated and automatically restored upon release.   Rights are lost upon conviction, then are automatically restored after completion of sentence, either through passage of time or by obtaining a certificate of discharge from the sentence.", "Rights are restored through judicial or administrative procedure, which typically requires completion of sentence and a waiting period and may also require proof of rehabilitation.   Rights are restored only by pardon.   Rights are permanently lost and cannot be restored.", "Other studies of restoration of civil rights provide context as to the range and use of restoration methods by states and the effect these methods have on disqualifying criminal convictions. For example, a 1997 study regarding the legal consequences of felony convictions compared the availability of restoration methods among states in 1996 with the availability of methods 10 years earlier in 1986. Researchers found that, during those 10 years, states did not increase the number of restoration methods available to former offenders to restore civil rights. The study reported that in 1996 the availability of restoration methods among states was as follows:   All 50 states allowed for pardons. In 22 states, the decision to pardon rested with the governor; in 16 states, the decision was shared between the governor and a board of pardons; in 11 states the decision rested with the board of pardons; and in 1 state, the decision required an act of the state\u2019s general assembly.   27 states had some method of felony record expungement (including sealing, annulment, and withheld or deferred judgments). In 9 of the 27 states, the law provided for general expungement or related legal actions. In the other 18 states, the expungement statutes contained specific eligibility requirements for the sealing of criminal records.   42 states statutorily provided for automatic restoration of all or some civil rights for felony offenders. In 22 of the 42 states, the law restored one or more civil rights after completion of sentence. In the other 20 states, an existing general statute restored civil rights.", "In October 2000, BJS reported on the status of state criminal history information systems.

In 43 of the states, the pardon was to be noted in the criminal history record; in 3 states, the record was to be destroyed; in 1 state, the record was to be sealed; and 2 states did not indicate how pardons were treated in terms of criminal history records.   21 states had statutes providing for the expungement of felony convictions.

In addition to identifying state actions that fully restore state and federal gun ownership rights, we also identified certain state restoration actions that only partially restore such rights. In the category of \u201crestoration of civil rights,\u201d some actions that restore state gun ownership rights do not restore federal firearms rights, because they do not provide full relief from disabilities\u2014that is, they do not also restore civil rights (as prescribed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921). Other state restoration actions do not restore federal firearms rights because civil rights were lost as a result of a noncriminal disqualifier (such restorations are not recognized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921). Nevertheless, we present the information here in order to illustrate the complexity of state restoration laws and procedures and the interaction between state and federal firearms laws.", "Regarding the specific state laws and procedures for restoring gun ownership rights, the six states differed primarily in three areas: (1) the processes for application of and approval for relief, (2) the conditions or criteria under which a prohibited person was eligible to receive relief, and (3) the effect restoration methods have on firearms rights. Table 7 shows the differences among the six states in these three areas.", "The six states we reviewed differed in the processes they have in place for restoring firearms rights. Most of the states either provide for automatic restoration of firearms rights for certain criminal disqualifications, or require an administrative or judicial petition to restore those rights. For example, California employs automatic restoration for persons convicted of certain misdemeanor offenses, 10 years following completion of sentence. Michigan, on the other hand, employs both procedures: persons convicted of low-grade or nonviolent offenses have their rights restored automatically 3 years after completing their sentence, while persons convicted of more serious felonies\u2014such as arson or drug-related felonies\u2014must apply to their County Concealed Weapons Licensing Board for relief 5 years after completing their sentence. In contrast, Utah has no separate provision for restoring firearms rights\u2014individuals in that state must apply for a pardon or an expungement. States also differed in the processes they use for reviewing and awarding pardons. For example, in California, pardons are approved by the governor; in Utah, pardons are approved by a state pardon board; and in Massachusetts, pardons are approved by a review panel, which includes the governor.", "All of the six states we visited require applicants to meet certain eligibility criteria\u2014depending on the type of restoration method\u2014to qualify for firearms relief, such as the passage of time or the absence of additional convictions. For example, persons in Florida must wait 10 years following the completion of their sentence to apply for a full pardon or 8 years to apply for a restoration of firearms authority. Persons convicted in Michigan of specific felonies\u2014for example, arson\u2014must wait 5 years after the completion of their sentence to apply for relief from their County Concealed Weapons Licensing Board. Many of the states also restrict the types of offenses for which the state will grant relief. For example, California automatically restores firearms rights to offenders convicted of certain misdemeanors\u2014but not felonies\u201410 years after completion of sentence. Some of the states also require that an applicant have no additional convictions other than the offense in question. In Utah, only certain offenders with two or fewer convictions\u2014only one of which can be a felony\u2014can apply to have their criminal history record expunged.", "In four of the states we reviewed\u2014California, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Texas\u2014certain state restoration actions restore state gun ownership rights, but do not restore federal firearms rights. As a result, persons in these states who are authorized under state law to possess a firearm are still prohibited from doing so under federal law. In California, for example, state law automatically restores the state right to possess or purchase firearms to certain persons who have been involuntarily committed to a mental institution, 5 years after their release from confinement. This restoration does not, however, restore federal firearms rights to persons prohibited under this category. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921, state actions to restore firearms rights are recognized as a restoration of federal firearms rights only for persons who lost those rights as a result of criminal disqualifiers (such as a felony conviction), as opposed to noncriminal disqualifiers such as confinement to a mental institution.", "In Massachusetts, ATF officials have determined that the operation of state law is inconsistent with federal law in terms of restoring firearms rights\u2014both handgun and long gun rights\u2014to persons who have been adjudicated as mentally defective or involuntarily committed to a mental institution. Under Massachusetts statute, persons prohibited under the mental defectives category can seek to regain their state firearms rights if they provide an affidavit from a registered physician attesting that they are not disabled in a manner that should prevent them from possessing firearms. However, according to ATF officials, the same principle that prevents recognition of California\u2019s mental health restoration statute under federal firearms law also prevents recognition of Massachusetts\u2019 mental health restoration statute. That is, the specified methods of restoring firearms rights under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921 do not include state restoration of firearms rights lost as a result of noncriminal disqualifications.", "Also in Massachusetts, state law restores the right to possess certain long guns, but not handguns, to nonviolent offenders 5 years following the completion of sentence. According to ATF officials, because this restoration does not apply equally to both handgun and long gun rights, it cannot be recognized under federal law as restoring firearms rights. This stems from a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court, Caron v. United States, in which the court held that a state restoration action would not restore federal firearms rights, if any restriction on an individual\u2019s right to possess firearms remained following the restoration. Similarly, in Michigan, persons convicted of a nonviolent felony have their firearms rights automatically restored 3 years after completion of sentence, subject to certain conditions. However, the state\u2019s concealed carry law prohibits anyone convicted of a felony from ever obtaining a concealed carry permit. According to ATF officials, because of this restriction on the right to obtain a concealed carry permit, Michigan\u2019s restoration only partially restores firearms rights to persons convicted of a felony. As a result, Caron also applies, and such restorations cannot be recognized as restoring federal firearms rights.", "Texas\u2019 law restores\u2014to varying degrees\u2014state firearms rights that were lost as a result of domestic violence misdemeanor and felony convictions. The law automatically restores, 5 years after completion of sentence, all state firearms rights to persons convicted of a domestic violence misdemeanor. The law also allows persons convicted of a felony to possess a firearm in their home 5 years after completion of sentence. However, according to ATF officials, the state law does not restore federal firearms rights for either category of offense\u2014felony or misdemeanor\u2014 because it does not also restore the offenders\u2019 civil rights, as specified under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Handgun Concealed Carry Permits", "paragraphs": ["This appendix presents (1) a national overview of concealed carry permit programs and (2) information about selected states\u2019 permit programs\u2014 including how states screen permit applicants, how they monitor the eligibility of permit holders, and what actions states take to revoke permits if the permit holders commit crimes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "National Overview of Concealed Carry Permit Programs", "paragraphs": ["Concealed carry laws allow gun owners, under certain conditions, to carry a concealed loaded firearm in public.

However, the thoroughness and types of databases used during background checks varied slightly. The states also had procedures in place for revoking permits once officials became aware, through monitoring efforts, that a permit holder had committed a disqualifying offense or otherwise became ineligible to have a permit.

In addition, each state we visited queried its own state criminal history repository in reviewing permit applicants. The states also maintained other information sources that they consulted during the screening process. For example, all the states we visited reviewed records of fugitive warrants. In addition, most states reviewed listings of protection orders and mental health records. Also, some of the states consulted information sources unique to their respective states when screening permit applicants. California, for example, queried records on persons under supervisory release (i.e., on probation or parole), and Utah reviewed driver\u2019s license records.", "Only two of the six states we visited included a check of local records as a routine portion of the permit-screening process. For instance, Texas law enforcement officials examine records kept at the local (county) level as a routine part of the concealed carry permit background investigation. A Texas Department of Public Safety officer is to physically visit the local courthouse in the county where the applicant resides to examine local records. Also, local officials in Michigan are to check local records for pending charges and ongoing investigations, in addition to records in previous counties of residence if the concealed carry permit applicant has lived in the present county only a short period of time. The remaining states generally seek details from local records only when an automated records search reveals a possible problem with incomplete data\u2014for example, a potentially disqualifying arrest without a disposition.", "Another example of a difference in background screening processes concerns time limits.

According to Florida officials, this situation could and does occur when the state does not receive fingerprint results back from the FBI within the 90-day time limit. During fiscal year 2001, for example, 1,065 concealed carry permits were issued without a completed background check. In these situations, if the permit holders are later determined to be ineligible, the state must take action to revoke the permits\u2014which occurred 461 times between 1987 and 2001.

As shown in table 10, these mechanisms include computerized matching of names of concealed carry permit holders against state criminal records (Utah and Florida), manual notifications to the state\u2019s permit authority by the courts when a concealed carry permit holder is convicted of a criminal offense (Michigan), and point-of-purchase verification of a permit\u2019s validity (Utah).", "With regard to automated database checks, two states\u2014California and Texas\u2014have procedures to continually match permit holders\u2019 names against state criminal records.

Utah conducts a daily computer check by matching records in the state criminal repository to the list of permit holders to determine if any of them have been charged with or convicted of a disqualifying offense. After Utah began daily matching in February 2000, the number of permits identified for revocation increased over 240 percent\u2014from 75 revocations in 1999 to 256 revocations in 2000.", "Rather than automated monitoring processes, Michigan depends on a formal process of reporting offenses committed by concealed carry permit holders. That is, when a permit holder is charged with an offense that could potentially result in revocation of his or her permit, the applicable prosecutor is to notify the county gun board that issued the individual\u2019s permit. Following prosecution, a court official is to notify the county gun board about the results, including information about any disqualifying conviction.", "Massachusetts, on the other hand, has no formal statewide mechanism for monitoring concealed carry permit holders for continued eligibility. Rather, monitoring is done on an ad hoc basis, such as when one local law enforcement entity requests information on a suspicious permit holder from another locality. Local permit-issuing authorities (police departments) have informal agreements regarding the sharing of criminal records on permit holders to help facilitate this process. Massachusetts officials told us they expect to have an automated system in place in the future to more closely monitor permit holders.", "Among the states we visited, Utah uniquely monitors its concealed carry permit holders at the time of purchase of a firearm. That is, before selling firearms to a permit holder, a gun dealer is required to verify the validity of the permit presented, in order to allow the purchase to proceed without a NICS background check (ATF has determined that Utah permits qualify to exempt the permit holders from a NICS background check when purchasing firearms). In the other states we visited\u2014Florida, Massachusetts, and Texas\u2014where ATF allows certain concealed carry permits to be presented in lieu of a NICS check, the gun dealer performs only a visual inspection of the permit. In Utah, the dealer is to visually inspect the permit and call the state\u2019s Bureau of Criminal Identification to verify that the permit is still valid and has not been revoked.

In addition to criminal offenses, a revocation could also be warranted if the individual had developed a noncriminal prohibition against carrying a concealed firearm (e.g., diagnosed with a mental illness or subject to a domestic violence restraining order). As shown in table 11, firearms prohibitions in all the states we visited included federal disqualifiers, such as felony convictions, along with additional prohibitions put in place by the states.", "Regarding additional prohibitors, three of the six states visited revoke a concealed carry permit for any violent offense\u2014whether a felony or misdemeanor. In addition, all six states identified certain misdemeanor offenses that would result in revocation. Michigan, for example, designates specific misdemeanors as revocable offenses upon conviction\u2014including driving under the influence, assault, child abuse, and various firearms- related offenses. Some of the states had other unique disqualifiers that could lead to revocation for their permit holders. For example, in Michigan, the concealed carry permit law generally provides that pending felony charges in any state or federal jurisdiction can result in permit suspension and revocation. Massachusetts is similar in that an arrest warrant in any jurisdiction\u2014whether in state or out of state\u2014will result in permit revocation. Texas also revokes permits for certain noncriminal activities\u2014such as delinquency on taxes, student loans, or child support.", "Of the six states we visited, only Massachusetts had laws establishing any civil or criminal penalties if an individual failed to return a revoked permit to state authorities. If a person fails to return his or her revoked permit, as required by Massachusetts state law, the state may charge the individual with a misdemeanor offense punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 or a jail term of up to 2-\u00bd years. Massachusetts was also one of only two states (California was the other) where we found that local permit-issuing authorities would actively seek out and seize permits once they had been revoked. Massachusetts law generally requires that revoked permits be surrendered to the permit-issuing agency and, if not surrendered, the licensing authority is to take possession of the permit and the permit holders may be subject to civil or criminal penalties. In California, although not a requirement in state law, local law enforcement officials also told us that revoked permits are seized.", "In contrast, state officials in Florida and Texas\u2014two states with large numbers of concealed carry permit holders\u2014told us that they did not actively seek out and recover revoked permits. Furthermore, neither state has sanctions in place to force the return of revoked permits or otherwise penalize permit holders who do not voluntarily surrender their revoked permits. Data from Florida and Texas illustrate the extent to which revoked permits are not surrendered.", "In fiscal year 2001, Florida issued over 25,000 concealed carry permits. Due to the 90-day limit on application processing mandated by state law, 1,065 of these permits were issued before the background check was completed. State officials later found that 18 of these persons were ineligible to have a concealed carry permit and these permits were then revoked. However, state officials told us that 7 of these persons did not voluntarily surrender their revoked permits.", "Although Texas officials did not have specific data, they estimated that about 20 percent of all revoked permits are not recovered by the state.

As defined in the law, a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence is an offense that is a misdemeanor under federal or state law and has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force or the threatened use of a deadly weapon, committed by (1) a current or former spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim; (2) a person with whom the victim shares a child in common; (3) a person who is cohabiting with or has cohabited with the victim as a spouse, parent, or guardian; or (4) a person similarly situated to a spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim.", "In addition to the detailed definitional criteria and elements of the offense, the Lautenberg Amendment also prescribed a series of more complex exceptions to the firearms prohibition.

Also, the firearms prohibition applies to any disqualifying misdemeanor, regardless of the court of record (federal, state, or local) where the conviction occurred. In practice, most criminal history records are generated by the states, not the federal government. As such, with respect to domestic violence misdemeanors, the determination of a person\u2019s eligibility to purchase firearms is based largely on review of state criminal history records and related documents.", "As BJS stated in its February 2000 report on improving criminal history records, identifying domestic violence misdemeanor convictions for purposes of a firearms background check presents a unique challenge. Although the law establishing this prohibiting category was retroactive, domestic violence incidents have historically been categorized simply as assaults, making it difficult to isolate them from other criminal history records. In addition, where additional research is necessary, information about misdemeanors may be more difficult to track down than felonies. In its recent report on the use and management of criminal history records,BJS noted that most state criminal repositories collect information only about the most serious classes of misdemeanor offenses. Moreover, BJS noted that the general lack of comprehensive misdemeanor arrest and disposition data has already been identified as one of the major deficiencies in state criminal history record systems. FBI NICS officials confirmed that researching domestic violence misdemeanor convictions can be laborious.

For example, some states enacted specific domestic or family violence statutes that clearly defined this as an offense; some states had not designated domestic violence as a separate offense but had instituted reporting systems for cases that could be characterized as such; in states with an incident-based crime reporting system, some had derived domestic violence crime statistics from the existing system; and in states lacking incident-based capability, some had created domestic violence reporting systems.", "An October 1999 update to the 1996 report on domestic and sexual violence expanded on the original findings.

In California, the state penal code has a separate citation for misdemeanor battery, when the violence involves a spouse or other similar relationship (Sec. 243e). In addition, the state penal code contains another statute that makes certain offenders\u2014that is, persons who willfully inflict a traumatic injury on their spouse, former spouse, cohabitant, former cohabitant, or the mother or father of their child\u2014guilty of a felony (Sec. 273.5). When a person is convicted of domestic violence under these statutes, California law enforcement personnel are to enter the appropriate citation in the criminal history record, thus making the offenses clearly identifiable as domestic violence for NICS background check purposes. Similarly, in Michigan, the state penal code statute for assault and battery includes a separate provision for domestic violence misdemeanor when the assault involves a family member or other close relationship (Sec. 750.81(2)).", "Two states\u2014Florida and Utah\u2014define domestic violence in noncriminal statutes, rather than within the context of a specific domestic violence criminal offense. For example, Florida\u2019s statutes on domestic relations define domestic violence to mean offenses such as assault, battery, false imprisonment, or any criminal offense resulting in physical injury or death of one family or household member by another who is or was residing in the same home (Sec. 741.28). Florida also requires a minimum level of punishment when any of the specified domestic violence-related offenses are committed. Similarly, Utah\u2019s code of criminal procedure contains the Cohabitant Abuse and Procedures Act, which includes a definition of domestic violence (Sec. 77-36-1). Within this definitional statute, certain crimes are identified\u2014such as assault and harassment\u2014which, if they involve one cohabitant assaulting another, are considered to be domestic violence offenses. In both states, however, the offenses themselves are still charged under general criminal statutes and, thus, they may not be easily identified in the criminal records during the course of a NICS background check.", "Four states\u2014California, Michigan, Texas, and Utah\u2014have penalty- enhancement statutes that provide for additional punishment when convicted domestic violence offenders are subsequently convicted of another domestic violence offense. For example, under the Michigan domestic violence statute, a convicted first-time offender is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by up to 93 days in prison, making this a less serious misdemeanor. However, second-time offenders are guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by up to 1 year in prison (Sec. 750.81(3)), and third-time offenders are guilty of a felony punishable by up to 2 years in prison (Sec. 750.81(4)). These enhancements increase the penalty for the domestic violence offense, but also\u2014because they are considered more serious than first-time offenses\u2014make them subject to more stringent reporting procedures to the state\u2019s criminal history repository. Texas, has a penalty-enhancement statute for familial assault (Sec. 22.01(b)), which is a separate citation under the state\u2019s penal code for general assault. A misdemeanor offense normally charged under the assault statute is enhanced to a felony if the defendant has previously been convicted of an assault involving the offender\u2019s spouse or other member of the household. While felony enhancements would be easily identifiable in the criminal records as disqualifying offenses during a NICS background check, first- time misdemeanor offenders charged under the general assault statute may not be as easily identified, since this part of the statute includes not only domestic assaults, but other types of assaults as well.", "Finally, three of the six states\u2014Florida, Michigan, and Utah\u2014identify domestic violence offenses in their criminal history database by using an automated flag. According to Florida officials, 2 years ago the Florida Department of Law Enforcement implemented an automated fingerprint system that allows users to check a \u201cyes/no\u201d box when submitting a domestic violence offense to the state\u2019s criminal history repository. In addition, this system provides a narrative field that allows users to enter details of the domestic violence incident. The \u201cyes/no\u201d box and narrative field allow anyone conducting a NICS background check to quickly see from the criminal history record if the person has a domestic violence offense on his or her record. In Michigan, any time the offense code for a domestic violence offense is entered into the criminal history record, the system automatically places a flag in the record indicating that it is a disqualifying domestic violence offense.", "One of the states we visited\u2014Massachusetts\u2014has no specific domestic violence criminal offense statute, nor other mechanism for easily identifying domestic violence offenses in the state\u2019s criminal history records. In February 2002, the state amended its criminal statutes (Chap. 265, Sec. 13A) in order to create two new types of offenses\u2014assault or battery against pregnant women and assault or battery in violation of certain protective orders. Although both provisions could be used to prosecute domestic violence-related offenses, the former provision could also be used to prosecute an assault where there is no family or household relationship involved. Also, this provision does not define or include any reference to the offender-victim relationship as a required element of the offense.
