Before  addressing these matters specifically, I would like to place these  challenges in the context of the larger challenges facing the federal  government today, which we discuss in our recently issued 21st Century  Challenges report. There is a need to bring the federal government and its  programs into line with 21st century realities. This challenge has many  related pieces: addressing our nation\u2019s large and growing long-term fiscal  gap; deciding on the appropriate role and size of the federal government\u2014 and how to finance that government\u2014and bringing the panoply of federal  activities into line with today\u2019s world. Continuing on our current  unsustainable fiscal path will gradually erode, if not suddenly damage, our  economy, our standard of living, and ultimately our national security. We  therefore must fundamentally reexamine major spending and tax policies  and priorities in an effort to recapture our fiscal flexibility and ensure that  our programs and priorities respond to emerging security, social,  economic, and environmental changes and challenges.", "The PBGC is an excellent example of the need for Congress to reconsider  the role of government organizations, programs, and policies. The  Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) was enacted in 1974 to  respond to trends and challenges that existed at that time. One impetus  for the passage of ERISA was the failure of Studebaker\u2019s defined benefit  pension plan in the 1960s, in which many plan participants lost their  pensions. Along with other changes, ERISA established PBGC to pay the  pension benefits of defined benefit plan participants, subject to certain  limits, in the event that an employer could not. ERISA also required PBGC  to encourage the continuation and maintenance of voluntary private  pension plans and to maintain premiums set by the corporation at the  lowest level consistent with carrying out its obligations. PBGC was thus  mandated to serve a social purpose and remain financially self-sufficient.  When ERISA was enacted, defined benefit pension plans were the most  common form of employer-sponsored private pension and were growing  both in number of plans and number of participants. In 1974, Congress  may well have expected continued growth of defined benefit plans in the  years and decades to come. Today, defined benefit pensions cover an ever  decreasing percentage of the U.S. labor force, a fact that raises several  questions about federal policy on pensions in general, and defined benefit  plans and the PBGC, in particular.", "In light of past trends and future challenges, some of the fundamental  questions that need to be addressed as we move forward include these:    Should the federal government continue to promote defined benefit  pension plans?", "What features of various pension plans should the government promote  to meet retirement income security needs of increasingly mobile  American workers?", "What changes should be made to enhance the retirement income  security of workers while protecting the fiscal integrity of the PBGC  insurance program?", "Should PBGC act as self-sustaining insurer, according to market-based  principles, should it be a social insurance program, or should it be a  hybrid entity? As defined benefit pension coverage declines, there is an  inherent tension between these two approaches that Congress  presumably did not foresee when ERISA was enacted.", "What legislative changes are necessary to allow the pension insurance  program and the PBGC to succeed in their missions? And how much  authority and flexibility should be provided to PBGC to manage its risk  and respond to the fiscal challenges it faces?", "Should the government\u2019s pension insurance program be used as a tool  to provide restructuring assistance to industries that have been  negatively affected by certain macroeconomic forces such as  globalization and deregulation? Should such costs be handled  differently than other pension insurance losses?", "What portion of the PBGC\u2019s premium revenue should be fixed versus  variable rate premiums and for what purposes? Should variable rate  premiums be more risk-related? If so, how can they be adjusted to  accomplish this objective?", "What should PBGC\u2019s investment strategy be and what impact, if any,  should that have on pension funding, recovery, premium, and other  calculations?", "It is critical that we address these fundamental issues as soon as possible  so that we take actions consistent with our broader policy objectives.  Furthermore, failure to enact the proper reforms could expedite the  demise of the defined benefit pension system. As part of GAO\u2019s efforts to  help Congress and other policymakers address such issues, I recently  convened a group of pension experts at a Comptroller General\u2019s Forum  entitled \u201cThe Future of the Defined Benefit System and the PBGC.\u201d We will  convey the observations of the forum participants in a forthcoming GAO  report.", "I will now turn to the specific issues before this subcommittee today. In  particular, I will discuss some of the structural problems that limit PBGC\u2019s  ability to protect itself from risk and steps PBGC has taken to forecast and  manage the risks that it faces.

More than 34 million  workers and retirees in about 30,000 single-employer defined benefit plans  rely on PBGC to protect their pension benefits.", "PBGC finances the liabilities of underfunded terminated plans partially  through premiums paid by plan sponsors. Currently, plan sponsors pay a  flat-rate premium of $19 per participant per year; in addition, some plan  sponsors pay a variable-rate premium, which was added in 1987, to  provide an incentive for sponsors to better fund their plans. For each  $1,000 of unfunded vested benefits, plan sponsors pay a premium of $9. In  fiscal year 2004, PBGC received nearly $1.5 billion in premiums, including  more than $800 million in variable rate premiums, but paid out more than  $3 billion in benefits to plan participants or their beneficiaries.", "The single-employer program has had an accumulated deficit\u2014that is,  program assets have been less than the present value of benefits and other  obligations\u2014for much of its existence.

The amount of contributions required under  IRC minimum funding rules is generally the amount needed to fund that  year\u2019s \u201cnormal cost\u201d \u2013 benefits earned during that year plus that year\u2019s  portion of other liabilities that are amortized over a period of years. Also,  the rules require the sponsor to make an additional contribution if the plan  is underfunded to a specified extent as defined in the law. However,  sponsors of underfunded plans may sometimes avoid or reduce minimum  funding contributions if they have earned funding credits as a result of  favorable experience, such as contributing more than the minimum in the  past. For example, contributions beyond the minimum may be recognized  as a funding credit.  These credits are not measured at their market value  and accrue interest each year, according to the plan\u2019s long-term expected  rate of return on assets. If the market value of the assets falls below the  credited amount, and the plan is terminated, the assets in the plan will not  suffice to pay the plan\u2019s promised benefits.  Thus, some very large and  significantly underfunded plans have been able to remain in compliance  with the current funding rules while making little or no contributions in  the years prior to termination (e.g., Bethlehem Steel).", "Further, under current funding rules, plan sponsors can increase plan  benefits for underfunded plans, even in some cases where the plans are  less than 60 percent funded. This may create an incentive for financially  troubled sponsors to increase pension benefits, possibly in lieu of wage  increases, even if their plans have insufficient funding to pay current  benefit levels. Thus, plan sponsors and employees that agree to benefit  increases from underfunded plans as a sponsor is approaching bankruptcy  can essentially transfer this additional liability to PBGC, potentially  exacerbating the agency\u2019s financial condition.", "In addition, many defined benefit plans offer employees \u201cshutdown  benefits,\u201d which provide employees additional benefits, such as significant  early retirement benefit subsidies in the event of a plant shutdown or  permanent layoff. In general, plant shutdowns are inherently  unpredictable, so that it is difficult to recognize the costs of shutdown  benefits in advance and current law does not include the cost of benefits  arising from future unpredictable contingent events. Under current law,  PBGC is responsible for at least a portion of any benefit increases,  including shutdown benefits, even if the benefit was added to the plan  within 5 years of plan termination. However, many of these provisions  were included in plans years ago. As a result, shutdown benefits pose a  problem for PBGC not only because they can dramatically and suddenly  increase plan liabilities without adequate funding safeguards, but also  because the related additional benefit payments drain plan assets.", "Finally, because many plans allow lump sum distributions, plan  participants in an underfunded plan may have incentives to request such  distributions. For example, where participants believe that the PBGC  guarantee may not cover their full benefits, many eligible participants may  elect to retire and take all or part of their benefits in a lump sum rather  than as lifetime annuity payments, in order to maximize the value of their  accrued benefits. In some cases, this may create a \u201crun on the bank,\u201d  exacerbating the possibility of the plan\u2019s insolvency as assets are  liquidated more quickly than expected, potentially leaving fewer assets to  pay benefits for other participants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PBGC\u2019s Premium Structure Does Not Properly Reflect Risks to the Insurance Program", "paragraphs": ["PBGC\u2019s current premium structure does not properly reflect risks to the  insurance program. The current premium structure relies heavily on flat- rate premiums that, since they are unrelated to risk, result in large cost  shifting from financially troubled companies with underfunded plans to  healthy companies with well-funded plans. PBGC also charges plan  sponsors a variable-rate premium based on the plan\u2019s level of  underfunding. However, these premiums do not consider other relevant  risk factors, such as the economic strength of the sponsor, plan asset  investment strategies, the plan\u2019s benefit structure, or the plan\u2019s  demographic profile. PBGC is currently operated somewhat more on a  social insurance model since it must cover all eligible plans regardless of  their financial condition or the risks they pose to the solvency of the  insurance program.", "In addition to facing firm-specific risk that an individual underfunded plan  may terminate, PBGC faces market risk that a poor economy may lead to  widespread underfunded terminations during the same period, potentially  causing very large losses for PBGC. Similarly, PBGC may face risk from  insuring plans concentrated in vulnerable industries affected by certain  macroeconomic forces such as deregulation and globalization that have  played a role in multiple bankruptcies over a short time period, as  happened in the airline and steel industries. One study estimates that the  overall premiums collected by PBGC amount to about 50 percent of what  a private insurer would charge because its premiums do not adequately  account for these market risks. Others note that it would be hard to  determine the market rate premium for insuring private pension plans  because private insurers would probably refuse to insure poorly funded  plans sponsored by weak companies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PBGC Is Subject to Moral Hazard", "paragraphs": ["Despite a series of reforms over the years, current pension funding and  insurance laws create incentives for financially troubled firms to use  PBGC in ways that Congress did not intend when it formed the agency in  1974. PBGC was established to pay the pension benefits of participants in  the event that an employer could not. As pension policy has developed,  however, firms with underfunded pension plans may come to view PBGC  coverage as a fallback, or \u201cput option,\u201d for financial assistance. The very  presence of PBGC insurance may create certain perverse incentives that  represent moral hazard\u2014struggling plan sponsors may place other  financial priorities above \u201cfunding up\u201d their pension plans because they  know PBGC will pay guaranteed benefits. Firms may even have an  incentive to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy in order to escape their pension  obligations. As a result, once a plan sponsor with an underfunded pension  plan experiences financial difficulty, existing incentives may exacerbate  the funding shortfall for PBGC while also affecting the competitive  balance within an industry. This should not be the role for the pension  insurance system.", "This moral hazard has the potential to escalate, with the initial bankruptcy  of firms with underfunded plans creating a vicious cycle of bankruptcies  and terminations. Firms with onerous pension obligations and strained  finances could see PBGC as a means of shedding these liabilities, thereby  providing them with a competitive advantage over firms that deliver on  their pension commitments. This would also potentially subject PBGC to a  series of terminations of underfunded plans in the same industry, as we  have already seen with the steel and airline industries in the past 20 years.", "In addition, current pension funding and pension accounting rules may  also encourage plans to invest in riskier assets to benefit from higher  expected long-term rates of return. In determining funding requirements, a  higher expected rate of return on pension assets means that the plan needs  to hold fewer assets in order to meet its future benefit obligations. And  under current accounting rules, the greater the expected rate of return on  plan assets, the greater the plan sponsor\u2019s operating earnings and net  income. However, with higher expected rates of return comes greater risk  of investment loss, which is not reflected in the pension insurance  program\u2019s premium structure. Investments in riskier assets with higher  expected rates of return may allow financially weak plan sponsors and  their plan participants to benefit from the upside of large positive returns  on pension plan assets without being truly exposed to the risk of losses.

In lieu of predicting  future bankruptcies, PIMS is designed to generate probabilities for future  claims.", "In recent annual reports, PBGC has discussed the methodologies used to  develop PIMS. Furthermore, as far back as 1998, PBGC has reported PIMS  results that forecast the possibility of large deficits for the agency. For  example, at fiscal year end 2003\u2014the most recent year for which PBGC  has released an annual report\u2014the model\u2019s simulations forecasted about  an 80 percent probability of deficit by the year 2013. This included a 10  percent probability of the deficit reaching $49 billion within this time  frame. These forecasts, made at the end of fiscal year 2003, did not include  the $14.7 billion in losses that PBGC experienced from terminated plans in  fiscal year 2004.

There is simply too much uncertainty about the future, with respect both  to the performance of the economy and of companies that sponsor defined  benefit pension plans. It is difficult to accurately forecast which industries  and companies will face economic pressures resulting in bankruptcies and  PBGC claims. Furthermore, because PBGC\u2019s risk lies primarily in a  relatively small number of large plans, the failure or survival of any single  large plan may lead to significant variance between PBGC\u2019s actual claims  and the projected claims reported by PBGC in its annual reports.  Academic papers report varying rates of success in predicting bankruptcy  with various models that measure companies\u2019 cash flows or financial  ratios, such as asset-to-liability ratios. One paper we reviewed reports that  one model succeeded at a rate of 96 percent in predicting bankruptcies 1  year in advance and a rate of 70 percent for predicting bankruptcies 5  years in advance.

In this regard, effectively addressing the uncertainties  associated with cash balance and other hybrid pension plans may serve to  help slow the decline in defined benefit plans.", "One of the underlying assumptions of the current insurance program has  been that there would be a financially stable and growing defined benefit  system. However, the current financial condition of PBGC and the plans  that it insures threaten the retirement security of millions of Americans  because termination of severely underfunded plans can significantly  reduce the benefits participants receive. It also poses risks to the general  taxpaying public, who ultimately could be made responsible for paying  benefits that PBGC is unable to afford.", "To help PBGC manage the risks to which it is exposed, Congress may wish  to grant PBGC additional authorities to set premiums or limit the  guarantees on the benefits it pays to those plans it assumes. However,  these changes would not be sufficient in themselves because the primary  threat to PBGC and the defined benefit pension system lies in the failure of  the funding rules to ensure that retirement benefit obligations are  adequately funded. In any event, any legislative changes to address the  challenges facing PBGC should provide plan sponsors with incentives to  increase plan funding, improve the transparency of the plan\u2019s financial  information, and provide a means to hold sponsors accountable for  funding their plans adequately. However, policymakers must also be  careful to balance the need for changes in the current funding rules and  premium structure with the possibility that any changes could expedite  the exit of healthy plan sponsors from the defined benefit system while  contributing to the collapse of firms with significantly underfunded plans.", "The long-term financial health of PBGC and its ability to protect workers\u2019  pensions is inextricably bound to the underlying change in the nature of  the risk that it insures, and implicitly to the prospective health of the  defined benefit system. Options that serve to revitalize the defined benefit  system could stabilize PBGC\u2019s financial situation, although such options  may be effective only over the long term. Our greater challenge is to  fundamentally consider the manner in which the federal government  protects the defined benefit pensions of workers in this increasingly risky  environment. We look forward to working with Congress on this crucial  subject.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.
