The conveyance process\u2014which GAO measured from a mortgage servicer's obtaining title to and possession of the property to FHA's marketing of the property\u2014involves servicers making repairs, transferring ownership, and filing a mortgage insurance claim, and FHA inspecting the property. FHA attributes the length of time to complete the process partly to foreclosure processing delays that left properties vulnerable to damage and vandalism, which can increase the time servicers need to bring properties into conveyance condition. Property damage also may increase the likelihood that FHA will reconvey a property (transfer it to the servicer) for not complying with condition standards, further extending the conveyance process. For about 55 percent of properties conveyed in July 2010\u2013December 2017, servicers exceeded the required time to obtain title and possession of a foreclosed property and convey it to FHA. For 2017 alone, the corresponding figure was 72 percent. As a result, servicers were not eligible to be reimbursed for all repairs and interest expenses for those properties when filing insurance claims with FHA.", "In recent years, FHA changed aspects of its conveyance process to help address some of the execution challenges the agency and servicers have faced. For example, in 2016, FHA enhanced its data system for conveyed properties to reduce manual administrative processing. FHA also began a pilot program in 2017 to decrease the number of properties FHA reconveys by inspecting properties before conveyance. However, GAO found shortcomings in FHA policies, procedures, and assessment efforts that are inconsistent with federal evaluation criteria and internal control standards, as follows:", "FHA's policies and procedures lack detail that could help servicers and contractors determine if a property is in compliance, and the agency has not examined alternative methods of communicating this information. Fifteen of the 20 servicers GAO interviewed said existing policies, procedures, and communications often were not clear or specific enough to address property conditions or repair decisions they encountered. FHA also relies on brief written policies to explain standards and makes limited or no use of other methods, such as photographs or industry-wide calls.", "FHA has not provided written direction on when to use alternatives to reconveyance\u2014such as agreements under which servicers make repairs or repay FHA for any repair costs after conveyance\u2014for properties not meeting condition standards. In the absence of such direction, FHA may not be addressing these properties in the most consistent or effective manner.", "FHA has not developed a plan to assess the outcome of its inspection pilot.

To assess the reliability  of FHA\u2019s data, we reviewed FHA documentation and conducted electronic  testing, including checks for outliers, missing data fields, and erroneous  values. We determined these data were sufficiently reliable for purposes  of characterizing the length of the conveyance process and servicer and  FHA timeliness.", "To determine recent changes FHA made to the conveyance process and  any ongoing process challenges, we reviewed updates to FHA  regulations, policies, and procedures for conveyances since 2010 and  interviewed FHA officials on reasons for the changes. We also  interviewed FHA headquarters and field office officials and FHA  contractors with responsibilities for property inspections and approving  servicer property preservation costs about any challenges they  experience executing the conveyance process. We conducted  semistructured interviews with a nongeneralizable random sample of 20  large- and medium-sized servicers of FHA-insured mortgages about any  challenges they have had with conveyance policies and procedures,  including time lines and property preservation allowances.

Before initiating foreclosure actions, FHA  requires servicers to contact the borrower, collect information on the  borrower\u2019s finances, and attempt informal methods of resolving the  delinquency. If informal steps are not appropriate for a borrower\u2019s  circumstances, the servicer evaluates the borrower for a series of home  retention actions, which include a formal forbearance and repayment plan  and a loan modification. Under certain circumstances, the servicer may  consider a foreclosure mitigation option, such as a preforeclosure (short)  sale or a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. If the home retention and  foreclosure mitigation actions are unsuccessful, the servicer or mortgage  note holder is generally entitled to pursue foreclosure to obtain title to the  property.

Servicers convey these  properties to FHA, which sells them out of its REO inventory.", "During the default and foreclosure process, servicers must meet two FHA  time requirements. The first requires servicers to initiate a foreclosure  (first legal action) or utilize a loss mitigation option within 6 months of  borrower default. The second requirement, for the \u201creasonable diligence\u201d  period, requires servicers to obtain good and marketable title and  possession of a property within a specified time frame that varies by  state.

At this time, FHA becomes responsible for maintaining  the property until it is sold. FHA pays the part of the claim that covers  eligible property preservation and protection expenses incurred by the  servicer once the servicer submits title evidence and documentation of  expenses (in Part B of the claim form). FHA inspects the property and  reviews title evidence before selling the property out of its REO inventory.  In some cases, FHA reconveys the title to the servicer if it finds the  servicer did not comply with requirements related to property condition or  title.

FHA data indicate that from 2010  through 2017 servicers increasingly disposed of properties through third- party sales using the CWCOT program. As previously noted, in 2014 FHA  began requiring servicers to offer all eligible properties for sale through  CWCOT before using the conveyance process. According to our analysis  of FHA property disposition data, in fiscal years 2010\u20132017, the share of  properties disposed of through CWCOT rose from about 1.4 percent to  almost 44 percent, while the share of conveyance and REO sales  dropped from about 84 percent to 42 percent (see fig. 7). The remaining  properties were disposed of through notes sales or preforeclosure  sales.", "Increased use of CWCOT may have extended property conveyance time  frames for two reasons. First, servicers must attempt to sell all eligible  properties through CWCOT while simultaneously preparing them for  conveyance, which may add additional time to the conveyance process  according to FHA officials. Second, properties conveyed to FHA because  they are not eligible for or sold through the CWCOT program are  generally in poorer condition and require more repairs, according to  servicer representatives. This may contribute to extended conveyance  time frames. For example, a representative from one mortgage industry  group told us that properties ineligible for CWCOT and conveyed to FHA  generally require more than the $5,000 in preservation and protection  costs that FHA allows. In these cases, servicers may request additional  funds from the compliance contractor, but processing the requests may  prolong the conveyance process, as discussed later in this report.", "Representatives from one servicer and two mortgage industry groups  stated they prefer the CWCOT program because it reduces the need to  convey properties. They said the conveyance process is costly and  comes with the risk of reconveyance. FHA data show that REO sales  generally had higher loss severity rates (the financial loss on a defaulted  loan as a percentage of the unpaid principal balance) than properties  disposed of through alternative methods, including the CWCOT program.  For example, for the last quarter of fiscal year 2017, FHA reported that  the loss severity rate for properties sold through REO was 54.8 percent,  while the combined loss severity rate for properties disposed of through  alternative methods was 43.8 percent. However, some of this difference  may be attributable to the poorer condition of conveyed properties, as  discussed previously.", "National Mortgage Settlement  In February 2012, the Department of Justice  and 49 states settled with the five largest  mortgage servicers\u2014 Ally Financial, Inc.

According to FHA officials,  properties with long default and foreclosure periods may be in poor  condition because they deteriorate if servicers delay property  maintenance and repairs. FHA officials said this was common for  properties conveyed to FHA after the 2012 National Mortgage Settlement  because some servicers delayed foreclosure proceedings to limit their  exposure to litigation in 2010 and 2011 (see sidebar).", "FHA officials said that after the Department of Justice issued the National  Mortgage Settlement in February 2012, servicers who had been delaying  default and foreclosure started conveying large numbers of properties.  According to FHA and servicer representatives, damaged properties can  take longer to convey because they require extensive repairs to meet  FHA\u2019s conveyance condition standards.", "The results of our analysis of FHA data are broadly consistent with these  observations. The number of properties conveyed to FHA increased by  31 percent (from 84,363 to 110,567) between 2011 and 2012, the year of  the settlement. Additionally, the default and foreclosure period for  conveyed properties (the time between the borrower defaulting on the  mortgage and the servicer obtaining title to and possession of the  property) increased over most of the July 2010\u2013December 2017 time  frame. As shown in figure 8, the median default and foreclosure period  was 416 days for properties conveyed in July\u2013December 2010, peaked at  664 days (about 60 percent higher) for properties conveyed in 2015, and  fell to 612 days for 2017 conveyances. The overall upward trend was  even more pronounced for properties with default and foreclosure periods  at the 75th percentile. The 75th percentile was 555 days for properties  conveyed from July through December 2010, peaked at 1,152 days  (about 108 percent higher) for properties conveyed in 2016, and declined  to 1,068 days for 2017 conveyances.", "Certain regulatory and policy changes also may have increased the  default and foreclosure periods since 2013. HUD issued a mortgagee  letter in 2013 that increased the reasonable diligence time frames and  allowed servicers additional time to complete foreclosures in certain  states. For example, the reasonable diligence time frame for properties  in New York increased from 13 to19 months. Also, in 2014 mortgage  servicing rules issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau went  into effect that restricted servicers\u2019 ability to initiate a foreclosure and  gave borrowers additional time to pursue loss mitigation options.  Specifically, servicers may not initiate foreclosure proceedings if a  borrowers\u2019 application is pending for a loan modification or other  alternatives to foreclosure.", "In addition, we found that properties with longer default and foreclosure  periods generally took longer to complete the conveyance process than  properties with shorter default and foreclosure periods (see fig. 9).  Specifically, from July 2010 through December 2017 properties with the  longest default and foreclosure periods\u2014those in the highest quartile\u2014 took 93 days at the median to complete the conveyance process and 238  days at the 75th percentile. In comparison, properties with the shortest  default and foreclosure periods\u2014those in the lowest quartile\u2014took 57  days at the median to complete the conveyance process and 136 days at  the 75th percentile for that same period. As previously stated, FHA  officials told us that properties with long default and foreclosure periods  may have deteriorated if servicers were not maintaining them. These  properties may have required additional repairs to bring them into  conveyance condition.", "As previously noted, overall conveyance time frames declined in 2016  and 2017 from their peak in 2015. FHA officials attributed this  improvement largely to the decreasing number of conveyances affected  by the National Mortgage Settlement. As discussed earlier, the settlement  contributed to a wave of properties that took a long time to convey,  potentially due to damage sustained during extended default and  foreclosure periods. FHA officials also indicated that the improved  housing market in recent years has resulted in fewer foreclosures and,  therefore, fewer property conveyances to FHA.

During the preconveyance period, servicers  must ensure the property has good and marketable title, conduct routine  inspections and maintenance on the property, and ensure the property  meets conveyance condition standards. If servicers do not believe they  will be able to convey a property within 30 days, they may request an  extension. The median number of days servicers took to complete the  preconveyance period increased from 31 in July\u2013December 2010 to 140  in 2015 (see fig. 10). This figure declined after 2015, dropping to 101  days in 2017. Variation around the median was considerable, especially  in more recent years. For example, in 2017 the time to complete the  preconveyance period was 43 days at the 25th percentile, compared with  268 days at the 75th percentile.", "The percentage of properties for which servicers did not convey in 30  days plus any approved extension grew from about 31 percent in July\u2013 December 2010 to about 72 percent in 2017. For the entire period from  July 2010 through December 2017, the corresponding percentage was 55  percent. Representatives of 13 of the 20 servicers we interviewed said  that meeting the 30-day timeline was one of their top challenges with the  conveyance process.", "Representatives of servicers and mortgage industry groups cited several  reasons for servicers needing additional time to convey. For example,  representatives of 11 servicers cited the heavily damaged condition of the  properties they acquired as one of the primary reasons for not conveying  properties within 30 days. Servicer representatives also noted other  reasons, including four who cited waiting for responses on hazard  insurance claims and five who cited difficulty in obtaining HOA bills to  pay. In addition, representatives of two mortgage industry groups and  three servicers told us that meeting all the conveyance and title  requirements simultaneously is a major challenge. For example,  representatives of one mortgage industry group said a servicer may have  completed required property repairs and paid HOA fees and utility bills,  but if the property were subsequently vandalized, the servicer would have  to delay conveyance to complete repairs. By that point, the servicer might  no longer be current on HOA and utility payments. Servicers have the  option to request an extension to the preconveyance time frame if they  think they will be unable to convey a property in 30 days. Servicers  requested a conveyance extension for about 40 percent of the properties  conveyed from July 2010 through December 2017. FHA approved the  extensions in about 40 percent of these cases.", "In addition, representatives from six of the 20 servicers we interviewed  said FHA\u2019s process for reviewing servicers\u2019 overallowable requests  (additional funds needed to complete work) negatively affected their  ability to convey properties in 30 days. Once a servicer makes an  overallowable request, FHA\u2019s compliance contractor has 5 business days  to review it and either reject the request or approve all or some of the  requested amount. (We discuss the compliance contractor\u2019s ability to  meet this and other time requirements in the following section.) Servicers  may appeal any rejections, in which case the compliance contractor has 3  business days to make a final determination. Six servicer representatives  said that the time it takes the compliance contractor to make  overallowable decisions may cause them to exceed the 30-day time  frame, especially when they submit multiple requests for the same  property. For context, our analysis of FHA data found that in 2017, the  median number of servicer overallowable requests per property was 13,  and the median number of appeals per property was six.", "In contrast to the preconveyance requirement, servicers usually met the  time requirement for giving title evidence to FHA. Title evidence includes  documentation that FHA is the legal owner of the property, including a  copy of the mortgage documentation, a legal description of the property,  and a copy of the recorded deed in FHA\u2019s name. Servicers may provide  title evidence to FHA at any point during the conveyance process up to 45  days after filing the deed. If servicers believe they will be unable to  provide title evidence within 45 days, they may submit an extension  request to the compliance contractor. According to FHA data, servicers  were able to provide title evidence within 45 days plus any approved  extension for 84 percent of properties conveyed from July 2010 through  December 2017."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FHA Contractors Involved in Property Conveyances Largely Met Time Requirements", "paragraphs": ["FHA\u2019s compliance and maintenance contractors generally met the  required time frames for key conveyance tasks for properties conveyed  from 2011 through 2017.

FHA established a time frame of 5 business  days for the compliance contractor to conduct various reviews in the pre-  and postconveyance periods. In the preconveyance period, the  compliance contractor reviews requests for overallowables, conveyance  extensions, and conveyance of a property with surchargeable damage.  The contractor also reviews title evidence and extension requests for title  evidence, which are generally submitted after conveyance. Table 2 shows  the percentage of properties conveyed from 2011 through 2017 for which  the compliance contractor met the 5 business day requirement, according  to our analysis of FHA data.", "Although the contractor mostly met the required time frames, when it did  not, the delay may have lengthened the time to complete the conveyance  process. Our analysis of FHA data indicates that when the compliance  contractor missed the deadlines, it missed them by a median of 4\u201310  days, depending on the requirement. The compliance contractor\u2019s  review of overallowable requests, conveyance extension requests, and  surchargeable damage requests generally occurs during the  preconveyance period when servicers have 30 days to convey the  property to FHA. As noted earlier, some servicer representatives we  interviewed said that waiting for the compliance contractor to approve or  deny overallowable requests hindered their ability to convey the property  in 30 days.", "The compliance contractor must complete at least 95 percent of the  reviews within the 5-day time frame to meet FHA\u2019s standard for minimum  acceptable performance. FHA uses monthly scorecards when reviewing  the contractor\u2019s performance against this standard. FHA officials told us  they had not issued any deficiency notices to the current compliance  contractor, but that discussions with the contractor can occur when it  does not meet the 95 percent standard in particular months. FHA officials  also noted that some of the contractor\u2019s reviews may take longer than 5  days if resolving them requires obtaining additional documentation or  substantial back-and-forth communications with the servicer.", "Maintenance contractors. After conveyance, FHA\u2019s maintenance  contractors have 2 calendar days from the date they are assigned a  property to conduct the comprehensive property inspection and upload  the results into a HUD Property Inspection Report in FHA\u2019s asset  disposition system. They then have 5 calendar days to complete a  Property Condition Report, which details the functionality of the property\u2019s  systems, the existence of any transferable warranties, and any legal  actions, such as code violations or pending demolition orders. FHA starts  measuring compliance with these time requirements 24 hours after the  properties are assigned to the compliance contractor (to account for  holidays and late afternoon assignments).", "According to our analysis of FHA data, the maintenance contractors  completed property inspections and uploaded the results within 3 days  (the 2-day requirement plus 24 hours) for about 90 percent of properties  conveyed from 2011 through 2017. The contractors met the 5-day  requirement to complete the Property Condition Report about 77 percent  of the time. When the maintenance contractors missed these time frames,  they missed them by a median of 1 and 2 days, respectively. The longer a  property remains uninspected after the servicer has conveyed it, the  greater the chance that it will be damaged or vandalized before  inspection. If a property is damaged during this period, disputes may arise  between FHA and the servicer about which entity is responsible for the  damage. FHA is responsible for maintaining the property once the  servicer complies with all HUD regulatory requirements leading to  conveyance, including filing the deed (in FHA\u2019s name) for record and filing  the conveyance claim. However, FHA may hold the servicer responsible  for the damage if the claim was suspended due to the need for review or  correction resulting from certain types of noncompliance with HUD  requirements or if the servicer could not prove the damage occurred after  FHA became responsible for maintaining the property. Disagreement over  this issue can add time to the conveyance process.", "FHA measures each maintenance contractor\u2019s performance monthly  using a formula that considers both the contractor\u2019s timeliness in  completing property inspections and uploading the results (2-day  requirement plus 24 hours) and in completing the Property Condition  Report (7-day requirement plus 24 hours) for each property. If the  contractor misses either deadline, it is not considered timely for that  property. FHA considers timeliness for 95 percent of properties each  month as satisfactory. According to FHA officials, FHA has taken actions  when the performance of maintenance contractors was not satisfactory. A  HOC official said that the actions may include issuing a defective  performance letter, which requires the contractor to provide a remedy  plan, and issuing a cure notice in coordination with HUD\u2019s contracting  office."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FHA Changed Aspects of the Conveyance Process, but Policies and a Pilot Program Still Have Limitations", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FHA\u2019s Updates to Property Preservation Allowances and Data Systems Partly Addressed Certain Servicer Challenges", "paragraphs": ["FHA updated aspects of the conveyance process in recent years to help  address some of the challenges experienced by servicers and the  agency. For example, FHA increased property preservation and  protection allowances in 2016 to help address servicer feedback and to  better align allowances with other mortgage industry participants,  according to FHA officials. In February 2016, FHA issued Mortgagee  Letter 2016-02, which increased allowance amounts that servicers may  claim for specific types of property preservation and protection work. It  also increased the total maximum amount servicers may claim for a  property without submitting an overallowable request from $2,500 to  $5,000. However, the mortgagee letter eliminated all exclusions from the  maximum amount, which previously included one-time major repairs,  such as a roof replacement. FHA officials said the agency increased the  allowance amounts to account for the standard increases in property  preservation costs over time, and to align allowances with those of the  enterprises and the Department of Veterans Affairs.", "Seventeen of the 20 servicers we interviewed said that FHA\u2019s current  property preservation and protection allowances are not sufficient to  complete the work needed to convey properties. While representatives of  eight of the 20 servicers told us the changes FHA made to allowances in  2016 helped them complete work within allowance amounts,  representatives of the remaining 12 servicers said the changes did not  help or helped in some ways but presented more challenges in other  ways. Representatives of an association of mortgage lenders and  servicers said that they preferred the previous system, because some  work was excluded from the maximum allowance. For example,  representatives of one servicer said that due to the 2016 changes, they  now must submit an overallowable request for standard maintenance  items, such as grass cuts, once they have exceeded the maximum  allowance amount.", "Our analysis of FHA data found that the percentage of properties with at  least one overallowable request increased steadily from 2011 through  2017\u2014from about 53 percent to about 90 percent\u2014despite the 2016  changes (see fig. 11). For properties with at least one overallowable  request, the median number of requests before the 2016 changes (from  July 1, 2010, through February 4, 2016) was seven, compared with eight  after the changes (from February 5, 2016, through the end of 2017). In  2017 alone, the median number of overallowable requests per conveyed  property was 13. However, it may be too early to tell what effect the 2016  mortgagee letter will have on servicer\u2019s ability to conduct work within the  allowances. FHA officials said that although the change in the allowance  amounts was partly intended to reduce overallowable requests, the poor  condition of many properties with extended default and foreclosure  periods may have increased such requests. The officials stated that some  of these properties were still being conveyed to FHA in 2017.", "FHA enhanced the information system servicers and contractors use to  manage conveyed properties, but officials noted the need to update  another system FHA uses to process and pay claims. In March 2018,  FHA incorporated its preconveyance inspection pilot, discussed in more  detail later in this report, into the asset disposition system, the information  system servicers use to convey properties to FHA. FHA officials and  contractors also use the system to track properties from conveyance  through REO sale. With the update, servicers may request a  preconveyance inspection and see the results of the inspection in the  system, according to FHA officials. Before FHA added the pilot to the  asset disposition system, servicers and FHA used email to communicate  about properties in the pilot.", "In October 2016, FHA added a feature to the asset disposition system  that enables FHA officials, contractors, and servicers to electronically  monitor the status of reconveyed properties. According to FHA officials,  all communication between FHA and servicers on reconveyed properties  previously was by email, including the servicer\u2019s notification to FHA that it  was ready to convey a property again, and the photographs required to  document property condition. However, according to FHA officials, FHA\u2019s  claims system is not equipped to process more than one claim per  property, so claims for properties FHA reconveys and which the servicer  then conveys to FHA a second time must be processed manually.  Officials from FHA\u2019s Office of Financial Services said that manual  processing delays claim payments to servicers\u2014sometimes by more than  a year. Seven of the 20 servicers we interviewed identified delayed claim  payments for reacquired properties as a challenge.

Additionally, in December 2016, FHA issued an updated single-family  housing policy handbook that consolidated all policies and procedures for  servicers into one document, including those on maintaining and  conveying foreclosed properties.

Representatives from 15 of the 20  servicers we interviewed said they found FHA\u2019s policies and procedures  on conveyance condition to be unclear or subjective, and 13 cited specific  parts of the conveyance condition standards they found to be unclear or  missing. For example, one servicer was unsure about the extent of  repairs required when a property had water seepage in the basement. We  found that FHA\u2019s policies and procedures include information on how to  treat a basement that is flooded or a property with moisture damage, but  does not address basement leaks, cracks, or seepage. Representatives  of four servicers said that FHA\u2019s policies and procedures do not  sufficiently address how servicers should handle properties with potential  structural or foundation damage. Consistent with this viewpoint, we found  that FHA\u2019s handbook and mortgagee letter do not explain what a servicer  should do if it believes a property has damage affecting its structural  integrity. In addition, representatives of three servicers said FHA\u2019s  expectations of them are unclear when a roof is damaged but does not  currently have a leak. According to FHA\u2019s policies and procedures,  servicers must ensure all roofs \u201care free of active leaks or other sources  of water intrusion.\u201d However, FHA does not specify what servicers should  do if there is roof damage but no active leak. Two of the servicers said  they were uncertain whether they should replace the damaged roof that is  not leaking, or convey the property and risk reconveyance if it rains  before FHA inspects the property and the roof leaks.", "Perceived inconsistency in interpretation. Representatives from 10 of  the 20 servicers we interviewed said FHA is somewhat or not at all  consistent in determining whether properties meet FHA\u2019s conveyance  requirements. Among the remaining 10, one stated that FHA is  completely consistent and nine said that FHA is mostly consistent.

FHA has an FAQ web page that includes information on conveyance condition, but, as of April 2019, did not include FAQs about the specific property preservation and protection issues discussed above (water seepage, structural integrity, and roof damage with no active leaks). In addition, a link in the web page labeled \u201cforeclosure/conveyance\u201d led to a few FAQs on conveyance condition and property preservation requirements, but the answers consisted solely of language from FHA\u2019s existing policies and procedures.", "One servicer\u2019s representatives suggested that FHA could issue policies and procedures in a format similar to Fannie Mae\u2019s Property Preservation Matrix and Reference Guide.

While the compliance contractor told us that it takes ad hoc calls and holds regular teleconference calls with a number of individual servicers, an FHA official told us the contractor is only authorized to respond to servicer questions by providing relevant parts of FHA\u2019s written policies and procedures and is not supposed to respond with interpretations (clarifications, or explanations) of existing policies and procedures. Representatives from one servicer said industrywide calls with FHA staff would give servicers a way to obtain fuller explanations of FHA\u2019s expectations.", "One servicer suggested that FHA provide training to servicers about the conveyance process.

FHA\u2019s policies and  procedures provide instructions for servicers and contractors on how to  document property conditions, but contain limited direction on  photographic evidence. Servicers must thoroughly document the  condition of the property when they first obtain possession so that FHA  does not hold them responsible for damage caused by the borrower.  Servicers also must take before and after pictures of any work they do on  the property. FHA\u2019s policies and procedures on photographic  documentation say only that the servicer must use digital photography,  ensure a date-stamp is printed within each photograph, and ensure that  each photograph is labeled to describe the contents of the photograph.  FHA has not communicated in writing any requirements for photograph  dimensions, color, distance, framing, or content or suggestions for  documenting conditions that may be difficult to see.", "Servicers and FHA officials stated that they face challenges in  documenting property conditions in a way that most accurately informs  the compliance contractor about the property. The compliance contractor  reviews documentation, including photographs, uploaded into the asset  disposition system by servicers to make decisions on overallowable and  extension requests. The compliance contractor also reviews  documentation from maintenance contractors on inspection results and  reconveyance recommendations by HOC officials. An FHA maintenance  contractor told us that the compliance contractor sometimes responds  that the condition described is not apparent from the photographs in the  asset disposition system. According to members of an industry group  representing servicers, in some cases this may result in FHA requiring  servicers to repair damage caused by the borrower, because the  servicers\u2019 photographs did not prove the damage was present when they  first gained possession of the property.", "To illustrate how photographs can effectively or ineffectively capture  property condition problems, figure 12 provides two examples of flooring  issues at properties conveyed to FHA. In one photograph, the buckling of  the floor is apparent, but in the other, the waterlogged and warped  condition of floor is harder to discern. An experienced FHA maintenance  contractor told us there are creative ways to document some conditions  that are difficult to photograph. For example, to document a damp floor,  one can photograph a piece of paper (which darkens when wet) before  and after placing it on the floor. This method is not included in FHA\u2019s  handbook or mortgagee letter.", "Limitations in the content and delivery of FHA\u2019s policies and procedures  on conveyance condition suggest room for improvement and are  inconsistent with the federal internal control standard for communicating  externally.

Federal agencies can help ensure compliance by communicating with  and obtaining information from external parties and by periodically  evaluating and selecting appropriate methods of communication, taking  into account factors such as the audience, the purpose and type of  information being given, and legal or regulatory requirements.", "However, FHA has not identified where the conveyance condition policies  and procedures could be improved because it has not assessed  information from servicers\u2014for example, the frequency or content of their  questions to the compliance contractor. FHA also has not thoroughly  evaluated its methods for communicating its policies and procedures. As  a result, FHA has limited assurance that servicers understand FHA\u2019s  expectations for conveyed properties and that contractor decisions are  made consistently.

According to officials from FHA  headquarters and the National Servicing Center, HOC officials can (1)  reconvey the property\u2019s title to the servicer, (2) issue a demand letter  establishing a debt to FHA for the cost of the work needed, or (3) enter  into a reconveyance bypass agreement with the servicer that requires the  servicer to complete repairs within a certain number of days. The latter  two options avoid reconveyance and therefore may expedite resale of the  property. These three options are mentioned in different parts of FHA\u2019s  policies and procedures, but the agency has not outlined the  circumstances that would warrant use of each method.", "FHA has not provided direction to the HOCs, partly because HOC officials  have the authority to choose a method based on the expected financial  return on the property. However, HOC officials with whom we spoke  differed in the factors that they considered when deciding how to address  properties that do not meet FHA\u2019s conveyance condition standards.  Officials from three HOCs cited criteria that any property with more than  $5,000 in damage due to servicer neglect should be considered for  reconveyance, while a bypass agreement or demand letter may be issued  if the amount of servicer neglect is less than $5,000. However, FHA  officials were not able to tell us where this criterion is written. An official  from the fourth HOC said the decision to reconvey partly depends on the  strength of the housing market. If the HOC believes it can sell the  property in its current condition\u2014even if the condition does not meet  FHA\u2019s conveyance standards\u2014the HOC will be more likely to issue the  servicer a demand letter than reconvey the property. In contrast, an  official from one of the other HOCs told us the state of the housing market  did not factor into decisions on reconveyance. Furthermore, according to  FHA officials, HOCs may also reconvey a property with only small  amounts of damage if the servicer frequently conveys properties not in  conveyance condition, in order to impress on the servicer the importance  of complying with FHA requirements.", "The HOC officials generally agreed that bypass agreements offer a way  for small repairs to be fixed quickly. However, an official from one HOC  said the HOC did not issue bypass agreements often because servicers\u2019  property preservation and protection vendors may take longer than the  time specified in the agreement to complete repairs and, since the title is  in FHA\u2019s name, FHA has no recourse with the servicer. An official from  another HOC also said that he did not like issuing bypass agreements  because servicers do not always complete repairs quickly.", "FHA does not produce reports on the HOCs\u2019 use of reconveyance,  demand letters, and bypass agreements, so the frequency with which the  HOCs employ these methods is unknown. Some servicer representatives  with whom we spoke noted apparent inconsistency among the HOCs. For  example, representatives of three servicers said that some HOCs do not  issue bypass agreements at all. Similarly, representatives of one servicer  told us they have infrequently, if ever, received a demand letter for small  condition issues at properties; rather, FHA reconveys the properties for  minor condition issues.", "FHA\u2019s lack of written direction on alternatives to reconveyance is  inconsistent with federal internal control standards, which call for  designing control activities, including policies, to achieve objectives.  Granting HOC officials discretion in dealing with properties that do not  meet condition standards gives them flexibility to respond to specific  circumstances. However, without written direction on factors to consider  when determining whether they should reconvey a property, issue a  demand letter, or enter into a bypass agreement with the servicer, FHA  lacks reasonable assurance that HOCs make determinations consistently  and in line with the agency\u2019s regulatory goals for the REO program\u2014to  dispose of properties in a manner that expands home ownership,  strengthens neighborhoods and communities, and ensures a maximum  return to the mortgage insurance fund. Balancing these goals may  require using different methods to address properties that do not meet  conveyance standards. For example, in some cases issuing a demand  letter or a bypass agreement for certain properties may result in FHA  marketing and selling the property more quickly than it would by  reconveying the property. A quicker sale, in turn, may help avoid the  negative effects of a vacant property on the surrounding neighborhood.

For example, eligible properties include those that experienced recurring  vandalism, received overallowable repairs of greater than $5,000, or have  potential structural defects, foundation issues, or damp or wet  basements. Based on the inspection results, the properties are  approved to convey, approved to convey subject to repair with no  additional inspection, or denied conveyance through the pilot (see table  3). After conveyance, FHA inspectors conduct a thorough inspection to  confirm that the property meets conveyance condition standards.  Properties that do not meet the standards may be reconveyed.", "As of November 2018, FHA had not developed plans for evaluating the  effectiveness of the pilot in achieving the goals of reducing the number of  properties reconveyed due to property condition and minimizing the time  it takes to convey properties.

A  properly selected control group can rule out competing explanations for  observed outcomes. Additionally, because the pilot may affect  participating servicers in ways that extend beyond the speed of the  conveyance process or the probability of reconveyance, it will be  important for FHA to thoroughly consider the information sources and  measures it uses, including participant feedback. For example,  representatives of the three participating servicers told us they had  concerns about FHA holding properties in the pilot to higher conveyance  condition standards than nonpilot properties and the time it takes to  complete the preconveyance inspection process.

FHA neither agreed nor disagreed with our first  recommendation to enhance the content and communication of its  policies and procedures on conveyance condition. FHA cited the 2016  updates to its policy handbook and mortgagee letter and said it  recognized the importance of external communication, training, and in- person meetings to ensure servicers have the information they need to  operate in compliance with FHA programs. Our report discusses these  updates, but also identifies areas for additional improvements to address  limitations in the clarity and comprehensiveness of FHA\u2019s policies and  procedures and methods for communicating them.

For purposes of our  analysis, we generally excluded properties conveyed to FHA from  January 2010, through June 2010 because they were managed using  different data systems and contractors than FHA currently uses.", "After excluding these properties, we analyzed data for 544,421 properties  conveyed to FHA from July 2010 through December 2017. (We use  calendar years in this report unless otherwise noted.) We calculated the  number of days it took each property to complete the conveyance  process. We defined the start of the conveyance process as the date the  servicer obtained possession and acquired marketable title for a property  and the end of the process as the date on which FHA assigned a  marketing contractor to sell the property. For each annual cohort of  conveyed properties, we calculated the 25th, 50th (median), and 75th  percentile time frames and compared these statistics across years.", "To analyze the effect that reconveyances had on the length of the  conveyance process, we compared length of time for conveyance in  2012\u20132017 for properties that were reconveyed to those that were not.  According to FHA staff, data on reconveyances were unreliable prior to  2012, so we excluded those properties from this comparative analysis.", "We interviewed FHA officials about factors that may have affected  conveyance time frames from 2010 through 2017, including increased  use of other disposition methods and servicers delaying foreclosure  actions and the resulting impact on property conditions, since the asset  disposition system does not disclose the reasons for any delays. To  analyze changes in the use of different property disposition methods and  to examine the loss severity rates for these methods, we reviewed FHA  data for fiscal years 2010\u20132017. To understand the relationship between  properties with long default and foreclosure periods and conveyance time  frames, we measured the time between the borrower defaulting on the  mortgage and the servicer obtaining title to and possession of the  property (effectively, the end of the foreclosure process) for properties  conveyed to FHA from July 2010 through December 2017. We divided  the range of default and foreclosure periods into four quartiles. For each  quartile, we calculated the length of the conveyance process at the  median and at the 25th and 75th percentiles. We then compared these  statistics across quartiles.", "To determine the extent to which mortgage servicers and FHA  contractors met their respective time requirements for the conveyance  process, we identified relevant time requirements in Department of  Housing and Urban Development (HUD) regulations and policies. We  also reviewed the performance work statements for FHA\u2019s mortgagee  compliance manager (compliance contractor) and field service managers  (maintenance contractors) to identify the contractors\u2019 time requirements  for the conveyance process. For servicers and contractors, we selected  key time requirements for which electronic data were available, including  the following:  Thirty calendar days from acquiring title and possession of a property, plus the length of any approved time extension, to convey property to FHA.", "Forty-five days from conveying a property to FHA, plus the length of any approved time extension, to provide FHA with title evidence.", "Five business days to review each overallowable request submitted by a servicer.", "Five business days to review the sufficiency of title documentation submitted by the servicer.", "Five business days to determine whether a servicer can convey a property with surchargeable damage.", "Five business days to approve or deny a servicer\u2019s conveyance or title extension request.", "Two calendar days, plus an additional 24 hours, to complete and upload the HUD Property Inspection Report from the date the property was assigned.", "Five calendar days to complete a Property Condition Report from the date the Property Inspection Report was completed.", "For each property, we calculated the number of days it took servicers and  contractors to complete these required steps in the conveyance process  and compared that number to the maximum number of days FHA allows  for each step. For each annual cohort of properties conveyed in 2010\u2013 2017, we calculated the 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentile time  frames for completing the steps. We also calculated the percentage of  properties for which servicers or FHA contractors met their time  requirements for each step. We reviewed FHA\u2019s procedures for  monitoring the performance of compliance and maintenance contractors  for conveyed properties. We also reviewed examples of contractor quality  control plans and FHA quality control reports and scorecards used to  assess the contractors\u2019 compliance with minimum time frames and other  requirements. Additionally, we interviewed FHA officials about the  contractors\u2019 compliance with their respective time requirements and what  steps FHA took, if any, to address any noncompliance.", "We assessed the reliability of data from the Single Family Insurance  System\u2013Claims Subsystem and the asset disposition system by  reviewing FHA documentation about the data systems and data  elements. We interviewed FHA staff and contractors knowledgeable  about the data to discuss interpretations of data fields and trends we  observed in our analysis. We also conducted electronic testing, including  checks for outliers, missing data fields, and erroneous values. We  excluded from each analysis properties with missing or erroneous  information in the applicable data fields. We also excluded from each  analysis properties for which the applicable data fields were five absolute  deviations from the median (which we consider to be outliers). In addition,  we excluded certain properties conveyed in calendar years 2010\u20132017  that had conveyance dates that were out of sequence. For example, we  excluded properties for which the date a servicer obtained possession  and good and marketable title occurred after the date the servicer  conveyed the property to FHA. The number of properties we excluded in  any analysis using these methods represents no more than 3.2 percent of  properties conveyed from July 2010 through December 2017, which we  consider to be insignificant when compared to the remaining properties  included in the analysis.

We compared the requirements and property preservation  and protection allowance amounts in the mortgagee letter to those in the  prior mortgagee letter. We also reviewed FHA documentation on changes  to the asset disposition system, FHA\u2019s data system for conveyed  properties, and on FHA\u2019s preconveyance inspection pilot program that  began in 2017.

In cases in which servicers stated that FHA\u2019s  policies and procedures on particular conveyance requirements was  insufficient or unclear, we examined the 2016 mortgagee letter, HUD\u2019s  single-family housing policy handbook, and frequently asked questions on  HUD\u2019s website\u2014to determine whether it addressed the topics and was  sufficiently thorough to be applied to properties with different  circumstances. We assessed whether the policies and procedures were  consistent with federal internal control standards for external  communication. In particular, we examined whether the policies and  procedures communicated necessary quality information to achieve  program objectives and whether FHA had evaluated appropriate methods  to communicate them. Where applicable, we also compared FHA\u2019s  policies and procedures to features of Fannie Mae\u2019s guide for servicers  on how to preserve and protect vacant properties.
