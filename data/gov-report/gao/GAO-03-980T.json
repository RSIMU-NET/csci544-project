All were fighting for control of specific territories tied to each group\u2019s  definition of its own state. During this time an estimated 2.3 million people  became refugees or were internally displaced. NATO forces intervened in  the conflict to support international humanitarian and peacekeeping  operations beginning in 1993, culminating in a month-long bombing  campaign against Bosnian-Serb forces in July 1995. This pressure and U.S.- led negotiating efforts resulted in a cease-fire and negotiation of the  Dayton Peace Agreement in December 1995. About 54,000 NATO-led  troops were deployed beginning in late 1995 to enforce the military  aspects of the agreement and provide security for humanitarian and other  assistance activities. Currently, about 12,000 international troops remain in  Bosnia to provide security, including 1,800 U.S. soldiers.", "The conflict in and around the Serbian province of Kosovo between  Yugoslav security forces and ethnic Albanian insurgents fighting for  Kosovo\u2019s independence took place from early 1998 through mid-1999.  NATO initiated a bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in March 1999 to  end Yugoslav aggression and subsequently deployed about 50,000 troops  to enforce compliance with cease-fire and withdrawal agreements.  Currently, there are about 25,000 NATO-led peacekeeping troops in  Kosovo, including about 2,500 U.S. soldiers.", "The conflict in Afghanistan extends back to the Soviet Union\u2019s 10-year  occupation of the country that began in 1979, during which various  countries, including the United States, backed Afghan resistance efforts.  Three years after Soviet forces withdrew, the communist regime fell to the  Afghan resistance\uf8e7but unrest continued. The Taliban movement emerged  in the mid 1990s, but was removed by coalition forces in late 2001 for  harboring al Qaeda terrorists who attacked the United States on  September 11. In December 2001, the Bonn Agreement was signed, which  provided for interim governance of the country. Currently, about 4,600  International Security Assistance Force troops provide security for the city  of Kabul and the surrounding area and approximately 11,000 U.S.-led  coalition forces continue to fight remnants of the Taliban and al Qaeda."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Nature and Extent of Post-Conflict Assistance", "paragraphs": ["GAO\u2019s work over the past 10 years on Bosnia and Kosovo, and our recent  work on Afghanistan, indicate that post-conflict assistance is a broad,  long-term effort that requires humanitarian, security, economic,  governance, and democracy-building measures. For Bosnia and Kosovo,  forces led by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization provided overall  security, and the international community developed country-specific and  regional frameworks for rebuilding the country and province, respectively.  Bosnia\u2019s plan included the 3- to 4-year, $5.1 billion Priority Reconstruction  Program, which provided humanitarian, economic, and other assistance  based on needs assessments conducted by the World Bank and other  international organizations. A number of international organizations  involved in the Bosnia peace operation, including the Office of the High  Representative, the United Nations, and the Organization for Security and  Cooperation in Europe, helped develop government institutions and  supported democracy-building measures and police training. In Kosovo, a  U.N. peace operation oversaw assistance through (1) the United Nations  and other donors for housing winterization, refugee relief, and other short- term needs; (2) the medium-term Reconstruction and Recovery Program  devised by the European Commission and the World Bank; and (3)  programs to build a judiciary, a police force, and government institutions.  The Bosnia- and Kosovo-specific programs were complemented in 1999 by  the Stability Pact, which focused on encouraging democratization, human  rights, economic reconstruction, and security throughout the region.", "For Afghanistan, the World Food Program\u2019s (WFP) food assistance effort  constituted the largest portion of humanitarian assistance in the post- conflict period. To determine the needs of the Afghan people, WFP  conducted and continues to undertake periodic rapid food needs  assessments and longer-term food and crop supply assessments. Based on  the results of these reviews, WFP designs short-term emergency  operations focusing on free distribution of food, as well as longer-term  recovery operations including health, education, training, and  infrastructure projects. Owing to the size of WFP\u2019s effort and its years of  experience in Afghanistan, WFP provided much of the logistics support for  other organizations operating in Afghanistan during 2002 and 2003. A  range of humanitarian and longer-term development assistance is being  provided through broad assistance programs developed by the United  Nations and other multilateral, bilateral, and nongovernmental  organizations. These programs include infrastructure rehabilitation,  education, health, agriculture, and governance projects, among others.", "Post-conflict assistance efforts differ in the extent of multilateral  involvement. In Bosnia and Kosovo, the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization is responsible for enforcing the military and security aspects  of peace operations under the terms of U.N. Security Council Resolutions  1031 and 1244, respectively. The United Nations, the European Union, and  other international organizations are responsible for rebuilding political  and civic institutions and the region\u2019s economies under U.N. resolutions  and the Dayton Peace Agreement. In Afghanistan, the United States is one  of many bilateral and multilateral donors of aid helping to implement the  Bonn Agreement. In contrast, in post-conflict Iraq, the United States and  Britain are occupying powers under international law and are recognized  as such in U.N. Security Resolution 1483. The obligations of occupying  forces as enumerated in international conventions include respecting the  human rights of the local population; ensuring public order, safety, and  health; protecting property; and facilitating humanitarian relief operations,  among others.", "While the post-conflict situation in each location has varied, certain  similarities are apparent, chief among them that assistance efforts  continue to be provided in volatile and highly politicized environments  where local parties have competing interests and differing degrees of  support for the peace process. In Bosnia, the Bosnian Serb parties  continue to oppose terms of the peace agreement, such as the freedom of  ethnic minority refugees and internally displaced persons to return to their  prewar homes. In Kosovo, groups of Kosovar Albanians and Serbs retain  unauthorized weapons and commit acts of violence and intimidation  against ethnic minorities in violation of the peace agreements. In  Afghanistan, warlords control much of the country and foster an  illegitimate economy fueled by the smuggling of arms, drugs, and other  goods. They also withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in customs  duties collected at border points in the regions they control, depriving the  central government of revenue to fund the country\u2019s reconstruction."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Essential Components for Effective Post- Conflict Assistance", "paragraphs": ["Our work has consistently shown that effective reconstruction assistance  cannot be provided without three essential elements: a secure  environment, a strategic vision for the overall effort, and strong  leadership."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Secure Environment", "paragraphs": ["In Bosnia and Kosovo, humanitarian and other civilian workers were  generally able to perform their tasks because they were supported by large  NATO-led forces.

In Kosovo, the NATO-led  force provided security by (1) ensuring that uniformed Yugoslav security  forces withdrew from Kosovo as scheduled and remained outside the  province and (2) monitoring the demilitarization and transformation of the  Kosovo Liberation Army. Despite the relative security in these two  locations, various paramilitaries continued to operate, and sporadic  violent incidents occurred against international workers and the local  population. From 1996 through 2002, eight humanitarian workers were  killed in Bosnia and from 1999 to 2002, two humanitarian workers were  killed in Kosovo as a result of hostile action.", "In contrast, throughout the post-conflict period in Afghanistan,  humanitarian assistance workers have been at risk due to ongoing security  problems caused by domestic terrorism, long-standing rivalries among  warlords, and the national government\u2019s lack of control over the majority  of the country. The 4,600-troop International Security Assistance Force  operates only in Kabul and surrounding areas, while the mission of the  approximately 11,000-troop (9,000 U.S. and 2,000 non-U.S. troops), U.S.-led  coalition force is to root out the remnants of the Taliban and terrorist  groups\uf8e7not to provide security. In 2002 and 2003, the deteriorating  security situation has been marked by terrorist attacks against the Afghan  government, the Afghan people, and the international  community\uf8e7including humanitarian assistance workers. Among the  incidents were attempted assassinations of the Minister of Defense and the  President; rocket attacks on U.S. and international military installations;  and bombings in the center of Kabul, at International Security Assistance  Force headquarters, and at U.N. compounds. On June 17, 2003, the U.N.  Security Council expressed its concern over the increased number of  attacks against humanitarian personnel, coalition forces, International  Security Assistance Forces, and Afghan Transitional Administration  targets by Taliban and other rebel elements.

In  Bosnia, the Dayton Agreement provided a framework for overall  assistance efforts, but lacked an overall vision for the operation. This  hindered both the military and civilian components of the peace operation  from implementing the peace agreement. For example, the Dayton  Agreement determined that the military operation in Bosnia would  accomplish its security objectives and withdraw in about 1 year but did  not address the security problem for the ongoing reconstruction efforts  after that time. Recognizing this deficiency, NATO, supported by the  President of the United States, subsequently provided an overall vision for  the mission by first extending the time frame by 18 months and then tying  the withdrawal of the NATO-led forces to benchmarks\uf8e7such as  establishing functional national institutions and implementing democratic  reforms.", "In Afghanistan, the Bonn Agreement sets out a framework for establishing  a new government. In addition, multilateral, bilateral, and  nongovernmental organizations providing humanitarian assistance and  longer-term development assistance have each developed independent  strategies, which have resulted in a highly fragmented reconstruction  effort. To bring coherence to the effort, the Afghan government developed  a National Development Framework and Budget. The framework \u2019provides  a vision for a reconstructed Afghanistan and broadly establishes national  goals and policy directions. The budget articulates development projects  intended to achieve national goals.

In Bosnia, for example, the international community created  the Office of the High Representative to assist the parties in implementing  the Dayton Agreement and coordinate international assistance efforts, but  initially limited the High Representative to an advisory role. Frustrated by  the slow pace of the agreement\u2019s implementation, the international  community later strengthened the High Representative\u2019s authority, which  allowed him to annul laws that impeded the peace process and to remove  Bosnian officials who were hindering progress.", "In Afghanistan, WFP recognized the need for strong leadership and  created the position of Special Envoy of the Executive Director for the  Afghan Region. The special envoy led and directed all WFP operations in  Afghanistan and neighboring countries during the winter of 2001\u20132002,  when the combination of weather and conflict was expected to increase  the need for food assistance. WFP was thus able to consolidate control of  all resources in the region, streamline its operations, and accelerate  movement of assistance. WFP points to creation of the special envoy as  one of the main reasons it was able to move record amounts of food into  Afghanistan from November 2001 through January 2002.

In Bosnia,  reconstruction continues after 8 years, and there is no end date for  withdrawing international troops, despite the initial intent to withdraw  them in 1 year. Corruption is difficult to overcome and threatens  successful implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement. In Kosovo,  after 4 years, there is still no agreement on the final status of the  territory\u2014whether it will be a relatively autonomous province of Serbia or  a sovereign entity. This makes it impossible to establish a time frame for a  transition in assistance efforts. Moreover, providing this assistance costs  more than anticipated. Total U.S. military, civilian, humanitarian, and  reconstruction assistance in Bosnia and Kosovo from 1996 through 2002  was approximately $19.7 billion\uf8e7a figure that significantly exceeded  initial expectations.", "In Afghanistan, the preliminary needs assessment prepared by the  international community estimated that between $11.4 billion and $18.1  billion in long-term development assistance would be needed over 10  years to rebuild infrastructure and the institutions of a stable Afghan state.  Others have estimated that much more is required. For January 2002  through March 2003, donors pledged $2.1 billion. However, only 27  percent, or $499 million, was spent on major development projects such as  roads and bridges; the remainder was spent on humanitarian assistance.  Consequently, more than a year and a half of the 10-year reconstruction  period has passed and little in the way of reconstruction has begun. For  fiscal year 2002, U.S. assistance in Afghanistan totaled approximately $717  million.

In Bosnia and Kosovo, the international community has  had difficulties providing civilian staff and the specialized police for  security in the volatile post-conflict environment. For example, operations  in Bosnia had a 40 percent shortfall in multinational special police trained  to deal with civil disturbances from returns of refugees or from efforts to  install elected officials. These shortfalls sometimes threatened security in  potentially violent situations. In Kosovo, U.N. efforts to establish a civil  administration, create municipal administrative structures, and foster  democracy were hindered by the lack of qualified international  administrators and staff. Delays in getting these staff on the ground and  working allowed the Kosovo Liberation Army to temporarily run  government institutions in an autocratic manner and made it difficult to  regain international control.", "In Afghanistan, inadequate and untimely donor support disrupted WFP\u2019s  food assistance efforts.

WFP\u2019s actual deliveries were,  on average, 33 percent below actual requirements for the April 2002  through January 2003 period. Lack of timely donor contributions forced  WFP to reduce rations to returning refugees and internally displaced  persons from 150 kilograms to 50 kilograms. Lack of donor support also  forced WFP and its implementing partners to delay, in some cases for up  to 10 weeks, compensation promised to Afghans who participated in the  food-for-work and food-for-asset-creation projects. WFP lost credibility  with Afghans and nongovernmental organizations as a result.

For example, the United  Nations and NATO initially could not agree on who would control and  reform the Bosnian special or paramilitary police units.

From the beginning  of the assistance effort, donors were urged to defer to the Afghan  government regarding coordination. According to the United Nations,  Afghan government authorities were responsible for coordination, and the  international community was to operate and relate to the Afghan  government in a coherent manner rather than through a series of disparate  relationships.
