The results of the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) efforts to integrate border security among its components and across federal, state, local, tribal, and Canadian partners are unclear. GAO was asked to address the extent to which DHS has (1) improved coordination with state, local, tribal, and Canadian partners; (2) progressed in addressing past federal coordination challenges; and (3) progressed in securing the northern border and used coordination efforts to address existing vulnerabilities. GAO reviewed interagency agreements, strategies, and operational documents that address DHS's reported northern border vulnerabilities such as terrorism. GAO visited four Border Patrol sectors, selected based on threat, and interviewed officials from federal, state, local, tribal, and Canadian agencies operating within these sectors. While these results cannot be generalized, they provided insights on border security coordination."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["According to a majority of selected northern border security partners GAO interviewed, DHS improved northern border security coordination through interagency forums and joint operations. Specifically, interagency forums were beneficial in establishing a common understanding of security, while joint operations helped to achieve an integrated and effective law enforcement response. However, numerous partners cited challenges related to the inability to resource the increasing number of interagency forums and raised concerns that some efforts may be overlapping. While guidance issued by GAO stresses the need for a process to ensure that resources are used effectively and efficiently, DHS does not oversee the interagency forums established by its components. DHS oversight could help prevent possible duplication of efforts and conserve resources. DHS component officials reported that federal agency coordination to secure the northern border was improved, but partners in all four sectors GAO visited cited ongoing challenges sharing information and resources for daily border security related to operations and investigations. DHS has established and updated interagency agreements, but oversight by management at the component and local level has not ensured consistent compliance with provisions of these agreements, such as those related to information sharing, in areas GAO visited. As a result, according to DHS officials, field agents have been left to resolve coordination challenges. Ongoing DHS-level oversight and attention to enforcing accountability of established agreements could help address long-standing coordination challenges between DHS components, and further the DHS strategic vision for a coordinated homeland security enterprise. Border Patrol--a component of DHS's U.S. Customs and Border Protection--reported that 32 of the nearly 4,000 northern border miles in fiscal year 2010 had reached an acceptable level of security and that there is a high reliance on law enforcement support from outside the border zone. However, the extent of partner law enforcement resources available to address border security vulnerabilities is not reflected in Border Patrol's processes for assessing border security and resource requirements. GAO previously reported that federal agencies should identify resources among collaborating agencies to deliver results more efficiently and that DHS had not fully responded to a legislative requirement to link initiatives--including partnerships--to existing border vulnerabilities to inform federal resource allocation decisions. Development of policy and guidance to integrate available partner resources in northern border security assessments and resource planning documents could provide the agency and Congress with more complete information necessary to make resource allocation decisions in mitigating existing border vulnerabilities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that DHS enhance oversight to ensure efficient use of interagency forums and compliance with interagency agreements; and develop guidance to integrate partner resources to mitigate northern border vulnerabilities. DHS concurred with our recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been challenged in its  efforts to address the threat of illegal activity on the northern border,  where the extent of illegal activity is unknown, but the risk of terrorist  activity is high. The United States and Canada share the longest common  nonmilitarized border between two countries, spanning nearly 4,000 miles  of land and maritime border from Washington state to Maine. The terrain,  which ranges from densely forested lands on the west and east coasts to  open plains in the middle of the country, is composed of both urban and  sparsely populated lands with limited federal, state, and local law  enforcement presence along the border. Historically, the United States has  focused attention and resources primarily on the U.S. border with Mexico,  which continues to experience significantly higher levels of drug  trafficking and illegal immigration than the U.S.-Canadian border.  However, DHS reports that the terrorist threat on the northern border is  higher, given the large expanse of area with limited law enforcement  coverage. There is also a great deal of trade and travel across this border,  and while legal trade is predominant, DHS reports networks of illicit  criminal activity and smuggling of drugs, currency, people, and weapons  between the two countries. DHS reported spending nearly $3 billion in its  efforts to interdict and investigate illegal northern border activity in fiscal  year 2010, annually making approximately 6,000 arrests and interdicting  approximately 40,000 pounds of illegal drugs at and between the northern  border ports of entry.", "Securing the northern border is the primary responsibility of various  components within DHS, in collaboration with other federal, state, local,  tribal, and Canadian law enforcement agencies. Within DHS, U.S.  Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is the frontline agency responsible  for interdiction of persons and contraband crossing the border illegally,  and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is responsible for  investigating the source of cross-border crimes and dismantling illegal  operations. Other federal, state, local, tribal, and Canadian law  enforcement agencies also have responsibilities to detect, interdict, and  investigate different types of illegal activity within certain geographic  boundaries. For example, the U.S. Forest Service, within the U.S.  Department of Agriculture (USDA), has responsibility for the protection of  natural resources and persons on Forest Service lands, including about  400 miles adjacent to the northern border. Similarly, the Drug  Enforcement Administration (DEA), within the Department of Justice  (DOJ), conducts investigations of priority drug trafficking organizations,  domestic and foreign, that can include drug smuggling across the border  or ports of entry.", "DHS has established partnerships with other federal, state, local, tribal,  and Canadian law enforcement agencies to secure the northern border,  and taken action to improve coordination among its components and  across its partners. To facilitate partnerships and coordination, DHS has  established various mechanisms\u2014such as interagency forums and  agreements\u2014to improve information sharing necessary to achieve a  common understanding of the border security threats and to leverage  resources for achieving an integrated law enforcement response. However,  it is unclear the extent to which these efforts are addressing border  security gaps, and in November 2008 we reported that DHS had not linked  its initiatives to the border vulnerabilities it had identified or informed  Congress about additional resources needed to secure the northern  border. DHS and GAO have also reported long-standing coordination  challenges between CBP\u2019s Office of Border Patrol (Border Patrol) and  ICE, ICE and DEA, and Border Patrol and Forest Service that may impede  achieving border security goals. This report responds to your request to  review how DHS has coordinated law enforcement resources across law  enforcement partners to improve northern border security and made  progress in addressing past coordination challenges. Specifically, we  answered the following questions:    According to selected northern border security partners, to what extent  has DHS improved federal coordination of border security intelligence  and enforcement operations with state, local, tribal, and Canadian law  enforcement partners?", "To what extent has DHS made progress in addressing past coordination  challenges between Border Patrol and ICE, and across DEA and Forest  Service in different locations across the northern border, according to  selected northern border security partners?", "What progress has DHS made in securing the northern border, and to  what extent has DHS used its partnerships and coordination efforts to  address DHS\u2019s reported border security vulnerabilities?"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["In conducting our work, we interviewed headquarters officials at DHS,  DOJ, the Department of the Interior (DOI), and USDA; analyzed DHS  documentation; and conducted site visits to four northern border  locations. We selected Border Patrol\u2019s Blaine, Spokane, Detroit, and  Swanton sectors to visit as they comprise a mix of differences along the  northern border regarding geography (western, central, and eastern  border areas), threats (terrorism, drug smuggling, and illegal migration),  and threat environment (air, marine, land) as shown in figure 1. We  conducted interviews with federal, state, local, tribal, and Canadian  officials relevant to these Border Patrol sectors. Although other northern  border partners do not divide their geographic areas of responsibility by  sectors, for the purposes of this report, we refer to the northern border  partners\u2014such as ICE and DEA\u2014whose area of responsibility overlaps  with these sectors as officials operating within these Border Patrol  sectors. While we cannot generalize our work from these visits to all  locations along the northern border, the information we obtained provides  examples of the way in which DHS and other federal agencies coordinate  their efforts with these northern border partners.", "To address the first objective, we reviewed documents that included  relevant legislation affecting the northern border, a past report to  Congress in response to legislated requirements, and agency strategies,  including the DHS Quadrennial Homeland Security Review, and CBP\u2019s  Northern Border Strategy. We interviewed DHS headquarters officials  with knowledge of DHS coordination efforts and also interviewed federal,  state, local, tribal, and Canadian officials in the four sectors we visited to  obtain their perspective on DHS coordination efforts focusing on their  participation in interagency forums and joint operations. For a complete  list of northern border partners we interviewed in each sector, see  appendix I. Based on these documents and discussions, we focused on  two interagency forums\u2014the Integrated Border Enforcement Team  (IBET) and the Border Enforcement Security Task Force (BEST)\u2014and  joint operations such as the Shiprider Program. Our assessment of these  interagency forums and joint operations are nongeneralizeable as they do  not include an exhaustive list of U.S. and Canadian initiatives to  coordinate the security of the border. However, they were highlighted by  the officials we interviewed as interagency forums that helped to  coordinate information sharing, interdiction, and investigations across  nations and levels of government along with joint operations that  coordinated a federal law enforcement response between the partners in  the air, land, and marine border environments. In addition to these  discussions within each sector, we reviewed documents at the sector level  relevant to northern border coordination including meeting minutes from  interagency meetings and after-action reports for joint operations. We  compared DHS coordination efforts to best practices and federal  guidelines for interagency coordination to determine whether DHS\u2019s  efforts are consistent with such practices.", "To address the second objective, we reviewed agreements established  between DHS components, between DHS and DOJ, and between DHS and  USDA to coordinate interdiction and investigation activities, and  interviewed officials from these agencies at headquarters and in the field.  Specifically, we reviewed agreements assigning responsibilities for  interdiction and investigation between Border Patrol and ICE, Border  Patrol and Forest Service, and ICE and DEA. We reviewed documents and  reports documenting coordination challenges between these agencies,  including those prepared by DHS and us, and subsequent corrective action  cited by the departments. As part of our interviews with officials in the  four sectors we visited, we examined the extent to which DHS and its  partners stated that agreements were working to overcome coordination  challenges between agencies and were enhancing the sharing of  information and resources to secure the border. See appendix I for a list of  offices interviewed in the four sectors. We also used work from our  companion review of border coordination on federal lands, to assess  Border Patrol coordination with DOI and the USDA in the Spokane  Sector.", "To address the third objective, we analyzed Border Patrol\u2019s 2007 through  2010 Operational Requirements Based Budget Process (ORBBP)  documents that include each sector\u2019s assessment of the border security  threat, operational assessment of border security, and resource  requirements needed to further secure border miles within each sector.  We reviewed these documents to determine the number of border miles  that Border Patrol reported were under effective control, the number of  miles reported as needing outside law enforcement support, and the  extent that use of partner resources were being used to address gaps in  Border Patrol resources. We reviewed guidance headquarters provided to  sectors for development of the ORBBP, as well as direction and  performance indicators provided in CBP\u2019s Northern Border Strategy. We  also interviewed Border Patrol officials in the field who are responsible for  preparing the ORBBP and headquarters officials responsible for reviewing  these documents.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2009 through  December 2010 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.

Also, the northern border\u2019s waterways can freeze  during the winter and can easily be crossed on foot or by vehicle or  snowmobile. The northern air border is also vulnerable to low-flying  aircraft that, for example, smuggle drugs by entering U.S. airspace from  Canada.

These partners include other U.S. federal agencies  such as DOJ\u2019s DEA, which has responsibility for drug enforcement, and  the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which has responsibility for  combating terrorism. The Department of Defense (DOD), while not a  partner, also provides support as requested, such as personnel and  technology for temporary joint operations. Partners also include Canadian  law enforcement agencies such as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police  (RCMP)\u2014which is responsible for national law enforcement, including  border security\u2014and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), which  is responsible for border security and public safety at the ports of entry.", "CBP and ICE also partner with federal, state, local, and tribal entities that  have law enforcement jurisdiction for federal, public, private, or tribal  lands that are adjacent to the border. As shown in figure 2, federal lands  comprise about 1,016 miles, or approximately 25 percent, of the nearly  4,000 northern border miles (excluding the Alaska\u2013Canada border), and  are primarily administered by the National Park Service and Forest  Service. Law enforcement personnel from sovereign Indian nations  located on about 4 percent of the northern border also conduct law  enforcement operations related to border security. In addition, DOI\u2019s  Bureau of Indian Affairs may enforce federal laws on Indian lands, with  the consent of tribes and in accordance with tribal laws. Moreover,  numerous state and local law enforcement entities interdict and  investigate criminal activity on public and private lands adjacent to about  75 percent of the northern border.

One reason for overlap is Border Patrol\u2019s  multilayered strategy for securing the border, which provides for several  layers of agents who operate not only at the border, but also on public and  private lands up to 100 miles from the border. As a result, officials from  other federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies may patrol  in the same geographic area and pursue the same persons or criminal  organizations who violate laws underpinning each agency\u2019s respective  mission.

For  example, in both 2004 and 2010, we reported that Border Patrol, USDA,  and DOI were challenged to coordinate border security efforts on northern  federal lands. We also reported in early 2009 that there were significant  challenges to coordination of drug law enforcement efforts between ICE  and DEA.

DHS reiterated its commitment to share information  across agencies in its 2008 Information Sharing Strategy, which provides  full recognition and integration of federal agencies, tribal nations, and  others in the DHS information-sharing environment and in development of  relevant technologies. Also, in its 2008 Report to Congress on the status  of northern border security, DHS listed interagency forums and joint  operations that it established or supports for coordinating efforts among  federal, state, local, tribal, and Canadian partners.

The 9/11 Commission had determined that limited  coordination had contributed to border security vulnerabilities, and  emphasized the importance of establishing or supporting interagency  forums to strengthen information sharing and coordinate efforts to secure  the border. Two DHS components, CBP and ICE, responsible for border  security interdiction and investigations, respectively, played key roles in  the establishment of the two interagency forums within our review\u2014the  IBET and BEST\u2014and along with USCG and Canada\u2019s RCMP and CBSA are  key participants in both forums. Information about these interagency  forums is presented in table 2.", "DHS is working to establish a means to quantify and report on the benefits  achieved through its investment in interagency forums, but in the  meantime officials from 17 offices that participate in interagency forums  across the four sectors we visited commented that interagency forums had  improved coordination among the participants. These officials provided  examples that highlighted benefits in three key areas: (1) facilitating the  sharing of border security intelligence information, (2) facilitating the  sharing of resources such as equipment and personnel; and in some cases,  (3) serving as a tool for deconfliction\u2014or a means to inform partners of  special border security operations that were planned to be conducted in  geographic areas of responsibility common to multiple law enforcement  agencies.", "Information Sharing. The IBET or the BEST facilitated exchange of  timely and actionable threat information between U.S. and Canadian  partners leading to improved interdiction and investigation capabilities,  according to officials from 17 of the 18 offices we interviewed. For  example, IBET participation helped to build trust between the core  partners, which resulted in collaborative efforts to secure the border,  according to Canadian CBSA officials from Windsor and Montreal\u2014north  of the Detroit and Swanton sectors respectively. In addition, IBET  membership further strengthened U.S. and Canadian relationships as  participants interacted more frequently through meetings and the  colocation of personnel, which in turn facilitated the exchange of  information according to ICE and Border Patrol officials operating within  the Swanton and Detroit sectors, respectively. As a result, we were told  IBET partners can more easily and quickly obtain information, such as  border entry and exit data and surveillance images that would normally  take several weeks to obtain. For example, Canada\u2019s CBSA forwarded  intelligence on a Canadian national who was smuggling drugs from  Canada to the United States to the BEST, according to ICE officials  operating within the Blaine sector, at which time BEST partners\u2014Border  Patrol and ICE\u2014were able to conduct surveillance and apprehend the  individual, seizing over 500 pounds of marijuana that was backpacked  across the border, and gain further intelligence about other criminal  activity.", "Sharing of Resources. The IBET or BEST helped partners leverage  personnel, technology, and other resources for operations to interdict or  investigate cross-border illegal activity, according to officials in 17 of the  18 offices we interviewed. For example, colocation of BEST members  provides U.S. and Canadian officials ready access to the knowledge and  skills of participating agencies, according to ICE officials operating within  the Detroit sector. Another example of a benefit is the pooling of  resources. The IBET operating within the Spokane sector maintains a  centralized resource list that participants can view and request use of  partners\u2019 available technology, equipment, and vehicles, according to ICE  and Border Patrol officials. Radio communications are also facilitated  among participants of the IBET and BEST attended by officials from the  Blaine sector, in that all participants have access to a bank of 10 hand-held  radios on the same frequency, according to an ICE official operating  within the Blaine sector. Officials cited examples of how sharing  personnel and resources helped secure the border. In one example, U.S.  and Canadian IBET partners were conducting joint operations to monitor  over 133 kilometers of unguarded roads in the Swanton sector that were  exploited by criminal organizations smuggling humans, drugs, and other  contraband, according to RCMP officials north of the Swanton sector. The  operation employed Canadian personnel from RCMP and Border Patrol to  patrol the roads using resources such as motion sensor and video  equipment to expand surveillance coverage. U.S. and Canadian IBET  partners also shared sensor hits and video footage from both sides of the  border. As a result of the shared information and resources, partners were  able to determine if illegal activities were going north or south of the  border and had increased awareness to detect and interdict cross-border  crime.", "Deconfliction. The IBET or BEST were also used in conjunction with  other interagency forums to deconflict operations planned by various  agencies that operate in geographic areas of responsibility common to  multiple law enforcement agencies, according to officials in all offices we  interviewed. For example, the colocation of BEST members raised  awareness of operations and activities at the border due to the daily and  ongoing information being shared between members, according to ICE  participants in the Blaine and Detroit sectors. IBET participants from the  Spokane sector also had daily telephone conversations to discuss their  operations, and subgroups within the IBET met once a week to share  information and intelligence and discuss operations to prevent  unknowingly interrupting each other, according to a Border Patrol  participant."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Joint Operations Improved Binational Coordination to Provide an Integrated Law Enforcement Response", "paragraphs": ["DHS components also used joint operations as a means to integrate  federal border security efforts with northern border partners from state  and local governments, tribal nations, and Canada. The 9/11 Commission  stressed the importance of extensive collaboration with international  partners as well as increasing interaction between federal, state, and local  law enforcement through joint efforts that would combine intelligence,  manpower, and operations to address national security vulnerabilities.  Individually, partners had insufficient authority, staff, or assets to conduct  certain types of operations, according to Border Patrol officials in the  Detroit sector, and joint operations allowed partners to leverage these  resources to address existing border security vulnerabilities. For example,  to address vulnerabilities related to different law enforcement authority  across the border, the United States and Canada established binational  agreements that allowed USCG and RCMP law enforcement personnel  under the Shiprider Program to conduct joint vessel patrols in the Blaine  and Detroit sectors that leveraged both U.S. and Canadian authority across  the maritime border. To address vulnerabilities related to insufficient staff  and resources, DHS issued 3-year grants to tribal nations and state and  local governments under Operation Stonegarden to augment Border Patrol  personnel and resources for patrolling the land border, which benefited all  four sectors we visited. DHS components also developed joint operations  for conducting time-limited surge operations for interdiction or  investigations in the air, maritime, or land border environments, including  Operations Channel Watch, Outlook, and Frozen Timber.", "DHS tracked the resulting benefits of these joint operations in their after- action reports as reflected in table 3, and all officials from 20 offices who  participated in one or more of these operations across the four sectors we  visited agreed that joint operations made important contributions to  border security. These contributions included an enhanced ability under  Operation Outlook to detect cross-border illegal activity and to inform  future asset deployments in Spokane sector, a show of force under  Operation Channel Watch to deter illegal cross-border activity in Detroit  sector, and across all operations the arrest of smugglers and other  criminals crossing the border, or seizures of narcotics, cigarettes,  currency, and other contraband.", "Officials in 5 of the 20 offices raised concerns that, while surge operations  provided short-term benefits, they may not provide an ongoing deterrent  effect or address long-standing border security vulnerabilities. For  example, Border Patrol officials in the Spokane sector said that while  Operation Frozen Timber was a successful joint operation that resulted in  significant arrests and drug seizures, it was not an ongoing effort, and in  their opinion, should be expanded to a more comprehensive concept of  operations to combat and deter cross-border smuggling by air. Likewise,  ICE officials operating within the Detroit sector stated that Operation  Channel Watch demonstrated a show of force on the Great Lakes, but it  was not clear whether conducting this joint operation six weekends a year  would deter sophisticated criminal organizations. Despite these  concerns, after-action reports showed that these time-limited joint  operations had provided some lasting benefits. Operation Outlook, for  example, resulted in information about the continuous and significant  threat of cross-border smuggling in the air environment in the Spokane  sector, and pointed out weaknesses that could be corrected in the  placement and use of air and ground assets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Oversight of Interagency Forum Missions and Locations Could Help Ensure Efficient Coordination of Partner Resources", "paragraphs": ["Most northern border partners we interviewed across the four sectors  cited challenges to resourcing the increasing number of interagency  forums being established in their geographic area of responsibility.

ICE officials operating within the Swanton sector stated that there are  two IBETs in their area of responsibility, and while they only have  resources to staff the closest one to their office, they would like to staff  the IBET further away as it is close to a port of entry and has more law  enforcement partners that can further the ICE mission.", "Local law enforcement in the Swanton sector, Rouses Point Police  Department, reported that the high level of commitment required by  forums such as the IBET make it difficult for resource-strapped smaller  law enforcement agencies such as their own to participate.", "Officials from seven of the nine remaining offices without these concerns  included Border Patrol in the Blaine, Detroit, and Swanton sectors and  ICE operating within the Blaine sector, who said they had sufficient  resources, and local law enforcement in the Detroit sector who said they  would not assign staff to a forum unless it was the most efficient use of the  officer\u2019s time.

ICE headquarters officials stated that  although there are not distinct geographic boundaries of operation for the  IBET and BEST, ICE is addressing concerns of overlapping operations by  developing a strategic plan to lay out the concept of operations,  administrative policies and procedures, and the goals of the BEST. At the  time of our review, ICE had not yet established a time frame for  completion of these efforts as they are in early stages of drafting the plan.  In the meantime, however, officials in 7 of the 13 offices in these forums  located in the Blaine and Detroit sectors were concerned that some BEST  activities to investigate and interdict cross-border illegal activity at the  ports of entry duplicated IBET efforts to conduct these same activities  between the ports of entry.", "Border Patrol officials in the Blaine sector said that despite good  working relationships between the IBET and BEST, concerns remain  about overlapping cases because of the ability for cases at the ports of  entry to expand into areas between the ports of entry. Likewise, ICE  officials operating within the Blaine sector agreed that BEST  investigative activity between the ports of entry would be duplicative of  the IBET mission, but disagreed that such overlap had occurred.", "RCMP officials north of the Detroit sector reported that there is a  perception of duplication because the BEST in Detroit is expanding its  scope to include investigations between the ports of entry, which is the  domain of the IBET. ICE officials operating within the Detroit sector  said they disagreed with the assumption that a geographic dividing line  could be drawn in conducting investigations. Border Patrol and DEA  officials operating within the Detroit sector said that the reason for  establishing the BEST in their area was unclear. In addition, Border  Patrol officials stated that the IBET serves as their primary forum for  targeting cross-border crime.

These officials stated that headquarters  organizations, including the Management Directorate, the Office of Policy,  and the Office of Operations Coordination and Planning, are developing  processes to provide department-level coordination and oversight of those  forums; however, DHS has not provided documentation to support its  plans, thus the scope and the time frames for finalizing this effort are  unclear. Ongoing DHS oversight of the mission and location of interagency  forums established by its components could help prevent duplication of  efforts, and help ensure that DHS is a mindful steward in conserving the  scarce resources of northern border partners.

For example, Border Patrol officials in the Spokane sector  said that there was considerable improvement in their relationship with  ICE since the MOU was established in 2004, and attributed improved  coordination to sector leadership, open lines of communication, and  personal friendships between agents. ICE officials operating within the  Detroit sector said that their relationship with Border Patrol had matured,  and they generally worked well to support each other\u2019s mission.

For  example, ICE officials operating within the Detroit sector interpreted  the MOU as requiring Border Patrol to notify ICE of the contraband at  the arrest site to inform investigations.

Specifically, ICE officials operating within the Detroit, Spokane,  and Swanton sectors said they are reluctant to share intelligence  information with Border Patrol because they are concerned Border Patrol  may adversely affect an ICE investigation. Border Patrol officials in the  Detroit sector said that because they do not believe ICE shares  information with them, coordination with ICE is hindered. Additionally,  these Border Patrol officials stated that, from their perspective, the lack of  information sharing between the agencies resulted in inefficient border  security efforts. Similarly, the Border Patrol officials in the Blaine sector  reported that the lack of information sharing resulted in inefficiencies as  Border Patrol has used its resources to respond to potential cross-border  criminals who were ICE agents engaged in undercover investigations.", "These coordination problems between Border Patrol and ICE have been  long-standing and the subject of several studies and reports. We reported  in 2005 that the effectiveness of ICE\u2019s antismuggling strategy would  depend partly on the clarification of ICE and CBP roles in antismuggling  activities. In 2006, the Congressional Research Service reported, after  interviewing agents in Los Angeles and San Diego, that ICE and CBP had  problems with communications that compromised some smuggling  investigations. In both 2005 and 2007, the DHS Office of Inspector  General (OIG) reported on the coordination challenges between CBP and  ICE, including those challenges between Border Patrol and ICE\u2019s  Homeland Security Investigations. The 2005 report concluded that  shortfalls in operational coordination and information sharing had  fostered an environment of uncertainty and mistrust between CBP and  ICE personnel in the field, and instead of collegial interaction, field  officials reported competition, and at times, interference. In its 2007  update, the OIG reported improvement, but additional work was necessary  to address remaining challenges related to improving intelligence and  information sharing, strengthening performance measures, and addressing  ongoing relational issues.", "DHS took several actions in response to past findings, but our work for  this review showed that ongoing coordination challenges continue to exist  between DHS components. For example, CBP and ICE issued an  addendum to strengthen the MOU between CBP and ICE, and established  an ICE-CBP Coordination Council to ensure, among other things, that  component policies and procedures supported the roles and  responsibilities outlined in the MOU and were communicated and  implemented in the field. DHS concurred with its OIG\u2019s recommendation  to establish joint CBP-ICE bodies to oversee the implementation of the  MOU\u2019s provisions but did not establish such an oversight body, stating that  the establishment of the Coordination Council and other working groups  would coordinate interagency efforts. The Coordination Council has  since been disbanded, and the DHS officials from the Office of Intelligence  and Analysis and the Office of Operations Coordination and Planning were  unfamiliar with the council and could not provide an explanation for why  it was discontinued. DHS continues to lack an entity to oversee the  implementation of the MOU because the agency relies on CBP and ICE  leaders to hold the field accountable for implementation of established  agreements. Additionally, according to DHS\u2019s Office of Intelligence and  Analysis officials, components often leave coordination challenges for  field leadership to resolve without adequate guidance from headquarters.", "DHS component field officials, DHS headquarters officials, and the DHS  OIG acknowledged that there remains a disconnect between headquarters  policy and field implementation that may require DHS-level oversight to  correct.

ICE officials stated  this MOU creates a strain on ICE\u2019s relationships with Border Patrol and  DEA, and also causes confusion that can hinder investigations and create  inefficiencies. DEA headquarters officials disagreed that ICE is excluded  as ICE has access to mechanisms DEA uses to share information with law  enforcement partners, such as the Special Operations Division and the  Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force.", "ICE and DEA officials operating within three sectors also attributed the  ongoing coordination challenges between the agencies to overlapping  missions and competition for leading investigations, as both agencies have  a mission to disrupt and dismantle criminal organizations that smuggle  drugs as well as other contraband across the border. A DEA official  operating within the Swanton sector stated that mission overlap creates  too much competition for the same work, as well as receiving credit for  that work.

At this level, CBP states that  partnerships with other law enforcement agencies play an important role  in resolving the illegal entries. Our review of sector ORBBP documents for  fiscal year 2010 showed that for the northern border overall, about 1,007 of  the nearly 4,000 northern border miles had reached this definition of full  situational awareness, with 398 of these miles included in the four sectors  we visited.

The ORBBPs state the  importance of partnerships to border security, and list federal, state, local,  and international partners in the sector. However, partner resources that  were available to address border security gaps in each sector were not  identified despite DHS investment in these efforts. We previously reported  that federal agencies must identify ways to deliver results more efficiently  and in a way that is consistent with multiple demands and limited  resources. To do this, we reported that agencies should, in part, identify  the personnel, technology, and infrastructure resources available among  the collaborating agencies to help identify opportunities to address  different levels of resources by leveraging across partners, thus obtaining  benefits that would not be available if they were working separately.", "CBP officials acknowledged the need to link partnership results to border  security goals, but said that the methodologies for border security  assessments and resource requirements documented in the ORBBP were  designed to be Border Patrol\u2013centric. As such, the processes in place  reflect the extent that Border Patrol, exclusive of its partners, had  sufficient resources to detect, apprehend, and achieve an effective law  enforcement resolution. One reason these officials said that partner  contributions are excluded is that the ORBBP is used as a basis for sector  budget requests. Therefore, including partner resources could  disadvantage individual sectors, the Office of Border Patrol, and CBP in  the DHS resource allocation process. However, Border Patrol may still  benefit from identifying partner resources separately from their budget  requests so they have a better understanding of the resources available to  them to help secure the border.", "Another reason cited by officials for excluding partner resources is that  these partners are not under the control of Border Patrol, and therefore  cannot be relied upon to sustain the border security mission. As such,  Border Patrol requires a set of resources that are not at risk of being  deployed away from the border if partners have a higher priority or  competing mission.

In regard to  our first recommendation, DHS stated that the structure of the department  precludes using a single headquarters organization to provide DHS-level  guidance and oversight for interagency forums established by its  components.  Instead, DHS said it will review the inventory of interagency  forums through its strategic and operational planning efforts to assess  efficiency and identify challenges consistent with the forthcoming DHS  Northern Border Strategy that will better integrate, coordinate, and  achieve northern border management missions.  Within the context of  these higher-level efforts and any subsequent tactical or operational  assessments or planning, we encourage DHS to provide the guidance and  oversight necessary to ensure that missions and locations of these forums  are not duplicative and consider the downstream burden on northern  border partners.", "In regard to our second recommendation that DHS provide oversight of  Border Patrol and ICE compliance with the MOU, DHS stated that it will  recommend that the ICE-CBP Coordination Council be resumed, and that  proper use of the Coordination Council would enable the recommended  DHS-level body to review and evaluate both Border Patrol and ICE  compliance with the MOU.  We note that in the past, the Coordination  Council was unable to improve upon the long-standing coordination  challenges between Border Patrol and ICE.  Thus, to be effective, a  resumed Coordination Council may require changes to its previous  structure, although determining what those changes should be was beyond  the scope of this study.  Nevertheless, we encourage DHS headquarters to  actively work with the Coordination Council and provide the oversight  necessary to address the MOU compliance issues identified in our report.", "Finally, DHS stated that our third recommendation to develop policy and  guidance to identify, assess, and integrate partner resources in northern  border security assessments and resource planning would be resolved  through formulation of new policy and guidance resulting from three  foundational documents to be issued later this year; namely, the  departmentwide strategy for the northern border, the Northern Border  Strategy Implementation Plan, and the Shared Vision for Perimeter  Security and Competitiveness between the United States and Canada.  We  encourage DHS to ensure that within the context of these higher-level  strategic efforts and any subsequent tactical or operational assessments or  planning, CBP provide consistent policy and guidance on integrating  partner resources to help ensure that DHS is maximizing the benefits of its  coordination efforts.", "In commenting on our draft report, USDA agreed with our  recommendations and stated that it will continue to work closely with  DHS to support northern border efforts and take the actions necessary to  make certain personnel at all levels of the agency implement provisions of  the interagency MOU.", "DOD, DOI, and DOJ did not have formal comments on our draft report.
