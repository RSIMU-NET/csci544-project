The United States is a member of IAEA and financially contributes to the agency\u2019s technical cooperation program. Through its technical cooperation program, IAEA is providing nuclear technical assistance to Cuba in 10 program areas, including general atomic energy development, the application of isotopes and radiation in agriculture, and nuclear safety. Some of this assistance is for Cuba\u2019s partially constructed nuclear power reactors.", "In 1983, Cuba started to construct two Soviet-designed 440-megawatt pressurized water reactors (known as the VVER 440 model) at Juragua near Cienfuegos on the south central coast of Cuba, about 180 miles south of Key West, Florida. The construction of these reactors was suspended in 1992 until financing should become available to complete them. The President of Cuba, in a January 1997 public statement, announced the indefinite postponement of the reactor program due to a lack of financial resources. In February 1997, we met with the Vice Minister, Ministry of the Russian Federation for Atomic Energy, who told us that Russia intends to resume the construction of Cuba\u2019s reactors in 1998 with financing provided by an international consortium of countries, including Russia. The United States opposes the completion of these reactors and discourages other countries from providing assistance, except for safety purposes, to Cuba\u2019s nuclear program.", "As requested, this report provides information on (1) the dollar value and type of all nuclear technical assistance projects IAEA provided for Cuba, (2) the sources of funding for all nuclear technical assistance projects IAEA provided for Cuba, and (3) IAEA\u2019s nuclear technical assistance projects for the Cuban nuclear power reactors and U.S. officials\u2019 views on this assistance."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["IAEA\u2019s technical cooperation program provides nuclear technical assistance through projects that have three main components\u2014equipment, expert services, and training activities (project- and non-project-related), including fellowships, scientific visits, and training courses\u2014that support the upgrading or establishment, for peaceful purposes, of nuclear techniques and facilities in IAEA member states.

IAEA has approved an additional $1.7 million in nuclear technical assistance projects for Cuba for 1997 through 1999. Over half of this additional assistance will be provided for the application of isotopes and radiation in medicine, industry, and hydrology.", "In addition to the approximately $12 million for nuclear technical assistance projects for Cuba, IAEA spent $2.39 million on regional and interregional training courses for Cuban nationals. These courses were not related to IAEA\u2019s nuclear technical assistance projects. (This information was available from IAEA only for 1980 through 1996.) Cuban nationals attended IAEA training courses in radiation protection and nuclear safety, probabilistic safety assessment, safety analysis and assessment techniques for the operational safety of nuclear power plants, and quality assurance for nuclear power plants. In addition, IAEA spent about $433,000 on research contracts for Cuba. (This information was available from IAEA only for 1989 through 1996.)

Other sources of financial support include extrabudgetary income, which is in addition to the funds donated to the technical cooperation fund and is contributed by member states for specific projects, and assistance-in-kind, which is provided by member states that donate equipment, provide expert services, or arrange fellowships on a cost-free basis.", "As shown in figure 2, IAEA\u2019s technical cooperation fund was the primary source of funding for the nuclear technical assistance projects provided for Cuba, for equipment, expert services, fellowships, scientific visits, and subcontracts.", "In 1996, the United States voluntarily contributed $36 million to IAEA. Of this amount, the United States contributed over $16 million\u2014about 30 percent\u2014of the total $53 million in the technical cooperation fund. (Cuba contributed its share of $45,150\u2014or 0.07 percent\u2014to the fund in 1996.)From 1981 through 1993, the United States was required, under section 307(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, to withhold a proportionate share of its voluntary contribution to the technical cooperation fund for Cuba, Libya, Iran, and the Palestine Liberation Organization because the fund provided assistance to these entities. The United States withheld about 25 percent of its voluntary contribution to the fund, which otherwise would have helped to fund projects for Cuba and the other proscribed entities. On April 30, 1994, the Foreign Assistance Act was amended, and Burma, Iraq, North Korea, and Syria were added to the list of entities from which U.S. funds for certain programs sponsored by international organizations were withheld. At the same time, IAEA and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) were exempted from the withholding requirement. Consequently, as of 1994, the United States was no longer required to withhold a portion of its voluntary contribution to IAEA\u2019s technical cooperation fund for any of these entities, including Cuba. However, State Department officials continued to withhold funds in 1994 and 1995. But beginning in 1996, the United States no longer withheld any of its voluntary contribution to the fund for these entities, including Cuba.

Seven reports were prepared by IAEA experts under this project that discuss the power plant\u2019s ability to cope with a nuclear accident. Our requests to review or to be provided with copies of these reports were denied by IAEA because information obtained by the agency under a technical cooperation project is regarded as belonging to the country receiving the project and cannot be divulged by IAEA without the formal consent of the country\u2019s government.

IAEA has spent about $31,000 of the about $74,000 approved for the project. Furthermore, according to IAEA\u2019s information on the technical cooperation program for 1995 to 1996, this project will develop and implement an adequate training program that will improve operational safety at all nuclear installations in Cuba and will promote a safety culture.", "For the 1997 to 1998 technical cooperation program, IAEA has approved two new projects to assist in licensing the reactors and establishing a quality assurance program for them. Funding of about $210,000 has been approved for these two projects.

In a statement made at the August 1995 hearing, the State Department\u2019s Director of the Office of Nuclear Energy Affairs agreed that the United States supported efforts by IAEA to improve safety and the quality of construction at the facility but that the administration strongly believed that sales or assistance to the Cuban nuclear program should not be provided until Cuba had undertaken a legally binding nonproliferation commitment. Cuba is not a party to the 1970 Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, but as a member of IAEA, it is entitled to receive nuclear technical assistance from the agency.", "State Department officials responsible for IAEA\u2019s technical cooperation program and U.S. Mission officials at the United Nations System Organizations in Vienna, Austria, told us that they did not object to IAEA\u2019s providing nuclear safety assistance to Cuba\u2019s reactors because the United States generally supports nuclear safety assistance for IAEA member states that will promote the establishment of a safety culture and quality assurance programs.
