Specifically, the Millennial generation (those born between 1982 and 2000) might not have the same opportunity as previous generations had to fare better economically than their parents. According to studies GAO reviewed, the share of people making more money than their parents at the same age (absolute mobility) has declined over the last 40 years, and the chances of moving up the income distribution (relative mobility) have been flat over time. Using a third measure of economic mobility (intergenerational income elasticity), researchers have found that income in adulthood is linked to how much a person's parents made, and that between one-third and two-thirds of economic status is passed down from parents to children. This is especially true of the lowest and highest income groups. Researchers also identified race and geography as key determinants of an individual's economic mobility.", "Millennials have different financial circumstances than Generation X (born 1965-1981) and Baby Boomers (born 1946-1964), and in light of flat or declining economic mobility, there is uncertainty about how they will fare financially as they age. A snapshot of data that allowed GAO to compare Millennials aged 25-34 to the previous two generations at similar ages showed that Millennial households were more likely than other generations to be college educated; however, incomes have remained flat across the three generations, implying that Millennials have not yet benefited from the potential additional lifetime income earned by college graduates. Millennial households had significantly lower median and average net worth than Generation X households at similar ages (see figure), especially among those with low net worth. Median net worth for the lowest quartile of Baby Boomers and Generation X was around zero, but it was substantially negative for Millennials, indicating that debt was greater than assets for the median low net worth Millennial household. Regarding assets, a significantly lower percentage of Millennials owned homes compared to previous generations at similar ages, but had retirement resources at rates comparable to Generation X and Baby Boomers. Finally, Millennials were more likely to have student loan debt that exceeded their annual income. It remains to be seen how these factors will affect Millennials' financial circumstances in the long run, including retirement."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The idea that individuals should have the opportunity to advance  economically beyond the circumstances of their birth is a familiar element  of the American Dream.

Assets could also be nonfinancial, including the value of  houses or vehicles. Households could have financial resources outside of  net worth, including future income from defined benefit (DB) retirement  plans or Social Security; however, we did not attempt to estimate the  future value of these financial resources in our net worth calculation given  the long time horizon to retirement for young Millennials.

For example, according to one estimate, there was an 8 percent  chance that a person born in the United States from 1980-1982 to  parents in the bottom 20 percent of the income distribution would  move to the top 20 percent of the income distribution for their birth  cohort by the time he or she was approximately 30 years old.", "Intergenerational income elasticity (IGE) - the strength of the  relationship between a person\u2019s income and their parents\u2019 income.", "The higher the number, between zero and one, the greater the  relationship between parental income and children\u2019s adult income  (see fig. 2).

One study found that areas  within the United States offer disparate opportunities, with some  localities supporting higher rates of economic mobility than others  (see fig. 5). In particular, counties in the southeastern United States  were found to have lower levels of economic mobility than counties in  the rural Midwest. Another study found that a child\u2019s neighborhood  has a statistically significant effect on life chances, and that growing  up in a low-income, metropolitan neighborhood has a strong negative  effect on future earnings. Conversely, growing up in an affluent  neighborhood can have almost as large an impact on future earnings  as completing a bachelor\u2019s degree.", "Specific neighborhood characteristics drive differing rates of  economic mobility. Several researchers linked economic mobility to  certain area and neighborhood characteristics, including rates of  poverty, racial segregation, economic inequality, the proportion of  single-parent households, and school quality. Researchers identified  racial segregation as a neighborhood characteristic broadly  associated with lower mobility. One study found that economic  segregation is also negatively associated with economic mobility.  One study identified three neighborhood characteristics that are  correlated with a weaker relationship between race and mobility: low  poverty rates, a high percentage of low-income black fathers present,  and low levels of racial bias among whites. According to this study,  neighborhoods with these characteristics had higher mobility for black  boys and a relatively small black-white mobility gap.", "The effects of geography on future earnings vary by race,  socioeconomic status, and gender. The effects of race and  neighborhood characteristics on economic mobility are related and  hard to disentangle. For example, one study found that black boys  have lower incomes in adulthood than white boys who grow up in the  same neighborhood in 99 percent of Census tracts, even when  accounting for income. This highlights the effect of race on  economic mobility when children face the same neighborhood  conditions. Conversely, the same study also found that 4.2 percent of  black children grow up in neighborhoods with the characteristics  associated with higher levels of mobility, compared to 62.5 percent of  white children.

Another study notes that Hispanic and black children tend to live in  neighborhoods with low mobility for those of their racial group,  whereas white children tend to live in neighborhoods with higher  mobility rates for whites.", "Neighborhood effects can also vary by socioeconomic status and gender.  Regarding socioeconomic status, one study found that place may matter  less for children from higher-income families, as they may be better able  to insulate themselves from the effects of local conditions (e.g., by  switching to private schools if public schools are weak.)

Moreover, the studies that examined  drivers of mobility found that a child\u2019s race and neighborhood have a  significant effect on their economic mobility as adults.

Home equity has  historically been an important source of retirement security as people  age. It is unclear whether Millennial households will reach similar  rates of homeownership as previous generations, but it is possible  they may be more likely to buy homes at older ages compared to  previous generations.", "Millennials were as likely to have retirement resources as  previous generations.

Estimates  of intergenerational income mobility can be affected by choices the  researcher makes, such as selecting a price deflator to inflation-adjust  parents\u2019 incomes; selecting the ages at which children and parents  will be compared, accounting for changing trends in household size  and composition; determining the value of non-cash benefits (e.g.,  employer-sponsored health insurance); and determining work-related  costs associated with dual-earner households (e.g., child care). Some  studies impute earnings for non-tax filers, and different methods of  imputation may lead to slightly different results; in other studies, those  with no reported income or observations with other missing variables  (e.g., demographic characteristics) may simply be dropped from the  dataset. How \u201cparent\u201d and \u201cchild\u201d are defined may also differ across  datasets (e.g., a parent could be the first adult to claim a child on their  tax return, or could be an adult male living with a minor child in a  household). Additionally, some studies required the researchers to  construct datasets that matched parents and children at different  points in time. Each researcher makes choices about how to handle  the data, which can lead to different estimates. While we did not  perform checks on these constructed data, the studies in our review  generally included descriptions of the data and methodologies used  as well as the difficulties and limitations associated with dataset  construction, which we evaluated in our technical review.", "Differences in Choice of Economic Mobility Measure and Model  Specification. Each measure of economic mobility provides a slightly  different lens on mobility and has different interpretations. Absolute  economic mobility, which compares the inflation-adjusted income of  parents and children at similar ages, tends to reflect trends in overall  economic growth and distribution of that growth. For instance, 92  percent of 30-year-olds in 1970 made more in inflation adjusted terms  than their parents did at that age, while about half of children born in  the 1980\u2019s grew up to make more money than their parents by age  30. The difference may largely have been due to higher economic  growth and a more equitable distribution of that growth along the  income distribution from 1940-1970, whereas growth was slower and  distributed differently between 1970 and the present. IGE offers a  different metric with different limitations. Studies that estimate IGE  regress log child income on log parent income. This conveniently  yields a coefficient that can be interpreted as \u201cthe percent change in  child income given a 1 percent change in parent income.\u201d However,  such estimates tend to be unstable because the relationship is non- linear and sensitive to the treatment of children with zero or very small  incomes (because the log of zero is mathematically undefined). IGE is  very sensitive to assumptions about the income of those with missing  income data and typically does not include households with zero  earnings, and so excludes some households with no income.  Additionally, elasticities are sensitive to changes in cross-sectional  income distributions (like during recessions). If children\u2019s income  distribution becomes more unequal, then the elasticity will become  larger, all else equal.", "Despite these limitations, based on our technical review, all of the studies  summarized in the report are of sufficient methodological rigor for the  purpose of providing information on economic mobility. The authors of the  studies we reviewed were generally aware of and transparent regarding  the limitations of the datasets they worked with, and carried out analyses  to test their results for robustness to different assumptions.", "Although there were differences in study datasets and methodologies,  common themes emerge from the body of literature we reviewed. For  example:", "None of the studies we reviewed found economic mobility to be  increasing\u2014all found it to be either flat or declining.", "While there was variation among studies regarding the exact degree  to which parental income influences individuals\u2019 income as adults, all  studies we reviewed that examined parental income found it to be an  important determinant of economic mobility.", "None of the studies that examined race found blacks to have higher  mobility than whites.", "The studies we reviewed that examine geography agree that different  locations have different economic mobility and that part of this  variation is connected to the characteristics of a given place (such as  school quality or level of segregation), not just to the characteristics of  people who choose to live there.", "In other words, while the studies varied in their point estimates of various  measures of economic mobility and its determinants, there was broad  consensus among the studies regarding the sign (positive versus  negative) and interpretation of the estimates. Additionally, these studies  represent an advance in the data and analysis capabilities relative to past  studies that examined economic mobility, largely because improved  computing power has enabled more complex analyses of large datasets  comprised of millions of records.

The SCF is a triennial survey of U.S. households sponsored by the  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in cooperation with  the Department of the Treasury. Every 3 years, the SCF interviews a  different sample of households and aims to be representative of  households across economic strata, including the top of the wealth  distribution. The SCF provides information on household balance sheets,  including detailed information on assets and debts, as well as pensions,  labor force participation, and demographic characteristics at the time of  interview. We compared the financial circumstances of young households  across 3 years of the SCF, as each year was representative of a  generation (or birth cohort) when someone in the household (either the  head of household or a spouse or partner) was 25-34 years old, following  similar previous GAO work."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Data Limitations", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of SCF data allowed us to make intergenerational  comparisons, but not to follow the same individuals over time, so we were  not be able to compare children to their parents using these data. While  our analysis allowed us to make comparisons, it did not allow us to make  statements as to why Millennials are different or similar to other  generations. Moreover, our data analysis focused on relatively older  Millennials whose experiences may be different than those born later in  the generation, especially due to the timing of the Great Recession. The  SCF dataset is based on self-reported data and as a result, the data are  subject to nonsampling error, including the ability to get information about  all sample cases; difficulties of definition; differences in the interpretation  of questions; and errors made in collecting, recording, coding, and  processing data. Also, demographic analyses using these data may be  limited based on the sample size needed to produce reliable estimates.  Lastly, we cannot make predictions about the future financial  circumstances of Millennials based on this snapshot in time.", "There are also limitations with the SCF with respect to making  comparisons by gender. In a household headed by a single person, the  head is taken to be the single core individual. However, in households  headed by a central couple who is of mixed sex, the head is taken to be  the male in the household. This assumption makes it difficult to make  reliable comparisons by gender. Finally, the SCF generally asks  questions of household heads and their spouses (and not others living in  the household), so it likely underemphasizes young adults who were still  living with their parents, which is more prevalent for the Millennial  generation. Thus, there may be some selection bias in the SCF with  respect to relatively more financially well-off Millennials.", "For the data used in our analysis, we reviewed documentation and tested  the data for anomalies.

The components of income  are wages, self-employment and business income, taxable and tax- exempt interest, dividends, realized capital gains, benefits from social  safety net programs, pensions and withdrawals from retirement  accounts, Social Security, alimony and other support payments, and  miscellaneous sources of income for all members of the primary  economic unit in the household.", "We defined household net worth as assets minus debt.

Debt includes mortgages, home equity loans,  credit card balances, education loans, vehicle loans, other installment  loans, and other debt, including loans against pensions or life  insurance. Households could have financial resources outside of net  worth, including future income from defined benefit plans or Social  Security; however, we did not attempt to estimate the actuarial  present value of these financial resources in our net worth calculation  given the long time horizon to retirement and the amount of  uncertainty associated with such a measurement. In addition, in our  professional judgment, the inclusion of these financial resources  would not have altered our finding that Millennials have lower net  worth compared to previous generations; the inclusion of these  financial resources would likely have widened the gap further between  Millennials and previous generations because previous generations  had greater access to DB plans than the Millennial generation.", "We estimated means and medians for variables of interest, both overall  and by quartile.
