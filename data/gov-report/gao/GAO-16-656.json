In 2013, HUD initiated a modernization program called New Core, which involved migrating financial management capabilities to a federal shared service provider, with expected benefits to include reducing legacy systems costs, improving the data, and resolving weaknesses in its financial management systems. After spending about $58 million over 3 years, HUD decided to end New Core development in April 2016.", "Congress included a provision for GAO to review the New Core program. This review (1) determined the financial management systems capabilities implemented through New Core and (2) evaluated HUD's implementation of key IT management practices applied to the program.

The implemented capabilities were for managing employee travel and relocation; recording time and attendance; performing core accounting functions such as general ledger accounting, producing financial reports, and processing salaries and expenses transactions; and managing procurements. As a result, the department reported that it fully replaced 4 systems, gained access to 7 shared service solutions, streamlined administrative services, and added efficiencies to the processing of financial management functions. For example, the systems used for core accounting and procurement were integrated to support the timely recording of commitments and obligations. However, while the 4 capabilities were transitioned as scheduled, none fully met the department's requirements or expectations. For instance, the department continues to execute programmatic transactions using costly and inefficient legacy systems that were expected to be replaced with New Core. HUD has begun other initiatives to deliver financial management systems capabilities and replace legacy systems that were not addressed under New Core. Detailed plans for these efforts are in development.", "HUD's efforts to implement planned capabilities for New Core demonstrated weaknesses in the department's information technology (IT) management and governance practices. Key management practices include fully defining what a program is intended to accomplish; developing the program scope, schedule, and costs; and managing requirements. However, HUD's management of New Core had weaknesses in these areas. For example, the department did not:", "outline operations for all planned capabilities or create a roadmap for transitioning to the desired modernized environment;", "create comprehensive scope, schedule, and cost documentation; and", "manage requirements to ensure they were fully documented and traceable from business needs to system implementation.", "Effective governance and executive-level oversight also help ensure programs achieve expected results. Specifically, establishing governance control reviews and providing oversight through, among other things, sustained leadership and coordination among stakeholders can strengthen modernization efforts. However, during the effort to implement New Core, HUD's IT governance and oversight were not fully effective. For example, governance reviews did not raise concerns or require improvement plans for management weaknesses identified, such as the lack of a schedule with a valid critical path. Moreover, executive-level oversight did not ensure effective coordination among stakeholders.", "With any further pursuit of new initiatives to modernize its financial management systems, it is critical that the department consistently apply key IT management practices and effective governance to ensure it does not jeopardize the success of these efforts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that HUD address weaknesses in key IT management practices for future financial systems modernization efforts and take action to improve its governance and strengthen investment oversight.

Notwithstanding the  systems that have been modernized, HUD and its Office of Inspector  General reported in November 2015 that the department\u2019s IT systems  have not been sufficient to effectively support financial management  needs. The department attributed this condition to the fact that its  financial management systems employ antiquated technology,  necessitate manual workarounds, are costly to maintain, and are not fully  compliant with federal requirements.

Approximately 60 percent of HUD\u2019s financial  management systems were deployed before the year 2001. These  systems are increasingly at risk of failure due to aging technology and  reliance on applications that are no longer supported by vendors. This  limits the department\u2019s ability to deploy updates or make adjustments  to ensure the systems support mission needs. For example, the HUD  Centralized Accounting and Program System (HUDCAPS) supports  the processing of financial data for one of the department\u2019s largest  programs, but it relies on outdated technology. In March 2016, HUD\u2019s  Inspector General stated that, as the volume and complexity of the  department\u2019s work continues to grow, it becomes increasingly difficult  to respond to market conditions using legacy systems that are 15 to  30 years old.", "Manual processes. A number of HUD\u2019s financial management  functions require manual processing due to gaps in the functionality  offered by its legacy systems.

HUD had a  requirement for a bi-directional interface between ARC\u2019s travel and  core accounting system that would provide real-time automated funds  control. The requirement was based on the department\u2019s need to  ensure that budgetary resources were available for immediate travel  in the event of an emergency. This interface was not part of ARC\u2019s  standard solution and, therefore, instead of a system performing an  automated check of the availability of travel funds, HUD adopted  ARC\u2019s standard business process to perform a manual check to  ensure funds availability prior to approving travel requests. According  to ARC officials, a technical solution that is intended to provide this  functionality is scheduled for implementation in January 2017.", "Time and attendance.

Notwithstanding the delay, HUD  officials noted that employees can access up-to-date data via the  reporting tool implemented and emphasized that the shared service  provider\u2019s core accounting system includes controls that decrease the  risk of funds being obligated when they are not available.", "ARC\u2019s system and services also execute transaction processing to  the general ledger for HUD\u2019s salaries and expenses funds. This  includes making payments to vendors and federal employees,  generating bills, and collecting payments. However, HUD is not yet  using ARC\u2019s shared services for executing transaction processing for  its program funds, as originally expected. This is particularly  significant because HUD directed 96.8 percent of its total gross  discretionary budget authority toward its programs during fiscal year  2015. As a result, the department continues to execute programmatic  transactions using costly and inefficient legacy systems. In June 2016,  senior HUD officials, including the Deputy CFO and CIO, stated that  the decision to not migrate transaction processing for program funds  to ARC was made due to the lack of fully defined requirements and a  shift in the department\u2019s priorities.", "Further, the reporting tool associated with ARC\u2019s core accounting  system has yet to produce detailed status of funds reports, which are  critical to HUD\u2019s understanding of the current amount of available IT  funds at any given time.

As a result, HUD employees spend at least 2 days  manually creating a report that meets their needs\u2014a product that the  department\u2019s legacy reporting tool had produced on-demand\u2014by  consolidating, manipulating, and verifying in spreadsheets data that  are taken from ARC\u2019s core accounting system as well as the  department\u2019s legacy systems. According to New Core officials, this  report must be manually created because HUD decided not to migrate  relevant historical data to ARC\u2019s system or include the accounting  fields needed to produce an automated version of the report. Senior  department officials stated that they are revisiting these decisions and  may implement changes in fiscal year 2017.", "Procurement. On October 1, 2015, HUD employees were provided  access to ARC\u2019s procurement system for activities including contract  writing and procurement tracking; electronic routing, review, and  approval of invoices; and the reporting of procurement data to a  federal procurement data system. The department also gained  access to a system for reconciliation and approval of purchase card  transactions, and to a government-wide invoice processing platform of  approved federal government suppliers. A notable feature of ARC\u2019s  procurement system is that it is integrated with the core accounting  system to provide real-time contract processing, which is intended to  support the timely recording of commitments and obligations and  prevent the department from creating contract obligations when  funding is not available. The migration to ARC\u2019s invoice processing  platform also allowed the department to adopt new controls and a new  electronic payment process for managing contracts and payments to  commercial vendors. In addition, the department shifted to ARC- managed processes for purchase cards, including issuing cards to  HUD employees, and to an electronic process for receiving,  approving, and paying invoices.", "Nevertheless, the features of ARC\u2019s procurement system did not offer  all of the features that existed in the department\u2019s legacy system; and  to fill these gaps, employees devised and adopted manual processes.  For example, HUD agreed to adopt ARC\u2019s standard procurement  system with the understanding that a requirement for processing  contracts that are funded by more than one entity within the  department would not be met. This agreement was made because  of the costly and lengthy system enhancement that would be needed  to add the feature.", "To address the requirement, the department adopted ARC\u2019s standard  business process change that, according to HUD and ARC officials,  has increased the level of effort and complexity of creating and  managing these contracts. Moreover, challenges with converting data  from HUD\u2019s legacy procurement system to ARC\u2019s system were  encountered. These challenges continue to adversely impact the  department\u2019s ability to process and manage contracts. Between  October 2015 and January 2016, HUD users of ARC\u2019s procurement  system reported instances in which data were missing or inaccurate.", "According to senior officials, this required procurement actions to be  processed manually outside of the system and then entered into the  system after data issues were resolved. In June 2016, HUD officials  reported that, although progress had been made toward resolving  these issues, additional work is needed to ensure that contract data  are correct.", "On November 4, 2015, HUD\u2019s Deputy Secretary stated that the  department would not develop additional capabilities as part of the New  Core program. According to the New Core Executive Director, this  decision allowed the department to refocus its efforts on evaluating  options and identifying the optimal solution for modernizing its approach  to grants management. The department\u2019s decision to end further  implementation of the program was made prior to, but was consistent  with, a December 2015 directive to have no other New Core releases in  fiscal year 2016. After spending at least $58 million over a period of 3  years, in April 2016 the department officially completed development  close-out activities for the New Core program.", "Although HUD ended further implementation of the New Core program  before all of the planned capabilities were implemented, HUD officials,  including the Deputy Secretary, stated that the migration to a shared  service provider allowed the department to streamline administrative  services, promote innovation, and gain efficiencies by transitioning  responsibilities to ARC. According to a June 20, 2016, memorandum,  HUD\u2019s Deputy CFO reported that the migration also resulted in  improved internal controls, such as real-time checks with the  documents in the procurement system for recording commitments and  obligations;  increased discipline in financial activities, including the use of  delegated authority for purchases;  improved compliance with laws and regulations; better data quality due to ARC\u2019s core accounting system ensuring that  budget funds control balances are the same as balances in the  general ledger;  strengthened funds-control process because of, among other things,  improvements in the accuracy of payroll costs and improved  procedures for accounts receivable; and  increased confidence in controls and configurations employed on  systems used for purchase cards, processing invoice payments,  procurement management, and employee time and attendance.", "HUD officials, including the Deputy Secretary, also stated that other new  initiatives were under way to deliver financial management systems  capabilities and replace legacy systems that were not addressed under  New Core. In this regard, the department is seeking $12 million for fiscal  year 2017 to support planning, design, and development activities for two  efforts referred to as the Voucher Management System/HUDCAPS  Decommissioning and the Enterprise Data Warehouse initiatives. Initial  documentation for these initiatives discusses delivering 5 of the remaining  10 planned New Core capabilities\u2014data warehousing, grant accounting,  grant and loan management, loan accounting, and Public and Indian  Housing Section 8 accounting.", "Related briefings and other early planning documents call for these two  initiatives to result in the replacement of the department\u2019s legacy financial  reporting system\u2014known as the Financial Data Mart\u2014as well as  HUDCAPS, the Line of Credit Control System, New Core Interface  Solution, and the Program Accounting System. Specifically, the  department expects to replace and decommission the New Core Interface  Solution by June 2017 and to begin activities that would enable the  decommissioning of the remaining systems by the end of fiscal year  2018. These documents also acknowledge the need for HUD to re- engage with ARC to ensure that its core accounting system will enable  the processing of transactions for HUD\u2019s program funds. According to  ARC officials, including the Director for the Office of Shared Services,  doing so would require a new interagency agreement and additional  implementation costs. As of June 2016, the department was still working  on developing detailed plans for these two initiatives.", "Further, in commenting on a draft copy of this report in July 2016, HUD  provided updated information regarding the status of the other 5  capabilities that would not be addressed through new initiatives.  Specifically, the department stated that the capability for budget  formulation would be met through existing systems, with improvements to  be considered at a future date. The department also stated that it would  no longer pursue modernization for the Housing/Federal Housing  Administration accounting, Ginnie Mae accounting, managerial cost  accounting, and property management capabilities. In regard to  Housing/Federal Housing Administration accounting and Ginnie Mae  accounting, the department said it had re-evaluated its legacy systems  and concluded that modernized capabilities were not required. For  managerial cost accounting, the department reported that it would be  focusing on enhancing processes and procedures instead of  implementing the capability originally planned. Additionally, HUD stated  that the implementation of the Federal Asset Management Enterprise  System in 2016 had met its needs for the property management  capability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementation of New Core Demonstrated Weaknesses in HUD\u2019s IT Management and Governance", "paragraphs": ["Our experience with IT-related programs has shown that disciplined  management practices can help agencies plan, manage, and oversee  modernization efforts.

Management practices including program definition, planning, and  requirements had deficiencies that were consistent with those we have  identified for other departmental modernization efforts. For instance,  HUD did not fully define the program, inadequately planned for the  program\u2019s cost and schedule, and did not effectively manage  requirements\u2014practices that in 2013 we recommended the department  improve. We also identified limitations in the department\u2019s governance  and executive oversight of the program.

Typically, developing the future  operating state helps to provide a high-level description of the IT systems,  describe the operations that must be performed and who must perform  them, and explain where and how the operations are to be carried out.  We have also previously reported on the benefits of developing the  concept for future operations. Fully defining a program also involves  creating a roadmap that can help justify continuing investments in  modernization efforts. An effective program roadmap consists of, among  other things, a graphic depiction of the program\u2019s intended future state, a  high-level view of milestones, and dependencies that help identify the  chronology for work, as well as reveal or explain gaps.", "HUD policy and guidance call for programs to develop a concept of  operations to provide a mechanism for users to describe their  expectations of the solution and recommend that one be developed for  modernization efforts that are of high mission criticality or cost to the  department. Further, the department\u2019s guidance states that when  implementing a program that contains multiple projects (i.e., phases or  releases), a concept of operations is expected to be produced at the  program level to show how the entire system and its parts would operate.", "To implement New Core financial management systems capabilities,  HUD developed planning documents for a series of specific activities  including an implementation plan, which partially described the IT  systems at a high level. For example, the plan documented the scope of  systems affected by the first three planned releases and also explained  that, in addition to implementing the shared services provider\u2019s solutions,  HUD planned to develop the New Core Interface Solution to crosswalk  budget and general ledger data between HUDCAPS and ARC\u2019s core  accounting system. For understanding operations at a high level through  the first three releases, the department relied upon documentation  outlining standard operations for customers using ARC\u2019s services and  systems. The New Core program also mapped out how the  department\u2019s processes would need to be altered to align with the  standard shared service processes.", "HUD also took action in late September 2015 to develop standard  operating procedures focused on the core accounting and procurement  capabilities provided through the shared service provider\u2019s systems and  services. For instance, the program developed transitional standard  operating procedures for budget execution, transition mission support,  and payroll review and correction. The procedures outlined, for example,  how budget staff in the Office of the CFO and program offices would  submit templates via e-mail to the shared service provider\u2019s employees,  who would set up the initial budget and allocate it to specific activities and  programs. The procedures described how HUD employees could verify  that ARC had processed payroll corrections accurately. In addition, the  department partially developed a program roadmap for New Core  consisting of delivery dates for the first three releases and a graphic of  the future modernized IT systems planned through fiscal year 2017. In  particular, the roadmap outlined that HUDCAPS and the Program  Accounting System would be replaced by shared service systems as a  result of implementing the planned capabilities.", "Although these planning documents and activities assisted with the  operations related to transitioning to ARC\u2019s services and systems,  documentation that outlined future operations for all of the planned New  Core capabilities was not developed. For the documentation that was  developed, it was limited because it did not clearly describe, from a HUD  user\u2019s perspective, the users\u2019 needs and what operations must be  performed, who must perform them, and whether shared service solutions  and/or HUD systems would be used to carry out the operations. For  instance, while the department developed training materials and job aids  prior to the delivery dates, processes and tasks had not been fully  determined for the operational changes needed for 54 identified user  roles. Similarly, while the department began developing standard  operating procedures during the summer of 2015, the procedures were  narrow in scope and focused on implementing daily operations to align  with ARC\u2019s processes\u2014instead of providing a comprehensive overview of  the operations users would perform. In addition, the department  acknowledged that activities to align procedures to positions was  incomplete and identified additional procedures that need to be  developed after implementation that were not originally part of New Core  plans.", "The partial roadmap that HUD developed also did not fully depict a  comprehensive view of the planned modernized environment and it did  not outline future dates for delivering the remaining 10 planned  capabilities. For instance, the roadmap did not account for when or how  the department would replace other systems identified to be replaced with  the program and fell short of clearly outlining what needed to occur to  achieve expected benefits such as reducing the costs of legacy systems.  Moreover, New Core program documentation did not provide information  regarding dependencies among the 14 capabilities or the priority or  chronological order in which the capabilities needed to be implemented.  Establishing dependencies would have allowed for HUD to identify and  understand gaps in planning or optimize the sequencing of the planned  capabilities during implementation.", "In June 2016, HUD officials, including the New Core program Executive  Director, acknowledged that the department had focused on planning  activities for the first three releases associated with migrating to ARC\u2019s  shared service solutions and did not fully define the program up front  because they were taking an iterative approach to planning for future  releases. The Deputy Director also noted that HUD\u2019s lack of maturity in  effectively planning the level of effort needed to implement all of the  intended capabilities was among the reasons the department did not  develop a comprehensive concept of operations. ARC Officials, including  the Director for the Office of Shared Services, further explained that the  time required to complete the work needed was underestimated due to  the challenges and resource constraints encountered. In commenting on  our draft report, HUD officials acknowledged that they had relied on an  OMB definition of a concept of operations from the early 1990s. In doing  so, the department determined it was better to leverage ARC\u2019s  documentation that described the system from a user\u2019s perspective  instead of developing a concept of operations in accordance with its own  guidance, which calls for one to be created at the program level. As a  result of these early planning decisions and a desire to implement the four  capabilities by October 2015, the program went forward without a  comprehensive concept of operations and roadmap that defined a long- term direction and activities needed to achieve a modernized future state.", "As HUD proceeds with new initiatives aimed at financial management  systems modernization, it is important that a concept of operations and  roadmap, or something similar, be developed to guide its efforts.

Planning  a program\u2019s scope involves developing a program-level work breakdown  structure that defines in detail the work activities necessary and capturing  all the relevant information to support the development of associated  schedules or cost estimates.", "Building upon the planned scope, developing an effective program  schedule entails establishing an integrated master schedule that identifies  when and how long work will occur. This is a fundamental management  tool that, when adequately created, defines a valid critical path to help  gauge progress and identify and resolve potential problems. Lastly,  planning for and establishing a credible cost estimate is important for  determining budget requests and understanding the total monetary value  invested in modernization efforts. Such estimates should be based on  current data and updated to increase the quality of the estimates and  create a means for effective program and cost control. HUD\u2019s project  planning and management policy also requires that these program plans  be developed for IT investments, including modernization efforts.", "HUD executed activities aimed at planning the New Core program,  including practices to develop its scope, schedule, and cost. To establish  the scope, the department developed work breakdown structures with  associated dictionaries that outlined the scope of 3 out of 14 planned  financial management systems capabilities and used them to manage the  planning and implementation of releases. For instance, the April 2015  work breakdown structure for the third New Core release identified tasks  within eight high-level categories, including planning, requirements and  analysis, and development and testing. Individual schedules were also  established and managed for the 4 capabilities delivered through October  2015. The individual schedules outlined specific tasks within the  categories that had been defined in the work breakdown structures. For  example, planning tasks within the schedule for the third release included  time for updates needed to the charter and program plans. Finally, HUD  developed a cost estimate for the program in 2013 that was based on the  original assumption that the first 4 capabilities would be implemented at a  single point in time\u2014October 2014.", "However, we identified shortcomings in HUD\u2019s management of program  planning practices. Regarding scope, the department did not develop a  comprehensive program-level work breakdown structure for New Core  that encompassed the high-level work activities relative to all 14  capabilities. For example, while work breakdown structures for 3  capabilities had been defined and developed, work activities related to  delivering the remaining 11 capabilities, such as managerial cost  accounting, were not defined in work breakdown structures or outlined in  New Core documentation.", "While the department created individual schedules, it did not develop a  program-level integrated master schedule to define when and how long it  would take to deliver the 4 capabilities with identified delivery dates or any  of the remaining 10 planned capabilities. The individual New Core  schedules that had been developed lacked valid critical paths to identify  key activities that, if not completed when planned, could delay the  implementation of the capabilities. For example, our assessment of the  schedule for capabilities delivered on October 1, 2015, found that the  critical path was not continuous, contained both hard and soft  constraints, and had long duration activities that did not represent  measurable work. In addition to developing individual schedules, briefings  were developed to guide senior management and stakeholder review of  New Core\u2019s progress. These slides identified certain major program  activities including development and testing. However, according to New  Core\u2019s Deputy Director, these briefings were used to report on major  activities that were of interest to management and stakeholders and were  not representative of New Core\u2019s critical path.", "Moreover, the cost estimate for New Core was based on outdated  information that did not accurately reflect the cost of the entire program.  Specifically, when the department decided in April 2014 to shift from a  single implementation to a phased implementation beyond October 2014,  the department did not take action to revise the original estimate or create  a new one to reflect the estimated costs of delivering capabilities over a  longer duration of time. Although the department continued to identify  budgetary resources needed for the program, those costs were not  derived from a credible estimate.", "According to New Core officials, including the Deputy Director, efforts to  establish a program-level work breakdown structure and an integrated  master schedule were limited because the scope of all planned  capabilities had not been defined. In June 2016, the department provided  information regarding the reason a comprehensive work breakdown  structure had not been developed that encompassed high-level work  activities; it stated that this was a lesson learned and that in hindsight the  individual schedules should have been integrated for the program. In its  comments on our draft report, HUD also stated that because it was the  first cabinet-level agency to migrate to a shared service provider, the  department had relied on ARC\u2019s experience and processes for program  planning practices. Further, the New Core officials stated that, while an  updated cost estimate had been drafted in early 2015, the information  used for the estimate had not been validated and the estimate was not  finalized.", "By adequately executing program planning practices, including creating  comprehensive scope, schedule, and cost documentation, HUD would be  better positioned to implement the remaining capabilities and have  reasonable assurance that investing in new initiatives would achieve  desired benefits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Requirements Were Not Effectively Managed on New Core", "paragraphs": ["Requirements establish what the system is to do, how well it is to do it,  and how it is to interact with other systems.

Following a  determination that ARC was the best fit for HUD, more detailed  requirements were created. To this end, the shared service provider, in  conjunction with the New Core program staff, held requirements working  sessions with relevant subject matter experts from program offices and  support offices managed by the CFO, CIO, Chief Procurement Officer,  and Chief Human Capital Officer. These sessions were intended to define  and document detailed requirements specific to each of the 4 planned  capabilities. During these sessions, 15 traceability matrixes were created  that documented 923 requirements for the program. These matrixes  included the identification of requirements that would be met by or require  enhancements to the shared service provider\u2019s standard solutions and  requirements that would need alternative solutions outside of the shared  services provided. According to the department and ARC officials, further  definition of the high-level requirements gathered for the remaining 10  planned capabilities was not completed because the capabilities were not  part of the April 2014 revised implementation approach or included in the  interagency agreement.", "Nevertheless, limitations existed in HUD\u2019s implementation of these  requirements management practices. Efforts to define and trace  requirements were limited because the level of detail needed was not fully  defined during requirement gathering sessions. For example, the  department did not document its \u201cas-is\u201d processes to aid in defining and  managing requirements. As a result, the department limited its ability to  assess and explain the impact of the New Core requirements on existing  processes. While HUD identified new requirements throughout the  duration of the program, these requirements were not added to the  matrixes or managed by the department. Alternatively, they were  documented in various files and not tracked with the originally identified  requirements.", "Furthermore, requirements outlined in the matrixes did not trace back to  documentation that described criteria to be used to evaluate and accept  these requirements.

After IT investments are  selected and work on them has been initiated, effective control processes  include monitoring and taking corrective actions for approved  investments. HUD policy, issued by the Office of the CIO, also calls for  similar processes in project planning and management guidance. The  guidance outlines the role of a technical review subcommittee to  authorize a program to proceed through one control gate to the next if it  has met an established set of criteria. These criteria include reviewing  requirements and approving planning documents (such as the program  management plan), an assessment of the readiness of the system or  service, and evaluating closeout activities to end a program. During  2015, HUD also implemented a process for conducting health  assessments biweekly or monthly to evaluate the overall scope,  schedule, and costs of IT investments.", "The department\u2019s Office of the CIO applied two governance IT investment  control mechanisms for monitoring New Core\u2014technical review control  gates and health assessments. In general, both types of control  mechanisms focused on assessing whether required program planning  documents, such as schedules for each release, were developed and  submitted for review.", "First, technical review control gates of New Core were performed for the 4  capabilities delivered during 2014 and 2015. Specifically, the decision to  initiate planning for New Core was made through the first review in July  2013. Subcommittee members specializing in privacy, enterprise  architecture, and IT security, among others, approved the requirements  and operational readiness for the first and second releases in September  2014 and January 2015, respectively. Continued work on release 3 of the  program was approved through four additional reviews in 2015 and 2016.  In particular, a baseline review of the plans and requirements, a review of  the operational readiness of the release, an additional review of the  interface HUD developed to support its use of ARC\u2019s shared service  solutions, and a closeout review were performed.", "For the second governance control mechanism, HUD conducted two  health assessment reviews for New Core in June 2015 and March 2016  that, among other things, looked at the scope, schedule, and cost of the  core accounting and procurement capabilities. For example, the review  in June noted that the schedule was on target overall, but that specific  activities on the schedule had been behind their expected completion  dates and a \u201cget well\u201d plan had been established. However, New Core  received a high score for its schedule and the assessment did not require  follow-up to ensure the get well plan yielded the intended results.", "Neither of these governance control activities was fully effective in  monitoring the program and ensuring corrective action was taken when  needed. Specifically, although the governing entities reviewed the same  New Core program artifacts we assessed, HUD\u2019s reviews did not raise  concerns regarding the management weaknesses we identified during the  course of our review and did not require improvement plans for known  deficiencies. For example, action to ensure New Core developed a  schedule with a valid critical path as defined by best practices before  moving forward was not taken despite the fact that concerns were raised  in reports issued by the department\u2019s Office of Inspector General and an  independent validation and verification contractor.", "Furthermore, decisions made about the timing of control reviews limited  the effectiveness of New Core governance. HUD combined the technical  reviews for planning and readiness for release 1 and 2 of New Core and  delayed control gates until nearly 2 weeks before deployment. This was a  deviation from the status quo of conducting sequential control gate  reviews that warranted a waiver from the department\u2019s Office of the CIO.  Department officials stated that the risk of combining reviews had been  knowingly accepted and asserted there was no adverse impact. However,  this in effect did not give technical reviewers the opportunity to provide  input or recommend corrective action for implementation plans and  requirements before the team had already executed activities against  them, as the process was intended.", "In response to our draft report, the department also stated that it did not  agree that the technical reviewers\u2019 perspectives were the most  fundamental purpose of the control reviews, but that the success of New  Core falls on holding program managers accountable. While we agree  that holding managers accountable is important, we maintain that the  approach taken in combining the reviews for New Core was a deviation  from the department\u2019s established processes. Specifically, according to  the department\u2019s guidance, the project planning and management  process is intended to involve progressive steps that help ensure proper  management review and approval. Further, guidance on control reviews  calls for approval gates to be held at each stage of a program\u2019s life cycle.  By not holding a distinct review at the end of the New Core planning, the  department did not effectively ensure program managers received the  independent review the guidance was intended to provide. Specifically,  the technical reviewers were not positioned to formally validate and  baseline the program\u2019s planned cost, scope, schedule, and requirements  or identify any deficiencies that needed to be addressed before managers  proceeded to act upon those plans.", "Our prior work also has shown the importance of executive-level  oversight and the role CIOs play as critical to the success of IT  investments. More directly related to our prior work on financial  management systems modernization efforts, we have emphasized that a  partnership between executives is critical to ensuring that systems are  effectively modernized. Specifically, our work has found the importance  of a CFO in leading financial management efforts and the role of a CIO to  ensure successful implementation of IT investments. Along with strong  leadership, federal and HUD guidance call for coordination among  stakeholders and the alignment of programs with other IT investments by  identifying subject matter experts and ensuring that IT investments are  composed of an efficient mix of programs that best utilized resources.", "HUD\u2019s Deputy Secretary, CFO, and CIO, as well as the Executive  Director and Deputy Director of New Core, provided executive-level  oversight for the program and were involved in key decisions for the  program. For example, the CFO, CIO, and Executive Director of the  program approved the charter that, as of March 2015, confirmed the  department\u2019s plans to implement the 14 capabilities. These leaders  worked to establish a program sponsor, business lead, and teams to  manage each release, as well as identify key subject matter experts to be  involved with activities such as testing and training. In addition, HUD\u2019s  Deputy Secretary was involved in weekly status meeting and also  assisted with reprioritized funding for all IT investments in order to sustain  adequate funding for the program.", "However, the effectiveness of the program\u2019s executive-level oversight  was limited in part by challenges HUD faced with sustaining leadership,  coordinating among stakeholders, and ensuring alignment with other IT  programs.", "Significant changes to key New Core leadership positions between  2013 and 2014 impacted the approach used in implementing the  planned capabilities. After turnover occurred in the key positions of  HUD Deputy Secretary, CIO, CFO, and program director, significant  changes were made to New Core. For example, the key senior  officials who originally assessed and evaluated New Core alternatives  and made the decision to move forward with ARC for financial  management shared services did not remain in those leadership  positions to sustain the effort. As a result, instead of implementing all  four capabilities at one time as planned, the new leaders opted to  implement the capabilities through a series of releases. According to  program documentation, this option had not been selected by the prior  Deputy Secretary due to it being more costly and requiring a longer  period of time to implement. In commenting on our draft report, HUD  noted that after the change in leadership, there was a consensus to  change the approach because advantages outweighed the risks.", "Critical decisions regarding the scope of New Core were not  coordinated with important stakeholders in a timely manner. Of  particular note, HUD\u2019s acting Chief Procurement Officer reported that  his office was not involved in the decision made by the Deputy  Secretary at the start of New Core in 2013 to change procurement  management system approaches and migrate to ARC\u2019s procurement  system. At that time, the acting Chief Procurement Officer was still  working to finish customization of the new in-house procurement  system the department had implemented during 2012. Additionally,  although the need for a data warehouse had been established early in  the program, HUD did not take action to ensure this capability was  delivered in time to support the first four capabilities implemented.  Specifically, New Core officials determined actions were needed to  make alternative plans because the data warehouse would not be  ready for the October 2015 release date as expected. Toward this  end, the Office of the CIO also recognized the need to establish an  enterprise data warehouse capability that would satisfy broader needs  of the department and took initial steps to start the Enterprise Data  Warehouse initiative. Because the department did not deliver that  capability when intended, financial data continue to be accessed and  stored in a legacy warehouse system that was expected to be  replaced by New Core.", "While the department had other IT modernization efforts aimed at  delivering budget formulation tools, it is unclear how or to what extent  those efforts would be incorporated into or aligned with the New Core  program\u2019s capabilities for budget formulation. Plans were not made to  ensure that New Core was aligned with other department IT  modernization efforts delivering similar capabilities related to budget  formulation. Specifically, at the same time New Core was  implemented, budget formulation tools were also being built by other  department offices. HUD\u2019s Office of the CIO has also implemented a  tool to support formulation of the department\u2019s IT budget. Yet,  program officials could not provide evidence that requirements or  dependencies among these efforts had been evaluated.", "HUD\u2019s Deputy CIO acknowledged in March 2016 that IT governance  practices needed to be updated to reflect the challenges associated with  shared services projects. He noted that lessons learned from New Core  would be used to document tailoring guidance for shared service projects  in the future. In addition, according to program officials, adequate time  was not invested to assess whether New Core had achieved its identified  benefits. This was in part due to the program\u2019s focus on implementing the  four capabilities by an established deadline.", "Concerning executive-level oversight, in February 2016 HUD officials  noted in describing lessons learned that several leadership transitions at  the initiation of the New Core program had resulted in a lack of strategic  direction and consensus around decision-making. The department\u2019s CIO  also acknowledged that processes needed to improve executive-level  oversight and decision-making and allow the department to avoid  duplication in modernization efforts had not yet been fully implemented.", "Until HUD addresses weaknesses in IT governance practices and  strengthens executive-level oversight for financial management systems  modernization efforts, the department\u2019s capacity to manage and control  successor efforts may be limited."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Over the past two decades, HUD has undertaken modernization efforts  aimed at improving its financial management systems and ensuring that it  can accurately and efficiently carry out financial functions. With New  Core, the department transitioned 4 of 14 planned capabilities to shared  service solutions. In doing so, the department added efficiencies and  integrated systems that support the processing of financial management  functions. However, the program ended further development efforts  before delivering the remaining 10 planned capabilities. As a result, the  department has been unable to follow through with its plans to replace a  number of its legacy financial management systems through New Core  and continues to maintain those systems while seeking other new  initiatives to address aspects of the remaining capabilities.", "HUD\u2019s efforts to modernize its financial management systems have been  hindered by weaknesses in implementing key IT management practices.  Specifically, the department did not fully define and plan the program by  outlining the future operational state, establishing the scope and  estimating the schedule and cost for all planned capabilities, or effectively  managing requirements. While HUD\u2019s senior leaders, including the CIO,  ensured that IT governance processes were applied and the program  received executive-level oversight, limitations existed with both.  Specifically, the governance process was not fully effective in recognizing  and addressing challenges as they arose, including those identified with  the scope, schedule and costs of the program. Further, HUD faced  challenges with sustaining leadership, coordinating among stakeholders,  and aligning New Core with other IT modernization efforts.

The department  stated that it considers the approaches taken for planning, schedule, and  cost activities to be aligned with OMB\u2019s guidance on dividing programs  into smaller segments, such as phases and releases. The department  also noted that New Core provided many lessons learned that are being  incorporated into its IT governance and that review processes would be  enhanced. The comments elaborated on the external entities that  provided governance and leadership for the New Core program beyond  the department\u2019s internal structure. For example, HUD explained that it  held regular briefings with ARC, the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office  of Financial Innovation and Transformation, and OMB.", "While we support HUD improving its management practices and  enhancing IT governance processes, we continue to stress the  importance of taking action to implement our recommendations to ensure  the success of subsequent initiatives aimed at modernizing the  department\u2019s financial management systems. This is particularly  significant for the two initiatives under way that are intended to replace  and decommission legacy systems that have been long-identified as at  risk of failure, and have contributed to the misstatement of financial  information.

In its comments, the  department noted its appreciation for HUD being the first cabinet-level  agency to transition to its shared services provider. Further, Treasury  stated that HUD had demonstrated a commitment to standardization and  working collaboratively through challenges which had hindered previous  modernization efforts. Treasury also stated that the migration had  resulted in HUD reducing enterprise risks and costs, compliance with  federal initiatives and mandates, standardization of information, and  improvements in the timeliness of information available for decision- making.", "HUD and Treasury provided technical comments on the draft report,  which we have incorporated as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban  Development, the Secretary of the Treasury, and other interested parties.

Our specific objectives for  this review were to (1) determine the planned financial management  systems capabilities implemented through New Core and (2) evaluate  HUD\u2019s implementation of key IT management practices applied to the  program.", "To determine what financial management systems capabilities had been  implemented through New Core, we reviewed artifacts such as the New  Core Program Charter, New Core Implementation Plan, interagency  agreements between HUD and ARC, and release scope statements, and  identified 14 capabilities that were planned for delivery through the  program. After determining that 4 capabilities had been implemented, we  identified the features that were delivered and the features that had been  planned for these capabilities by reviewing, for example, post- implementation reports and briefings, requirements and training plans,  and HUD\u2019s Fiscal Year 2015 Financial Management Systems Plan. More  specifically, for each of the 4 capabilities\u2014travel, time and attendance,  core accounting, and procurement\u2014we reviewed release-related  documentation and compared the result of outcomes to the identified  planned features. Further, we reviewed actions under way to address  open issues and challenges HUD was managing after the implementation  and how those related to planned features. In addition, to identify the  systems that support HUD financial management functions, as well as the  systems that were targeted for replacement with New Core, we reviewed  documentation such as the department\u2019s financial management systems  plans for fiscal years 2014 and 2015. We also reviewed documentation  regarding the department\u2019s future modernization efforts, including the  HUD IT Fund 2017 Summary Statement and Initiatives, preliminary  planning documents, and briefings.", "To evaluate the program, we assessed the department\u2019s implementation  of key IT management practices in the areas of program definition,  planning, requirements, and governance in order to compare the  practices with standards and processes identified by the Project  Management Institute (PMI), Institute of Electrical and Electronics  Engineers, and federal guidance, including HUD policies and guidance  and GAO\u2019s guides for investment management, cost estimating, and  schedule assessments.", "In the area of program definition, we reviewed documentation  including the New Core Implementation Plan and the New Core  Program Charters, and New Core Program Management Plans for  each release, and briefings to determine whether these artifacts were  developed in adherence with key practices and elements for fully  defining a program as called for in PMI program management  standards, concept of operations guidance published by the Institute  of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and our previous reports on IT  modernization efforts. We also reviewed briefing slides documenting  recommendations and results of a study HUD conducted to plan for a  vision and roadmap for New Core to determine the extent to which the  department established a comprehensive concept of operations and  roadmap for the program.", "For program planning, we reviewed New Core documentation  including work breakdown structures, schedules, and cost estimates  to determine the extent to which these artifacts were consistent with  key practices identified by federal guidance and industry. Specifically,  we assessed whether the work breakdown structures defined in detail  all of the work activities and scope necessary to deliver the planned  14 capabilities and compared it to key practices identified by PMI. In  addition, using GAO\u2019s Schedule Assessment Guide, we assessed  whether schedules identified when and for how long work would occur  as well as whether a valid critical path had been defined. Finally, we  assessed whether New Core developed reliable cost estimates by  using key practices outlined in GAO\u2019s Cost Estimation Guide and  assessed whether those estimates were up to date.", "In regard to requirements management, we reviewed New Core\u2019s  process for defining and tracing requirements to determine the extent  to which these practices were consistent with practices promulgated  by PMI. Specifically, we reviewed and assessed the 15 requirements  matrixes developed for New Core to determine if requirements could  be traced back to business needs, criteria used for evaluating and  accepting requirements, and design and testing documentation. We  also ascertained if matrixes identified specific attributes for the  established requirements, such as disposition of the requirements or  any associated testing that was performed.", "To assess HUD\u2019s IT governance, we reviewed documentation  produced from New Core governance reviews and program artifacts  such as the charter, program briefings, and associated governance  and program team meeting minutes and compared them to relevant  HUD governance policies outlined in its project planning and  management framework and health assessment guide as well as to  governance practices in our IT investment management guide.", "Additionally, we compared New Core executive-level oversight with  criteria in our previous reports and guidance on oversight.", "For each objective, we interviewed senior officials from HUD\u2019s  headquarters in Washington, D.C., including HUD\u2019s Deputy Secretary,  Chief Financial Officer, Chief Information Officer, and Chief Procurement  Officer.
