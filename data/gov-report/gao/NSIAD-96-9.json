The military EO program applies only to military personnel. DOD civilians are covered by a separate program\u2014the Equal Employment Opportunity Program. Military personnel do not have access to mediation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and federal courts have held that they may not sue for discrimination under the provisions of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended.", "Concurrent with our review, a House National Security Committee task force conducted focus group sessions with servicemembers at  19 installations to determine their views on EO. The task force issued its report in December 1994. In addition, the Defense Equal Opportunity Council (DEOC), a DOD group chartered to advise the Secretary of Defense concerning EO matters, reviewed the services\u2019 discrimination complaint systems. DEOC issued its report in May 1995. In August 1995, DOD revised DOD Directive 1350.2 to incorporate many of DEOC\u2019s recommendations.

The following are three examples:", "Deadlines for filing complaints. Air Force personnel have 6 months to file a complaint, Army and Marine Corps personnel must file within 60 days, and Navy personnel must file a complaint within 45 days of an EO incident.", "Avenues for filing complaints. All four services encourage complainants to use the chain of command to resolve a complaint before resorting to other measures. Only the Air Force encourages its members to seek assistance outside the chain of command. This alternative is the base Social Actions Office, which is staffed by EO specialists. In the other services, complaints filed with EO specialists or others outside the chain of command are usually referred back to the chain of command for resolution.", "Complaint documentation. The Air Force, the Army, and the Navy (starting in Nov. 1994) use complaint forms that guide and document the complaint process, from the filing of the complaint to the end of the investigation. Each form is different. The Marine Corps\u2019 form is not EO specific, but is used to request a meeting with the commander for any reason.", "In its May 1995 report, DEOC stated that differences in the complaint processes reflected differences in the services\u2019 missions, organization, and culture. \u201cWhile general principles and standards can often be shared across Service lines, the simple substitution of one Service\u2019s complaints process for another is both undesirable and unworkable,\u201d DEOC asserted. In its focus group sessions with servicemembers, the House National Security Committee task force heard widespread reports that complaint systems did not serve members well. The task force identified a number of factors that an effective system should incorporate, including options for raising complaints outside the chain of command, strong support for the system from top leadership, and adherence to established timelines for investigating complaints and providing detailed feedback to complainants.", "At the time of our review, none of the six joint service commands and defense agencies we visited had written procedures for resolving EO complaints outside the chain of command. In addition, because the services\u2019 definitions of discrimination and procedures for resolving EO complaints vary, handling EO complaints involving members of different services could be difficult without written guidance for doing so. According to DEOC, defense agencies were beginning to develop specific procedures for processing EO complaints.", "For the most part, the focus group discussions revealed that the servicemembers were familiar with their respective service\u2019s procedures for filing an EO complaint.

The task force found that for a complaint system to be effective, the chain of command must demonstrate a commitment to protecting complainants from reprisal. DEOC made several recommendations aimed at preventing reprisal, including adopting a standard definition of reprisal, establishing specific reprisal prevention procedures, and improving training for leaders.

According to the Chief of Social Actions at one base, the move increased the office\u2019s importance and visibility.", "The Army and the Navy generally assign EO specialists to senior commanders. The Army, in addition, assigns EO specialists to garrison commanders, who are responsible for managing the infrastructure of a base and supporting tenant commands. At several commands we visited, however, EO specialists were not placed on the command staff, but reported to an official lower in the chain of command. Some of the EO specialists in these commands said their organizational placement limited their access to the commander and, consequently, limited the effectiveness of their support to the EO program. The Navy\u2019s Inspector General has reported that EO specialists lack the support and confidence of their superiors and are underused as program experts.", "In the Marine Corps, EO specialists are assigned to commanding generals and commanding officers of independent installations and stations. However, at one Marine Corps base we visited, the senior officer did not have an EO specialist assigned.

The following examples illustrate some of the reporting problems we found: In fiscal years 1993 and 1994, subordinate units at one Army command did not report 24 complaints to EO officials because they were not aware of the requirement.
