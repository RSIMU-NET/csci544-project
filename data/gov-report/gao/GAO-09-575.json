To conduct this work, GAO analyzed Census and enrollment data and conducted interviews with federal officials within the Departments of Education, Health and Human Services (HHS), and Labor and the National Institute for Literacy (NIFL); semistructured telephone interviews with state adult education officials in 12 states; site visits to 4 states; and reviews of relevant laws and literature."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The number of adults who speak English less than very well grew by 21.8 percent between 2000 and 2007, to roughly 22 million. The Adult Education State Grant Program, the key federal program for adult English language instruction, reported enrollment of about 1.1 million English language learners in 2007--which had remained relatively stable since 2000. However, most state adult education grantees we contacted reported increased demand. Also, there are many federal programs that allow for adult English language instruction for which national enrollment data are not collected. Federal support is dispersed across diverse programs in Education, HHS, and Labor that allow for English language learning in pursuit of other goals and do not collect data on participation in English language learning or the amount of federal funding that supports it. The agencies have undertaken initiatives and provided technical assistance. However, while there has been some collaboration among federal offices on behalf of English language learning, there is no ongoing mechanism to share information on resources or strategies to expand and capitalize on the agencies' individual efforts. States GAO contacted generally did not distinguish funding for English language learning from the other components of adult education, but they did vary greatly in the state matching funds contributed to their programs. GAO found states and local providers collaborating with other federal- and state-funded programs that serve populations likely to need this help. Yet such ef-forts to coordinate were not universal, and some local providers said they did not know how to access additional instructional or financial resources. States and local providers also supported English language learning in various ways. Education had one research study under way to test the effectiveness of an approach to adult English language learning, and Education and Labor had some ongoing work related to adult English language learners. Education officials said that there had been little research on what approaches are effective for adult English language learning, and noted that federal funds for rigorous research are limited.

English language ability appears to be linked to multiple dimensions of  adult life in the United States, including civic participation; workforce  participation and mobility; and fulfilling parental responsibilities, such as  reading to children and communicating with their schools and teachers.  Consistent with these relationships, the top reasons that adults have cited  for seeking English language classes include improving the way they feel  about themselves, making it easier to do things on a day-to-day basis,  attending school, getting a raise or promotion, obtaining a new job,  obtaining U.S. citizenship, and helping children with their schoolwork.  Regarding workforce participation, the Department of Labor\u2019s (Labor)  Bureau of Labor Statistics analyses show that foreign-born persons\u2014who  are much more likely than native-born persons to lack English  proficiency\u2014accounted for about 16 percent of the U.S. civilian labor  force in 2007.

(See app. I for detailed  information on our scope and methodology.) Briefly, to determine what is  known about trends in need and enrollment, we reviewed and analyzed  Census and American Community Survey (ACS) data on English language  speaking ability for 2000 to 2007, and reviewed reports of the Department  of Education\u2019s (Education) National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL)  and National Household Education Surveys Program (NHES). We also  reviewed data on enrollment in the Adult Education State Grant  Program\u2014a federal program that funds adult education, including English  language instruction\u2014which states report to the Adult Education National  Reporting System (NRS). We assessed the reliability of these data and  determined that both the Census and NRS data were sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of our report. To examine the nature of federal support  for adult English language learning, we examined programs\u2019  authorizations to support adult English language learning, actions that  federal agencies and programs had taken to support adult English  language learning, as well as the available data on spending and  effectiveness regarding adult English language learning. We selected three  key federal agencies\u2014Education, the Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS), and Labor\u2014for review of related programs. We selected  these agencies on the basis of their missions to administer education- and  workforce-related programs. We also selected these agencies because of  their mandate to collaborate with the National Institute for Literacy  (NIFL), which is tasked with serving as a resource to support literacy\u2014the  development of reading and writing skills\u2014across all age groups. While  we used several means to identify programs within these agencies that  supported English language learning as a primary purpose or allowable  use of federal funds, the possibility exists that the programs we identified  may not capture all of the programs authorized to support adult English  language learning within the three agencies. To examine state and local  activities, we selected the 6 states that had the largest adult limited  English proficient populations in the nation in 2007 (California, Florida,  Illinois, New Jersey, New York, and Texas) and the 6 states that had the  highest growth rates in their adult limited English proficient populations  from 2000 to 2007 (Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Nevada, and  Tennessee). We conducted semistructured telephone interviews with  officials responsible for administering the Adult Education State Grant  Programs in each of these states. The 12 states accounted for 75 percent of  the national adult limited English proficient population and 75 percent of  the Adult Education State Grant Program\u2019s national enrollment in English  language programs for 2007. We also conducted site visits to California,  Illinois, Minnesota, and Washington State to interview officials of related  state agencies and local programs. We selected these states for visits to get  a mix of states with large (California and Illinois) and high-growth  (Minnesota and Washington) limited English proficient populations, as  well as diversity in administrative structures and practices under way  regarding adult English language learning.

The survey did not  inquire about why some adults were not interested, but potential reasons  for not actively seeking instruction include the belief that participation is  impractical in the midst of competing work or family responsibilities, lack  of need for additional English to perform daily activities, or lack of  success in past efforts. In addition, persons who are interested in English  language classes may not participate because they face barriers. In the  1995 NHES, 30.5 percent of adults with limited English proficiency had not  taken an English language class in the last 12 months, even though they  expressed interest in doing so.

Such factors may include  educational attainment and literacy in the learners\u2019 native language.  Additional factors that may pose challenges include economic issues, such  as the competing priorities of work and family and a lack of transportation  and child care; cultural background; age; and motivational challenges.

Our previous work has highlighted the  benefits of actions that federal agencies have taken to enhance and sustain  their collaborative efforts, including the ability to leverage resources,  improve quality, expand services, and reach more clients. Yet, while  Education, HHS, and Labor all serve populations in need of language  assistance, there is no ongoing mechanism to share information or expand  and capitalize on the agencies\u2019 individual efforts.", "The agencies have at times used interagency agreements to support  English language learning for adults. For example, Education and the  Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Office of Citizenship have an  interagency agreement to support a Web-based tool for lessons in civics-  and citizenship-oriented English language learning, according to  Homeland Security and Education officials. To promote mutual  understanding of their programs, HHS\u2019s Office of Refugee Resettlement  and Labor\u2019s Office of Workforce Investment temporarily placed employees  in one another\u2019s agencies and participated in each other\u2019s conferences in  2008, with one result being a list of promising practices. Additionally,  Labor officials said that they have begun to meet with Education officials  to identify effective strategies for adult learning, and that adult English  language learning would be included in this effort.", "Beyond these collaborations, there have been some interagency task  forces established; however, generally these task forces have been  temporary and have not focused on adult English language learning. For  example, all three agencies, as well as other agencies, participated in an  interagency Task Force on New Americans, created in response to a June  2006 executive order, and this task force issued a report that touched on  English language learning and other issues. The task force, while still  technically active, has not met since the issuance of the report in  December 2008, according to a Homeland Security official. Also, in 2006,  the agencies participated in the Interagency Coordination Group for Adult  Literacy to focus on multiple objectives, including improving coordination,  leveraging resources and reducing duplication among federal agencies and  programs, sharing best practices, and helping states maximize the federal  investment in adult education. The group supported the creation of a  database of foundations supporting literacy efforts and developed Web- based adult literacy resources, and, according to an Education official,  served as the starting point for an interagency group on strengthening  adult education, created by an executive order in 2007, that fulfilled its  mission with the issuance of a report in 2008. These short-term  collaborative efforts point to the interest in and need for collaboration,  and others have also identified the need for collaboration specific to adult  English language learning. In 2006, NIFL convened a working group on  English language learning that, in 2007, recommended to NIFL interagency  coordination on adult English language learning \u201cto facilitate collaborative  work and information sharing\u201d to better serve this population. However,  as of the time of our review, according to a NIFL official, the  recommendation had yet to be considered by NIFL. Additionally, we did  not identify any federal agency that has been specifically tasked to  coordinate information sharing on adult English language learning.", "Further coordination between and among the agencies is still uncertain,  despite a common interest in English language learners\u2019 employment and  despite shared challenges in serving learners with certain characteristics.  For example, Education and HHS\u2019s Office of Refugee Resettlement have  discussed but not developed an interagency agreement to provide local  refugee programs with information on English learning resources, and no  exchange of staff with Education has been discussed along the lines of  what had been done with Labor. However, in technical comments on a  draft of this report, Education indicated that it is open to collaboration  with HHS, as well as other federal agencies, as appropriate. Coordination  between Labor and Education on their respective initiatives has been  variable. Although Education officials reported helping Labor with its  Limited English Proficiency and Hispanic Worker Initiative, they had not  involved Labor in Education\u2019s employment- and training-related initiative,  namely the Career Connections project. For its part, while Labor has  provided technical assistance to one-stops and other stakeholders on  working with the Adult Education State Grant Program, it has provided no  guidance or technical assistance specifically regarding English language  instruction, according to Labor officials. Furthermore, although HHS\u2019s  Office of Refugee Resettlement and Labor\u2019s Office of Workforce  Investment took temporary steps to coordinate, as we have previously  discussed, an Office of Refugee Resettlement official said that it was  unclear whether such coordination would be reinitiated, despite the  benefits it provided in identifying additional resources available to  refugees.", "The limited nature of federal efforts to coordinate is apparent in the  agencies\u2019 efforts to issue guidance and information that could help local  providers identify both promising practices for providing English language  instruction and additional resources in their communities for providing  such instruction. While guidance can support efficient and effective  coordination across programs, there has been no recent guidance from  HHS, for example, to grantees of the refugee resettlement program for  obtaining their language instruction resources through local collaboration,  despite an official\u2019s acknowledgment that the refugee program\u2019s limited  funding might require agencies serving refugees to tap additional  resources. For the TANF program, HHS officials said guidance has been  focused on how to count English language instruction as an activity, but  not on how to identify and leverage local resources. Nor has the HHS  Office of Community Services, which manages the Community Service  Block Grant program, issued any guidance that would help local programs  identify English instruction resources in their communities, according to a  department official. Also, Labor\u2019s update of Trade Adjustment Assistance  guidance focused on the conditions under which English language  instruction would be allowable, rather than resources for how to best  provide instruction. Regarding Labor\u2019s 2003 initiative instructing one-stop  managers to develop plans for helping clients with limited English  proficiency (LEP plans), the guidance offered no specific information on  promising practices or information about local resources available  through the Adult Education State Grant Program. Additionally, an official  of the National Farmworkers Job Program said that this program has  issued no guidance on this topic. An exception to the absence of  information on resources and opportunities for local collaboration is  Education\u2019s Web site, \u201cCommunity Partnerships for Adult Learning.\u201d This  Web site offers information on how to collaborate locally, based on 12  community profiles, and makes it possible to search for examples  involving English language instruction. At the same time, however, we  found that many local providers were unaware of Education\u2019s USA Learns  Web site providing English language instruction, despite federal efforts to  publicize it. Although Labor did apprise its regional offices of this  resource, 22 of the 28 farmworker program grantees whom we contacted  were not aware of it, none of the Job Corps operators we contacted had  heard of USA Learns, and an association of refugee agencies also was not  acquainted with the Web site.", "Representatives of programs serving certain populations of English  language learners, including refugees, farmworkers, and Job Corps  students, said that greater coordination could benefit their clients by, for  example, offering information about innovative practices, access to  teacher training opportunities, and the efficient use of scarce resources.  For example, certain agencies that serve refugees at the local level  expressed interest in information about additional English language  learning resources that could benefit refugees after their job placement.  Additionally, an official of an association of refugee-serving agencies said  that, while some refugee agencies might be aware of the Adult Education  State Grant Program\u2019s English language learning component, others might  not or might have questions about refugees\u2019 eligibility for it. This official  also noted that refugee agencies would be likely to welcome information  about additional English language learning opportunities for their clients,  given scarce resources in the refugee system. A farmworkers\u2019 program  grantee said that the benefits of greater coordination could include access  to updated and innovative materials, curricula, and teaching methods, as  well as access to additional teacher training opportunities, while others  pointed to access to additional resources. Among Job Corps Center  managers with whom we spoke, the potential benefits cited included  additional information for centers inexperienced in serving English  language learners, additional information about promising instructional  practices, and additional information about curricula that combine English  language learning and occupational skills training.", "In addition, it is important to note, all three agencies serve subpopulations  of English language learners who share some characteristics. For example,  providers of services under the Adult Education State Grant Program and  refugee funding streams, Job Corps Center managers, and officials of the  farmworkers\u2019 program all indicated the presence of beginning English  learners among their clients, such as those who lack literacy in their  primary language. Among those who mentioned this subpopulation,  effectively and efficiently serving these learners was frequently described  as challenging. In addition, some refugee-serving agencies told us that  some refugees are highly educated\u2014precisely the subpopulation targeted  by several local programs through Education\u2019s Career Connections  initiative."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "States and Service Providers Have Used a Range of Strategies to Support Adult English Language Learning", "paragraphs": ["States have supported adult English language learning in a variety of ways,  particularly through the one federal program with an explicit focus on  English language learning\u2014the Adult Education State Grant Program\u2014but  also beyond this program.

Moreover, some states are addressing program quality through  teacher qualifications and training, content standards, and other means  and are developing mechanisms for local planning. Additionally, some  states are coordinating with other programs. States and local providers are  also taking steps to integrate English language instruction with  occupational training. Furthermore, states are supplementing these  activities with their own efforts to support English language instruction,  such as through libraries and special schools.

While most states did not distinguish the funding  they provided for English language learning from the funding provided for  other components of adult education, their financial contributions for  adult education varied considerably. Specifically, state and local spending  used to match Federal Fiscal Year 2005 funds ranged from the federally  required 25 percent minimum in Tennessee and Texas to 88 percent of  total spending in California and 90 percent in Florida. At least 2 states\u2014 California and New York\u2014described current or planned reductions to  their state contributions to the Adult Education State Grant Program.  Meanwhile, officials for Arizona\u2019s program said that their program has  begun to track funding for English language learning separately, to provide  a specific focus on such learning as a distinct activity.", "The states we contacted reported using a variety of considerations in  allocating funding to local areas under the Adult Education State Grant  Program, and some reported that they are beginning to use provider  performance as a consideration. While Minnesota used factors such as  instructional hours in allocating funds to local providers, other states\u2014 including Arizona, Florida, Illinois, and New Jersey\u2014directed funding to  local programs, at least in part, on the basis of the size of the local limited  English proficient population, using Census Bureau data. Illinois further  emphasizes need, according to a state official, by giving extra weight to the  population least proficient in English. In terms of performance-based  funding, while California adopted this funding approach after the passage  of WIA in 1998, Illinois has considered local provider performance in  distributing funding to local programs since 2005, according to officials in  each state. According to a Florida official, that state is redesigning its  funding formula to emphasize performance, beginning July 1, 2009. Also,  Tennessee is also revising its formula to give greater weight to  performance, with an anticipated implementation in 2010, according to an  official from that state.", "Most of the 12 states we contacted through our semistructured telephone  interviews also reported taking steps to improve the quality of English  language teaching, such as by supporting professional development for  English language teachers. Ten states had set minimum requirements for  teaching English\u2014typically, a state teacher\u2019s license or a Bachelor of Arts  degree\u2014while 2 states had no specific teacher qualifications. Generally,  however, in those states that had established qualifications, they were the  same as those for other adult education teachers. Two of these states had  or were developing qualifications specific to teachers of English language  learners: California required a special credential for such teachers, and  Arizona, according to state officials, was developing standards that would  delineate specifically what teachers of English language learners need to  know. Additionally, 1 state\u2014Arkansas\u2014requires certain providers to  adhere to standards specifically for volunteers who work with English  language learners through the Adult Education State Grant Program. To  augment these minimum qualifications, most states addressed teachers\u2019  training needs through professional development activities. Six states had  set an annual minimum number of professional development hours,  although this minimum varied widely, from 5 to 60 hours. Additionally, all  but 1 of the 12 states reported using most of their Adult Education State  Grant state leadership funds to finance their teachers\u2019 professional  development. For example, Arkansas, Illinois, and Nevada have used such  funding for special centers, which can provide professional development  opportunities for teachers of English language learners. Furthermore, 8 of  the 12 states reported having adopted content standards to guide English  language instruction. Among the reasons that these states cited for  developing content standards was consistency of instruction statewide.", "States and local providers with whom we met also cited ways in which  they were using NRS data on English language learners to improve service  delivery. For example, in Washington State, the Adult Education State  Grant Program agency officials said they discovered through reviewing  program data that learners\u2019 outcomes were lower in classes that were held  at certain locations, and were subsequently able to make changes in those  locations by addressing the needs of teachers, actions that the officials  said eventually led to better results. Furthermore, this agency has  developed a workshop for local providers to train them on how to use data  for program improvement. At the local level, one provider in Washington  State reported using the data to compare day and evening classes and  make adjustments in their scheduling without adversely affecting  outcomes. Moreover, officials of California\u2019s Adult Education State Grant  agency described using the data to determine that numbers of English  language learners were not successfully transitioning to adult basic  education, and worked closely with a technical assistance provider and  held regional meetings to address this issue.", "Also within the Adult Education State Grant Program, states reported  providing technical assistance to local providers, sponsoring special  projects on a variety of topics, or taking other steps to address program  quality. For example, Illinois provided training on its new content  standards to local providers to support their curriculum development.  Florida and New Jersey reported efforts to focus on beginning-level  learners by providing special training and issuing targeted grants,  respectively. In addition, California provided technical assistance to local  programs to find ways to improve student retention. The state has also  piloted an electronic English language assessment in certain locations to  increase efficiency and reduce teachers\u2019 burden in conducting written  assessments. Additionally, Arizona has adopted stricter enrollment  policies, a step described by state officials as part of their effort to address  program quality for English language learners. Finally, Florida and  California also supported provider efforts to offer distance learning  opportunities for English language learners, and 5 other states are  exploring distance learning applications for English language learning  through a project sponsored by the University of Michigan.", "Mechanisms to guide and coordinate local service delivery have been  developed in 2 of the 4 states that we visited\u2014Illinois and Minnesota.  According to a state official, Illinois has established about 30 Area  Planning Councils across the state comprising a diverse array of providers  that are required to meet twice a year and submit annual areawide service  plans. These councils can encourage individual providers to focus on  specific skill levels to minimize duplication of services. While Adult  Education State Grant providers must belong to these councils, they may  also include representatives from state agencies and the private sector,  and, in some cases, agencies that serve populations outside the Adult  Education State Grant Program. Meanwhile, Minnesota relies on 53 local  consortia of providers for local service coordination, and requires them to  submit comprehensive plans every 5 years. For example, the St. Paul  Community Literacy Consortium includes both public schools and CBOs;  according to state officials, the public schools generally serve more  advanced learners, while the CBOs serve more beginning-level learners. In  addition to facilitating the targeting of resources in this way, the  consortium structure has, according to a consortium official, allowed  individual providers to work together to respond to emerging trends and  explore common interests, such as the uses of technology for English  language learners."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some States and Local Providers Coordinated with Other Federally Funded Programs", "paragraphs": ["Some state agencies that manage the Adult Education State Grant Program  and the local providers they support have taken steps to coordinate with  other federal- and state-funded programs that serve populations likely to  need this help\u2014particularly refugees, those seeking assistance through  one-stops, and those receiving public financial support. For example,  Washington State has established an \u201cLEP Pathway\u201d that refers refugees  and TANF clients to providers of English language instruction. According  to state officials, many, although not all of these providers, also receive  funding from the state\u2019s Adult Education State Grant Program agency.  According to state officials, the LEP Pathway has helped ensure timely and  culturally appropriate services for refugees, particularly for the majority  who are beginning-level English speakers, and given the state a flexible  way to respond to changes in refugee flows from different countries and  primary languages. In Minnesota, the state agency that administers both  TANF and services for refugees uses a state-funded family stabilization  program to serve most limited English clients, which serves these clients  for 1 year to address a variety of barriers to immediate employment,  including limited English. Additionally, Minnesota\u2019s refugee program has  transferred funding to its Adult Education State Grant Program agency, to  secure seats in English language classes for refugees within the relatively  short period before they are placed in employment. In Florida, the refugee  Program contracts with local Adult Education State Grant Program  providers for English language instruction, according to a state official. By  contrast, Nevada\u2019s Adult Education State Grant Program agency has  provided funding to that state\u2019s refugee agency, as one of several English  language providers.", "Among the 12 states we contacted through semistructured telephone  interviews, 6 reported formal, state-level coordination between the Adult  Education State Grant Program and the TANF program. For example,  Arkansas officials reported that this coordination helped target learners at  the beginning levels. Texas officials reported that such coordination  helped prevent duplication of effort and facilitated the cotraining of staff  from both the Adult Education State Grant Program and the TANF  program. None of the 12 states, on the other hand, reported formal  coordination at the state level between agencies administering the Adult  Education State Grant Program and those administering services for  refugees.", "Furthermore, of the 12 states we contacted through semistructured  telephone interviews, 8 reported formal, state-level coordination between  the Adult Education State Grant Program and the state agency that  administers the one-stop system. For example, New York\u2019s Adult  Education State Grant Program officials said that English language  instruction is available at all one-stops in New York City. Other states that  reported English language instruction on-site at one-stops were Alaska and  Tennessee. Beyond these 12 states, Minnesota\u2019s Adult Education State  Grant Program specifically requires all local providers to establish formal  agreements with their local one-stops to include help for English language  learners, as well as other adult education clients, such as those needing  basic skills. While Georgia officials did not report formal, state-level  coordination, they did report that such coordination, including the co- location of services, occurs on the local level. States reported that their  state-level coordination with the one-stop system involved functions such  as assessment (Arkansas and Texas), improved referral (Arizona), and a  special pilot in 12 sites to electronically assess both literacy and job skills  (California). State officials also attested to some benefits from this formal,  state-level coordination between the two programs. In Tennessee, officials  said this coordination provided better services for clients and reduced the  burden of filling out multiple forms in multiple locations, while Texas  officials said that it has helped provide access to work and training  programs.", "Meanwhile, some states reported coordination with other federal or  federally supported programs, such as Even Start, postsecondary  education, and the federal program for farmworkers. For example, Illinois  and Texas reported state-level coordination between English language  learning under their adult education programs and the Even Start program,  a family literacy program administered by Education. Illinois officials  reported that its Even Start program has a representative on an adult  education advisory board, in an effort to ensure that the programs\u2019 policies  are consistent. Additionally, Adult Education State Grant Program  agencies in Arizona, Illinois, Minnesota, and New York reported initiatives  that focused on transitioning English language learners to postsecondary  education. On another front, Florida\u2019s farmworkers\u2019 program is housed  within the same division of the state education department as the Adult  Education State Grant Program. According to a state official, coordination  between the two programs has reduced testing costs for the farmworkers\u2019  program, allowed the farmworkers\u2019 program to focus on its primary  mission of employment, provided access to information about promising  practices in English language instruction, facilitated joint efforts to serve  beginning-level learners, and created opportunities for program clients to  continue their training.", "However, such coordination efforts were not universal, and some  providers, particularly refugee agencies in California and Washington  State, said they did not know how to access or acquire additional  resources through the Adult Education State Grant Program, despite, in  some cases, expressing a need for such additional resources. Furthermore,  officials of one of these refugee-serving agencies said that it would be  prohibitively expensive for the agency to pay Adult Education State Grant  Program providers to secure seats for refugees in their classes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some States and Local Providers Are Exploring Ways to Integrate English Language Learning and Occupational Training", "paragraphs": ["In a variety of settings, a number of states are combining occupational  training with English language instruction to support local workforce  development and to improve the ability of new English speakers to gain  employment. In 2004, Washington State began to merge English  instruction with occupational instruction in its community college  classrooms as a pilot program. The project was designed to shorten the  time that it was taking new learners to progress from mastering English to  mastering an occupational skill. According to state officials, a sequential  approach had required as long as 7 or 8 years, in some cases. Today,  Washington State has adopted the dual approach of the pilot program for  its occupational curricula at community colleges and expanded this  approach statewide. Under this program, called I-BEST, or the Integrated  Basic Education and Skills Training Initiative, each classroom has both an  occupational skills teacher and a basic skills teacher, who may be an  English language instructor. While the particular occupational tracks at  the community colleges vary, each reflects jobs that are in demand locally,  according to state officials. Occupational programs are available, for  example, for English language learners who seek to become nursing  assistants, medical assistants, phlebotomists, automotive technicians,  welders, accountants, and advanced manufacturing workers, among other  occupations. In May of 2009, an evaluation of I-BEST reported better  educational outcomes for participants, including English language  learners, compared with nonparticipants. Illinois and Minnesota, which  we also visited, as well as Indiana, Ohio, and Wisconsin have been  exploring other approaches to integrating English and occupational  training under the Joyce Foundation\u2019s Shifting Gears initiative.", "Certain states we contacted had targeted English language learners in  high-demand occupations in other ways. Minnesota\u2019s workforce agency  has used a state-funded program to support workforce-oriented English  language learning with projects that required employers to provide  matching funds. To date, the program has sponsored projects in  occupational fields such as manufacturing, health care, food processing,  hospitality, and horticulture. In addition, its workforce agency and its  department of education, which manages the Adult Education State Grant  Program, have collaborated on 14 projects, some of which integrate  English language learning in fields such as manufacturing and health care.  All 14 projects will be evaluated, according to state officials. In Texas, the  Adult Education State Grant Program and workforce agencies have  collaborated to develop industry-specific curricula for English language  learning in the fields of services, manufacturing, and health care. Florida is  planning to refine its existing curriculum in order to make it industry- specific, according to a state official. In addition, Arizona has used federal  incentive funding for health care education and training for limited English  proficient and other low-skilled adults.", "Some local providers of adult education programs have also responded to  employer requests for customized English language instruction for their  employees. An Illinois community college, for example, provided classes  to various companies, including a printing company, often with support  from certain city and state grants. At the state level, Illinois has a program  to support such workplace-based activities that serve English language  learners and others with literacy needs, with employers paying part of the  cost. Also, a California community college provided English lessons to  culinary workers, and a California CBO provided safety-oriented English  instruction to warehouse workers. However, some providers told us that  their ability to contract with employers to provide such customized  English language instruction depends on factors such as having enough  people enrolled to meet costs, while accommodating different levels of  English proficiency.", "In the course of our site visits, we visited a number of local providers  involved in combining English language instruction with occupational  training. These providers were involved with a wide range of industries  and venues for training or retraining workers, and they used a wide range  of funding sources (see table 2). For example, one community college  provider in California placed an English language instructor in the same  classroom with the occupational instructor, who taught advanced  carpentry. In other cases, to accommodate workers\u2019 schedules, providers  delivered English language and occupational instruction at different times,  or\u2014when it was delivered on-site\u2014between shifts. Another model, used at  community colleges, such as City College of San Francisco and Cerritos  College in Norwalk, California, involves offering a \u201csupport course\u201d with  terms and concepts specific to certain occupations; college officials told  us this English language support course may precede or follow the  occupational course."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some States Funded Their Own Programs", "paragraphs": ["Aside from their use of Adult Education State Grant Program funds, some  states and local jurisdictions have supported English language learning  through additional programs of their own, such as through state literacy  organizations, libraries, and special schools, and some states aim to offset  employers\u2019 costs by offering tax credits or other incentives. In 2007,  California had enrolled some 466,000 adults in its own English language  learning program for adults\u2014almost as many as were enrolled (528,000) in  its Adult Education State Grant Program. The state has also invested   $50 million annually in its Community-based English Tutoring program,  which officials said has, heretofore, reached about 1.5 million adults each  year. New Jersey also funds a separate state-funded program to provide  English language learning opportunities through the one-stop system, that,  according to state officials, has reached about 6000 individuals annually.  Also, Illinois has a state-funded program to provide civics- and citizenship- oriented English language instruction that it has funded at about $2 million  annually. At the local level, New York City funds an initiative that serves  about 30,000 English language learners annually, according to a city  official.", "Family literacy programs, which can include English language instruction  for parents as well as children, have also been an area of state and local  activity. Illinois has such a program, which aims to serve those whose  child care responsibilities may prevent them from accessing other  services. According to a state official, the program was funded at   $1.2 million in state fiscal year 2008 and served about 900 adult  participants, the majority of whom were English language learners. A  local agency in Los Angeles County has used revenue from a state tobacco  tax to provide English language learning opportunities through family  literacy activities. According to an agency official, this project served 688  adults in state fiscal year 2008. Additionally, local public schools in 75  locations across the country, including in Memphis, Tennessee, have  developed family literacy programs that focus specifically on English  language learners, with support from Toyota and the National Center for  Family Literacy, according to a representative of the center.", "Other states have supported English language learning indirectly, by  supporting the volunteers who work with English language learners and  others enrolled in Adult Education State Grant Program activities. In  Illinois, a state agency\u2014the Office of the Secretary of State\u2014has provided  access to training and set standards for volunteers who work in these  programs. By contrast, in Washington State, a private association that  receives state funding fulfills these functions. In fact, when we asked  about standards for volunteers, officials from 5 of the 12 states we  contacted said that such standards had been set by entities other than the  Adult Education State Grant Program.", "Public libraries have been another venue by which states and local  governments have provided funds for English language learning. Officials  of the California State Library, for example, told us that the Library has a  program that reaches more advanced English language learners and some  libraries in the state also use local resources, grants, and fund-raising to  support their own English language learning activities. Officials of  Arizona\u2019s Adult Education State Grant Program also noted that their  agency has transferred funding to the Arizona State Library to support  services for English language learners. Some have estimated that a  significant portion of public libraries across the country provide English  language instruction. Additionally, in seven communities around the  country, libraries and other entities, including some adult education  providers, have begun to develop an Internet tool, known as the Learner  Web, that can help adult English language learners access online and  community resources. Public support for people learning English  through their libraries was also augmented in 2008 with a grant from the  American Library Association and the Dollar General Foundation, whichawarded one-time grants to 34 libraries in 18 states to better serve adultEnglish language learners.", "Also aside from activities associated with the Adult Education State Grant  Program, some states have supported adult English language learning  through special schools. For example, Washington State provides funding  for a vocational school for farmworkers, the Community Agriculture  Vocational Institute. According to the local farmworkers program director,  the school incorporates workforce-oriented English language instruction  as part of tractor, ladder, and pesticide safety classes. In Arizona, there  are charter schools managed by both a National Farmworkers\u2019 Jobs  Program grantee and a Job Corps Center that provide English language  instruction to young adults. In the District of Columbia, a charter school  for adults, the Carlos Rosario International Public Charter School,  combines English language instruction with occupational training in  computer technology and culinary arts.", "Finally, a few of the state officials we interviewed reported that their  states have devised incentives for employers to provide English language  learning opportunities. According to state officials, employers in Florida  and Georgia may claim a tax credit for providing training for their  employees, and this training can include English language instruction. In  New Jersey, according to state officials, employers can be reimbursed for  one-half of their employees\u2019 salaries while the employees are in training,  including English language instruction."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies Have Undertaken Some Research, but Have Not Coordinated Research Planning across Agencies on Adult English Language Learning", "paragraphs": ["At the time of our review, Education had one research study under way to  test the effectiveness of a particular approach to adult English language  learning, and Education and Labor had some ongoing work related to  adult English language learners.

However, while agencies cited a few efforts to collaborate on  specific projects, they had not coordinated research planning across  agencies to systematically leverage research resources for increasing the  knowledge base regarding adult English language learning.", "Education was funding a study, led by IES, evaluating the effectiveness of  one instructional strategy for low-literacy English language learners.  Funded using $6.9 million in AEFLA national leadership dollars over  multiple years, the study\u2019s final report is expected in the summer of 2010.  The impetus for this research, according to Education officials, was that  while English language learners made up the largest share of participants  in the Adult Education State Grant Program, there had been little research  on what approaches are effective for adult English language learners and  few instructional strategies are available for low-literacy English language  learners. The particular literacy textbook being tested, according to the  study\u2019s design report, was chosen on the basis of its consistency with  characteristics identified in literature as promising, as well as through  recommendations from experts in the field. Depending on the results of  the study, Education officials said they expect that the results could be  disseminated for use at the classroom level and could make classroom  materials more research-based.", "Also at the time of our review, Education and Labor were doing analyses  of the NAAL survey data looking at literacy levels of adults, including  those of English language learners. Education\u2019s OVAE and Labor\u2019s  Employment and Training Administration had a memorandum of  understanding covering a contractor\u2019s preparation of four issue briefs on  the NAAL data, including one brief on the literacy of nonnative English  speaking adults. According to Education and Labor officials, the briefs are  expected to be released in the late summer of 2009. In addition to this joint  effort, according to Labor officials, the contractor is using the NAAL data  to prepare a separate report for Labor\u2019s Employment and Training  Administration, expected in early 2010, that will address the literacy of the  working poor, workers in high-growth and declining occupations and  industries, and nonnative English speaking workers, and address how this  information may be utilized when serving these populations in the public  workforce system. Separately, Education\u2019s NCES was finalizing two  studies, according to an NCES official, expected to be released in one  report in 2009, examining the oral reading and contextual reading skills of  adults with the lowest levels of literacy. The NCES official with whom we  spoke about the studies said that the studies will discuss the results for  different subgroups, including nonnative English speakers.", "Federal officials cited interest in identifying effective approaches to adult  English language learning but said that little research on adult English  language learning has been conducted or planned by federal agencies  because of cost and competing priorities. However, officials did not  identify steps to coordinate research planning on adult English language  learning across agencies. Education officials said that there are limited  funds for rigorous research and multiple research priorities within the  department. Furthermore, officials noted that sound research takes years  of investment and strategic planning. However, at the same time, officials  from the agencies did not identify efforts to coordinate research planning  across agencies on adult English language learning, which could help  leverage resources used for research. For example, the NCES official  responsible for the NAAL studies reported being unaware of Labor\u2019s NAAL  work at the time that we spoke, and asked for more information about  Labor\u2019s effort to avoid duplicating efforts. NIFL prepared a working  document of research themes and priorities in adult literacy, with input  from experts in the field, as well as Education\u2019s OVAE. However, the  document was submitted to its Interagency Group in January 2008 and,  according to a NIFL official, no further action has occurred.", "In 2007 and 2008, two working groups identified the need for better  collaboration across Education, HHS, Labor, and NIFL on adult education  and English language learning research. In September 2007, a planning  group, organized to help NIFL consider options for its future work on  issues related to adult English language learners, recommended a system  to coordinate research efforts on adult English language learner education  across organizations and agencies to ensure that strong research  methodologies are used and to develop a common knowledge base.  However, implementation of this recommendation has not yet been  considered by NIFL. Similarly, in July of 2008, the Interagency Adult  Education Working Group, convened to fulfill Executive Order 13445,  reported that there was no unified federal research agenda for adult  education, and that, across Education, HHS, Labor, and NIFL, each entity  invested in research addressing its individual programmatic needs without  considering holistically what educators and policymakers need to know  about adult learning. The group recommended greater collaboration in  research planning efforts to leverage funds to invest in high-quality  scientific research. Specifically, the group recommended that federal  agencies meet annually to discuss current and planned research efforts to  provide agencies with the opportunity to coordinate their efforts and  permit them to plan joint research efforts when possible. In technical  comments on a draft of this report, Education indicated that it intends to  address the recommendations of the working group, but is \u201cawaiting any  final decisions until appropriate leadership positions at Education have  been filled under the new administration.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The landscape for providing English language instruction to adults is  multifaceted. In addition to the numerous federal programs identified in  this report, English language instruction can also be provided by for-profit  vendors, private employers, and volunteer organizations. Regarding  federal support, there is a wide array of federal programs that may provide  English language instruction to adults, yet little data on the extent to  which these programs are providing English language instruction. Because  they vary greatly in purpose and focus, it is understandable that these  programs do not collect data on the extent of support for adult English  language instruction; however, in our view, more coordinated information  sharing across these programs and their agencies would have a number of  possible benefits. Specifically, coordinated information sharing may help  agencies assess the demand for services and find the best ways to deliver  those services, help agencies discover inefficiencies in program operations  and make improvements that may reduce program costs or increase the  number of people served, and help to improve the quality of services by  learning about the most effective way to deliver services and obtain  positive outcomes. During our review, we found a few instances in which  agencies shared information about their initiatives, but we also found  instances of missed opportunities to use resources and information to  benefit the missions of more than one agency. Similarly, during our  review, we found that the agencies invested resources in research studies  without taking steps to consider other research needs or plans across  agencies. Greater collaboration in research planning could ensure that  limited funds for research are put to the best possible use in a field in  which there is little research indicating what is effective. Such planning  efforts would allow agencies to think more globally about the needs and  priorities for research in this area and could help to build a common base  of knowledge to inform practitioners on effective approaches to English  language instruction for adults. The speed with which adult English  language learners acquire English proficiency not only affects the  livelihood of these learners and their children, but also their ability to  effectively participate in civic life. Without a more coordinated approach,  the limited resources available to facilitate English language learning  among those who seek it may not be used to their optimal benefit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that federal programs, states, and local providers are able to  optimize resources and knowledge in providing adult English language  instruction, we recommend that the Secretary of Education work with the  Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Labor, and  other agencies as appropriate to develop a coordinated approach for  routinely and systematically sharing information that can assist federal  programs, states, and local providers in achieving efficient service  provision. Such coordination may include the following activities:    developing interagency agreements for sharing information on resources  that states and local programs may leverage for adult English language  learning,   devising a plan for routinely sharing information on available technical  reviewing the extent to which federal guidance assists local providers in  leveraging resources,   meeting regularly to discuss efforts under way in each agency and to  consider potential for joint initiatives, or   establishing clear time frames for the accomplishment of joint objectives.", "To ensure the most efficient use of available research resources and to  inform practitioners and other stakeholders in the area of adult English  language instruction, we recommend that the Secretary of Education work  with the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of  Labor, and the National Institute for Literacy to implement a coordinated  strategy for planning and conducting research on effective approaches to  providing adult English language instruction and disseminating the  research results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Education, the  Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Labor, and  the National Institute for Literacy for review and comment.

Overall, to address these  research objectives, we selected three key federal agencies\u2014the  Departments of Education, Health and Human Services (HHS), and  Labor\u2014to be included in the scope of our review. We selected these  agencies on the basis of their missions to administer education- and  workforce-related programs. We also selected these agencies because of  their mandate to collaborate with the National Institute for Literacy  (NIFL), which is tasked with serving as a resource to support literacy\u2014the  development of reading and writing skills\u2014across all age groups.", "To answer all of our research objectives, we also conducted state and  local interviews in California, Illinois, Minnesota, and Washington State.  We selected these states for our site visits because they provided a mix of  large, adult limited English proficient populated states (California and  Illinois) and high-growth states (Minnesota and Washington State). We  also selected these states for diversity in administrative structures and  practices under way regarding adult English language learning. For  example, Minnesota\u2019s and California\u2019s Adult Education State Grant  Programs are housed within their state education agencies, while Illinois\u2019  and Washington State\u2019s are housed in the community college agencies. In  addition to these site visits, we selected 12 states for semistructured  telephone interviews with state officials responsible for administering the  Adult Education State Grant Program. Of these 12 states, 6 were selected  because they had the largest adult limited English proficient populations  in the nation in 2007 (California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New York,  and Texas), and the other 6 states were selected because they had the  highest growth rates in their adult limited English proficient populations  from 2000 to 2007 (Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Nevada, and  Tennessee). To determine the states with the largest and highest growth  adult limited English proficient populations, we used U.S. Census Bureau  data on the English speaking ability of adults ages 18 and over who speak  a language other than English at home. Specifically, we used American  Community Survey (ACS) data for 2007 to determine the largest adult  limited English proficient populated states, and we used 2000 Census data  and 2007 ACS data to determine the states with the highest growth.  Together, the 12 states account for 75 percent of the national adult limited  English proficient population and 75 percent of the Adult Education State  Grant Program\u2019s national enrollment in English language classes for 2007.  In addition, we consulted with outside researchers, academics, industry  associations, union representatives, and others\u2014including the American  Library Association, AFL-CIO, Asian-American Justice Center, Association  of Farmworker Opportunity Programs, Catholic Legal Immigration  Network, Center for Law and Social Policy, Institute for the Study of  International Migration, Literacywork International, Migration Policy  Institute, National Association of Manufacturers, National Council of State  Directors of Adult Education, National Center for Family Literacy,  National Coalition for Literacy, National Council of La Raza, National Job  Corps Association, Pew Hispanic Center, Proliteracy, Refugee Council  USA, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.", "To determine what is known about trends in the need and enrollment in  federally funded programs, we reviewed and analyzed Census and ACS  data on English language speaking ability for 2000 to 2007. Both the  decennial Census and ACS collect self-reported information on the English  language speaking ability of respondents who speak a language other than  English at home. Specifically, respondents are asked whether they speak  English \u201cvery well,\u201d \u201cwell,\u201d \u201cnot well,\u201d or \u201cnot at all.\u201d To assess the  reliability of the Census Bureau data, we (1) reviewed Census Bureau  documents and external literature on the reliability of the data and (2) met  with internal GAO staff knowledgeable about the reliability of the Census  Bureau data. We also reviewed Adult Education State Grant Program  enrollment data for 2000 to 2007 reported in the Adult Education National  Reporting System (NRS). To assess the reliability of data reported by  Education, we (1) reviewed NRS implementation guidelines,   (2) interviewed agency officials knowledgeable about the data, and   (3) interviewed officials responsible for administering their Adult  Education State Grants in the 14 states included in our review about  procedures used to ensure the reliability of the data they report to the  NRS. We determined that both the Census Bureau and NRS data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our report. However, it is  important to note a few limitations of and modifications to the data.  Regarding the Census Bureau data, the data are self-reported by  respondents, and are not based on any standard assessment of speaking  ability. Additionally, the data are limited to English speaking ability, and  do not ask respondents to assess their abilities in reading or writing  English. Regarding the NRS data, the definitions of the NRS English  language levels changed in 2006. Specifically, the highest level was  removed and one of the lowest levels was broken into two levels. We note  this change when we discuss enrollment trends by level in the report. In  addition, Education officials within the Office of Vocational and Adult  Education (OVAE), as well as state officials responsible for administering  their Adult Education State Grant programs, reported federal and state  efforts to improve NRS data over the last several years. Specifically, OVAE  also issued a data quality checklist for use by states to certify compliance  with assessment policies and developed monitoring tools for OVAE  monitoring site visits. OVAE and state officials reported training and  technical assistance, and some of the state officials with whom we spoke  reported state data systems that have improved their ability to ensure the  data are reliable. It is also important to note that the NRS only includes  data for programs funded by the Adult Education State Grant Program. We  also reviewed information on adult literacy from the National Household  Education Surveys (NHES) and the 2003 National Assessment of Adult  Literacy (NAAL), both sponsored by the National Center for Education  Statistics. To identify whether other federal programs that allow for adult  English language learning have national enrollment data specific to such  instruction, we also interviewed federal agency and program officials for  agencies included in the scope of our review.", "To assess the nature of federal support, we identified federal programs  that allow for adult English language learning within Education, HHS, and  Labor. To do this, we began by interviewing federal agency officials about  programs within their agencies supporting adult English language learning  and reviewing the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance and other  relevant literature. We reviewed federal laws and interviewed federal  officials responsible for each program to verify that the programs allow for  English language learning for adults and to learn about the extent that they  collect data on spending and other data related to adult participation in  English language instruction in their programs. We also identified some of  the federal programs through interviews and data gathered from local  providers of English language programs in the 4 states we visited, and  corroborated this information with our review of the law and interviews  with federal program officials. For the purposes of identifying programs,  we generally defined adults as those who were at least age 16 and not  enrolled in secondary school. The programs identified in this report may  not capture all programs that support English language learning for adults  within the three agencies. We reviewed agency strategic plans, and for the  programs included in our review, performance reports and the Office of  Management and Budget\u2019s Performance Assessment Rating Tool. We  interviewed Job Corps Center managers and obtained information from   28 National Farmworkers\u2019 Job Program grantees about their experiences  in serving English language learners. In addition, in the 4 states we visited,  we also met with state program officials responsible for administering  their Adult Education State Grant, Even Start, refugee and Temporary  Assistance for Needy Families programs, and Workforce Investment Act of  1998 (WIA) title I programs. We visited multiple WIA one-stops, Even Start  providers, a Head Start grantee, a Community Services Block Grant  grantee, a Job Corps Center, a Youthbuild site, a National Farmworkers\u2019  Job Program grantee, two community-based organizations (CBO)  receiving Trade Adjustment Assistance funds, and grantees of special  Labor initiatives.", "To determine ways in which states and local providers support English  language learning for adults, we conducted semistructured telephone  interviews with officials responsible for administering the Adult Education  State Grants in the 12 states that we have previously mentioned. In the   4 states we visited, in addition to interviewing state officials responsible  for administering federal programs as we discuss in the previous  paragraph, we also interviewed providers of adult English language  programs. In sum, we interviewed 16 CBOs, 11 community colleges, and 8  adult schools. In selecting providers to visit, we considered  recommendations from state officials. We asked state officials responsible  for administering their adult education and refugee programs to  recommend local providers with the following criteria in mind:  demonstrated effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, leveraged community  resources or developed private partnerships, exhibited promising  practices, or reduced waiting lists. We selected providers from their  recommendations to get a range of different types of providers. These  interviews focused on ways in which English language instruction is  provided, spending and cost, coordination with other public and private  entities, and challenges to supporting English language learning.", "To determine what federal research is planned in this area, we met with  federal officials from Education, HHS, and Labor for the programs  included in this review.
