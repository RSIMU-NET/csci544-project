To encourage employers to establish and maintain pension  plans for their employees, the federal government provides preferential tax  treatment under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) for plans that meet  certain requirements. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that in  fiscal year 2000 the tax expenditure for qualified employer-sponsored  pension plans will be about $76 billion. In exchange for preferential tax  treatment, an employer is required to design the pension plan within legal  limits that are intended to improve the equitable distribution and security  of pension benefits. There has been recent controversy concerning how  conversions of traditional defined benefit pension plans to cash balance  plans can affect workers, especially those nearing retirement. Questions  have also been raised about the application of current tax qualification  requirements to this new type of pension plan.", "You asked us to (1) describe the prevalence and major features of cash  balance plans and reasons why firms adopt them; (2) discuss how the use  of cash balance plans can affect the pension benefits for workers of  different ages and tenure, particularly after conversion; and (3) determine  what information employers converting to cash balance plans typically  provide to plan participants and how disclosure might be improved.", "To address your questions, we conducted a random sample survey of 420  firms on the 1999 Fortune 1000 list and reviewed pension plan documents  to examine the features of cash balance plans. In addition, we conducted  in-depth interviews with officials from 14 firms with cash balance or similar  plans to discuss why they adopted such plans and to obtain information  about how firms disclosed changes to their pension programs. We modeled  pension plan design features to compare pension benefits provided by a  \u201cbasic\u201d cash balance plan and a defined benefit plan with a final average  pay formula, common to large defined benefit plans. Also, we interviewed  various federal agency officials, pension consultants, and actuaries.

According  to Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) survey data, most participants in large  and medium-sized firms\u2019 defined benefit plans are covered by plans that  use a final average pay formula that is based on years of service, average  earnings over a specific number of years, and a multiplier. For example, a  final average pay formula might determine benefits on the basis of 1.25  percent multiplied by years of service completed multiplied by the employee\u2019s average salary over the past 5 years of service. Defined benefit  plans typically express an accrued pension benefit as an annuity beginning  at the plan-specified normal retirement age. The firm, as the plan sponsor,  is responsible for funding the promised benefit, investing and managing the  plan assets, and bearing the investment risk.", "Under defined contribution plans such as 401(k) plans, workers have  individual accounts to which employers, employees, or both make periodic  contributions. Defined contribution plan benefits are based on the  contributions to and investment returns on these accounts. Employees  bear the risk of poor investment performance and often control, at least in  part, how the funds are invested.", "Cash balance plans are referred to as hybrid plans because legally they are  defined benefit plans but contain features that resemble defined  contribution plans. Similar to traditional defined benefit plans, cash  balance plans use a formula to determine pension benefits. However, cash  balance plans express benefits as an \u201caccount balance.\u201d An employee  account balance is based on hypothetical pay credits (percentage of salary  or compensation) and hypothetical interest credits to employee accounts  rather than an annuity. As with other defined benefit plans, under cash  balance plans, employee pension benefits are paid from commingled funds  invested in a pension trust on behalf of all participants, and plan trustees  have a fiduciary responsibility for all assets in the pension trust.  Hypothetical account balances need not be related to investment returns  on assets in the plan\u2019s pension trust, and hypothetical accounts are not  credited with the plan\u2019s actual investment gains or losses. Employees  neither own these \u201caccounts\u201d nor generally make investment decisions.  Cash balance plans are defined benefit plans because federal pension law  defines any pension plan that does not provide individual accounts with  benefits based solely on those accounts as a defined benefit plan.", "Federal law provides specific rules on how pension benefits must be  accrued in order for plans to receive favorable tax treatment as well as  safeguards to preserve benefits that participants have already earned. The  law prohibits firms from amending a plan\u2019s benefit formula to reduce  benefits that have already accrued. Firms can, however, change a pension  plan\u2019s benefit formula to prospectively reduce or eliminate future benefit  accruals. For example, defined benefit plan formulas can be amended to  reduce the percentage of final pay used in the future to determine the  annual benefit or limit the number of years over which benefits accrue.  Firms can also terminate their pension plans. Defined benefit plan  sponsors that terminate their plans are subject to an excise tax of up to 50  percent on any surplus assets in their pension trusts if they do not share  excess pension assets with participants.", "The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) mandates  the types of information that must be disclosed to plan participants. The  law requires firms to provide all plan participants with a summary plan  description that describes the terms of the plan. Furthermore, whenever  there is a significant change to the plan (called a plan amendment), firms  must provide participants with a summary of the changes no later than 210  days after the end of the plan year in which the changes are adopted,  known as a summary of material modification. Firms must notify  participants of amendments that will result in a significant reduction in the  rate of future benefit accrual at least 15 days before the effective date. This  notification can entail providing either a copy of the amendment to the plan  or a written summary of the change.", "IRS, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), and the  Department of Labor\u2019s Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration  (PWBA) are primarily responsible for enforcing laws related to private  pensions. IRS enforces participation, vesting, and funding standards that  concern how participants become eligible to participate in benefit plans  and earn rights to benefits and that ensure that plans have sufficient assets  to pay promised benefits. PWBA enforces ERISA\u2019s reporting and disclosure  provisions and fiduciary standards, which concern how plans should  operate in the best interest of participants. PBGC insures the benefits of  participants in most private defined benefit pension plans. Employers can  voluntarily submit an application to IRS, seeking approval of their plan  when it is started, when the plan is amended to comply with law changes or  plan design changes, or when the plan is terminated.", "Under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, it is unlawful for  employers to sponsor a defined benefit plan that stops a benefit accrual or  reduces the rate of an employee\u2019s benefit accrual because of age. The  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces federal law  prohibiting employment discrimination, including discrimination based on  age (aged 40 and older). IRC and ERISA have similar provisions prohibiting  a defined benefit plan from ceasing accruals or reducing the rate of accrual  because of the attainment of any age.", "Prompted by concern from members of the Congress and charges by  participants in plans that were converted, federal agencies are now  reviewing age discrimination and other issues raised by cash balance plans.  In September 1999, EEOC began a review of potential age discrimination  issues in cash balance conversions and is coordinating with agencies that  are responsible for administering federal pension laws. Within the past  year, more than 800 workers and retirees have filed age discrimination  charges with EEOC concerning cash balance plans. EEOC has opened 34  cases to investigate these charges. The Department of the Treasury and IRS  are currently reviewing tax qualification issues raised by cash balance  plans. For example, in September 1999, IRS announced that it would begin  requiring that applications for the approval of cash balance formula designs  be forwarded to its headquarters for technical review, resulting in an  effective moratorium on approving conversions to cash balance plans. In  addition, in October 1999 IRS announced that it was soliciting public  comments on issues related to the conversion of traditional defined benefit  formulas to cash balance formulas. Further, in July 2000, the Office of  Management and Budget issued a Statement of Administration Policy  proposing legislative action to address certain issues raised by conversions  to cash balance plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cash Balance Plans Are Increasingly Common, and Plan Features Vary", "paragraphs": ["Few firms that we surveyed on the 1999 Fortune 1000 list that sponsor cash  balance plans adopted such plans before the early 1990s.

Firms adopted cash balance formulas for a variety of  reasons, including reducing total pension costs, increasing portability to  enhance the recruitment of younger or more mobile workers, and adding a lump sum benefit feature that can be used to better explain pension  benefits to workers.

Instead, these plans cover particular segments  of a firm\u2019s workforce such as managers or salaried employees or certain  workers in a firm\u2019s subsidiary. Most cash balance plans we identified in our  survey (an estimated 69 percent) have fewer than 10,000 active participants  (see fig. 1), including 8 percent with no active participants because benefit  accruals are frozen. The most common reason sponsors froze a cash  balance plan was that the plan was acquired as part of a merger or  acquisition and the firm did not want to continue the cash balance plan.", "The earliest known cash balance plan has been in use since 1925, but such  plans have become prominent since the 1980s. The earliest a firm in our  survey had adopted a cash balance plan was 1985; more than 60 percent of  the cash balance plans we identified have been adopted in the past 5  years. Firms sponsoring these plans exist in many sectors of the economy,  but the greater concentrations are found in the financial services, health  care, and manufacturing industries. Some of these firms have undergone  mergers or acquisitions and have adopted cash balance plans to  \u201charmonize\u201d benefits\u2014that is, to provide the same pension plan for  employees who had been covered by different plans. Most firms in our  survey that sponsor cash balance plans previously covered their workers  under another defined benefit plan. Other firms started cash balance plans  as their first pension plan or to supplement existing defined contribution  plans.", "While we were told by pension practitioners, employer associations, and  agency officials of firms\u2019 continuing interest in cash balance or similar  hybrid plan designs, few of the firms we surveyed expected to adopt a cash  balance plan in the future. About 3 percent of the firms we surveyed told us  that they were considering whether to adopt a cash balance plan within the  next 5 years, and about a third of these, or 1 percent of Fortune 1000 firms,  told us that they plan to adopt a cash balance plan next year. All the firms  considering adopting a cash balance plan told us that the continuing  uncertainty as to whether such plans violate pension and age  discrimination laws might discourage them from converting their plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Firms Adopt Cash Balance Plans for Different Reasons", "paragraphs": ["Firms sponsoring cash balance plans told us that their decision to adopt  these plans was based on a combination of factors such as the desire to  become more competitive within their specific industry and to address  changing workforce demographics. For example, some firms decided to  adopt cash balance plans in order to improve their ability to recruit new  workers by providing them with higher pension benefits earlier in their  careers and allowing lump sum distributions so that pension benefits are  more portable. Other firms told us, however, that they decided not to use  cash balance plans because they had older or long-tenured workforces that  could be adversely affected by a change to a cash balance plan.", "Some firms we surveyed that chose to convert their plans cited the  financial implications of changing to a cash balance plan as a key reason in  their decision. Reducing the overall cost of the defined benefit plan was a  primary reason some firms converted to a cash balance formula. For  example, some firms have reduced costs by eliminating early retirement  subsidies on future accruals. A PricewaterhouseCoopers survey of 100  cash balance plan sponsors found that 56 percent of firms expected the  long-term cost of their defined benefit plans to decrease after conversion.  Even when enhancements to other retirement programs were considered  in conjunction with a conversion, 33 percent of the firms expected a  decrease in the costs of their total retirement benefits package. However,  a few firms we surveyed reported that converting to a cash balance plan  increased the cost of their defined benefit plan because their plan provided  a higher level of benefit for all workers.", "Converting to cash balance plans is also an alternative to terminating a  pension plan. Firms can terminate their defined benefit plans, but doing so  imposes various economic costs. When plan sponsors terminate defined  benefit plans, the sponsors must pay income and excise taxes on any  surplus assets, immediately vest participants in their accrued benefits, and  provide participants with annuities or lump sum payments. These costs  may prevent some firms from terminating their plans. Instead, firms can  convert to cash balance plans and achieve economic benefits from the  surplus pension funds without incurring the costs related to plan  termination. For example, converting to a cash balance plan can extend the  period of time a firm would not have to make a contribution to the pension  plan while still having the plan considered to be fully funded or  overfunded\u2014that is, the value of plan assets meet or exceed the value of  currently accrued pension benefits. Also, after a conversion, if the pension  plan\u2019s assets earn a higher rate of return than the interest rate credited to  hypothetical employee accounts, this can lower the overall cost of  maintaining the cash balance plan.", "Firms deciding not to adopt a cash balance formula cited increased costs as  influencing their decision. These costs included increased administrative  costs such as consultants\u2019 fees to design the plan formula and the costs of  developing individualized participant statements. In addition, cash balance  plans can have ongoing administrative costs that are higher than those  typically incurred by traditional defined benefit or defined contribution  plans. Firms also cited the potential cost of special plan provisions to  protect the benefits of workers nearing retirement as another reason not to  convert.", "Firms that adopted cash balance plans reported that the opportunity for the  increased portability of benefits influenced their decision to adopt such  plans. The lump sum benefit distribution feature common to most cash  balance plans allows eligible workers, upon separation, to gain access to  their pension benefit. These firms believed that offering a pension plan  with such a benefit feature would enhance their recruitment of younger,  relatively mobile workers. While traditional defined benefit plans can  provide lump sum payments, historically many of these plans have not  done so. Most of the plans in our survey did not allow lump sum  distributions above $5,000 before converting to a cash balance plan.  Instead, participants generally received their benefits as an annuity at  retirement. The percentage of plans in our survey offering lump sum  distributions at both separation and retirement increased from 15 percent  before conversion to 83 percent after conversion. Most of the firms we  conducted in-depth interviews with stated that after conversion the  majority of vested participants who have separated from the firm or retired  opted for a lump sum payment, indicating its popularity.", "Most firms that expressed a desire to attract and hire more mobile workers  as a reason for converting did not, however, change their vesting  requirement when converting from a traditional defined benefit plan to a  cash balance plan. As under traditional defined benefit plans, workers  under a cash balance plan must remain with a firm long enough to earn a  right to such benefits. Large defined benefit plans typically have a \u201ccliff\u201d  vesting requirement\u2014that is, participants are 100 percent vested in their  benefits after a certain number of years, with no rights to a pension benefit  if they leave the firm before then. Most of these large plans have 100  percent vesting after 5 years. Seventy-two percent of the firms we surveyed  with cash balance plans had a 5-year cliff vesting requirement, while the  remaining firms sponsoring cash balance plans had various vesting  requirements, including graded vesting.", "Finally, firms deciding to convert told us that employees better understand  benefits under cash balance plans than under traditional defined benefit  plans. Because benefits under cash balance plans are expressed as lump  sum values rather than retirement-age annuities, some employees may  better understand and value such plans. Furthermore, according to  company officials, given that many of these employees also have a 401(k)  plan, the cash balance plan is more \u201cvisible\u201d and comparable to benefits  under the 401(k) plans. This is in contrast to the view many employees  have of their benefits under traditional defined benefit plans. Human  resource and benefits officials at several firms we visited said that defined  benefit plans have been one of the least understood and least appreciated  benefits in a worker\u2019s compensation package. Employees rarely focused on  the benefits from a defined benefit plan until they neared retirement age."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Variations in Plan Design Features", "paragraphs": ["As with traditional pension plans, significant variation exists in cash  balance plan designs, particularly the benefit formulas. Thirty-five percent  of cash balance plans in our survey provide level pay credits for all  participants, regardless of age or years of service. Most plans, however,  provide pay credits that increase, based on participant age or service. For  example, one plan provides an annual pay credit of 3 percent of salary for  participants younger than 30 that increases in increments up to 11 percent  for participants aged 50 and older. Another plan provides annual pay  credits of 3 percent for participants with 4 or fewer years of service with  incremental increases up to 9 percent for participants with 25 or more  years of service. About 30 percent of the cash balance plans in our survey,  because they were integrated with Social Security, provided participants  with higher pay credits on pay above the Social Security wage base. For  example, two plans provided 4 percent of pay for earnings that were  subject to Social Security taxes ($76,200 in 2000) and 8 percent for earnings  that were not subject to Social Security taxes.", "Cash balance plans generally credit interest to participant hypothetical  accounts using an index tied to a Treasury security. About 80 percent of the  cash balance plans in our survey tied interest credit rates in their plan  formulas to the rate of return on a Treasury security. For example, we  found that many cash balance plans credit interest on the basis of the yield  to maturity for 30-year Treasury bonds, but some cash balance plans credit  interest on the basis of the yield to maturity for 1-year Treasury bonds or  another Treasury index."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conversions Can Be Advantageous for Some Workers but Can Result in Lower Benefits at Retirement for Others", "paragraphs": ["Conversions to cash balance plans can result in higher pension benefits  accruing earlier in a worker\u2019s career and increased portability of benefits,  which can be advantageous to younger or more mobile workers.

Conversions can also result in periods during  which older workers accrue no new pension benefits while others do.

Traditional defined benefit plans express  benefits as the normal retirement age annuity the participant has accrued  to date. Typically, participants under a defined benefit plan with a final  average pay formula accrue the greatest share of their benefits in the final  years of their careers because benefits are based on completed years of  service and final average salary, both of which usually increase as workers  age. Generally, under a cash balance plan, the basis for determining  benefits payable at normal retirement age includes both the hypothetical  account balance (annual pay and interest credits) accrued to date plus the  value of future hypothetical interest credits each pay credit would earn up  to the plan\u2019s normal retirement age. As shown in figure 2, workers under a  cash balance plan who have many years before reaching normal retirement  age earn a greater proportion of their benefits early in their careers.", "Cash balance plans can result in a decreasing rate at which normal  retirement benefits accrue over time. The rate at which normal retirement  benefits accrue in both defined benefit final average pay plans and cash  balance plans depends on the number of years participants have remaining  until they reach the plan-specified normal retirement age. However, in a  defined benefit plan with a final average pay formula, the rate of normal  retirement benefit accrual increases as participants age, being driven by  growth in service and wages. As with defined benefit plans, under the law,  the accrued benefit in cash balance plans must be expressed as an annual  benefit beginning at normal retirement age. Cash balance plans must express benefits in this manner to comply with defined benefit plan rules.  For the purposes of satisfying these rules, employee hypothetical accounts  are not equal to the accrued benefits participants are entitled to receive. As  a result, cash balance plans cannot simply provide participants  hypothetical account balances as their benefit. Instead, the hypothetical  balance must be calculated to comply with defined benefit plan accrual and  other requirements.", "When a worker\u2019s hypothetical account balance in a given year is projected  forward with hypothetical interest to normal retirement age, the rate of  normal retirement benefit accrual declines as the employee ages, because  each additional year\u2019s pay credit will have one less year in which future  interest will compound. This declining rate of accrual results from plans  providing for future interest credits in accordance with IRS Notice 96-8.  The notice discusses the applicability of defined benefit plan rules to cash  balance plans and provides that the accrual of future interest credits  attributable to hypothetical pay credits may be required in the year in  which the pay credit is allocated to a worker\u2019s account.", "To demonstrate how a worker earns pension benefits under a traditional  final average pay plan and a basic cash balance plan, we calculated several  scenarios for workers of different ages. These hypothetical scenarios  assume that a worker participates under either a basic cash balance plan or  traditional final average pay formula (no conversion) until retirement and  that the formulas result in equivalent benefits at retirement. In reality,  workers may have very discontinuous work histories, work at many  different places under various pension plans, or retire early.", "Our comparative design scenarios illustrate the declining rate of normal  retirement benefit accrual inherent in cash balance plans. The basic cash  balance plans we simulated add annuity benefits to a participant\u2019s total  pension benefit at smaller dollar increments each year that the participant  ages. For example, a 25-year-old worker who is assumed to participate in  a cash balance plan until retirement at age 65 accrues an incremental  annuity benefit of approximately $1,660 at age 26 but earns a smaller  incremental benefit of about $630 at age 65. In contrast, the traditional final  average pay plan provided normal retirement benefits at an increasing rate  as workers age. The same 25-year-old worker earns an incremental annuity  benefit of $310 at age 26 but earns a higher incremental benefit of about  $2,440 at age 65. The basic cash balance plan produced a declining rate of  normal retirement benefit accrual for all hypothetical workers we modeled.  (See fig. 3.)", "A cash balance plan\u2019s declining rate of normal retirement benefit accrual as  workers age is the reason some have charged that these plans are age  discriminatory. Cash balance proponents define the accrued benefit as the  employee\u2019s hypothetical account balance. Under this definition, cash  balance plans generate a level rate of accrual for all employees regardless  of age and therefore do not appear to raise issues of disparate treatment of  employees based on age. Critics state that cash balance plans, as defined  benefit plans under the law, must express an employee\u2019s accrued benefit as  an annual benefit beginning at normal retirement age or the actuarial  equivalent to a deferred annuity. When cash balance plans are viewed in  this way, the amount of the actuarially determined benefit is a function of  the participant\u2019s age and decreases as the participant ages. Therefore,  critics argue, cash balance plans violate the prohibition on age  discrimination. Federal agencies are considering the issue of whether cash  balance plans violate age discrimination statutes. Participants have filed a  number of court cases alleging that cash balance plans are age  discriminatory but no definitive decision has been reached.", "There is uncertainty concerning whether plan sponsors must adhere to IRS\u2019  guidance on calculating cash balance benefits. The methodology described  in Notice 96-8 has been subject to legal challenge in federal court. Two  recent U.S. Court of Appeals decisions have approved the methodology.  When Notice 96-8 was issued, IRS characterized it as including proposed  interest rate equivalencies that were to be incorporated in a subsequent  regulation, but nothing more has been promulgated on this subject.  However, IRS has determined whether cash balance plans comply with  current defined benefit plan requirements on the basis of its position that  Notice 96-8 represents current law.", "It should be noted that a cash balance plan can result in a declining rate of  normal retirement benefit accrual over a worker\u2019s career but not  necessarily a lower benefit than a defined benefit plan with a final average  pay formula would provide. The actual benefit that any individual worker  would receive under either plan would depend on a variety of factors,  particularly the actual design of the specific pension plan. Workers under a  cash balance plan who leave a firm before retiring could ultimately achieve  either a higher or a lower pension benefit at retirement. For example, a  worker who elected a lump sum payment option could receive a higher or  lower retirement benefit, depending on the rate of return of the  investments and whether the money were preserved until retirement. We  discuss these issues in more detail in another report we issued  concurrently on the potential implications of cash balance plans on  retirement income."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conversions to Cash Balance Plans Can Provide Higher Benefits for Some Workers", "paragraphs": ["Conversions to cash balance plans can have distributional effects in terms  of the lump sum benefits that favor vested younger workers and short- tenure workers. This group can be a significant percentage of a firm\u2019s  workforce, depending on the specific firm and industry.

For many workers, these distributions can be greater than those provided  by a plan with a final average pay formula.", "We compared lump sum benefits that basic cash balance plans can provide  with lump sum benefits from the traditional final average pay formula after  conversion for the workers we modeled.  Compared with the final average  pay formula, the basic cash balance plan formula can provide larger lump  sum distributions for the younger workers we modeled for a period of time  after conversion. For example, anytime within the next 14 years, a 35-year- old worker at conversion would receive higher lump sum benefits from the  cash balance plan upon leaving the firm. As shown in table 1, a 30-year-old  at conversion would when leaving a firm receive a larger lump sum  distribution from the cash balance plan at any given age until reaching 53.", "As with traditional defined benefit plans, workers must meet a plan\u2019s  vesting requirement before they have a right to their accrued pension  benefit. BLS reported that median tenure among all workers aged 25 and  older was 4.7 years in 1998, indicating that some workers change jobs  before vesting. As we discussed earlier, most cash balance plans, like many  traditional defined benefit plans, have a 5-year vesting requirement. Plan  sponsors we interviewed told us that the 5-year vesting requirement of  many cash balance plans results in some short-term, mobile workers\u2019 not  benefiting from the higher benefits provided by cash balance plans because  they leave before vesting and forfeit their accrued benefits.", "In addition to increasing the value of preretirement lump sum distributions  for many workers, conversions to cash balance plans can benefit workers  in other ways. For example, because cash balance plans spread benefit  accruals more evenly over a worker\u2019s career than a traditional defined  benefit plan with a final average pay formula does, workers can accrue  higher benefits sooner. This is especially important for workers who  change jobs frequently or move in and out of the workforce. According to a  Society of Actuaries study of vested workers with 5 or more years of  service, 45 percent of workers terminate employment before completing 10  years of service. This length of service allows workers to earn a right to  their pension benefits. Generally, cash balance plans allow vested  participants to receive preretirement lump sum distributions when they  leave a firm. Many traditional defined benefit plans, however, do not offer  such an option. When participants leave firms that sponsor final average  pay or other traditional defined benefit plans, their normal retirement-age  annuity benefits are frozen when they separate.

We used our  model to compare the annuity benefit provided by a basic cash balance  plan at normal retirement age with the annuity that a traditional final  average pay formula would have generated at retirement had no conversion  occurred and the traditional plan continued unchanged. After conversion,  the decreasing rate of normal retirement benefit accrual in the basic cash  balance plan we modeled produces a lower annuity at retirement compared  with the annuity benefit that traditional final average pay formula would  generate. For example, a 45-year-old worker at the time of conversion  receives an annual annuity of about $18,500 at retirement from the cash  balance plan instead of the $39,800 annuity the worker could have received  from the defined benefit plan with a final average pay formula. Likewise, a  worker 50 years old at conversion receives an annual annuity of about  $17,800 from the cash balance plan rather than the $35,100 annuity the final  average pay formula could have provided. For all workers we modeled,  conversions to the basic cash balance plan resulted in lower annuities at  the plan\u2019s normal retirement age than resulting from the final average pay  formula.", "For workers with equal salary and tenure at conversion, the basic cash  balance plan we modeled produces the lowest annuity at retirement for the  worker who was oldest at conversion. This results from older workers  having fewer years after conversion to earn benefits from the cash balance  formula and a lower rate of normal retirement benefit accrual compared  with the prior final average pay formula. For example, we modeled benefits  from a basic cash balance formula for a 35-, 45-, and 55-year-old worker  with equal salary and tenure at conversion. At retirement, the worker who  was 55 years old at conversion receives an annual annuity of $6,900 from  the cash balance plan, while the 35-year-old and 45-year-old workers  receive annuities of approximately $24,300 and $12,600 per year,  respectively, at retirement (see fig. 4). Conversion to the cash balance plan  resulted in lower annuities for each of these workers compared with the  annuities they would have received had no conversion occurred.

A  wearaway period is created at conversion when a participant\u2019s opening  hypothetical account balance is set at less than the present value of his or  her prior accrued benefits\u2014that is, the amount benefits would currently  equal if paid out as a lump sum. During wearaway, hypothetical pay and  interest credit contributions do not represent new pension accruals until  the cash balance account exceeds the value of benefits accrued under the  prior formula. This is because workers who leave a firm during a wearaway  period are entitled to receive the higher benefit they had accrued under the  old formula before conversion.", "Wearaway established at conversion tends to be longer for older workers.  For example, the basic cash balance plan we modeled as establishing  opening account balances at less than the present value of prior accrued  benefits generated a 2-year lump sum wearaway for a 35-year-old worker, a  4-year wearaway for a 45-year-old worker, and an 11-year wearaway for a  55-year-old worker at conversion (see table 2). This is because older  workers generally accrue larger benefits before conversion. Thus, older  workers must wait longer before their hypothetical balances catch up to  the value of prior accrued benefits and new benefits begin to accrue.  Wearaway created at conversion is also problematic for older workers  because these periods often occur during the years when the traditional  formula would have provided the most favorable rate of pension benefit  accrual for them had no conversion occurred.", "We also simulated several examples in which workers\u2019 salary and tenure  were equal at conversion in order to determine whether the length of a  wearaway created at conversion can differ for workers of different ages.  In most of these simulations, the length of a lump sum wearaway created at  conversion was extended 1 to 2 years for workers with equal salary and  tenure but different ages. For example, we found that a 45-year-old faces a  4-year wearaway at conversion, while a 55-year-old with the same salary  and tenure at conversion faces a 6-year wearaway. Another simulation we  modeled indicates that a 40-year-old worker faces a 3-year wearaway at  conversion while a 50-year-old worker with the same salary and tenure  faces a 4-year wearaway. Although our simulations show that differences in  wearaway periods based on age can be small, the older worker faces the  longer wearaway at conversion in every instance in which a difference in  wearaway periods emerged.", "Plan sponsors determine whether to create wearaway at conversion. When  defined benefit plan sponsors provide accrued benefits as preretirement  lump sum distributions, they must follow federally mandated assumptions.", "However, current federal law does not govern how plan sponsors set  opening hypothetical account balances for cash balance plans, provided  that a plan ensures that participants do not receive less than the present  value of prior accrued benefits if they separate from the employer. Plan  sponsors can set the opening balances with any discount rate and set of  mortality assumptions they choose. Thus, at conversion, cash balance plan  sponsors can select assumptions that establish opening account balances  at amounts lower than those they would be required to pay as lump sum  distributions of benefits accrued under the prior formula. Many firms,  however, choose not to create a wearaway at conversion. According to a  recent survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers, 60 percent of cash balance plan  conversions that established opening account balances at the value of prior  accrued benefits used a discount rate equal to or lower than the mandatory  discount rate at conversion, thereby avoiding wearaway at conversion.", "Wearaway can also occur outside the control of plan sponsors after a  conversion. In this instance, wearaway occurs because of fluctuations in  the federally mandated discount rate for determining lump sum  distributions from defined benefit plans. The value of the distributions rises  when the mandatory discount rate falls, and the value falls when the  mandatory discount rate rises. Therefore, a falling mandatory discount rate  can generate wearaway while participants remain with the sponsor, even  when no wearaway was created at conversion. For example, we modeled a  scenario in which no wearaway was created at conversion and the  mandatory discount rate changes after conversion. Table 3 shows that the  fall in the discount rate 1 year after conversion causes the value of the  annuity benefit accrued under the prior formula to exceed the value of the  35-year-old worker\u2019s hypothetical account balance, resulting in a wearaway  period. Two years after conversion, the mandatory discount rate rises, and  the lump sum value of the participant\u2019s prior accrued benefit falls below the  participant\u2019s hypothetical account balance.", "In addition to arising from conversion of a final average pay formula to a  cash balance formula, wearaway can arise in relation to annuity benefits  that participants have earned as of conversion. For purposes of this report,  annuity wearaway refers to a period of time after conversion when the  annuity benefit produced by the cash balance formula is less than the  annuity benefit earned under the prior formula up to the date of  conversion. Whether annuity wearaway results from conversion to a cash  balance formula depends on several factors, including how the plan  sponsor determines opening balances, the cash balance formula design,  and whether the prior formula has an early retirement benefit.", "Annuity wearaways can arise as a result of conversion to a cash balance  formula, depending on the form of annuity benefit that the worker selects  and the design of early retirement benefits in the prior formula. Even when  no lump sum wearaway is established at conversion, annuity wearaway can  arise on the worker\u2019s accrued normal or early retirement benefits. For  example, as indicated above, the 45-year-old worker described in table 2  has a 4-year lump sum wearaway, assuming the account balance is  established with a 6.99 percent interest rate (the rate of return on 30-year  Treasuries plus 1 percent), but there would be no lump sum wearaway if  the opening account balance was established with a 5.99 percent interest  rate. Table 4 is based on an example in which the participant\u2019s opening  account balance was established as the minimum lump sum distribution of  prior accrued benefits from conversion of a final average pay formula with  an early retirement subsidy. In this example, there is a wearaway on both  the accrued normal retirement benefit and the early retirement benefit earned as of the date of conversion. Specifically, if the prior formula had  included a subsidized early benefit, the 45-year-old worker who elects to  receive early retirement benefits at age 60 has a 9-year wearaway of the  early retirement annuity benefit even if the opening balance is established  with the mandatory 417(e) discount rate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Transition Provisions Vary in How They Mitigate the Adverse Effects of Plan Changes on Older Workers", "paragraphs": ["Most of the Fortune 1000 firms we surveyed that adopted cash balance  plans included various provisions to mitigate the potential reductions in  some workers\u2019 benefits, but these provisions can vary in the extent to  which they mitigate potential reductions in expected benefits.

Some firms protected against a  potential reduction in future benefits by grandfathering plan participants at  the time of conversion. Grandfathering allows eligible participants to  continue accruing benefits under the prior formula or entails operating  both formulas and providing eligible participants with the greater benefit.  Grandfathering can be implemented in various ways, each affecting  different groups of workers. For example, in one firm in our survey eligible  participants who had a minimum of 60 points based on age and service at  the date of conversion receive benefits from the formula that provides the  greater benefit. Another firm in our survey allowed all participants aged 45  and older with a minimum of 60 points, based on age and service, to  continue accruing benefits under the prior formula.", "To mitigate the potentially adverse effects of adopting a cash balance  formula on older participants, some firms incorporated features such as  formulas that provide additional pay credits on the basis of a participant\u2019s  age or years of service or they increased opening account balances. For  example, one plan in our survey provides additional pay credits that range  from 5 to 10 percent (above the ongoing pay credit in the plan formula) for  eligible participants 40 years old or older at conversion that increase with  age.

We modeled conversions to several  variations of cash balance formulas with weighted pay credits for  hypothetical participants ranging from age 30 through age 55 at conversion,  and they produced similar results. For example, a 45-year-old participant  would receive an annuity of approximately $29,200 per year from a cash  balance plan with weighted pay credits compared with $18,500 from the  basic cash balance plan (see fig. 6).

This  redistribution can be advantageous for young or mobile workers but can  have adverse effects for older workers. Recognizing that some workers  face reductions in future benefits or periods of no new benefit accruals,  many firms have adopted transition provisions to mitigate the loss of  expected benefits for some of their workers. The trend toward cash  balance plans and other hybrid plan designs underscores the challenge of  developing a pension system that provides retirement income for a broad  complement of workers while ensuring benefit equity among various  groups of workers.", "The increased use of cash balance plans highlights the growing mismatch  between the continuing innovation in pension plan design and a regulatory  framework that is much slower to adapt to new designs. Although cash  balance plans legally are defined benefit plans, they do not fit neatly within  the current defined benefit plan regulatory structure. Consequently, this  mismatch has now resulted in considerable regulatory uncertainty for  employers, as well as litigation with potentially significant financial  liabilities and contradictory court decisions. For many workers, this  mismatch has also raised questions about the security of their retirement  income and the rights they have to their pension benefits. As a result,  additional protections are needed to address issues raised by the  emergence of cash balance and similar hybrid plan designs.
