The Medicare program's labor cost adjustment may not adequately account for geographic differences in hospital wages because of problems with the definition of labor markets. The geographic areas used by Medicare to approximate hospital labor markets often encompass large areas in which hospitals in different parts of an area or different types of communities pay widely varying wages. Geographic reclassification does not systematically address inadequacies in the way the Medicare program defines geographic areas, although it allows some, but not all, hospitals that may be in distinct labor market and pay wages above the average in their area to receive a higher labor cost adjustment. Geographic reclassification reduces payments to hospitals that do not reclassify because of the budget neutrality requirement, and the amount of this reduction would vary across hospitals under a state-specific budget neutrality approach depending on their location. In 2002, payments to metropolitan hospitals that were not reclassified were 1 percent lower and payments to nonmetropolitan hospitals that were not reclassified were 0.6 percent lower because of geographic reclassification.

The wage index reflects  how average hospital wages in each geographic area compare to average  hospital wages nationally. The geographic areas are intended to represent  the separate labor markets in which hospitals compete for employees.  Each metropolitan area, as defined by the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB), is considered a single labor market, and all areas outside  of metropolitan areas in each state are treated as a single labor market. All  hospitals within a given geographic area receive the same labor cost  adjustment. Thus, Medicare\u2019s payment to a hospital in an area with lower  wages is below the national average payment and the payment to a  hospital in a higher wage area is above the national average. In general,  hospitals in nonmetropolitan areas have lower wages than those in  metropolitan areas and therefore have a lower wage index and receive  lower Medicare payments. Conversely, hospitals in metropolitan areas  tend to pay higher wages than hospitals in nonmetropolitan areas and  receive higher Medicare payments.", "The labor cost adjustment has been criticized for failing to appropriately  adjust payments to reflect the average wages that some hospitals pay.  Some hospitals indicate that the wages they must pay are higher than the  average wages in their assigned geographic area because they must  compete for employees with hospitals in nearby, higher wage areas. To  address these concerns, the Congress in 1989 established an  administrative process for geographic reclassification, which allows  hospitals that meet criteria concerning their average wages and proximity  to a higher wage paying area to reclassify. A reclassified hospital is paid  based on the Medicare labor cost adjustment of the higher wage area. In  addition, certain specially designated rural hospitals can reclassify to a  higher wage area by meeting less stringent criteria. The Congress required  that the reclassification policy be budget neutral, that is, not change total  Medicare outlays, so the increased payments to reclassified hospitals are  offset by an across-the-board reduction in payments to other hospitals.", "In the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of  1999 (BBRA), the Congress directed us to evaluate Medicare\u2019s labor cost  adjustment policies. In consultation with the committees of jurisdiction,  we have examined (1) whether Medicare\u2019s labor cost adjustment accounts  appropriately for geographic variation in average wages, (2) the extent to  which reclassification addresses potential problems with Medicare\u2019s labor  cost adjustment, and (3) the effect of the budget neutrality adjustment on  hospitals that do not reclassify, including the impact of altering the budget  neutrality adjustment so that payment increases to reclassified hospitals in  a state would be funded by payment reductions to hospitals within the  same state, rather than across all hospitals nationwide, as is done now.", "To address these issues, we used 1997 Medicare hospital cost reports (the  comprehensive financial document that hospitals submit annually to  receive payment from Medicare) to analyze hospital wage data, because  1997 wage data were used to calculate the 2001 wage indexes. We also  analyzed more recent Medicare hospital cost report data, PPS Payment  Impact Files, and wage data in California Hospital Annual Disclosure  Reports submitted to the California Office of Statewide Health Planning  and Development. We also interviewed officials at the Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS); the Medicare Geographic  Classification Review Board (MGCRB), which reviews and approves  reclassification applications; and representatives of some hospitals that  have been reclassified.

The payment is based on  standardized amounts that are calculated separately for hospitals in large  metropolitan areas (with populations of 1 million or more) and for  hospitals in smaller metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. The  standardized amounts are the average cost of hospital stays for Medicare  beneficiaries based on historical data and are updated annually for  inflation. For 2001, the standardized amount for hospitals in large  metropolitan areas was $4,028 and for hospitals in other areas it was  $3,965.", "To determine a hospital\u2019s payment for a Medicare beneficiary\u2019s stay, the  standardized amount is adjusted to account for variation in the cost of  providing care to specific patients in specific locations. The labor cost  adjustment accounts for geographic variation in hospitals\u2019 labor costs,  because the wages hospitals must pay employees vary significantly by  area. The portion of the standardized amount (71 percent) that reflects  labor-related expenses is multiplied by the area wage index. The remaining  portion of the standardized amount (29 percent) is not adjusted. This part  of the payment\u2014which covers drugs, medical supplies, utilities, and other  nonlabor-related expenses\u2014is uniform nationwide because prices for  these items are not perceived as varying significantly from area to area.  The case-mix adjustment accounts for differences in resource  requirements across types of patients. It is based on the expected care  needs of the patient as measured by the diagnosis-related group (DRG)  patient classification system.", "Additional payments are made under PPS to compensate hospitals for  costs they incur in performing certain missions beyond caring for  individual patients. Teaching hospitals receive additional payments from  Medicare to account for costs associated with training medical residents.  Hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income Medicare and  Medicaid patients also receive additional Medicare payments. The  combination of all these adjustments and additional payments may result  in widely varying per-stay payments across different types of hospitals or  geographic areas."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Wage Index", "paragraphs": ["The Medicare labor cost adjustment is based on a wage index that is  computed for each of 324 metropolitan and 49 statewide nonmetropolitan  areas using data that hospitals submit to Medicare. The wage index for an  area is the ratio of the average hourly hospital wage in the area compared  to the national average hourly hospital wage. The average hourly wage is  calculated for each area by aggregating Medicare-allowable wages for all  the hospitals in the area and then dividing that sum by the corresponding  staff hours. The area\u2019s average hourly wage is then divided by the national  average hourly wage to produce the area\u2019s wage index. For example, if  the average hourly wage for all hospitals in a large metropolitan area was  $22.59, the wage index for that large metropolitan area would be $22.59  divided by the national average hourly wage of $21.77, for a wage index of  1.04. The wage indexes ranged from roughly 0.74 to 1.5 in 2001.", "As currently calculated, the wage indexes vary because of geographic  differences in wages paid and also because of variation in the mix of  higher- and lower- skilled workers employed in an area, termed  occupational mix. An area\u2019s average hourly wage can be higher than the  national average if hospitals in an area employ more highly skilled (and  thus more highly paid) workers and lower if an area\u2019s hospitals employ  more lower- skilled workers than the national average. When one area\u2019s  hospitals have a larger proportion of more skilled, higher wage staff than  another area, the former\u2019s wage index will be higher, even if wage rates in  both areas for staff with the same skills, such as registered nurses, are  identical. While geographic differences in wages paid affect a hospital\u2019s  labor costs but are largely beyond an individual hospital\u2019s ability to  control, the mix of occupations employed in a hospital reflects managerial  decisions. The Congress, in the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits  Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA), required the Secretary  of Health and Human Services to collect data on hospitals\u2019 mix of  employees and their corresponding wages and calculate wage indexes  beginning October 1, 2004, that are adjusted for occupational mix.

The two standard criteria that individual hospitals must meet to reclassify  for a higher wage index are intended to identify hospitals that have higher  average wages than other hospitals in their area because they are  competing for labor with hospitals in a different nearby area. The first  criterion concerns the hospital\u2019s proximity to the higher wage \u201ctarget\u201d  area. The proximity requirement is satisfied if the hospital is within a  specified number of miles of the target area or if at least half of the  hospital\u2019s employees reside in the target area. The second criterion  pertains to the hospital\u2019s wages relative to the average wages in the target  area.

These hospitals receive special  treatment from Medicare because of their role in preserving access to care  for beneficiaries in specified areas. RRCs are relatively large rural  hospitals providing an array of services and treating patients from a wide  geographic area. SCHs are small hospitals isolated from other hospitals by  location, weather, or travel conditions. RRCs and SCHs do not have to  meet the proximity criteria to reclassify. RRCs are also exempt from the  requirement that their wages be higher than the average wages in their  original area.

More than 75  percent of these hospitals were in nonmetropolitan areas. In the following  year, almost 1,200 hospitals were reclassified (of which 69 percent were in  nonmetropolitan areas). For 1994, HCFA established more restrictive  criteria and the number of reclassified hospitals subsequently dropped by  approximately 44 percent, to 667 (see fig. 3). From 1995 to 2002, wage  index reclassifications became more predominant, increasing by an  average of 6 percent annually, while standardized amount reclassifications  fell by almost one-quarter. For 2002, 511 nonmetropolitan hospitals and  117 metropolitan hospitals were reclassified for Medicare payment  purposes. Individual hospitals have also been reclassified through  legislation.

As a result, the labor cost adjustment for hospitals in  outlying counties of metropolitan areas is based on an average wage that is  often higher than the wages paid by these hospitals.

The most  populous MSAs typically cover a region of several thousand square miles  (see table 1). Distances between points within an MSA can exceed 100  miles. For example, the Chicago MSA includes 8 counties and 5,065 square  miles, and the distance from its northernmost to southernmost point is  roughly 110 miles. Hospitals in central counties of an MSA typically paid  higher wages than hospitals in outlying counties.

We used data on reclassifications and hospital characteristics  from the PPS Payment Impact Files created each year by CMS.  Information on metropolitan areas, such as central and outlying counties  and the criteria by which counties are included in an MSA, was obtained  from the U.S. Census Bureau Web site as well as interviews with Census  Bureau staff.", "We used RUCA codes, developed at the Washington, Wyoming, Alaska,  Montana, & Idaho (WWAMI) Rural Health Research Center at the  University of Washington, to examine segments of nonmetropolitan areas.  We assigned 1 of 30 possible RUCA codes to each hospital based on its  census tract. These 30 codes were then collapsed into 4 categories: urban,  large town, small town, and rural.", "We calculated dollar-weighted average hourly hospital wages for each of  the nonmetropolitan categories, nationally and by state, by dividing  aggregate wages for all hospitals within a category by aggregate hours. We  then compared the average hourly hospital wage for each nonmetropolitan  subgroup within a state to the statewide nonmetropolitan average hourly  wage.", "To evaluate the potential payment impact of applying a geographic  reclassification budget-neutrality factor on a state-specific basis, we used  the 2000 PPS Payment Impact File to calculate the Medicare payments to  all hospitals within each state, before and after any geographic  reclassifications. We then used the difference between pre- and post- reclassification payments to calculate a budget neutrality factor for each  state. These budget neutrality factors were then used to estimate how  payments to reclassified and nonreclassified hospitals in each state would  differ under a state-specific budget neutrality adjustment, compared to the  current national adjustment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: The Effect of Accounting for Occupational Mix on the Wage Index", "paragraphs": ["In BIPA, the Congress required the Secretary of Health and Human  Services to collect data on hospitals\u2019 mix of occupations and their  corresponding wages by September 30, 2003, and calculate wage indexes  beginning October 1, 2004, that are adjusted to remove the effects of  occupational mix on average wages. Occupational mix data for each acute  care hospital will be collected and updated every 3 years. The  methodology for adjusting the wage index for occupational mix will be  determined after the data have been collected.", "Average hospital wages vary because of differences in wages paid across  hospitals, but also because hospitals employ different mixes of  occupations. As a result, average hospital wages are higher than the  national average if the hospitals in an area employ more workers in highly  skilled occupations and lower if the hospitals employ fewer workers in  more highly skilled occupations. The current calculation of the Medicare  wage index does not distinguish between wage differences due to  geographic labor cost variation and wage differences due to geographic  variation in the mix of more highly and less highly skilled occupations.  Thus, Medicare\u2019s wage indexes are too high in areas with a more highly  skilled mix of hospital workers and too low in areas with a less skilled mix  of hospital workers. While geographic differences in wages paid affect  hospitals\u2019 labor costs, but are beyond an individual hospital\u2019s ability to  control, occupational mix generally is within the control of a hospital.", "Changing the calculation of the wage index to eliminate the effect of  occupational mix differences will raise the wage index for some types of  hospitals and lower it for others. Wage indexes will be reduced for  hospitals, such as metropolitan or teaching hospitals, that tend to hire  more employees in highly skilled occupations with higher wages. Wage  indexes for rural hospitals, which tend to employ a less skilled mix of  employees, are likely to go up.", "While national data on the occupational mix of hospital employees are not  available, data from California demonstrate the potential effects of  changing the wage index calculation to eliminate the effects of  occupational mix differences. Without adjusting for differences in  occupational mix, the average hourly wage for hospitals in the Oakland  MSA is 57 percent higher than the average hourly wage for  nonmetropolitan California hospitals. Hospitals in the Oakland area  generally employ a greater proportion of more skilled, and therefore more  expensive, staff (see table 6). For example, in Oakland area hospitals, RNs  account for approximately 25 percent more of the total hours worked by  hospital employees than they do in nonmetropolitan California.  Recalculating the wage indexes so that they reflect the same mix of  workers in all areas reduces the difference between the Oakland area  wages and those paid in nonmetropolitan areas to 50 percent. An  occupational mix-adjusted wage index in nonmetropolitan California  would be almost 4 percent higher than the current wage index calculation  (see table 7). Across metropolitan areas, the change to the wage index  would vary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Average Hospital Wages in Outlying and Central Counties of Metropolitan Areas, by State, Fiscal Year 1997", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Average percent difference between outlying and central", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Average Hospital Wages across Community Types in Nonmetropolitan Areas, by State, Fiscal Year 1997", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Number of hospitals", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Effect of the Current and a State- Specific Budget Neutrality Option on Hospital Payments, by State, Fiscal Year 2000", "paragraphs": ["Change in Medicare hospital payments  (current law)", "Change in Medicare hospital payments  (current law)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Comments from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}], "fastfact": []}
