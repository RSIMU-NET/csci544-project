NIST is tasked with developing standards and guidance for  implementation of FISMA requirements by federal agencies. However, 4  years into the implementation of FISMA, many agencies continue to  exhibit weaknesses in carrying out the act\u2019s requirements.", "Overall, FISMA requires each agency to develop, document, and  implement an agencywide information security program. This program  should provide security for the information and information systems that  support the operations and assets of the agency, including those provided  or managed by another agency, contractor, or other source. Among the  key activities and responsibilities associated with implementing this  program are the following:    Development, maintenance, and annual update of an inventory of major  information systems (including major national security systems) that are  operated by the agency or are under its control.", "Risk-based policies and procedures that cost-effectively reduce  information security risks to an acceptable level and ensure that  information security is addressed throughout the life cycle of each  information system, including through compliance with minimally  acceptable system configuration requirements.", "Security awareness training for agency personnel, including contractors  and other users of information systems that support the operations and  assets of the agency, and training for personnel with significant  responsibilities for information security.", "Periodic testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of information security  policies, procedures, and practices, performed with a frequency depending  on risk, but not less than annually, and that includes testing of  management, operational, and technical controls for every system  identified in the agency\u2019s required inventory of major information systems.", "A process for planning, implementing, evaluating, and documenting  remedial action to address any deficiencies in the information security  policies, procedures, and practices of the agency.", "In addition, as part of its responsibilities for overseeing the establishment  of agency information security programs in accordance with FISMA, OMB  requires that systems be certified and accredited, a process by which  senior agency officials certify that the risk level of information systems is  acceptable and that the systems are approved for operation.", "Because these key activities are interdependent, weaknesses in one  activity challenge the effective accomplishment of other FISMA activities.  For example, a complete and accurate system inventory provides a basis  for tracking FISMA compliance and for testing the effectiveness of  security controls for all systems and their components\u2014necessary to  assess system risk. The inventory and risk assessments in turn feed an  agency\u2019s strategy for managing risk and maintaining departmental risk- based policies and procedures.

For  example, some departments attribute weaknesses to limitations in the  tools and processes they use to perform certain activities (such as training  and remedial actions).

OMB has announced in its FY 2006 Report  to Congress on Implementation of The Federal Information Security  Management Act of 2002 that Justice\u2019s automated tool will be available to  other federal agencies under the information system security line of  business. However, Defense and State have not developed accurate and  complete FISMA inventories.", "Since 2004, the IG at Defense has reported that the department does not  have a complete and accurate inventory of its major information systems.  A contributing factor to this incomplete inventory is that Defense does not  have a common definition of an information system. As noted in guidance  that the department issued in 2006, Defense policies have at least two  definitions of a system, neither of which provides consistent criteria for  what should be entered into a FISMA inventory. The 2006 guidance  provides a third set of criteria and states that the two policy definitions  should act only as a starting point. However, Defense components must  make independent interpretations of whether the asset under evaluation  should be reported as a system for FISMA purposes, and the varied  interpretations create discrepancies in the inventory. For example,  Department of the Navy officials stated that not having a common  definition of what is an information technology (IT) system makes it  virtually impossible to distinguish between a system and its constituent  subsystems/applications versus a family of systems and constituent  systems. Without establishing and enforcing the use of one common  definition, Defense cannot implement consistent inventory management  practices across its components.", "State has developed a definition of a major information system for the  purposes of its inventory; however, there is disagreement with its IG  regarding how to apply the definition to individual IT assets\u2014either  separately or as part of a consolidated system. In 2006, State\u2019s IG found  Web applications that State officials had not included separately in their  FISMA inventory. Because of time limitations, the IG was unable to  determine whether other IT assets were missing from the inventory and  rejected the entire FISMA inventory maintained by State. State now has an  effort under way to resolve this challenge and identify all Web applications  for inclusion in the inventory. If this effort results in agreement with  State\u2019s IG, it could help the department in obtaining independent  verification of its system inventory."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Three of the Four Departments Are Challenged in Implementing Common Security Configurations for All Systems", "paragraphs": ["FISMA requires that agency information security programs include risk- based policies and procedures that ensure that information security is  addressed throughout the life cycle of each information system, including  through compliance with minimally acceptable system configuration  requirements. According to the NIST guidance for implementing  configuration management requirements, the policies for baseline system  configurations provide information about the makeup of a particular  system component (e.g., the standard software load for a workstation or  notebook computer, including updated patch information). In addition, the  system configuration settings are the adjustable parameters of these  components that enforce the agency security policy consistent with  operational requirements.", "According to the fiscal year 2006 CIO FISMA reports, all four departments  reported that they had established a departmentwide policy for common  security configurations. However, as detailed in table 2, only State  reported successfully implementing its common configuration policy on  all system platforms. State attributes its success to the development and  implementation of a strong configuration management compliance  program known as \u201cEvaluation and Verification.\u201d According to State, the  program conducts remote scans to confirm whether State systems are  operating as intended, in accordance with mandatory security  configuration requirements. The program also helps provide the CIO with  an additional level of assurance by identifying known security  vulnerabilities within State systems and applications. However, Defense,  Homeland Security, and Justice reported inconsistent implementation of  common secure configuration policies across departmental systems.", "Without consistent implementation of common security configurations  across systems, these departments increase the risk that their systems will  have avoidable security vulnerabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Three Departments Face Challenges in Identifying Personnel Needing Training", "paragraphs": ["FISMA mandates that all federal employees and contractors who use  department information systems be provided with periodic training in  information security awareness and accepted information security  practices. FISMA also requires agencies to provide appropriate training on  information security to personnel who have significant security  responsibilities. This training, described in NIST guidance, should inform  personnel, including contractors and other users of information systems  supporting the operations and assets of an agency, of information security  risks associated with their activities and of the roles and responsibilities of  personnel to properly and effectively implement the controls required by  policies and procedures that are designed to reduce these risks.", "Although the four departments reported that they have implemented  training for the majority of their personnel, three departments face  individual challenges, as follows:    Defense officials reported that the department\u2019s components have not  been able to document and track whether their 2.3 million users (who are  distributed worldwide) have received the required awareness training. For  example, the Department of the Army is currently unable to ensure that  users who access its IT systems have taken the required awareness  training. To overcome this obstacle, the Army has identified a need for a  componentwide tool that will ensure that only users who have taken the  required training are permitted to access its systems. In addition, Defense  officials stated that several of its components have difficulty in identifying  and tracking all employees who have significant IT security  responsibilities. For example, U.S. Air Force officials stated that it is  challenging to identify these personnel when they are not within an IT  functional area, and the Defense Information Systems Agency stated that it  is difficult to track information security training requirements for  contractors because of the lack of a central personnel database. In fiscal  year 2006, Defense issued a training and workforce improvement manual  to provide instructions to components to account for and track training of  all IT security personnel, even in the absence of a central personnel  database. Such a manual, if properly implemented, could help Defense  ensure that all personnel receive appropriate security training. However,  until Defense implements a mechanism to track training of personnel, it  will be unable to verify that personnel are effectively trained in their  information security roles and responsibilities.", "Homeland Security has not been able to ensure that employees who have  significant IT security responsibilities receive specialized training.  Specifically, the Homeland Security IG reported that the department has  not yet established a program to train all individuals who have significant  IT security responsibilities. Furthermore, in fiscal year 2006, the IG  reported that Homeland Security did not ensure that employees with these  responsibilities had completed the required training in the department\u2019s  process for validating the annual FISMA metrics. In addition, the  department reported that it was unable to accurately report on the  percentage of employees who have received specialized training because  its reporting tool counts each course taken, instead of tracking that an  individual has taken a specialized course. As a result, it could not be  assured that all users had completed required training. Homeland Security  has efforts under way to implement a centralized Web-based learning  management system that will track the completion of security training.  Until such a system is properly implemented, the department is unable to  identify personnel who have not completed required training.", "State has not been able to verify that all employees and contractors have  received required annual awareness training. The State IG reported that  the department was unable to determine the total number of users who are  required to complete the annual awareness training because of duplicate  entries in State\u2019s database that generates the number of users. Without  adequate controls to ensure the accuracy of training information, the  department cannot confirm that all personnel who require awareness  training have actually completed the training."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Departments Have Weaknesses in the Testing and Evaluation of Their Information Security Programs", "paragraphs": ["FISMA requires that department information security programs include  periodic testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of information security  policies, procedures, and practices.

It is to include  testing of management, operational, and technical controls for every  information system identified in the FISMA-required inventory of major  systems. Furthermore, a review of each system is essential to determine  the program\u2019s effectiveness. However, as we explained in a prior report,  the depth and breadth of such system reviews are flexible and depend on  several factors, such as (1) the potential risk and magnitude of harm to the  system or data, (2) the relative comprehensiveness of the last year\u2019s  review, and (3) the adequacy and successful implementation of the plan of  action and milestones for weaknesses in the system.", "Each of the four departments reported progress in increasing the  percentage of systems for which reviews were performed and security  controls tested (see fig. 1).", "However, the departments have not demonstrated adequate and effective  monitoring and evaluation of information security controls. In previous  work, we showed that guidance for performing such assessments at these  departments was not sufficient, and that the departments have not  adequately and effectively implemented policies for periodically testing  and evaluating information security controls. We reported that the  policies for the 24 Chief Financial Officer\u2019s Act agencies for periodically  testing and evaluating security controls did not fully address elements  included in OMB and NIST guidelines and standards for performing  effective security testing and evaluations. In particular, we reported that  Defense, Homeland Security, Justice, and State had not established  adequate instructions for determining the depth and breadth of periodic  tests.

Justice was the only department to report that all of its  components successfully completed the required annual security control  and contingency plan testing on all their systems. This success was  achieved through the department\u2019s efforts to establish and maintain a  system inventory and to manage departmentwide risks. In contrast,  Defense, Homeland Security, and State reported inconsistent testing of  security controls and contingency plans among their components.

When  weaknesses are identified, agencies are required to follow OMB and NIST  guidance for developing and maintaining a plan of action and milestones.  NIST Special Publication 800-37 states that remediation plans need to be  updated to address weaknesses identified as a result of periodic testing.  Key to an effective remediation plan is the accurate and complete  inclusion of weaknesses identified during periodic testing. Remediation  plans (also referred to as plans of action and milestones) should list all  identified weaknesses and show estimated resource needs or other  challenges to resolving them, key milestones and completion dates, and  the status of corrective actions.", "In their fiscal year 2006 FISMA reports, the IGs at all four departments  reported that the departments did not consistently use the remediation  plan process to manage the correction of their information security  actions. Specifically, the four departments had not fully ensured (1) that  significant IT security weaknesses are addressed in a timely manner and  receive appropriate resources or (2) that when an IT security weakness is  identified, program officials develop, implement, and manage plans of  action and milestones for their systems.

However, Defense is in the process of developing a departmentwide  remediation process, but the process has not been completed and  promulgated in final form. Interim guidance has been issued, and the  Defense CIO stated that more time is needed to coordinate staffing to  complete the final remediation guidance. Without complete guidance and  an established departmentwide process, Defense cannot be assured that  identified security weaknesses have been tracked and corrected.", "At Homeland Security, component agencies view the departmentwide  FISMA reporting tool as more of a hindrance than a help for tracking their  weaknesses, so use of the tool is inconsistent across component agencies.  However, the department headquarters disagrees with the components on  the usefulness of the tool. Unless the department can achieve user  acceptance of this tool, it will be challenged to establish a consistent  departmentwide remediation process.", "At Justice, the transition from an earlier NIST control framework to that in  the most recent guidance resulted in duplicate versions of plans of action  and milestones (one for each framework). According to Justice officials,  the department\u2019s tool for tracking these plans does not permit easy  reconciliation of these redundancies because there is no automated  process in place to do so. As a result, the department is challenged in  accurately tracking information security weaknesses. Without such  accurate tracking, the department has little assurance that security  weaknesses are being addressed appropriately.", "In September 2006, State\u2019s IG stated that the department has not yet  verified that IT security findings and recommendations from external and  internal reviews are being addressed and resolved as part of the  remediation process. The department is aware of the need to have all data  in its tracking tool\u2014including weaknesses reportable via the remediation  process\u2014monitored and validated on a regular basis. To address this issue  in fiscal year 2007, the senior agency information security officer plans to  use a \u201csystem vulnerability checklist\u201d to ensure that system owners are  aware of the weaknesses and plan to remediate them in a timely manner  according to the set milestones.

We believe that the issues identified in our report are appropriately  characterized as the challenges State faces with regard to verifying  whether all of its employees received the required FISMA security  awareness training and with regard to certifying and accrediting its  systems. Our report also discusses the progress State has made in these  two areas.", "Second, in response to the recommendation to improve mechanisms for  tracking information security awareness training of all personnel, State  asserted that the report declared that it is unable to identify all of its  employees. However, our report does not make this claim; instead, we  note that State has not been able to verify that all of its employees and  contractors have received the required training.", "Finally, State also noted in its comments that prior GAO reports and  testimonies discussed the lack of a common IG reporting framework and  that current FISMA reporting does not take full account of an agency\u2019s  ability to detect, respond to, and react to cyber security threats and  manage vulnerabilities. While State officials told us that these issues  inhibit the department from implementing the provisions of FISMA, we  emphasize that despite external factors, which may influence  measurement or perception of an agency\u2019s performance, the department  still controlled the internal processes that effectively execute all of the  information security program activities required by FISMA, which  constituted the scope of this report. These issues were addressed, as noted  by State in its comments, on a governmentwide basis in other GAO reports  and testimonies that had a broader scope.", "As we agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents  of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution of it until 30 days  from the date of this letter. At that time, we will send copies of this report  to interested congressional committees; the Secretaries of Defense,  Homeland Security, and State; and the U.S. Attorney General. We will also  make copies available to others on request. In addition, this report will be  available at no charge on the GAO Web site at http://www.gao.gov.", "If you have any questions regarding this report, please contact me at   (202) 512-6244 or by e-mail at wilshuseng@gao.gov.

We also reviewed and analyzed relevant  NIST special publications and federal information processing standards  that were created and modified due to FISMA, as well as guidance and  reports issued by OMB. For example, we reviewed and analyzed its Fiscal  Year 2005 Report to Congress on Implementation of The Federal  Information Security Management Act of 2002 and OMB Circular A-130,  Management of Federal Information Resources. In addition, we reviewed  our previous information security work. We also interviewed individuals  from OMB\u2019s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs and Office of  General Counsel and interviewed officials from the NIST Computer  Security Division to discuss their FISMA implementation project work as  mandated by FISMA.", "We also reviewed and analyzed chief information officer (CIO) and  inspectors general FISMA reports for fiscal years 2003 through 2006 at  Defense, Homeland Security, Justice, and State. In addition, we reviewed  and analyzed various plans, policies, and procedures at the four  departments. These included strategic plans, risk management policies,  and budget documentation. We also held structured interviews with  individuals who had FISMA implementation as their primary responsibility  at each department and at selected department components. Specifically,  at Defense we interviewed individuals from the Office of the Secretary of  Defense as well as three Defense service components\u2014the Departments  of the Army and Navy, and the U.S. Air Force\u2014and individuals from the  Defense Information Systems Agency. At Homeland Security, we  interviewed officials within the Office of the CIO as well as from the U.S.  Coast Guard, Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Citizenship  and Immigration Services, Transportation Security Administration, and  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. At Justice, we interviewed  officials within the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives;  the Justice Management Division; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the  Executive Office of United States Attorneys; and the Drug Enforcement  Administration. At State, we interviewed officials of the Office of the Chief  Information Officer, the Office of Foreign Missions, the Bureau of  Diplomatic Security, and the Bureau of Information Resources  Management. Finally, we met with the Office of the Inspector General at  each of the four departments to discuss what challenges its department  has encountered in implementing FISMA.", "Our work was conducted in Washington, D.C., from July 2006 through May  2007.
