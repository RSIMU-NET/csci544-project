In 1990, the President presented a defense plan reflecting a shift in U.S. strategy from preparing for a global war in Europe against the Soviet Union to preparing for major regional conflicts against uncertain adversaries. This plan proposed a significantly reduced force structure, or base force, but retained sufficient forces to counter a possible reemergence of the Soviet threat.", "Following the change in administrations in 1993, the new Secretary of Defense reassessed U.S. defense requirements in an effort referred to as DOD\u2019s bottom-up review. This review, completed in October 1993, examined the nation\u2019s defense strategy, force structure, modernization, infrastructure, foundations, and resources needed for the post-Cold War era. As a result of the bottom-up review, DOD continued to focus U.S. strategy on regional threats; however, it de-emphasized the possibility of a reemerging Soviet threat and reduced U.S. forces to levels smaller than the base force. According to DOD officials, the Secretary of Defense called for the bottom-up review to be completed in time to be considered in developing DOD\u2019s fiscal year 1995 budget and Future Years Defense Program.

If a second conflict breaks out, DOD would need to deploy another block of forces, requiring a further reallocation of overseas presence forces, any forces still engaged in smaller-scale operations, and most of the remaining U.S.-based forces.", "In determining force requirements for the two-conflict strategy, DOD assumed that forces already engaged in other operations could redeploy to a regional conflict. However, DOD did not analyze the feasibility of or requirements for such a redeployment during the bottom-up review. For example, DOD did not consider (1) requirements for readiness upgrades for forces before redeployment, (2) requirements for diverting airlift and sealift assets to pick up personnel and equipment from the operation, and (3) the impact on the war-fighting commander involved in a regional conflict if combat and support forces engaged in other operations were not immediately available.", "DOD did not begin to analyze its assumption on redeploying forces from operations other than war until after completing the bottom-up review. In June 1994, the Army initiated a study of the impact of peace operations on Army requirements, including the implications of redeploying combat and support forces from such operations to regional conflicts. The Army does not expect to complete this analysis until early to mid-1995.", "Our work on the impact of peace operations on U.S. forces suggests that it would be difficult for certain support and combat forces to disengage and quickly redeploy to a major regional conflict. For example, certain Army support forces and specialized Air Force combat aircraft, such as the F-4G and F-15E, deployed to peace operations are the same forces needed in the early stages of a regional conflict. However, some support forces, such as transportation units that move personnel and cargo through ports, could not immediately redeploy because they would be needed to assist in redeploying other forces. Furthermore, while Air Force aircraft and aircrews could easily fly from the peace operation to a regional conflict, the maintenance and logistics support needed to keep the aircraft flying\u2014supplies, equipment, and personnel\u2014would have to wait for available airlift. Obtaining sufficient airlift to redeploy forces from a peace operation would be challenging because already limited airlift assets committed to deploying forces to the regional conflict would have to be diverted to pick up these forces.", "Finally, forces may need to upgrade their training, equipment, and supplies before redeploying. For example, according to Air Force officials, peace operations tend to degrade the overall combat readiness of Air Force flight crews.

For example, in determining force requirements, DOD did not determine what specific types and numbers of assets would be required to be dual-tasked and when they could be redeployed, or whether sufficient logistical support, such as airlift, refueling aircraft, air crews, or spare parts kits, would be available for the redeployment.", "DOD officials explained that because a model for two nearly simultaneous conflicts does not exist, the modeling to determine force requirements during the bottom-up review did not simulate the shifting of assets from one conflict to another. Rather, DOD identified the specific number of assets required for each conflict and assumed that dual-tasking would compensate for any shortfalls.", "After the bottom-up review, the Air Force and its Air Mobility Command began analyzing the implications and requirements for dual-tasking based on assumptions contained in the Secretary of Defense\u2019s May 1994 defense planning guidance.

Furthermore, in November 1994, at the direction of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, DOD began a war game analysis of several variables of the two-conflict strategy, including requirements for dual-tasking. This analysis is expected to be completed sometime in 1995.", "As discussed in chapter 3, war-fighting commands are analyzing the two-conflict strategy using a different scenario and deployment concept from those outlined in the defense planning guidance. They, too, are examining dual-tasking, including how many and what type of assets would need to shift and at what point in the conflict such a shift could reasonably occur.

Because DOD assumed that most of these forces would not be in the region when hostilities begin, it emphasized that sufficient strategic mobility\u2014airlift, sealift, and prepositioning of equipment at forward locations\u2014would be needed to successfully execute the two-conflict strategy.", "The bottom-up review called for specific enhancements to DOD\u2019s existing strategic mobility capability\u2014most of which DOD had identified in its 1991 mobility requirements study. This congressionally required study determined future requirements for airlift, sealift, and prepositioning and recommended a program to improve DOD\u2019s mobility capability. In conducting the study, DOD analyzed various scenarios involving single regional conflicts and a scenario involving two concurrent conflicts. Based on the requirements for the single conflict scenario deemed to be most demanding, the study recommended increasing sealift capacity for prepositioned equipment and rapid deployment of heavy Army divisions and other U.S. forces by (1) acquiring\u2014through new construction and conversion\u2014additional capacity equal to 20 large, medium-speed, roll-on/roll-off ships; (2) leasing two container ships; (3) expanding the Ready Reserve Force from 96 to 142 ships (an increase of 46 ships); and (4) increasing the overall readiness of the Ready Reserve Force;increasing U.S. capability to respond within the first few weeks of a regional conflict by prepositioning Army combat, support, and port-opening equipment aboard nine of the newly constructed or converted large, medium-speed ships (by fiscal year 1997);improving airlift by continuing the C-17 aircraft program, acquiring up to 120 aircraft; and improving the capability of the U.S. transportation system to move combat and support units from their peacetime locations to ports of embarkation by, among other things, purchasing 233 additional heavy-lift rail cars and developing an ammunition loading facility on the U.S. west coast.", "According to the mobility study, the recommended program reflected a moderate-risk and affordable mobility force for a single regional conflict that would enable DOD to move 4-2/3 Army divisions in 6 weeks. It also concluded that its recommended program was not sufficient to handle a second concurrent major regional conflict.", "During the bottom-up review, DOD relied heavily on the results of the mobility study when considering mobility requirements for the two-conflict strategy. The bottom-up review endorsed the mobility study\u2019s recommendations, and called for increasing the amount of equipment prepositioned on land in the Persian Gulf area. At the time of the bottom-up review, DOD had a battalion-sized set of equipment ashore in the Persian Gulf and planned to increase this prepositioning to two brigade sets. DOD believed that the prepositioning was necessary because the bottom-up review envisioned that forces would need to deploy more quickly than provided for in the 1991 study.", "After completing the bottom-up review, DOD initiated a detailed analysis of mobility requirements for the two-conflict strategy to validate its recommendations in the 1991 mobility study and the bottom-up review. According to DOD, this study was required because of significant changes resulting from the bottom-up review and delays in DOD\u2019s mobility program. For example, the bottom-up review and related defense planning guidance presented a new military strategy, changed the overall force structure, and called for enhancements in war-fighting capability. Furthermore, as discussed later, DOD experienced delays in acquiring C-17 aircraft.", "By February 1995, DOD expects to complete its study, identifying any changes in mobility requirements and necessary adjustments to its mobility program.

As discussed in chapter 3, war-fighting commands are just beginning to analyze how and when the enhanced brigades might be used in a regional conflict.", "The Army Chief of Staff also determined that the brigades would maintain personnel and equipment at the highest readiness level during peacetime and be ready to deploy at this level no later than 90 days after being called up; train with specific divisions or corps in peacetime, but maintain the flexibility to operate with any division or corps in wartime; focus their training on mission-essential tasks involving movement (maneuvering) to contact with the enemy, attacks on enemy positions, and defense against enemy attacks; be of standard Army design for heavy and light brigades and armored be equipped and modernized in a manner compatible with active divisions.", "The U.S. Army Forces Command was tasked to develop and test a training strategy to ensure that the enhanced brigades meet the 90-day deployment goal. This strategy will include any necessary adjustments to the Army\u2019s current training program for Guard combat brigades. Army headquarters elements were tasked to identify the requirements and costs associated with equipping the brigades. As of January 1995, the Army expected to complete the equipment study in February 1995 and the training strategy in mid-1995. Once the training strategy is completed, the Army envisions that by 1999 it will be tested on only 3 of the 15 brigades.

However, these estimates assumed that the brigades will have achieved proficiency in basic skills at the individual soldier, crew, and platoon level during peacetime training.", "During the Persian Gulf War, three Guard combat brigades were activated, but the Army did not deploy any of these brigades. Instead, they remained in training status until the war was over. As we reported in November 1992,and testified in March 1994, the brigades experienced problems in achieving proficiency in basic skills at the time of mobilization. For example, many Guard soldiers were not completely trained to do their jobs, many tank and Bradley Fighting Vehicle crews were not proficient in many commissioned and noncommissioned officers had not completed required leadership courses.", "As a result, Guard brigades were trained to achieve proficiency in many basic skills, rather than more complex skills, after mobilization. Because the Army believed the brigades were not ready to deploy, it substituted active brigades. Contributing to the brigades\u2019 training problems was the fact that reserve forces generally train only about 39 days each year, and a considerable portion of this time can be taken up by administrative matters or in traveling long distances to reach training ranges.", "Because of the Gulf War experience, the Army significantly changed its strategy for training Guard combat brigades, including implementing an initiative called Bold Shift. This project, initiated in September 1991, was designed to focus brigade training during peacetime at the basic\u2014individual, crew, and platoon\u2014level. Prior to this initiative, peacetime training encompassed both basic and complex skills.", "Our ongoing work on the Bold Shift program suggests that Guard combat brigades are still continuing to experience problems in achieving proficiency in basic skills. For example, as we stated in our March 1994 testimony, 1992 training data for seven existing Guard combat brigades showed that none had reached pre-mobilization training and readiness goals. Our analysis of 1993 training data confirmed that this trend is continuing.

By the same time, DOD expected to preposition equipment on ships and increase the amount of equipment prepositioned on land in the Persian Gulf area from a battalion-sized set to two brigade sets, located in two different locations.

Specifically, DOD\u2019s assumption that 80 C-17 aircraft would be available by fiscal year 1999 was overly optimistic. Since its inception, the C-17 program has been plagued with cost, schedule, and performance problems. We testified in April 1994 that total costs continued to grow, delivery schedules had slipped, and aircraft had been delivered with unfinished work or known deficiencies. In December 1993, the Secretary of Defense decided to limit the program to 40 aircraft unless the contractor significantly improved management and productivity. Furthermore, as discussed previously, the Secretary also decided to study alternatives for a mixed airlift force of C-17s and nondevelopmental\u2014commercial or military\u2014aircraft. DOD expects to complete the study in November 1995 and at that time will decide whether to procure additional C-17s. As of October 1994, the contractor had delivered 15 C-17 aircraft and planned to deliver the remaining 25 aircraft by September 1998.", "As of October 1994, the Department of Transportation had acquired 14 of the 21 Ready Reserve Force ships planned to be available for DOD\u2019s mobility program by fiscal year 1999.

Until DOD fully analyzes basic factors, such as whether forces engaged in other operations that are needed in the early stages of a regional conflict can quickly redeploy, sufficient mobility and support forces exist, reserve brigades can deploy when needed or improvements in capabilities will be available, it will not have a firm basis for determining the forces, supporting capabilities, and funding needed for the two-conflict strategy or if the strategy should be changed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD disagreed with our overall conclusion that DOD did not adequately analyze the assumptions used in the bottom-up review.

In making these decisions, DOD made critical assumptions about factors that are key to the successful execution of the two-conflict strategy without performing sufficient analyses to test the validity of its assumptions. In fact, DOD and the war-fighting commands are now exploring basic questions about DOD\u2019s assumptions, such as whether forces involved in smaller-scale operations can actually be available when needed to deploy to a regional conflict, whether the same combat forces would be needed at the same time in both regional conflicts and whether the Army has sufficient support for nearly simultaneous combat operations in two conflicts.", "DOD also disagreed with our specific findings that (1) it did not assess requirements for shifting assets between regional conflicts, (2) it did not fully assess mobility requirements, and (3) the Army would be challenged in supporting two major regional conflicts. First, DOD stated that it has ample experience in rapidly deploying forces, particularly combat and support aircraft, from one theater to another. DOD said that in its bottom-up review analysis, it made judgments about its future ability to shift assets based on that experience.", "We agree that DOD has ample experience in redeploying forces from one theater to another.

Furthermore, as discussed in chapter 3, the war-fighting commands\u2019 study has raised questions about shifting assets between conflicts. For these reasons, we continue to believe that the bottom-up review did not adequately assess requirements for shifting assets between conflicts.", "Second, DOD stated that in assessing mobility requirements during the bottom-up review, it relied heavily on its 1991 mobility requirements study. DOD believes that it understands the vast majority of its basic lift requirements and capabilities for responding to two nearly simultaneous conflicts. We agree that the 1991 study provided a useful baseline; however, the bottom-up review resulted in significant changes in mobility assumptions. DOD did not begin to analyze these changes until after the bottom-up review. Furthermore, the 1991 study concluded that its recommended mobility program was not sufficient for two concurrent conflicts. Until DOD\u2019s reassessment of mobility requirements is complete, we continue to believe that DOD will not know the extent of strategic airlift, sealift, and prepositioning needed to support two major regional conflicts.", "Finally, DOD stated that the Army demonstrated, as recently as Operation Desert Storm in 1991, that it can fully support large-scale combat operations in a single major regional conflict.

We recognize that the Army was able to support combat operations during Operation Desert Storm; however, as discussed in chapter 2, the Army did encounter difficulties. Also, the operation was conducted under several favorable circumstances; for example, there was no second conflict at the same time. Furthermore, we did not conclude that the Army could not support two major regional conflicts. Rather, we showed that DOD did not analyze the validity of its assumption that sufficient support forces would be available and that various factors suggest that the Army would be challenged in meeting this requirement.
