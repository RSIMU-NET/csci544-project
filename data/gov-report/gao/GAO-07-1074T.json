This statement is based on a recent report (GAO-07-585) and other nearly completed work. GAO assessed (1) the extent to which FMCSA identifies carriers that subsequently have high crash rates, (2) how FMCSA ensures that its compliance reviews are conducted thoroughly and consistently, and (3) the extent to which FMCSA follows up with carriers with serious safety violations. GAO's work was based on a review of laws, program guidance, and analyses of data from 2004 through early 2006."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["FMCSA generally does a good job in identifying carriers that pose high crash risks for subsequent compliance reviews, ensuring the thoroughness and consistency of those reviews, and following up with high-risk carriers. SafeStat is nearly twice as effective (83 percent) as random selection in identifying carriers that pose high crash risks. However, its effectiveness could be improved by using a statistical approach (negative binomial regression), which provides for a systematic assessment to apply weights to the four SafeStat safety evaluation areas (accidents and driver, vehicle, and safety management violations) rather than FMCSA's approach, which relies on expert judgment. The regression approach identified carriers that had twice as many crashes in the subsequent 18 months as did the carriers identified by the current SafeStat approach. FMCSA is concerned that adopting this approach would result in it placing more emphasis on crashes and less emphasis on compliance with its safety management, vehicle, and driver regulations. GAO believes that because (1) the ultimate purpose of compliance reviews is to reduce the number and severity of truck and bus crashes and (2) GAO's and others' research has shown that crash rates are stronger predictors of future crashes than is poor compliance with FMCSA's safety regulations, the regression approach would improve safety. GAO's preliminary assessment is that FMCSA promotes thoroughness and consistency in its compliance reviews through its management processes, which meet GAO's standards for internal controls. For example, FMCSA uses an electronic manual to record and communicate its compliance review policies and procedures and teaches proper compliance review procedures through both classroom and on-the-job training. Furthermore, investigators use an information system to document their compliance reviews, and managers review these data, helping to ensure thoroughness and consistency between investigators. For the most part, FMCSA and state investigators cover the nine major applicable areas of the safety regulations (e.g., driver qualifications and vehicle condition) in 95 percent or more of compliance reviews, demonstrating thoroughness and consistency. GAO's preliminary assessment is that FMCSA follows up with almost all carriers with serious safety violations, but it does not assess the maximum fines against all serious violators that GAO believes the law requires. FMCSA followed up with at least 1,189 of 1,196 carriers (99 percent) that received proposed unsatisfactory safety ratings from compliance reviews completed in fiscal year 2005. For example, FMCSA found that 873 of these carriers made safety improvements and it placed 306 other carriers out of service. GAO also found that FMCSA (1) assesses maximum fines against carriers for the third instance of a violation, whereas GAO reads the statute as requiring FMCSA to do so for the second violation and (2) does not always assess maximum fines against carriers with a pattern of varied serious violations, as GAO believes the law requires."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We appreciate the opportunity to participate in this hearing to discuss the  Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration\u2019s (FMCSA) oversight of  motor carriers that pose high crash risks. This is an important issue  because each year about 5,500 people die as a result of crashes involving  large commercial trucks or buses, and about 160,000 more people are  injured. These crashes may result from errors by truck, bus, or passenger  vehicle drivers; vehicle condition; and other factors. Effective oversight is  important because of the large size of the motor carrier industry (over  700,000 carriers are registered with FMCSA) compared to the number of  compliance reviews\u2014reviews of carriers at their bases of operations for  compliance with FMCSA\u2019s safety regulations\u2014that FMCSA and its state  partners are able to conduct each year (about 15,000 in 2006). As a result,  it is crucial that FMCSA identify the most unsafe carriers so that the  carriers either improve their operations or are put out of service.", "My remarks are based on work we have recently completed for this  Subcommittee and the full committee and on the preliminary results of  our ongoing work for the Chairman of the full committee. This latter work  is nearing completion, and we expect to report on our final results on  these and other topics later this summer. Specifically, we have been  assessing (1) the extent to which FMCSA identifies carriers that  subsequently have high crash rates, (2) how FMCSA ensures that its  compliance reviews are conducted thoroughly and consistently, and   (3) the extent to which FMCSA follows up with carriers with serious safety  violations.", "Our work was based on a review of laws, regulations, program guidance,  analyses of data, and discussions with FMCSA. To determine the extent to  which FMCSA identifies carriers that subsequently have high crash rates,  we analyzed data from FMCSA\u2019s Motor Carrier Management Information  System for its June 2004 assessment of carriers and compared it to data on  crashes the carriers experienced over the subsequent 18 months (July 2004  through December 2005). To assess how FMCSA ensures that its  compliance reviews are completed thoroughly and consistently, we  identified our key internal control standards related to the communication  of policy, documentation of results, and monitoring and reviewing of  activities and findings. We gathered information on these key internal  controls through discussions with FMCSA officials in its headquarters as  well as in 7 of FMCSA\u2019s 52 field division offices and reviews of policy  documents and reports. To assess the extent to which FMCSA follows up  with carriers with serious violations and assesses maximum fines in  certain situations, we reviewed regulations and FMCSA policies directing  how FMCSA must follow up and track these violators, analyzed data to  determine if FMCSA had met these requirements, and held discussions  with FMCSA officials. As part of our review, we assessed internal controls  and the reliability of FMCSA\u2019s data on motor carriers\u2019 safety history and  compliance review and enforcement activities pertinent to this effort.  While there are known problems with the quality of the crash data  reported to FMCSA, we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable  for our use, which was to assess whether different approaches to  categorizing carriers could lead to better identification of carriers that  subsequently have high rates of crashes. We conducted our work from  February 2006 through July 2007 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.", "By and large, FMCSA does a good job of identifying carriers that pose high  crash risks for subsequent compliance reviews, ensuring the thoroughness  and consistency of those reviews, and following up with high-risk carriers.  That being said, we have identified areas that could be improved. In  summary:    Overall, the data-driven model that FMCSA uses to identify carriers that  pose high crash risks\u2014the Motor Carrier Safety Status Measurement  System (SafeStat)\u2014does a good job of identifying carriers that pose high  crash risks. In this regard, we found that it is nearly twice as effective   (83 percent better) as random selection in identifying carriers that pose  high crash risks. Thus, in our view, it has value for improving safety.  However, we believe that its effectiveness could be improved through  either of two enhancements that we analyzed. One enhancement entails  applying a statistical approach, called the negative binomial regression  model, to the four SafeStat safety evaluation areas (accidents and driver,  vehicle, and safety management violations) instead of its current  approach, which relies on expert judgment to assign weights to each of the  four areas. The other enhancement\u2014the results of which are  preliminary\u2014uses the existing SafeStat overall design but places greater  weight on carriers that scored among the worst in the accident safety  evaluation area. Both enhancements performed better than the current  SafeStat approach. For example, the regression approach identified  carriers that had twice as many crashes in the subsequent 18 months as  the carriers the current SafeStat approach identified. We believe that the  negative binomial regression model approach offers a greater potential for  improving safety over the other enhancement that we analyzed and the  current SafeStat approach because it provides for a systematic assessment  of the relative contributions of accidents and driver, vehicle, and safety  management violations rather than the use of expert judgment to apply  weights to these areas. FMCSA agreed that our approach looks promising  but believes that placing more emphasis on crashes is counterproductive,  in part, because it would have to place less emphasis on compliance with  its safety management, vehicle, and driver regulations. We disagree  because the ultimate purpose of compliance reviews is to reduce the  number and severity of truck and bus crashes, and high crash rates are  stronger predictors of future crashes than is poor compliance with safety  regulations.", "Our preliminary assessment showed that FMCSA\u2019s management of its  compliance reviews meets our standards for internal controls, thereby  promoting thoroughness and consistency. FMCSA records its compliance  review policies and procedures in an electronic operations manual and  distributes the manual to investigators and managers. FMCSA also trains  investigators on these policies and procedures. Investigators we spoke  with found both the electronic manual and the training to be effective  means of communicating policies and procedures. FMCSA and state  investigators use an information system to document the results of the  compliance reviews. This information system supports thoroughness and  consistency by alerting investigators if they are not following key policies  or if data appears suspect; the system also provides managers readily  available data to review. For the most part, FMCSA and state investigators  cover the nine major applicable areas of the safety regulations (e.g., driver  qualifications and vehicle repair and maintenance) in 95 percent or more  of compliance reviews, demonstrating thoroughness and consistency.", "Our preliminary assessment showed that FMCSA follows up with many  carriers with serious safety violations, but it does not assess maximum  fines against all serious violators, as we believe is required by law. FMCSA  followed up with at least 1,189 of 1,196 carriers (99 percent) that received  a proposed safety rating of unsatisfactory following compliance reviews  completed in fiscal year 2005. For example, FMCSA found that 873 of  these carriers made safety improvements and it placed 306 other carriers  out of service. FMCSA monitors carriers to identify those that are violating  out-of-service orders, but in fiscal years 2005 and 2006, it cited only 26 of  768 carriers that its monitoring showed had a roadside inspection or crash  while subject to an out-of-service order. An FMCSA official told us that  some of the 768 carriers, such as carriers that were operating intrastate,  may not have been violating the out-of-service order and that FMCSA did  not have enough resources to determine whether each of the carriers was  violating an out-of-service order. Finally, we found that while FMCSA  assesses maximum fines against carriers that repeat a serious violation, it  does not, as we believe federal law requires, assess maximum fines against  carriers with a pattern of serious violations. In addition, FMCSA assesses  maximum fines only for the third instance of a violation. We read the  statute as requiring FMCSA to assess the maximum fine if a serious  violation is repeated once\u2014not only after it is repeated twice.", "In our June report we recommended that FMCSA use a negative binomial  regression model approach to identify carriers that pose high crash risks.  We are considering making several recommendations based on our  ongoing work, including that FMCSA assess maximum fines, as discussed  above, in circumstances that we believe the law requires it to do so.

In addition, about  160,000 of the approximately 3.2 million highway injuries per year involve  motor carriers. While the fatality rate for trucks has generally decreased  over the past 30 years, it has been fairly stable since 2002. (See fig. 1.)

These  approaches entail giving more weight to crashes than the current SafeStat  model does.

FMCSA recognizes that SafeStat can  be improved, and as part of its Comprehensive Safety Analysis 2010 reform  initiative\u2014which is aimed at improving its processes for identifying and  dealing with unsafe carriers and drivers\u2014the agency is considering  replacing SafeStat by 2010."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Using Either a Statistical Approach or Modifying Existing SafeStat Categorization Rules Could Improve Identification of High-risk Carriers", "paragraphs": ["In June 2007, we reported that FMCSA could improve SafeStat\u2019s ability to  identify carriers that pose high crash risks if it applied a statistical  approach, called the negative binomial regression model, to the four  SafeStat safety evaluation areas instead of its current approach. We used  this approach to determine whether systematic analyses of data through  regression modeling offered improved results in identifying carriers that  pose high crash risks over FMCSA\u2019s model, which uses expert judgment  and professional experience to apply weights to each of the safety  evaluation areas. The negative binomial model results in a rank order  listing of carriers by crash risk and the predicted number of crashes. This  differs from SafeStat\u2019s current approach, which gives the highest priority  to carriers that are deficient in three or more safety evaluation areas or  that score over a certain amount\u2014SafeStat categories A and B.   (See table 1.)", "The other enhancement that we analyzed\u2014the results of which are  preliminary\u2014utilized the existing SafeStat overall design but examined the  effect of providing greater priority to carriers that scored among the worst  5 percent of carriers in the accident safety evaluation area (SafeStat  category D). We chose this approach because we found that while the  driver, vehicle, and safety management evaluation areas are correlated  with the future crash risk of a carrier, the accident evaluation area  correlates most with future crash risk. This approach would retain the  overall SafeStat framework and categorization\u2014categories A through G  for carriers with safety problems\u2014but would substitute carriers in  category D (the accident category) for carriers in categories A and B that  have either (1) lower overall SafeStat scores or (2) lower accident area  scores.", "We compared the performance of our regression model approach and  placing greater weight on carriers that scored among the worst 5 percent  of carriers in SafeStat category D to the current SafeStat model. The  comparison showed that both these approaches performed better than the  current SafeStat approach. (See table 2.) For example, the regression  model approach identified carriers with an average of 111 crashes per  1,000 vehicles over an 18-month period compared with the current  SafeStat approach, which identified carriers for compliance reviews with  an average of 102 crashes per 1,000 vehicles. This 9 percent improvement  would have enabled FMCSA to identify carriers with almost twice as many  crashes in the following 18 months as those carriers identified in its  current approach (19,580 v. 10,076). Placing greater emphasis on carriers  in category D provided superior results to the current SafeStat approach  both in terms of identifying carriers with higher crash rates (from 6 to 9  percent higher) and greater numbers of crashes (from about 600 to 800  more). In addition, the regression approach performed at least as well as  placing greater emphasis on carriers in category D in terms of identifying  carriers with the highest crash rates and much better in identifying  carriers with the greatest number of crashes.", "Because both the approaches that we analyzed would identify a larger  number of carriers that pose high crash risks, FMCSA would choose the  number of carriers to review based on the resources available to it, much  as it currently does.", "We believe that our statistically based regression model is preferable to  placing greater weight on carriers in category D because it provides for a  systematic assessment of the relative contributions of accidents and  driver, vehicle, and safety management violations. We recommended that  FMCSA adopt such an approach. By its very nature the regression  approach looks for the \u201cbest fit\u201d in identifying the degree to which prior  accidents and driver, vehicle, and safety management violations identify  the likelihood of carriers having crashes in the future, compared to the  current SafeStat approach, in which the relationship among the four  evaluation areas is based on expert judgment. In addition, because the  regression model could be run monthly\u2014as is the current SafeStat  model\u2014any change in the degree to which accidents and driver, vehicle,  and safety management violations better identify future crashes will be  automatically considered as different weights to the four evaluation areas  are assigned. This is not the case with the current SafeStat model, in which  the evaluation area weights generally remain constant over time.", "FMCSA agreed that use of a negative binomial regression model looks  promising but officials said that the agency believes that placing more  emphasis on the accident area would be counterproductive. First, FMCSA  is concerned that this would require placing correspondingly less  emphasis on the types of problems the compliance review is designed to  address so that crashes can be reduced (i.e., the lack of compliance with  safety regulations related to drivers, vehicles, and safety management that  is captured in the other evaluation areas). Along this line, FMCSA said that  compliance reviews of carriers in SafeStat category D have historically  resulted in fewer serious violations than compliance reviews of carriers in  SafeStat category A or B. We agree with FMCSA that the use of the  approaches that we are discussing here today could tilt enforcement  heavily toward carriers with high crash rates and away from carriers with  compliance issues. We disagree, however, that this would be  counterproductive. We found that while driver, vehicle, and safety  management evaluation area scores are correlated with the future crash  risk of a carrier, high crash rates are a stronger predictor of future crashes  than poor compliance with safety regulations.

However, in June  2007 we reported that FMCSA has made considerable efforts to improve  the reliability of crash data.

FMCSA told us it is difficult to detect carriers operating in violation of out- of-service orders because its resources do not allow it to visit each carrier  or conduct roadside inspections on all vehicles, and we agree. In fiscal  years 2005 and 2006, 768 of 1,996 carriers (38 percent) that were subject to  an out-of-service order had a roadside inspection or crash; FMCSA cited  only 26 of these 768 carriers for violating an out-of-service order. An  FMCSA official told us that some of these carriers, such as carriers that  were operating intrastate or that had leased its vehicles to other carriers,  may not have been violating the out-of-service order. He said that FMCSA  did not have enough resources to determine whether each of the carriers  was violating an out-of-service order."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FMCSA Conducted Compliance Reviews on About Half of All High-risk Carriers That It Was Required to By Statute", "paragraphs": ["From August 2006 through February 2007, FMCSA data indicate that the  agency performed compliance reviews on 1,136 of the 2,220 (51 percent)  carriers that were covered by its mandatory compliance review policy.  The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A  Legacy for Users act requires that FMCSA conduct compliance reviews on  carriers rated as SafeStat category A or B for 2 consecutive months. In  response to this requirement, FMCSA implemented a policy in June 2006  requiring a compliance review within 6 months for any such carrier unless  the carrier had received a compliance review within the previous 12  months. An FMCSA official told us that the agency did not have enough  resources to conduct compliance reviews on all of the 2,220 carriers  within 6 months.", "In April 2007, FMCSA revised the policy because it believes that it required  compliance reviews for some carriers that did not need them, leaving  FMCSA with insufficient resources to conduct compliance reviews on  other carriers that did need them. Specifically, FMCSA believes that  carriers that had already had a compliance review were targeted  unnecessarily after they had corrected identified violations, but these  violations continued to adversely affect their SafeStat rating because  SafeStat penalizes carriers for violations regardless of whether they have  been corrected. The new policy requires compliance reviews within 6  months for carriers that have been in SafeStat category A or B for 2  consecutive months and received their last compliance 2 or more years  ago (or have never received a compliance review) and offers some  discretion to FMCSA division offices. For example, division offices can  decide not to conduct a compliance review if its SafeStat score is based  largely on violations that have been corrected or on accidents that  occurred prior to the carrier\u2019s last compliance review. We believe that  these changes are consistent with the act\u2019s requirement and give FMCSA  appropriate discretion in allocating its compliance review resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FMCSA Does Not Assess Maximum Fines for All the Violations Required by Law", "paragraphs": ["FMCSA does not assess the maximum fines against all carriers as we  believe the law requires. The law requires FMCSA to assess the maximum  allowable fine for each serious violation by a carrier that is found (1) to  have committed a pattern of such violations (pattern requirement) or (2)  to have previously committed the same or a related serious violation  (repeat requirement). However, FMCSA\u2019s policy on maximum fines does  not fully meet these requirements. FMCSA enforces both requirements  using what is known as the \u201cthree-strikes rule,\u201d applying the maximum  allowable fine when it finds that a motor carrier has violated the same  regulation three times within a 6-year period. FMCSA officials said they  interpret both parts of the act\u2019s requirements to refer to repeat violations,  and because they believe that having two distinct policies on repeat  violations would confuse motor carriers, it has chosen to address both  requirements with its single three-strikes policy.", "FMCSA\u2019s interpretation does not carry out the statutory mandate to  impose maximum fines in two different cases. In contrast to FMCSA, we  read the statute\u2019s use of the distinct terms \u201ca pattern of violations\u201d and  \u201cpreviously committed the same or a related violation\u201d as requiring  FMCSA to implement two distinct policies. A basic principle of statutory  interpretation is that distinct terms should be read as having distinct  meanings. In this case, the statute not only uses different language to refer  to the violations for which maximum fines must be imposed but also sets  them out separately and makes either type of violation subject to the  maximum penalties. Therefore, one carrier may commit a variety of  serious violations and another carrier may commit the same or a  substantially similar serious violation as a previous violation; the language  on its face requires FMCSA to assess the maximum allowable fine in both  situations\u2014patterns of violations as well as repeat offenses.", "FMCSA could define a pattern of serious violations in numerous ways that  are consistent with the act\u2019s pattern requirement. Our assessment of eight  potential definitions shows that the number of carriers that would be  subject to maximum fines depends greatly on the definition. (See table 4.)  For example, a definition calling for two or more serious violations in each  of at least four different regulatory areas during a compliance review  would have made 38 carriers subject to maximum fines in fiscal year 2006.  In contrast, a definition calling for one or more serious violations in each  of at least three different regulatory areas would have made 1,529 carriers  subject to maximum fines during that time.", "We also interpret the statutory language for the repeat requirement as  calling for a \u201ctwo-strikes\u201d rule as opposed to FMCSA\u2019s three-strikes rule  interpretation. FMCSA\u2019s interpretation imposes the maximum fine only  after a carrier has twice previously committed such violations. The  language of the statute does not allow FMCSA\u2019s interpretation; rather, it  requires FMCSA to assess the maximum allowable fine for each serious  violation against a carrier that has previously committed the same serious  violation.", "In fiscal years 2004 through 2006, more than four times as many carriers  had a serious violation that constituted a second strike than carriers that  had a third strike. (See table 5.) For example, in fiscal year 2006, 1,320  carriers had a serious violation that constituted a second strike, whereas  280 carriers had a third strike.", "Carriers that commit a pattern of violations may also commit a second  strike violation. For example, three of the seven carriers that had two or  more serious violations in each of at least five different regulatory areas  also had a second strike in fiscal year 2006. Were FMCSA to make policy  changes along the lines discussed here, we believe that the new policies  should address how to deal with carriers with serious violations that both  are part of a pattern and repeat the same or similar previous violations.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
