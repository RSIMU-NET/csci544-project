In its decision, the court clarified that VA contract competitions must be restricted to these businesses if they meet two criteria: (1) the contracting officer reasonably expects that at least two such businesses will submit offers, and (2) the award can be made at a fair and reasonable price and best value to the government. This has become known as the \u201cVA Rule of Two.\u201d VA created a new policy for implementing Veterans First following the 2016 decision. The percentage of obligations set aside for veteran-owned small businesses increased from fiscal years 2014 to 2017 (see figure).", "Contracting officers face challenges implementing aspects of Veterans First, some of which VA has addressed through policy and optional training. However, 12 of the 30 contracting officers GAO interviewed cited difficulty in assessing the second criterion of the VA Rule of Two when making a set-aside decision. Eight of them stated that they sometimes lacked confidence in their fair and reasonable price determinations. VA's training, however, does not fully address these more challenging aspects of implementing the Veterans First policy. More targeted training would provide VA with greater assurance that its contracting officers have the knowledge and skills necessary to implement the policy. Additionally, assessing whether training on this policy should be mandatory would allow VA to determine if it would be beneficial for all contracting officers.", "GAO found that VA conducts limited oversight of contractor compliance with limitations on subcontracting and has few mechanisms for ensuring compliance. For example, GAO found that the required clause for ensuring that veteran-owned small business contractors perform the required portion of work was either missing entirely or an outdated version was used in 11 of the 29 set-aside contract actions GAO reviewed.

In 2006, in order to increase  opportunities for veterans to do business with VA, Congress directed the  department to apply a preference to Veteran-Owned Small Businesses  (VOSB) and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses  (SDVOSB) before awarding competitive contracts. VA created what it  calls its Veterans First Contracting Program (referred to in this report as  Veterans First) to implement the statute.", "In June 2016, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Kingdomware  Technologies, Inc. v. United States clarified conflicting interpretations of  the requirement for the preference, concluding that VA must restrict  competition to veteran-owned small businesses if the contracting officer  reasonably expects that at least two such businesses will submit offers  and the award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best  value to the United States. VA\u2019s prior practice had been to consider this  preference mandatory only until it met its annual goals for contracting with  veteran-owned small businesses. Prior VA practice was also not to apply  it to orders placed against the Federal Supply Schedules (FSS). The  Court held that VA must apply the preference\u2014often referred to as a \u201cset- aside\u201d\u2014before contracting under competitive procedures, regardless of  whether VA has met goals, and to orders placed against FSS. In  response, VA made a number of changes to the policies and regulations  implementing its Veterans First program to ensure appropriate application  across all of the department\u2019s contracts. Firms that receive contracts  through this preference must also comply with a number of requirements,  which generally includes the Small Business Administration\u2019s (SBA)  Limitations on Subcontracting requirement. The purpose of the  subcontracting limitations is to ensure that firms that receive awards on a  set-aside basis perform a material portion of the contract themselves,  rather than subcontracting a majority of the work to firms that would have  been ineligible for the award.", "You requested that we examine changes to how VA implements the  Veterans First program as a result of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.

They also stated, and OSDBU officials confirmed, that each SD/VOSB  self-selects the codes that indicate the types of goods and services it can  provide, and many list a large number. As a result, a search can return  hundreds of results. Twenty-six contracting officers we interviewed\u2014 either individually or in roundtable discussions\u2014stated that they have had  instances where they issued an SD/VOSB set-aside solicitation based on  a VIP search returning a high number of SD/VOSB contractors that  provide the desired goods or services, but no SD/VOSBs submitted  offers. Many of these contracting officers stated that, because they feel  they cannot rely on the VIP results, they have taken subsequent steps  such as using public \u201csources sought\u201d notices to gauge interest from  SD/VOSBs. While this step requires additional time, they said they found  it to be a better source of information for making a VA Rule of Two  decision.", "VA OSDBU officials stated that they would like to provide contracting  officers with enhanced utility for conducting and documenting market  research. They acknowledged that VIP is not designed to be used as a  market research tool and that the challenges contracting officers noted  were not surprising. The director of OSDBU stated that VA is planning to  make some improvements to its VIP database to provide better  information on SD/VOSB capability, but, according to these officials,  these improvements are not yet available for use.", "The 2016 Veterans First policy requires contracting officers to document  their VIP searches in the contract file, but this requirement is being  implemented inconsistently. Specifically, 29 of the 35 contract files we  reviewed did not contain such documentation. The cognizant contracting  officers for most of these contracts told us they conducted the VIP  searches; some stated they forgot to print and attach the results to the  contract file, while others stated they had difficulty printing the results.  According to VA\u2019s Veterans First policy, documenting the results of the  VIP search is required to establish the contracting officer\u2019s basis for the  VA Rule of Two decision, regardless of whether the contract is set aside  or not. Documenting this information in the case files, as required,  provides VA with assurance that contracting officers have performed this  search to support their overall market research efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contracting Officers Face Challenges in Determining Whether to Set Aside for SD/VOSBs Under VA Rule of Two", "paragraphs": ["There are a large number of certified SD/VOSBs offering various goods  and services\u2014about 12,000 as of fiscal year 2017, according to VIP data  provided by the OSDBU. A number of contracting officers we met with  stated that this can result in VIP searches that return a lengthy list of  SD/VOSBs. As a result, the decision of whether to set aside a solicitation  is often based on the second criterion of the VA Rule of Two\u2014whether  there is a reasonable expectation that the award can be made at a price  that is fair and reasonable and offers the best value to VA. To meet this  criterion, the contracting officer combines research and professional  judgment to make a decision whether to set aside or not, according to VA  officials.", "While these VA Rule of Two criteria have not changed since 2007,  contracting officers told us that their perception of the rule\u2019s application  has changed following the Supreme Court decision and VA\u2019s 2016  Veterans First policy. Several contracting officers we met with stated that  sometimes, when they identified that there were two or more SD/VOSBs  that they expected to submit offers, they set aside a solicitation without  providing full consideration of this second criterion. These contracting  officers told us it is difficult in some cases to make a prospective  determination that they can reasonably expect to be able to make an  award at a fair and reasonable price without any actual offers in-hand.  Contracting officers told us that prior to the Supreme Court decision their  understanding was that they had the option to set aside contract actions  for SD/VOSBs when they expected that the price would be fair and  reasonable. They stated that after the decision, management relayed an  expectation that contracting officers must set aside contract actions to  SD/VOSBs unless they can prove that they cannot reasonably expect to  make an award at a fair and reasonable price.", "Contracting officers also told us of instances where they identified  multiple SD/VOSBs likely to submit proposals, but, based on their market  research, it was unlikely that an award could be made at a fair and  reasonable price that offered best value to VA. Many of these contracting  officers stated that, despite those findings, they focused only on the  number of SD/VOSBs, in part because they felt pressure to do so from  local or headquarters\u2019 management, OSDBU, or feared protests from  SD/VOSBs, which would delay the award.", "In two specific areas of contracting we found examples of differing  approaches to addressing the challenges faced by contracting officers  when applying the VA Rule of Two criteria. Prior to the Supreme Court  decision, there was little use of SD/VOSB set-asides in real property  leasing or for high-tech medical equipment, according to officials from  contracting offices responsible for these procurements. After the decision,  there was uncertainty about whether and how to apply the Veterans First  policy to these areas of contracting. As illustrated in the examples below,  real property officials continue to face challenges applying the VA Rule of  Two to leasing, whereas high-tech medical equipment contracting officials  addressed this challenge by preparing a business case and used it to  apply the VA Rule of Two consistently across their contracts:", "Officials in VA\u2019s headquarters Construction and Facilities  Management office\u2014responsible for planning, designing, and  constructing VA facilities\u2014told us that prior to the Supreme Court  decision they did not apply the VA Rule of Two to its real property  leases. These officials stated that they have found the Rule of Two to  be difficult to apply. According to the officials, VHA facilities have  requirements for specific size, space, and location, and there are few  SD/VOSBs in this industry, so it is rare that an SD/VOSB can meet  these requirements. These officials further told us that, since the  Supreme Court decision, they have often set aside lease solicitations  for SD/VOSBs as long as there were two firms available despite  uncertainty that these firms could compete for the work at a fair and  reasonable price at best value to the VA.", "According to these VA officials, based on guidance they received from  OGC and others, they felt compelled to conduct the procurements as  SD/VOSB set-asides even when they were unsure that the second  criterion of the VA Rule of Two would be met. These officials stated  they are often unable to make awards to those firms\u2014either because  their proposals were not acceptable, or the SD/VOSBs did not submit  proposals at all. They expressed concern that the Veterans First  program is being applied to leasing when, from their perspective, it is  impractical to do so. They stated that these challenges in applying  VA\u2019s Rule of Two criteria have added an average of 3 to 6 months to  the process of awarding a new lease, resulting in delays in developing  new facilities. Similarly, officials responsible for awarding leases at  one VISN contracting office we visited told us they set aside a  solicitation to an SDVOSB even though only one SDVOSB responded  to a sources sought notice. This action was taken, according to the  contracting officials, because they were concerned that their decision  would be challenged by OSDBU if they did not set it aside. They  stated they had been without a broker\u2014a firm that helps to negotiate  leases\u2014for more than a year due to challenges in applying the VA  Rule of Two, making it difficult for them to move forward with any new  leases.", "In both cases, VA officials stated that they decided to solicit on an  SD/VOSB set-aside basis even though they lacked confidence that  there was a reasonable expectation that two or more SD/VOSBs  would submit offers and that award could be made at a fair and  reasonable price that offered the best value to the government. Also,  in both cases, VA had to reissue solicitations without the SD/VOSB  set-aside restriction, which lengthened the time that VA procurement  staff were required to spend on the acquisition and delayed the  fulfillment of VA\u2019s leasing requirements.", "In contrast, another VA contracting organization determined that  SD/VOSB set-asides were not feasible because there was no  reasonable expectation that two or more SD/VOSBs would submit  offers and that award could be made at a fair and reasonable price.", "The National Acquisition Center\u2019s program to procure high-tech  medical equipment\u2014such as magnetic resonance imaging and X-ray  machines\u2014historically had little participation from SD/VOSBs.  Following the release of the 2016 Veterans First policy, contracting  officials responsible for the program halted all non-emergency  purchases for over a year while they conducted an analysis of how to  apply the VA Rule of Two to purchases of high-tech medical  equipment. These officials analyzed the marketplace and concluded  that no SD/VOSBs manufacture such equipment, and that purchasing  this equipment from SD/VOSB resellers would greatly increase costs  and not present the best value to VA.", "The results of this analysis were summarized in an internal report that  was used as documentation to support the contracting officers\u2019  decision not to set-aside high-tech medical equipment purchases for  SD/VOSBs. As a result, they continued to meet medical centers\u2019  equipment needs through existing purchasing arrangements. The  contracting officers told us they also periodically revisit their analysis  to identify any opportunities to set aside specific solicitations for  SD/VOSBs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Determining Whether the Price Offered by an SD/VOSB Is Fair and Reasonable Poses Challenges for Contracting Officers", "paragraphs": ["Contracting officers must determine whether the price proposed by an  SD/VOSB is fair and reasonable and offers the best value to VA before  awarding the contract. The 2016 Veterans First policy did not change this  requirement, and contracting officers are generally required to make this  determination for every contract award. However, we found that many of  the contracting officers we interviewed were uncertain how to balance the  Veterans First preference with the determination of fair and reasonable  price when lower prices were available on the open market. Twelve of the  30 contracting officers we interviewed for selected contract actions stated  that it is difficult to assess whether the SD/VOSB\u2019s offered price is fair  and reasonable, and 8 stated that, in some cases, they lacked confidence  in their determinations that prices were fair and reasonable. In many of  these cases, contracting officers told us that they determined that a  higher price was fair and reasonable in order to effectuate the Veterans  First preference. For instance, a branch chief we interviewed provided  five examples of purchases under $16,000 where, in recent, separate  procurements, non-SD/VOSB small businesses had proposed prices for  the same or substantially similar items that were about $400 to $3,000  less than those proposed by SD/VOSBs. These procurements were  conducted as SD/VOSB set-asides, and awards were made to  SD/VOSBs on the basis of the Veterans First preference.", "The FAR establishes that adequate price competition normally  establishes a fair and reasonable price, and it provides methods for  determining fair and reasonable pricing, such as comparing proposed  prices to each other, previous prices paid for the same or similar items,  published prices, or the independent government cost estimate.  However, a few of these contracting officers told us that some of these  comparison methods may not be reliable for offers received under  SD/VOSB set-asides. They stated that they lacked the confidence that  using these methods consistently provided robust and well-documented  support for their decision to not award to an SD/VOSB. For example, they  stated that in some instances, the independent government cost estimate  is outdated, and the customer responsible for preparing it conducts  limited market research. This issue is not unique to VA; in 2017, we  reported on shortcomings in the usefulness and documentation of  independent government cost estimates across several agencies.", "VA Procurement Policy officials emphasized that contracting officers must  apply professional judgment and that no across-the-board standard  exists\u2014a higher price compared to non-SD/VOSBs might be  appropriately found reasonable in some cases but not others, depending  on many variables, including the degree of difference between the prices  and the size and complexity of the requirement. However, in response to  requests for clarification from contracting officers, VA officials provided  conflicting informal guidance. For example, a contracting officer stated  that, during a webinar training on the implementation of the Veterans First  policy in late 2016, VHA\u2019s Acting Chief Procurement and Logistics Officer  said that, as a general rule, he would be hesitant to pay 5 percent more  than any recent prices identified in contracting officers\u2019 market research  for the same or similar supplies or services from non-SD/VOSBs, a view  he repeated when we interviewed him in spring of 2018.", "In contrast, the Executive Director for the Office of Acquisition and  Logistics said he would not advocate paying any amount above recent  prices identified in contracting officers\u2019 market research for the same or  similar goods or services from non-SD/VOSBs for any requirement. He  stated that the Veterans First statute and policy did not authorize higher  prices for goods and services from SD/VOSBs. According to a contracting  officer we met with, he shared this view in a training session at a VA  conference in March 2017, as well as when meeting with us in spring of  2018. A consistent message from senior management would provide VA  greater assurance that its contracting officers have confidence when  making fair and reasonable price determinations in set-aside acquisitions.", "In one of VA\u2019s national contracting offices, the Strategic Acquisition  Center, the Director told us that contracting officers were confused about  how to implement the Veterans First policy in their work, particularly in  making VA Rule of Two decisions and fair and reasonable price  determinations. In order to address confusion and provide guidance to  contracting officers, the Director stated that he provided a series of case  studies to contracting officers that demonstrated effective application of  these aspects of the Veterans First policy.

These situations include:  contracts for certain types of services, such as grounds maintenance,  van transportation, and specialty trade construction; where a SD/VOSB has multiple contracts across several VISNs for  the same services; and where a SD/VOSB does not have a business presence in the same  geographical area where the services are being performed.", "They said these were higher risk situations because the SD/VOSBs have  had difficulty completing the required work on their own, or the lack of a  local business presence increases the likelihood that the SD/VOSB might  rely on a local, non-SD/VOSB contractor to do more than the permissible  portion of the work. According to RMCS officials, they have not shared  information on subcontracting limitation risks with stakeholders, such as  contracting officers and their management, but they agreed this could be  a helpful step. By sharing information on higher risk situations, contracting  officers would have a better understanding of when to refer cases to  RMCS.", "Our prior work on subcontracting limitations, in the context of SBA\u2019s 8(a)  program, also identified situations presenting an increased risk that  subcontracting limitations may be exceeded. These situations included  instances when the 8(a) prime contractor proposed subcontractors that  were the agency\u2019s incumbent contractor or that had more experience in  meeting the agency\u2019s current requirement than the small business. It also  included situations where the subcontractor, rather than the prime  contractor, submitted documents to or corresponded directly with  government officials.

In one case we reviewed, the  contracting officer reported that a large business was the prime contractor  on a previous water treatment services contract. After the 2016 Supreme  Court decision, the contract was re-competed on a SDVOSB set-aside  basis; a SDVOSB won the award and the incumbent contractor served as  a subcontractor. According to the contracting officer, he suspected that  the subcontractor was performing more than 50 percent of the work  based on the SDVOSB\u2019s limited capacity, but he said he did not have the  authority to request information on payments from the SDVOSB prime  contractor to the subcontractor. We found that neither the set-aside  clause that limits subcontracting nor the monitoring clause were included  in this contract, limiting the contracting officer\u2019s ability to ensure the  SDVOSB was meeting the appropriate subcontracting limitation  requirement.

However, the  2016 Supreme Court decision prompted VA to refocus and refine its  policy, and implementing the refined policy and the associated VA Rule of  Two across the entire enterprise of VA contracting has been challenging  due to inherent complexities, perceived and real pressures to award  contracts to SD/VOSBs, and inconsistent and sometimes conflicting  management guidance. This environment created mixed messages and  lessened some contracting officers\u2019 confidence about how to  appropriately apply the VA Rule of Two criteria, particularly in making a  determination that there is a reasonable expectation that award could be  made at fair and reasonable prices.", "Most of the contracting officers for the selected contracts we reviewed  expressed dissatisfaction with VIP as the starting point for market  research, citing difficulty in using it. While documentation of the VIP  search results is required by the Veterans First policy, over three-quarters  of the contract files we reviewed lacked such documentation. Such  documentation, combined with support for overall market research efforts,  provides VA with assurance that contracting officers have performed this  search as part of the basis for their Rule of Two decision. These  contracting officers also had some difficulty applying the VA Rule of Two,  particularly in the more challenging component, determining whether they  can reasonably expect prices offered by SD/VOSBs to be fair and  reasonable\u2014issues that could be mitigated by establishing more targeted  training that would provide the VA with greater assurance that its  contracting officers have the knowledge and skills necessary to  implement this policy. Further, assessing whether training on the  Veterans First policy should be designated as mandatory would provide  VA with information necessary to determine if such training would be  beneficial for all contracting officers.", "Monitoring of subcontracting limitations is an important oversight tool to  ensure effective implementation of VA\u2019s Veterans First program. Without  ensuring that required contract clauses regarding subcontracting  limitations are included in all SD/VOSB set-aside contracts, VA lacks  assurance that SD/VOSBs are aware of subcontracting limitations.  Additionally, VA\u2019s Subcontracting Compliance Review Program has found  subcontracting limitation violations and has identified some risk factors  and practices for monitoring compliance with subcontracting limitations.  Conducting a comprehensive assessment of fraud risk, using GAO\u2019s  Fraud Risk Framework, would help better position VA to detect potential  fraud related to subcontracting limitations for the Veterans First program.

In June 2016, the Supreme Court\u2019s  decision in Kingdomware Technologies, Inc. v. United States clarified  conflicting interpretations of the requirement for the preference,  concluding that VA must restrict competition to veteran-owned small  businesses if the contracting officer reasonably expects that at least two  such businesses will submit offers and the award can be made at a fair  and reasonable price that offers best value to the United States. This  report assesses: (1) how VA procurement obligations to veteran-owned  small businesses changed in the period from fiscal years 2014 through  2017; (2) what actions VA has taken to update Veterans First policies and  regulations and provide training following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision;  (3) what challenges, if any, VA is encountering in applying Veterans First  policies; and (4) the extent to which VA has mechanisms in place to  monitor compliance with subcontracting limitations by veteran-owned  small businesses, and the effectiveness of such mechanisms.", "To assess how VA procurement obligations to veteran-owned small  businesses changed in the period from fiscal years 2014 through 2017,  we obtained data from VA\u2019s Electronic Contract Management System  (eCMS) on all contracts from fiscal years 2014 through 2017, chosen to  provide data before and after the Supreme Court decision. We chose to  exclude orders reported in Express Reports\u2014summaries of multiple  orders placed on existing contracts\u2014from our analysis. These actions  were only consistently reported in eCMS starting in 2017; because they  represent billions of dollars of obligations with relatively little set-asides to  service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and veteran-owned  small businesses (SD/VOSB), including them would have distorted year- to-year comparisons of percentages set aside for SD/VOSBs. We  analyzed these eCMS data to determine changes in the use of set-asides  for SD/VOSBs relative to overall VA contracting obligations during this  period. We used this analysis to determine the extent to which VA set- aside contract obligations to SD/VOSBs in the period after the  Kingdomware decision compared to the period before the decision. We  adjusted obligations for inflation to fiscal year 2017 dollars using the fiscal  year gross domestic product price index. We also analyzed the data to  identify patterns of set-asides as a percentage of obligations among  different contracting activities and across VA contracting organizations.  To determine the extent to which new businesses are obtaining SD/VOSB  certification, we obtained Vendor Information Pages (VIP) data from VA\u2019s  Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) for  fiscal years 2014 through 2017. We used these data to identify the  change in the total number of certified SD/VOSBs in VIP during this  period. We also analyzed VA\u2019s eCMS data to determine the number of  unique, individual SD/VOSBs that received awards for set-asides during  the same period. With these data from VIP and eCMS, we compared the  number of certified SD/VOSBs to the number of businesses awarded set- asides for each year during this period. To assess reliability of these data,  we also reviewed available eCMS documentation and interviewed officials  responsible for maintaining eCMS data to gather information on  processes, accuracy, and completeness of these data. We determined  that these eCMS and VIP data were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of  describing changes in VA\u2019s use of SD/VOSB set-asides over this period.", "To assess what actions VA has taken to update Veterans First policies  and regulations and provide training following the Supreme Court\u2019s  decision, we analyzed policies, regulations, guidance, and training  materials related to the program, and compared these to what VA had in  place prior to the decision. We obtained and analyzed the program\u2019s  initial Information Letter, policy memorandum, and revisions to VA\u2019s  Acquisition Regulations, which detailed the Department\u2019s intention to  comply with federal statute. We also obtained and reviewed additional  program documentation, including briefings, presentations, and training  provided to contracting officers. We met with leadership at VA\u2019s national  contracting organizations to discuss implementation of the Veterans First  policy within their organizations, and interviewed senior officials in VA\u2019s  Office of Acquisition and Logistics\u2014including Office of Procurement  Policy and VA Acquisition Academy\u2014OSDBU, Office of General Counsel,  and the Veterans Health Administration\u2019s (VHA) Procurement and  Logistics Office to discuss policies, guidance and training regarding the  Veterans First program.", "To assess what challenges, if any, VA is encountering in applying the  Veterans First policy, we gathered documentation from six contracting  organizations across the VA. We conducted reviews of eCMS data to  determine VA\u2019s use of set-asides and the increase in the use of set- asides for all VA contracting organizations. Based on our analysis of  these data, we determined that VHA had the greatest use of set-asides in  fiscal year 2017. As such, we conducted site visits at a non-generalizable  selection of three VHA regional offices, known as Veterans Integrated  Service Networks (VISN).", "The three VISNs we selected are as follows:", "VISN 8: St. Petersburg, Florida", "Network Contracting Office 8", "Orlando, Florida VA Medical Center", "Tampa, Florida VA Medical Center", "VISN 12: Westchester, Illinois", "Network Contracting Office 12", "Hines, Illinois VA Medical Center", "Milwaukee, Wisconsin VA Medical Center", "VISN 16: Ridgeland, Mississippi", "Network Contracting Office 16  Jackson, Mississippi VA Medical Center", "New Orleans, Louisiana VA Medical Center  We focused our site visits on VHA, because it is the largest contracting  organization in the Department.

The first site visit to VISN 8  was chosen because it had a high change in the percent of obligations on  SD/VOSB set-asides from fiscal years 2015 through 2017 and high total  obligations in fiscal year 2017. After completing the first site visit, we  decided to exclude obligations for construction-related contracts, as our  analysis of VA\u2019s eCMS data found that construction had not been affected  much by the 2016 Veterans First policy because the majority of  construction contracts have always been\u2014and continue to be\u2014awarded  to SD/VOSBs. The second site visit to VISN 12 was chosen because it  had a low change in the percent of non-construction obligations on  SD/VOSB set-asides from fiscal years 2015 through 2017 with high total  non-construction obligations in fiscal year 2017. The final site visit to  VISN 16 was chosen because it had a high change in the percent of non- construction obligations on SD/VOSB set-asides from fiscal years 2015 to  2017 with high total non-construction obligations in fiscal year 2017.

We visited each of the Network Contracting  Offices and interviewed the contracting officer for each of the selected  contract actions and discussed the set-aside determination and their  experiences with the Veterans First policy; because some were  responsible for more than one, we interviewed 30 contracting officers for  the 35 selected contracts and orders. We interviewed leadership at each  location, and held 5 roundtable discussions with contracting officers from  various product lines\u2014supplies, services, construction, and leasing\u2014 whose contracts were not included in our non-generalizable sample.
