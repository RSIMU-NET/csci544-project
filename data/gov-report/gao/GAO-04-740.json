Success would require effective, collaborative, interdisciplinary, and intergovernmental planning. The present extent and scope nationwide of public safety wireless communication systems' ability to talk among themselves as necessary and authorized has not been determined. Data on current conditions compared to needs are necessary to develop plans for improvement and measure progress over time. However, the nationwide data needed to do this are not currently available. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) intends to obtain this information by the year 2005 by means of a nationwide survey. However, at the time of our review, DHS had not yet developed its detailed plans for conducting this survey and reporting its results. The federal government can take a leadership role in support of efforts to improve interoperability by developing national requirements and a national architecture, developing nationwide databases, and providing technical and financial support for state and local efforts to improve interoperability. In 2001, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) established the federal government's Wireless Public Safety Interoperable Communications Program, SAFECOM, to unify efforts to achieve national wireless communications interoperability. However, SAFECOM's authority and ability to oversee and coordinate federal and state efforts has been limited by its dependence upon other agencies for funding and their willingness to cooperate. OMB is currently examining alternative methods to implement SAFECOM's mission. In addition, DHS, where SAFECOM now resides, has recently announced it is establishing an Office for Interoperability and Compatibility to coordinate the federal response to the problems of interoperability in several functions, including wireless communications. The exact structure and funding for this office, which will include SAFECOM, are still being developed. State and local governments can play a large role in developing and implementing plans to improve public safety agencies' interoperable communications. State and local governments own most of the physical infrastructure of public safety communications systems, and states play a central role in managing emergency communications. The Federal Communications Commission recognized the central role of states in concluding that states should manage the public safety interoperability channels in the 700 MHz communications spectrum. States, with broad input from local governments, are a logical choice to serve as a foundation for interoperability planning because incidents of any level of severity originate at the local level with states as the primary source of support. However, states are not required to develop interoperability plans, and there is no clear guidance on what should be included in such plans."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The inability of first responders\u2014police officers, fire fighters, emergency  medical service personnel, public health officials, and others\u2014to  communicate effectively over wireless systems with one another as  needed during an emergency is a long-standing and widely recognized  problem in many areas across the country. Reports have shown that when  first responders cannot communicate effectively as needed, it can literally  cost lives of both emergency responders and those they are trying to  assist. Thus, effective communications between and among wireless  communications systems used by federal, state, and local public safety  agencies is generally accepted as not only desirable but essential for the  protection of life and property. Public safety officials generally recognize  that effective \u201cinteroperable\u201d communications is the ability to talk with  whom they want, when they want, when authorized, but not the ability to  talk with everyone all of the time. The effective interoperability of wireless  systems permits a rapid and coordinated response to an emergency  incident, whether that incident is a \u201croutine\u201d spill from an overturned  tanker truck or railcar, a natural disaster, or a terrorist attack.", "Various reports have documented a number of barriers to achieving  interoperable public safety wireless communications, including  incompatible and aging equipment, limited and fragmented funding,  fragmented planning and collaboration, and limited equipment standards.  The federal government has been addressing these issues for over 15 years  through the attempts of a variety of federal agencies to define the extent of  the problem and to identify potential solutions. The September 11 attacks  have resulted in greater public and governmental focus on the role of first  responders and their capabilities to respond to emergencies, including  terrorist incidents. In our November 6, 2003, testimony before  subcommittees of the House Committee on Government Reform we  identified three principal challenges to improving interoperable  communications for first responders: (1) clearly identifying and defining  the problem; (2) establishing national interoperability performance goals  and standards that balance nationwide standards with the flexibility to  address differences in state, regional, and local needs and conditions; and   (3) defining the roles of federal, state, and local governments and other  entities in addressing interoperability needs. We noted that perhaps the  fundamental barrier to addressing all of the long-standing problems in  interoperable communications is the lack of effective, collaborative,  interdisciplinary, and intergovernmental planning and that no one first  responder group or governmental agency can successfully \u201cfix\u201d the  interoperability problems that face our nation.", "In this report, we examine (1) issues in determining the current  interoperable communications capabilities of first responders nationwide,  including the scope and severity of interoperable wireless  communications problems across the nation; (2) the potential roles that  federal, state, and local governments can play in improving these  communications, and (3) how the variety of federal grants for state and  local first responders may encourage or inhibit the assessment of  interoperable problems and the development of comprehensive plans to  address those problems.", "To address these issues, we met with officials of the Office of Management  and Budget (OMB), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the  Department of Justice (DOJ), the Department of Commerce (DOC), the  Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and the Department of  Defense (DOD), and obtained and reviewed appropriate documentation.  We also met with officials from the states of California, Florida, Georgia,  and Washington and local governments within those states. We chose  these four states because we had information that they were active in  addressing interoperability issues and because California and Washington  provided an opportunity to examine specific interoperability issues that  might be presented by national borders with Mexico and Canada. We  obtained and reviewed documentation from federal, state, and local  officials regarding interoperability issues, plans and activities. In addition,  we attended several meetings of public safety communications officials  and met with staff of the National Governors Association. See appendix I  for more details on our objectives, scope, and methodology. In addition,  information on cross-border communications issues we obtained during  field visits to the states of California and Washington is included in  appendix II.

Rather, it is a  necessary means for achieving an important goal\u2014the ability to respond  effectively to and mitigate incidents that require the coordinated actions of  first responders, such as multi-vehicle accidents, natural disasters, or  terrorist attacks. Public safety officials have pointed out that needed  interoperable communications capabilities are based on whether  communications are needed for (1) \u201cmutual-aid responses\u201d or routine day- to-day coordination between two local agencies; (2) extended task force  operations involving members of different agencies coming together to  work on a common problem, such as the 2002 sniper attacks in the  Washington, D.C. metropolitan area; or (3) a major event that requires  response from a variety of local, state, and federal agencies, such as major  wildfires, hurricanes, or the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. A  California State official with long experience in public safety  communications breaks the major event category into three separate types  of events: (1) planned events, such as the Olympics, for which plans can be  made in advance; (2) recurring events, such as major wildfires and other  weather events, that can be expected every year and for which  contingency plans can be prepared based on past experience; and   (3) unplanned events, such as the September 11th attacks, that can rapidly  overwhelm the ability of local forces to handle the problem.", "Interoperable communications are but one component, although a key  one, of an effective incident command planning and operations structure.  As shown in figure 1, determining the most appropriate means of  achieving interoperable communications must flow from an  comprehensive incident command and operations plan that includes  developing an operational definition of who is in charge for different types  of events and what types of information would need to be communicated  (voice, data, or both) to whom under what circumstances. Other steps  include:    defining the range of interoperable communications capabilities needed  for specific types of events;    assessing the current capabilities to meet these communications needs;  identifying the gap between current capabilities and defined requirements;   assessing alternative means of achieving defined interoperable    developing a comprehensive plan\u2014including, for example, mutual aid  agreements, technology and equipment specifications, and training\u2014for  closing the gap between current capabilities and identified requirements.", "Interoperable communications requirements are not static, but change  over time with changing circumstances (e.g., new threats) and technology  (e.g., new equipment), and additional spectrum as it becomes available.

According to  SAFECOM officials, there are over 2.5 million public safety- first  responders within more than 50,000 public safety organizations in the  United States. Local and state agencies own over 90 percent of the existing  public safety communications infrastructure. This intricate public safety  communications infrastructure incorporates a wide variety of  technologies, equipment types, and spectrum bands. In addition to the  difficulty that this complex environment poses for federal, state, and local  coordination, 85 percent of fire personnel, and nearly as many emergency  management technicians, are volunteers with elected leadership. Many of  these agencies are small and do not have technical expertise; only the  largest of the agencies have engineers and technicians.", "In the past, a stovepiped, single jurisdiction, or agency-specific  communication systems development approach prevailed\u2014resulting in  none or less than desired interoperable communications systems. Public  safety agencies have historically planned and acquired communications  systems for their own jurisdictions without concern for interoperability.  This meant that each state and local agency developed communications  systems to meet their own requirements, without regard to interoperability  requirements to talk to adjacent jurisdictions. For example, a Public Safety  Wireless Network (PSWN) analysis of Fire and Emergency Management  Services (EMS) communications interoperability found a significant need  for coordinated approaches, relationship building, and information  sharing. However, the PSWN program office found that public safety  agencies have traditionally developed or updated their radio systems  independently to meet specific mission needs.", "According to a study conducted by the National Task Force on  Interoperability, public safety officials have unique and demanding  communications requirements. According to the study, however, when the  issue of interoperability is raised, officials respond that they are unable to  even talk to their own personnel, much less expand their communications  to include reliable and interoperable local and regional communications,  and, ultimately reliable and interoperable local, state, and federal  communications. The events of September 11, 2001, which called for an  integrated response of federal, state, and local first responders, highlighted  the need for interoperable first responder communication across  disciplines and throughout levels of government.", "The attacks on New York City and the Pentagon have resulted in greater  public and governmental focus on the role of first responders and their  capabilities to respond to emergencies, including those resulting from  terrorist incidents. One result has been significantly increased federal  funding for state and local first responders, including funding to improve  interoperable communications among federal, state, and local first  responders. In fiscal year 2003, Congress appropriated at least $154 million  targeted specifically for interoperability through a variety of grants  administered by the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of  Justice, and other agencies. Other available grants, such as the Homeland  Security Grant, could be used for a variety of purposes, including  interoperable communications.", "For over 15 years, the federal government has been concerned with public  safety spectrum issues, including communications interoperability issues.  A variety of federal departments and agencies have been involved in  efforts to define the problem and to identify potential solutions, such as  the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Justice  (DOJ), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and the National  Telecommunications and Information Agency (NTIA) within the  Department of Commerce (DOC), among others. Today, a combination of  federal agencies, programs, and associations are involved in coordinating  emergency communications.", "DHS has several agencies and programs involved with addressing first  responder interoperable communication barriers, including the SAFECOM  program, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and the  Office for Domestic Preparedness (ODP). As one of its 24 E-Gov  initiatives, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in 2001 created  SAFECOM to unify the federal government\u2019s efforts to help coordinate the  work at the federal, state, local, and tribal levels to establish reliable  public safety communications and achieve national wireless  communications interoperability. The SAFECOM program was brought  into DHS in early 2003. In June 2003, SAFECOM partnered with the  National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National  Institute of Justice (NIJ) to hold a summit that brought together over 60  entities involved with communications interoperability policy setting or  programs. According to NIST, the summit familiarized key interoperability  players with work being done by others and provided insight into where  additional federal resources may be needed.", "In addition to the many federal agencies and programs involved with  shaping first responder interoperable communication policies, a range of  public safety associations play a significant role in defining the problems  and solutions to emergency communications interoperability. For example  the National Public Safety Telecommunications Council (NPSTC) is a  federation representing public safety telecommunications. The purpose of  NPSTC is to follow up on the recommendations made by the Public Safety  Wireless Advisory Committee (PSWAC) to FCC and the National  Telecommunications and Information Agency on public safety  communication needs. In addition, NPSTC acts as a resource and  advocate for public safety telecommunications issues and is working with  SAFECOM to develop requirements for first responder communications.", "FCC established the Public Safety National Coordination Committee  (NCC) to advise them on spectrum policy decisions for public safety  interoperable communications.

First, public safety agencies have been  assigned frequencies in new bands over time as available frequencies  become congested and as new technology made other frequencies  available for use. As a result, public safety agencies now operate over  multiple frequency bands\u2014operating on these different bands required  different radios because technology was not available to include all bands  in one radio. Thus, the new bands provided additional capabilities but  fragmented the public safety radio frequency spectrum, making  communications among different jurisdictions difficult. Another technical  factor inhibiting interoperability is the different technologies or different  applications of the same technology by manufacturers of public safety  radio equipment.

Two key studies in the late 1990s sponsored  by DOJ and PSWN program provide a nationwide picture of wireless  interoperability issues among federal, state, and local police, fire, and  emergency medical service agencies at that time. Both studies describe  most local public safety agencies as interacting with other local agencies  on a daily or weekly basis. As a result, most local agencies had more  confidence in establishing radio links with one another than with state  agencies, with whom they less frequently interact. Local public safety  agencies interact with federal agencies least of all, with a smaller  percentage of local agencies expressing confidence in their ability to  establish radio links with federal agencies.", "However, the events of September 11, 2001, have resulted in a  reexamination of the circumstances in which interoperable  communications should extend across political jurisdictions and levels of  government. To obtain a current national picture, SAFECOM established  as a key objective to assess by July 2005 the current state of  interoperability across the nation and create a nationwide baseline  describing public safety communications and interoperability. The  baseline will be the basis for measuring future improvements made  through local, state, and federal public safety communications initiatives.  SAFECOM officials said their study will be designed to measure actual  interoperability capabilities in a sample of locations selected to represent  the national condition. According to these officials, SAFECOM will  conduct a gap analysis, which will compare the actual levels of  interoperability within a state to the various scenarios used in a  nationwide statement of requirements and determine the minimum level of  interoperability that needs to be obtained.", "Establishing a national baseline for public safety wireless communications  interoperability will be difficult because the definition of who to include as  a first responder is evolving, and interoperability problems and solutions  are situation specific and change over time to reflect new technologies and  operational requirements. In a joint SAFECOM/AGILE program planning  meeting in December 2003, participants agreed that a national baseline is  necessary to know what the nations\u2019 interoperability status really is, to set  goals, and to measure progress. However, at the meeting, participants said  they did not know how they were going to define interoperability, how  they could measure interoperability, or how to select their sample of  representative jurisdictions; this was all to be determined at a later date.  At the time of our review, SAFECOM officials acknowledged that  establishing a baseline will be difficult and said they are working out the  details of their baseline study but still expect to complete it by July 2005.", "DHS also has other work under way that may provide a tool for such self- assessments by public safety officials.

The official said  the assessment will provide an inventory of communications equipment  and identify how the equipment is used. He also said the results of this  prototype effort will be placed on a CD-Rom and distributed to states and  localities to provide a tool to conduct their own self assessments.

Traditionally, first responders have been  considered to be fire, police, and emergency medical service personnel.  However, in a description of public safety challenges, a federal official  noted that the attacks of September 11, 2001, have blurred the lines  between public safety and national security. According to the Gilmore  Commission, effective preparedness for combating terrorism at the local  level requires a network that includes public health departments, hospitals  and other medical providers, and offices of emergency management, in  addition to the traditional police, fire, and emergency medical services  first responders. Furthermore, Congress provided an expanded definition  of first responders in the Homeland Security Act of 2002, which defined  \u201cemergency response providers\u201d as including \u201cFederal, State, and local  emergency public safety, law enforcement, emergency response,  emergency medical (including hospital emergency facilities), and related  personnel, agencies, and authorities.\u201d", "Technological changes also present new problems and opportunities for  achieving and maintaining effective interoperable communications.

However, three different and incompatible trunking  technologies developed, and these systems were not interoperable. This  official noted that as mobile data communications becomes more  prevalent and new digital technologies are introduced, standards become  more important.", "In addition, technical standards for interoperable communications are still  under development. Beginning in 1989, a partnership between industry and  the public safety user community developed what is known as Project 25  (P-25) standards. According to the PSWN program office, Project 25  standards remain the only user-defined set of standards in the United  States for public safety communications. DHS purchased radios that  incorporate the P-25 standards for each of the nation\u2019s 28 urban search  and rescue teams.

Availability of new spectrum can also  encourage the development of new technologies and require further  development of technical standards. For example, the FCC recently  designated a new band of spectrum, the 4.9 Gigahertz (GHz) band, for use  and support of public safety. The FCC provided this additional spectrum  to public safety users to support new broadband applications such as high- speed digital technologies and wireless local area networks for incident  scene management.

At that time, the development of an interoperable federal system  was seen as a long-term goal. \u201cThere is an integrated system-of-systems, in regular use, that allows public safety  personnel to communicate (voice, data, and video) with whom they need on demand, in  real time, as authorized:  Public safety can respond anywhere, bring their own equipment, and can work on any  network immediately when authorized.", "Public safety will have the networking and spectrum resources it needs to function  properly.\u201d", "SAFECOM officials said under this concept each major region of the  country\u2014for example, New York City, Chicago, and Saint Louis and their  adjacent suburban jurisdictions\u2014will have their own \u201csystem\u201d which is  made up of multiple subsystems, such as police agencies, that have  established relationships. Part of the SAFECOM concept is that a centrally  dispatched Urban Search and Rescue team can respond to any of these  cities/regions and operate with the equipment that they bring with them.", "However, a national architecture has not been prepared yet to guide the  creation of interoperable communications. An explicit and commonly  understood and agreed-to blueprint, or architecture, is required to  effectively and efficiently guide modernization efforts. For a decade, we  have promoted the use of architectures, recognizing them as a crucial  means to a challenging goal: agency operational structures that are  optimally defined in both business and technological environments. Office  of Management and Budget officials told us that OMB charged SAFECOM  with developing a national architecture, which will include local, state, and  federal government architectures. According to these officials, SAFECOM  is to work closely with state and local governments to establish a basic  understanding of what infrastructure currently exists and to identify  public safety communication requirements. SAFECOM officials said the  development of a national architecture will take time because SAFECOM  must first assist state and local governments to establish their  communications architectures. They said SAFECOM will then collect the  state and local architectures, and fit them into a national architecture that  links federal communications into the state and local infrastructure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation Program for Existing and Emerging Public Safety Communications and Interoperability", "paragraphs": ["The SAFECOM Program Plan includes an objective for 2005 to establish a  research, development and testing, and evaluation program that identifies  and develops a long-term, sustainable technical foundation.

Public safety agencies have historically planned and acquired  communications systems for their own jurisdictions without concern for  interoperability. This meant that each state and local agency developed  communications systems to meet their own requirements, without regard  to interoperability requirements to talk to adjacent jurisdictions. For  example, a PSWN analysis of Fire and EMS communications  interoperability found a significant need for coordinated approaches,  relationship building, and information sharing. However, the PSWN  program office found that public safety agencies have traditionally  developed or updated their radio systems independently to meet specific  mission needs.", "The PSWN program also concluded that state leaders can, through  memorandums of understanding (MOU), help to define interagency  relationships, reach procedural agreements, promote regular meetings of  statewide or regional interoperability committees, and encourage joint  efforts to deploy communications technology.

For example,  several officials said the state can facilitate the planning process by  including key stakeholder input in the decision making process and ensure  that communications interoperability issues are addressed. However,  officials also see state roles in providing common infrastructure and  developing routine training exercises.", "Several states have or are taking executive and legislative actions that  coordinate and facilitate efforts to address problems of interoperable  communications within their states. For example, as we indicated  previously, states we visited have or are in the process of establishing  SIECs to enhance communications interoperability planning, including the  development of interoperability plans and administration of  interoperability spectrum. California in 2003 also established the Public  Safety Radio Strategic Planning Committee (PSRSPC) to develop and  implement a statewide integrated public safety communications system  for state government agencies that facilitates interoperability and other  shared uses of public safety spectrum with local and federal agencies.

According to another  Public Safety Wireless network (PSWN) funding report, the extraordinary  investment in LMR systems makes obtaining the necessary funding to  finance the replacement or upgrade of LMR systems one of the greatest  challenges facing public safety agencies. This is especially true because  public safety communications systems typically reach the end of their  useful life cycle in 8 to 10 years. In addition, the National  Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and Federal  Communications Commission (FCC) have established a new migration  plan that will require that all federal and state and local public safety  agencies replace current LMR equipment with narrowband (12.5 kHz)  equipment by 2008 and 2018, respectively.

This has a limiting effect on the ability of the skilled personnel who normally  engage in the regional planning efforts to continue engagement at the high levels that  would be necessary to deal with a re-banding effort. This is even more the case in the  complex border areas where numerous technical, procedural and perhaps political issues  need to be resolved to make the effort a success. Region 43 strongly supports the need for  a national pool of experts and funding to work with the RPCs as they undertake the re- banding in their Regions.

The analysis would be used by the jurisdictions to  develop an interoperable communications plan that would support the  State and Urban Area Homeland Security strategies.", "State and local public safety officials that we spoke with reported that  because of the lack of federal requirements to submit plans for  interoperable communications; some federal grant funds are being spent  on individual projects without a plan to guide these expenditures. States  that we visited received federal funds that could be used for  communications, but did not have statewide communications plans to  guide decisions on local requests for federal funds. To combat this  concern, the state of Washington Emergency Management Division said  that it is holding back on allocating its obligated funds until its State  Executive Interoperability Committee has developed a statewide  communications plan that can be used to guide decisions on local request  for communication funds.", "In addition to variations in requirements to create communications  interoperability plans, federal grants lack consistency in defining what  \u201cregional\u201d body should conduct planning. Regions are defined differently  by different federal agencies. The COPS office, which provided grant funds  for interoperable communications equipment, defined eligible regions as  Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA\u2019s). The Office for Domestic  Preparedness\u2019 (ODP) Urban Areas Security Initiative\u2019s provided grants to  \u201curban area\u201d regions, which were defined\u2014in some cases\u2014as a subset of  a MSA. On the other hand, FEMA awarded its grants for interoperable  communications equipment based upon a jurisdictional nomination from  the state governor. Furthermore, FCC has defined regions for  communications planning based upon other characteristics.

State and local officials from the Office of Emergency  Management Services expressed concern about their inability to develop  effective plans within the current grant timeframes. State officials from  California\u2019s Office of Emergency Management said that the short turn  around timeframe on the ODP Homeland Security and UASI grants limited  their ability to perform a high-level grant review or assist with local  planning. ODP required that grantees submit a proposal within 30 days of  the announcement. As a result, state officials said that they were allowed  only enough time to review whether local grant proposals matched an  itemized equipment list provided by ODP and could not perform an  evaluation of local grant proposals or provide assistance to the locals in  planning for and writing their grants. A representative from a county  Office of Emergency Services in California expressed the same sentiment.  He said that grants are coming with such short timeframes that localities  are operating with a total lack of information before submitting the grants.  He stressed that states and localities need time to study what they need in  order to get something worthwhile. Officials from the other three states  that we visited\u2014Florida, Georgia, and Washington\u2014also articulated  similar concerns.", "Similar to state and local officials, federal officials expressed concerns  about first responders\u2019 ability to plan for long-term regional  communication systems within the current 30 or 60 day submission time  frames allotted for the grants. Officials from SAFECOM said that in order  to alleviate the previous stove pipe communications planning of agencies,  regional planning should be a pre-requisite to receiving federal funds.  However, they emphasized that if planning were required as a condition  for receiving grants, states would have to be given enough lead time to  prepare a successful plan. The officials said that the current time frames  placed on grants does not allow states or jurisdictions enough time to  effectively create a communications plan that would make the most  efficient use of federal funds. Adequate lead time may be a 1 or 2 year  planning period. In addition, states should be given a planning model to  demonstrate how to successfully plan for communications\u2014including  creating a governance structure as the first step. SAFECOM officials said  that they are trying to develop this type of model in the Commonwealth of  Virginia. ODP is also developing a similar model in Kansas City, Missouri.", "COPS officials administering the fiscal year 2003 Interoperable  Communications Technology grant also said that requiring that a  communications plan be developed prior to receiving grants would be a  positive thing, if the grantees were given an appropriate amount of time to  develop a plan before submission\u2014perhaps several months. They noted  that they did not require that grantees have a communications plan  developed prior to receiving federal funds because the grantees only had  30 days from the grant announcement to submit their proposals. The  Homeland Security Grant, UASI grant, Assistance to Firefighters grants  also allow states only 30 or 60 days to submit a grant proposal.  Demonstration grants also have been awarded to state and locals for  communications interoperability that have 1 or 2 year performance  periods and do not support long-term solutions. For example, Assistance  to Firefighters Grant, COPS and FEMA\u2019s Interoperable Communications  Equipment grants, and National Urban Search and Rescue Response  System grants all have 1-year performance periods. UASI, HSGP, and  Local Law Enforcement Block Grants have 2-year performance periods."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fragmented First Responder Grant Structure Complicates and Limits Coordination at the Federal, State, and Local Levels", "paragraphs": ["In our 2003 testimony, we pointed out that the federal first responder  grant programs\u2019 structure was fragmented, which can complicate  coordination and integration of services and planning at the state and local  levels.

For example, DHS\u2019s Assistance to Firefighters grant  had a maintenance of effort requirement while the Fire Training Systems  grant had no similar requirement.", "In this report, we find that fragmentation exists within Communications  Interoperability grants that presents challenges to federal efforts to  coordinate and streamline the funding process. Multiple agencies provide  communication interoperability funding and have different guidelines and  appropriations language that define how the funds can be used. A list of  interoperable communications grant sources from 2003 through 2004  within DHS and DOJ and their eligible uses are listed in table 2.", "Despite federal efforts within DHS to synthesize federal grants, various  agencies have statutory language that make it difficult to coordinate their  use. For example, both SAFECOM and COPS officials said that certain  statutory provisions underlying the grant programs presented barriers to  the coordination efforts of COPS, FEMA, and SAFECOM to consolidate  the grant application process for the 2003 Interoperable Communications  Equipment grants. COPS and FEMA coordinated their application process  for the grants and used sections of the SAFECOM grant guidance to guide  their application requirements. According to COPS and FEMA officials, the  combined COPS and FEMA application process was intended to maximize  the use of funds and reduce duplication and competition between the two  agencies\u2019 Interoperability grants. Both COPS and SAFECOM officials  explained that COPS and FEMA encountered difficulty in creating a  combined grant application process because the COPS grant required a  twenty-five percent match while the FEMA grant did not have such a  requirement. However, COPS officials said FEMA added a twenty-five  percent match of \u201cin-kind\u201d resources to its grant requirements in order to  reduce competition between the COPS and FEMA grant programs.", "In addition to matching requirements, the underlying statutory language  for COPS and FEMA interoperable communications grants made it  difficult to incorporate some of the SAFECOM grant guidance  recommendations. For example, SAFECOM grant guidance recommended  that applicants conduct planning for developing public safety  communications and specified eligible planning activities. However, the  underlying statutory language for the COPS and FEMA grants focuses on  the purchase of equipment without specifically addressing planning. COPS  and FEMA officials said that they were able to justify allowing certain  planning activities directly related to the purchase of equipment, but could  not require that funds be used to develop a communications system.  SAFECOM grant guidance also recommended addressing maintenance and  other life-cycle costs of communications equipment; however, the  statutory language underlying COPS and FEMA interoperable  communications equipment grants focuses on funding the purchase of  equipment rather than maintenance and other related costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "No Coordinated Federal or State Grant Review Exists to Ensure Funds Are Used to Improve Regional or Statewide Communications Interoperability", "paragraphs": ["Federal officials that we spoke with agreed that, generally, there is no  high-level review of communications interoperability across the federal  government to ensure that the full range of granted projects compliment  each other and add to overall statewide and national interoperability. Each  agency reviews its own set of applications and projects. As a result, grants  can be given to bordering jurisdictions that propose conflicting  interoperability solutions. For fiscal year 2003, federal officials from COPS  and FEMA attempted to eliminate awarding funds to conflicting  communication systems within bordering jurisdictions by selecting  different applicant pools and coordinating their review of grant proposals.  The COPS office selected the largest MSAs from each state and territory as  well as the 50 largest MSA\u2019s regardless of state, to apply for COPS funds.  FEMA requested that the governor of each state nominate one lead  jurisdiction to submit a grant proposal, taking into account the state\u2019s  demographics and the location of critical infrastructure. In addition to  selecting applicants from different jurisdictions, COPS and FEMA engaged  in a process to ensure that projects from neighboring jurisdictions did not  conflict with or duplicate each other. The collaboration that occurred  between COPS and FEMA to review the 2003 Interoperable  Communications Equipment grant proposals was a step forward, however,  these agencies constitute only two of several federal agencies that provide  funds for communications interoperability.", "A coordinated high-level review of key federal grant programs that award  funds for communication purposes does not exist. In response to this  challenge, SAFECOM has recently sponsored the formation of the Federal  Interagency Coordination Committee (FICC), which includes a federal  grant coordination working group. The FICC is an informal council  consisting of federal agencies, whose mission is to help local, tribal, state  and federal public safety agencies improve public safety response through  more effective and efficient interoperable wireless communications by  reducing duplication in programs and activities, identifying and promoting  best practices and coordinating federal grants, technical assistance,  training, and standards. Federal officials said that FICC will assist in  shaping the common grant guidance for federal initiatives involving public  safety communications. As of April 23, 2004, officials said that FICC has  held two meetings.", "State governments that we visited also did not have a coordinated or  centralized grant review process to ensure that communications grant  funds in the programs that we reviewed were being used to support  projects that were complimentary and not duplicative. Florida State  Technology Office (STO) officials, who are members of Florida\u2019s Domestic  Security Oversight Board (DSOB), said that the DSOB was concerned that  there was no overall centralized review of grant applications for federal  funding and no central review of federal funds passing through the state to  local governments. For example, STO has the statutory authority to  review plans for new or expanded communication systems. However, STO  officials said that some local communications plans are not reviewed by  the state because there is no requirement that locals must submit their  plan to STO for review before grant approval. Florida is now developing a  funding working group under the DSOB to review funding requests for  communication interoperability.", "Officials that we spoke with in California also acknowledged that there  has been no centralized grant review process for funds that can be used  for communications interoperability. Officials from the grants  administration division within the Office of Emergency Services said that  they do not have a centralized review of grant funds in California because  several state and local agencies receive funds directly to their agencies or  jurisdictions from the federal government.", "Local officials were concerned that this lack of a coordinated review of  grants used across the state for communications interoperability can  result in grants being awarded to bordering jurisdictions or localities that  propose conflicting interoperability solutions and, therefore, compound  existing barriers to regional or statewide interoperability. As a result, the  state of Washington has set up a structure to facilitate centralized grant  review of federal and state funding to ensure that they promote regional  interoperability.

The  database is intended to decrease duplication of funding and evaluation  efforts, de-conflict the application process, maximize efficiency of limited  federal funding, and serve as a data collection tool for lessons learned that  would be accessible to state and locals. According to federal officials, this  database is operational; however, its use is limited in its ability to  coordinate federal oversight of grant funds for several reasons. First, the  database does not contain information from the majority of relevant  federal agencies and SAFECOM has no enforcement authority to require  that all federal agencies provide information to the database or use it  guide decisions in their grant approval process.", "In addition, SAFECOM officials said that it is unclear how to obtain the  needed information from formula grants on the use of federal funds for  communications.

According to  these officials, formula grants that go directly to the jurisdictions, like the  ODP UASI grants, have the potential to be tracked and used within the  database if ODP provides application and award information for the  database.
