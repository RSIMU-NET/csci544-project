This report addresses, for fiscal year 2012, (1) the extent to which agencies complied with spending requirements, (2) the extent to which agencies and SBA complied with certain reporting requirements, (3) the potential effects of basing spending requirements on agencies' total R&D budgets, and (4) what is known about the amounts spent administering the programs. GAO reviewed agency spending data and required reports for fiscal year 2012 and interviewed program officials from SBA and the participating agencies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Agency data indicate that 8 of the 11 agencies participating in the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program and 2 of the 5 agencies participating in the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program complied with spending requirements in fiscal year 2012. Program managers for agencies that did not comply with the requirements identified reasons for noncompliance. For example, program managers at two of the agencies told GAO that they believe their agencies comply with spending requirements if the agencies spend the total amount reserved or budgeted for the program, regardless of the year the funding is spent. However, the authorizing legislation for the programs requires agencies to \u201cexpend\u201d a certain amount of funding each year. This difference in the interpretation of spending requirements occurred, in part, because the Small Business Administration's (SBA) policy directives for the programs inaccurately state that the authorizing legislation requires agencies to \u201creserve\u201d the minimum amount each year. Additionally, some officials told GAO their agencies did not comply with spending requirements because the recent reauthorization of the programs included an increased spending requirement in fiscal year 2012, but the reauthorization was enacted a full quarter into the fiscal year, after some agencies had planned their programs and made awards.", "Participating agencies and SBA did not fully comply with certain reporting requirements for the SBIR and STTR programs. For example, participating agencies are required to submit reports to SBA describing their methodologies for calculating their budgets for extramural research or research and development (R&D)\u2014which is generally conducted by nonfederal employees outside of federal facilities\u2014within 4 months of the enactment of appropriations. However, all 11 participating agencies were late in submitting these reports because SBA allowed them to submit the reports later. As a result, SBA was unable to analyze the reports and provide timely feedback to assist agencies in accurately calculating these budgets.", "Potential effects of basing each participating agency's spending requirement on its total R&D budget instead of its extramural R&D budget include an increase in the amount of the spending requirement\u2014for some agencies more than others\u2014and, if the thresholds for participation in the programs did not change, an increase in the number of agencies required to participate. Officials identified benefits of such a change, such as funding more projects, but they generally said the drawbacks could outweigh the benefits.", "Little is known about the total amounts agencies spent administering the SBIR and STTR programs because agencies did not consistently collect such information for fiscal year 2012. Agencies are not required to track costs for administering the programs. Most agencies provided GAO with some data on such costs for fiscal year 2012, ranging from about $200,000 to about $8 million, but the data were wide-ranging, incomplete, and unverifiable. With the start of a pilot program in fiscal year 2013 that allows agencies to use up to 3 percent of SBIR program funds for administrative costs, agencies will be required to report to SBA on the amount spent for such activities. However, even with the pilot program, agencies will likely not identify or track all administrative costs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends, among other things, that SBA revise program policy directives to accurately summarize spending requirements and request that agencies submit their methodology reports on time.

The  SBIR and STTR programs are similar in that participating agencies  identify topics for research or research and development (R&D) projects  and make awards to small businesses to develop and commercialize  innovative technologies. However, for the SBIR program, a for-profit small  business performs the work associated with an award, while the STTR  program requires the small business to partner with a nonprofit research  institution\u2014such as a nonprofit college or university or federally funded  research and development center\u2014to perform the work.", "Federal agencies with a budget of $100 million or more for extramural  R&D are required to establish and operate an SBIR program, while  federal agencies with budgets of $1 billion or more for extramural R&D  are required to establish and operate an STTR program.  Currently, 11  agencies participate in the SBIR program, and 5 of these agencies also  participate in the STTR program, as shown in table 1.", "The Small Business Act, which authorizes the programs, establishes the  minimum percentage of an agency\u2019s extramural R&D budget that must be  spent on the programs annually. In fiscal year 2012, agencies  participating in the SBIR program were required to spend at least 2.6  percent of their extramural R&D budgets on the program and agencies  participating in the STTR program were required to spend at least 0.35  percent of their extramural R&D budgets on the program. The SBIR and  STTR policy directives require participating agencies to submit data to the  Small Business Administration (SBA) each year on the amount of their  extramural R&D budgets and the amount obligated for awards, among  other information. The Small Business Act also establishes certain  reporting requirements for participating agencies and SBA. Among other  things, agencies are to report to SBA on their methodologies for  calculating their extramural R&D budgets within 4 months of the  enactment of their annual appropriations. Furthermore, SBA is to annually  report to Congress on all participating agencies\u2019 SBIR and STTR  programs.", "In addition, the 2011 reauthorization of the programs mandates that GAO  review the participating agencies\u2019 compliance with spending and reporting  requirements for the programs, as well as other aspects of the programs.  We issued our first annual report in response to this mandate in  September 2013, which covered fiscal years 2006 through 2011. In that  report, we recommended, among other things, that SBA provide more  guidance to agencies for calculating spending requirements under certain  circumstances and provide more timely reports to Congress. This second  annual report determines for fiscal year 2012 (1) the extent to which  participating agencies complied with the programs\u2019 spending  requirements, (2) the extent to which participating agencies and SBA  complied with certain reporting requirements, (3) the potential effects of  basing the spending requirements for the SBIR and STTR programs on  agencies\u2019 total R&D budgets instead of their extramural R&D budgets,  and (4) what is known about the amounts participating agencies spent for  administering the programs.", "To address these objectives, we followed the methodology that we used  for our first annual report on these issues. To determine the extent to  which participating agencies complied with the programs\u2019 spending  requirements in fiscal year 2012, we used the data that each agency  submitted to SBA and calculated each agency\u2019s spending requirement by  applying the mandated percentages to the agency\u2019s extramural R&D  budget. We then compared the spending requirements to the total  obligations data the agencies submitted to SBA for fiscal year 2012. We  determined that an agency complied with its spending requirement if the  agency\u2019s spending for these programs was equal to or greater than the  calculated spending requirement. To assess the reliability of these data,  we interviewed agency officials about the source of the data and data  quality control procedures for the data, reviewed relevant documentation,  and compared the agency\u2019s submissions to SBA with SBA\u2019s version of  documents received from the agencies. We determined the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. We discussed  agencies\u2019 compliance with spending requirements, including reasons  agencies did not meet spending requirements, with program officials at  each of the participating agencies.", "To determine the extent to which participating agencies and SBA  complied with certain reporting requirements for fiscal year 2012, we  compared information in the methodology reports that each agency  submitted to SBA to requirements in the law and SBA policy directives.  Additionally, we requested SBA\u2019s report to Congress for fiscal year 2012  and discussed the status of that report with SBA program officials, who  said it had not been submitted at the time of our review.", "To determine the potential effects of basing spending requirements for  the SBIR and STTR programs on agencies\u2019 total R&D budgets instead of  their extramural R&D budgets, we used fiscal year 2012 data on total  R&D budget authority from the President\u2019s budget to calculate potential  spending requirements for each federal agency. In calculating these  potential spending requirements, we assumed that the same spending  percentages currently required by the Small Business Act would apply to  total R&D budgets. We also assumed that the current spending  thresholds that require agency participation in the SBIR and STTR  programs when applied to extramural R&D budgets would apply to total  R&D budgets. In other words, an agency with a total annual R&D budget  of $100 million or more would be required to participate in the SBIR  program, while an agency with a total annual R&D budget of $1 billion or  more would be required to participate in both the SBIR and STTR  programs. We compared the spending requirements that would result  under this scenario with the spending requirements under the current law  to determine the potential effects that changing the methodology to  calculate the spending requirements could have had for fiscal year 2012,  recognizing that changes to the thresholds for participating in the  programs or the mandated percentages could have different effects. We  also calculated spending requirements under another scenario to  determine whether different assumptions would lead to different  outcomes. Under this scenario, we applied a lower percentage than is  required under current law to each agency\u2019s total R&D budget.  Additionally, we discussed the effects of changing the methodology for  calculating the spending requirements for the programs with program  officials at each of the agencies currently participating in the programs  and offered the agencies that could be affected by the change an  opportunity to comment on our analysis.", "To determine what is known about the amounts participating agencies  spent for administering the programs, we collected administrative cost  data from agencies and discussed the data with program officials.

Consequently, we could not use the data to draw conclusions  about agencies\u2019 administrative costs in our report.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2013 to June 2014  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The purpose of the STTR program\u2014initiated  in 1992\u2014is to stimulate a partnership of ideas and technologies between  innovative small businesses and research institutions through federally  funded R&D. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2012, enacted on December 31, 2011, reauthorized the SBIR and STTR  programs through September 30, 2017.", "The SBIR and STTR programs each include the following three phases:  In phase I, agencies make awards to small businesses to determine  the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas that appear to  have commercial potential. Phase I awards normally do not exceed  $150,000. For SBIR, phase I awards generally last 6 to 9 months and  for STTR these awards generally last 1 year.  In phase II, small businesses with phase I projects that demonstrate  scientific and technical merit and feasibility, in addition to commercial  potential, may compete for awards of up to $1 million to continue the  R&D for an additional period, normally not to exceed 2 years.", "Phase III is for small businesses to pursue commercialization of  technology developed in prior phases. Phase III work derives from,  extends, or completes an effort made under prior phases, but it is  funded by sources other than the SBIR or STTR programs. In this  phase, small businesses are expected to raise additional funds from  private investors, the capital markets, or from funding sources within  the agency that made the initial award other than its SBIR or STTR  program. While SBIR or STTR funding cannot be used for phase III,  agencies can participate in phase III by, for example, purchasing the  technology developed in prior phases.", "SBA\u2019s Office of Investment and Innovation is responsible for overseeing  and coordinating the participating agencies\u2019 efforts for the SBIR and  STTR programs by setting overarching policy and issuing policy  directives, collecting program data, reviewing agency progress, and  reporting annually to Congress, among other responsibilities. As part of  its oversight and coordination role, SBA issued SBIR and STTR policy  directives in September 2002 and December 2005, respectively, and  updated them in August 2012, January 2014, and February 2014. These  directives explain and outline additional requirements for agencies\u2019  implementation of the SBIR and STTR programs.

In general, the programs are similar across agencies. For  those agencies that have both SBIR and STTR programs, agencies  usually use the same process for both programs. Each participating  agency has considerable flexibility to design and manage the specifics of  these programs, such as determining research topics, selecting award  recipients, and administering funding agreements. All of the agencies  follow the same general process to obtain proposals from and make  awards to small businesses for both the SBIR and STTR programs.  At  least annually, each participating agency issues a solicitation requesting  proposals for projects in topic areas determined by the agency.

We found that these two  agencies did not implement the annual program spending requirements  as written in the Small Business Act, in part because SBA\u2019s SBIR and  STTR policy directives inaccurately summarize the law.

For  example, if the amount of funding remaining in the program account is  less than the amount of a phase I or phase II award, program managers  said they carry over the funding to the next year, rather than make a  smaller award to a recipient. An agency can carry over funding from one  year to the next and comply with spending requirements if the agency  spends the minimum required amount during the fiscal year, regardless of  the year the funding was appropriated.", "Carrying over funds to the next fiscal year without spending the minimum  required amount contributed to two agencies\u2014DOD and USDA\u2014not  complying with spending requirements in fiscal year 2012. Program  managers from DOD and USDA said their agencies did not meet  spending requirements using our method of calculating compliance, but  DOD and USDA officials said they will spend all of the funding that was  budgeted for the programs before the funding expires, which they believe  meets the intent of the law. Program managers from both agencies  explained that they receive multiyear appropriations for research and  development funding, which would generally allow them to carry over  funds from one year to the next. However, if an agency carries over  funding from one year to the next without spending the minimum required  amount on the program in each fiscal year, then the agency is not in  compliance with the spending requirements. According to SBA officials,  SBA agrees with our methodology for calculating compliance and  interprets the Small Business Act as requiring agencies to spend, rather  than reserve, the required percentages each year.", "Carrying over funds from one year to the next without spending the  minimum required amount in fiscal year 2012 also contributed to at least  one agency\u2014DOD\u2014not complying with spending requirements in prior  years. To demonstrate the effect that carrying over funds can have, we  made the following calculations for DOD for fiscal years 2006 to 2011  using two different methodologies for calculating program spending.  First, we determined the amount spent in a specific year, regardless of  the year the funding was appropriated, from DOD\u2019s total program  obligations data submitted to SBA; this is the method that we used to  calculate compliance with spending requirements for this report and the  method SBA uses. Second, we calculated the amount of the funding  appropriated in a fiscal year that was spent in that year or the next year;  this is how DOD believes it should determine its compliance. We found  that DOD complied with SBIR spending requirements in 2 of the 6 years  from fiscal years 2006 through 2011 and with STTR spending  requirements in 4 of the 6 years using our method.

These increases were the first increases in many years for the programs:  the SBIR levels had remained at a minimum of 2.5 percent of the  extramural R&D budget from 1997 through 2011, and STTR levels had  remained at a minimum of 0.3 percent from 2004 through 2011.  Appropriations for fiscal year 2012 were enacted in November and  December 2011, so some agencies had already planned their spending  for the programs and had started to make awards to meet the prior  percentages of 2.5 percent of their extramural R&D budgets for SBIR  awards and 0.3 percent for STTR awards. For some agencies, this  increase totaled millions of dollars. For example, NASA\u2019s SBIR spending  requirement increased by about $5.5 million, and its STTR spending  requirement increased by about $2.7 million over its estimates at the  beginning of the fiscal year due to the higher percentages included in the  reauthorization. If the spending requirements had remained at fiscal year  2011 levels, one of the three agencies that did not meet SBIR spending  requirements for the year would have met the requirements, and the  remaining two agencies would have been much closer to meeting the  SBIR spending requirements, and all five agencies would have met the  STTR requirements.", "The increased spending requirements also affected agencies that  complied with spending requirements for the year. For example, program  managers at one agency that met SBIR spending requirements told us it  was difficult to spend SBIR and STTR funds at the increased levels in the  remaining portion of the fiscal year because the agencies had already  begun to make awards, and their spending plans for the programs  included funding a certain number of projects at a certain level. Program  officials at one agency said that, as a result of the increased spending  requirements, they increased the amounts of their awards for fiscal year  2013. The officials anticipate that the increased award amounts will help  them meet their minimum spending requirements in future years.

Also, DOE, EPA, NASA, and NSF provided  general categories of exclusions but not particular itemized programs.  DOT excluded the research expenditures of the Federal Aviation  Administration and the Federal Highway Administration from its  extramural R&D budget without explanation in the report about why the  programs were excluded.", "As we found in our first annual report on these issues, agencies  submitted different levels of detail on their methodologies, such as the  programs excluded from the extramural budget and the reasons for the  exclusions, and SBA did not raise questions about details of the  methodologies. SBA officials told us they would like agencies to include  more information about exclusions in their methodology reports. In our  first annual report, we concluded that, without guidance from SBA,  participating agencies are likely to continue to provide SBA with broad,  incomplete, or inconsistent information on their methodologies for  calculating their extramural R&D budgets. At that time, we recommended  that SBA provide additional guidance on the format agencies are to  include in their methodology reports, among other issues. As of May  2014, SBA said that a working group of program managers had  developed a template for agencies to use to submit their methodology  reports. Agencies will be encouraged to use the template for their fiscal  year 2013 submission and required to use it beginning in fiscal year 2014."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Two Agencies Submitted Incorrect Data for the STTR Program", "paragraphs": ["Two agencies\u2014DOD and HHS\u2014submitted incorrect figures to SBA for  the size of their extramural R&D budgets for the STTR program for fiscal  year 2012. The Small Business Act requires federal agencies to spend a  certain amount of their extramural R&D budgets on the SBIR and STTR  programs if the agency meets certain thresholds for participation. The  threshold for participating in the programs is based on the entire agency\u2019s  extramural R&D budget and not that of the specific subunits within the  agency. Additionally, the extramural R&D budget figures for the SBIR and  STTR programs should be consistent because the budget must be  calculated the same way for both programs under the act. However, DOD  submitted an extramural R&D budget for SBIR that was about $2.7 billion  more than its budget for STTR, and HHS submitted an extramural R&D  budget for SBIR that was about $337 million more than its budget for  STTR. This occurred because the two agencies incorrectly excluded the  budgets of subunits within the agencies that spent less than $1 billion per  year on extramural R&D from the budget calculation for the STTR  program.  For example, HHS calculated its extramural R&D budget data  for STTR using the amount of the extramural R&D budget of the National  Institutes of Health and excluded the extramural R&D funding from the  other subunits that participate in the SBIR program\u2014the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, and  the Administration for Children and Families\u2014from its calculation.", "As a result of the incorrect data, DOD and HHS underestimated their  STTR spending requirements by about $9.3 million and $1.2 million,  respectively, for fiscal year 2012. Using the correct extramural R&D  budget figures did not change our assessment of DOD\u2019s or HHS\u2019s  compliance with spending requirements for fiscal year 2012 because  DOD did not meet its spending requirement using the lower extramural  R&D budget figure and HHS\u2019s spending for the STTR program was high  enough that it met its spending requirements even using the higher  extramural R&D budget amount from its SBIR report. However, since  spending requirements are calculated as a percentage of the extramural  R&D budget, using an incorrect budget figure could lead to an agency not  spending the required amount for the programs in the future. For  example, the National Institutes of Health is the only subunit that  participated in HHS\u2019s STTR program in fiscal year 2012. If the National  Institutes of Health had not exceeded the minimum spending  requirements for HHS in fiscal year 2012, HHS would not have complied  with its agencywide spending requirements.", "DOD officials said they were aware of the problem because we identified  it in our first annual report, but it was too late for them to correct it for  fiscal year 2012.

HHS officials told us they did not correct the budget numbers for fiscal  year 2012 because it was too late to do so. However, they also said that  they have not corrected this problem for fiscal years 2013 or 2014  because HHS has not received guidance from SBA to do so.

Consequently, we recommended that SBA provide Congress with a  timely annual report that includes a comprehensive analysis of the  methodology each agency used for calculating the SBIR and STTR  spending requirements.

The change would have had this effect because an agency\u2019s  extramural R&D budget is a part of and, therefore, smaller than its total  R&D budget, and the same percentages would have been applied to a  larger amount of funding.

The agency would have a relatively  small increase in its SBIR spending if the spending requirement were  based on its total R&D budget instead of its extramural R&D budget:  DHS would have been required to spend about $2 million more in  fiscal year 2012 if the calculation methodology changed.", "The Department of Commerce used a relatively small percentage of  its total R&D budget\u2014about 17 percent\u2014for extramural R&D in fiscal  year 2012, and its spending requirement for SBIR would have  increased more than five times, from about $5 million to $27 million in  fiscal year 2012 if the calculation methodology had changed. While  Commerce did not participate in the STTR program in fiscal year  2012, it would have been required to participate in the STTR program  if the calculation methodology had changed and the thresholds for  participating in the program had remained the same. Its spending  requirement for the STTR program would have been $4 million rather  than $0. Consequently, if the funding percentage required in law in  fiscal year 2012 applied to the total R&D budget instead of the  extramural budget, Commerce\u2019s SBIR and STTR spending would  have increased by a total of about $26 million.", "Changing the calculation methodology to the total R&D budget instead of  the extramural R&D budget would also increase the number of agencies  that would be required to participate in the SBIR and STTR programs,  assuming the dollar thresholds for participating in the programs remained  the same. Two additional agencies\u2014the Departments of Veterans Affairs  and the Interior\u2014would have been required to participate in the SBIR  program in fiscal year 2012 if the dollar thresholds for participating in the  programs applied to the total R&D budgets. Adding these two agencies  to the other agencies that participated in the SBIR program in fiscal year  2012 would have increased total federal SBIR spending requirements by  about $51 million, in addition to the increased spending requirements for  the other agencies. For STTR, three additional agencies\u2014Commerce,  USDA, and the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2014would have been  required to participate in the STTR program for fiscal year 2012 if the  dollar thresholds for participating in the programs were applied to the total  R&D budgets.

For example, basing the SBIR and STTR  spending requirement on an agency\u2019s total R&D budget and applying a  lower percentage than under current law could result in reduced spending  requirements for some agencies. Specifically, if the percentage applied to  the total R&D budget had been 1.5 percent instead of 2.6 percent, and  the thresholds for participating in the programs had remained the same,  the spending requirement for the total SBIR programs would have slightly  decreased in fiscal year 2012.

Additionally, several program managers  told us that basing the SBIR and STTR spending requirements on the  total R&D budget could improve transparency and reduce complexity in  determining the SBIR and STTR spending requirements because the  agencies would no longer need to identify the extramural portion of their  R&D budgets, which the agencies have to determine internally.

For example, most program  managers said that increasing the amount of funding for the SBIR and  STTR programs could be a drawback because funding used to support  the agency\u2019s other R&D efforts would have to be spent on the SBIR and  STTR programs. In addition, most program managers said that changing  the methodology for calculating spending requirements for these  programs could affect agency operations, depending on how the change  is implemented within the agency. For example, several program  managers said that basing spending requirements on the total R&D  budget could increase SBIR and STTR budgets, which may lead to a  decision within the agency to reduce intramural R&D programs and, in  turn, lead to reductions in staffing of these programs.

In our first annual report on these issues, we  identified some areas where SBA could take actions to ensure that  agencies comply with spending and reporting requirements. Our report  was issued in September 2013, after agencies\u2019 fiscal year 2012 data and  reports were due to SBA, and, as a result, some of the issues we  identified in the data and reports for fiscal years 2006 through 2011  remained in fiscal year 2012. For example, in our prior report, we found  that the agencies submitted different levels of detail in their methodology  reports, such as the programs excluded from the extramural R&D budget  and the reasons for the exclusions. In that report, we recommended that  the SBA Administrator provide the format for agencies to include in their  methodology reports and to provide timely annual feedback to agencies  on whether their methodology calculations for extramural R&D budgets  comply with program requirements. We found similar issues with  agencies\u2019 reports for fiscal year 2012 and continue to believe that this  oversight is needed and that the recommendation is valid and should be  fully implemented. Additionally, as part of its oversight role, SBA is  required to provide Congress with annual reports on the SBIR and STTR  programs.  However, SBA has faced challenges in submitting its report in  a timely manner\u2014particularly with agencies revising their data  submissions well after the fiscal year is over\u2014leading to reports that are  submitted between 2 and 4 years after the subject year. In our September  2013 report, we recommended that SBA provide Congress with a timely  annual report that includes a comprehensive analysis of the methodology  each agency used for calculating the SBIR and STTR spending  requirements. We continue to believe that providing a timely report to  Congress is important and that the recommendation continues to have  merit and should be fully implemented.  Moreover, such a report could  demonstrate SBA\u2019s oversight to help ensure that the programs are  meeting their intended goals.", "In addition to those issues that could be addressed by implementing our  prior recommendations, we identified four additional issues that\u2014if left  unaddressed\u2014could affect compliance with spending and reporting  requirements in the future. First, some agencies did not comply with the  requirement to spend program funds annually because SBA\u2019s policy  directives inaccurately summarize the requirement. Without correct  information in the policy directives, such misinterpretations could lead to  agencies spending less than required. Second, agencies did not report  the total amounts spent on the programs because SBA has not provided  guidance on whether or how to submit information on spending for  reasons other than awards, such as technical assistance. As a result,  Congress does not have access to complete and accurate information on  the amounts spent on the programs. Third, agencies have continued to  submit their methodology reports to SBA significantly later than required  by law. In fiscal year 2012, most agencies submitted their methodology  reports more than a year after the deadline established in the Small  Business Act. Without holding agencies to the deadlines in the law, SBA  did not have an opportunity to perform timely oversight by analyzing these  methodologies and providing the agencies with feedback, if needed, to  correct problems with the calculations and help to ensure that agencies  meet mandated spending requirements.  Fourth, two agencies have  calculated their extramural R&D budgets for the STTR program  incorrectly. DOD officials told us that they will use the same extramural  R&D budget figure for both programs moving forward, but HHS officials  do not plan to do so.

The remaining four agencies\u2014SBA, HHS,  USDA, and DOD\u2014provided written comments, which are reproduced in  appendixes IV through VII and discussed below.", "In written comments, reproduced in appendix IV, SBA generally agreed  with the issues and recommendations included in our report. The letter  states that SBA does not believe that the policy directive inaccurately  summarizes the law and that the use of the term \u201creserve\u201d refers to the  allocation of the extramural budget. SBA officials plan to start using the  term \u201cextramural obligations\u201d instead of \u201cextramural budget\u201d to address  confusion with participating agencies, but they will review all language in  the policy directives to ensure that the funding requirements are clear.  SBA\u2019s proposed change could help address some confusion among  participating agencies, but we continue to believe that SBA should  implement our first recommendation to revise the language in the SBIR  and STTR policy directives to accurately summarize the statutory  provisions that describe the program spending requirements. Specifically,  the policy directives currently say that the relevant statutory provision  requires participating agencies to \u201creserve\u201d a minimum percentage of  their extramural budget for awards to small businesses each year,  whereas the law requires participating agencies to \u201cexpend\u201d the minimum  percentages. As reflected in USDA\u2019s agency comments (see app. VI), the  use of the term \u201creserve\u201d is a specific point of confusion for at least one of  the participating agencies.", "In written comments, reproduced in appendix V, HHS concurred with our  recommendation regarding the inclusion of all of the agency\u2019s extramural  R&D budget in the calculation of the STTR spending requirements and in  the data submitted to SBA. HHS plans to ensure that the agency\u2019s  extramural R&D budget is calculated the same way for the SBIR and  STTR programs beginning in fiscal year 2015, as funding for the  programs in fiscal year 2014 is already under way.", "In written comments, reproduced in appendix VI, USDA\u2019s Director of the  National Institute of Food and Agriculture, stated that USDA generally  agrees with our report, but the agency does not agree that it did not  comply with the spending requirements for the SBIR program. USDA\u2019s  written comments state that USDA has not always obligated the minimum  percentage of its extramural R&D budget for the SBIR program in a single  fiscal year because some of the funds used for the program are available  without fiscal year limitations, referred to as \u201cno-year money.\u201d USDA\u2019s  written comments explain that USDA did not obligate the required  amounts due to the language in the program policy directive, which  directs federal agencies to \u201creserve\u201d the minimum percentage of their  extramural R&D budgets for awards to small business concerns. This is  consistent with what officials told as during our review. We recognize that  agencies with multiyear appropriations are generally allowed to carry  funds over from one year to the next and that there are benefits to doing  so, but we continue to believe that the Small Business Act requires  participating agencies to spend at least the minimum percentage of their  extramural R&D budgets on the program each year, regardless of the  year the dollars spent were appropriated. In other words, an agency can  use a mix of funds from different fiscal years, consistent with the  limitations specific to its appropriations, to meet the spending requirement  in any given fiscal year, but it must still meet the spending requirement in  each fiscal year. Conversely, as we state in the report, if an agency  carries over funding from one year to the next without spending, or at  least obligating, the minimum required amount on the program in each  fiscal year, then the agency is not in compliance with spending  requirements. As noted above, we continue to believe that a change to  the program policy directives is needed to address this misinterpretation  of the spending requirements.", "In written comments, reproduced in appendix VII, the DOD Administrator  for the SBIR and STTR programs stated that DOD concurs with our  finding that DOD does not expend all SBIR and STTR funds appropriated  to the department in the same fiscal year that they are received, but DOD  believes that the agency is in compliance with the law in that it obligates  the minimum percentage of SBIR and STTR funds each year in  accordance with the obligation authority conferred by Congress and long- standing DOD procedures. We neither state in the report, nor do we  believe, that agencies are required to spend all of the SBIR or STTR  funds appropriated in the same year that they are received. As we state in  the report, we used the total obligations data that agencies submitted to  SBA to calculate compliance with spending requirements. These data  represent the amount obligated in a specific year, regardless of the year  the funding was appropriated. Additionally, we agree that an agency is in  compliance with program spending requirements if it obligates the  minimum percentage of program funds each year.
