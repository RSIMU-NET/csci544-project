Several of these agreements describe each country's roles, such as sharing costs for the operation and maintenance of each plant.", "Several factors can affect the plants' operations, including deteriorating infrastructure in Mexico and the United States that results in raw sewage spills around the plants. USIBWC has taken steps to resolve some of these factors. For example, USIBWC proposed a binational rapid response team to address broken pipes and failing pumps that can send sewage from Mexico into the United States; however, the team has not been formalized to ensure its long-term operation. By taking steps to formalize the team, USIBWC would have assurance it can more effectively address recurring infrastructure failures contributing to sewage spills.", "USIBWC and others have taken some actions to address stormwater problems, such as studying stormwater flows in the Tijuana River Valley watershed and building some retention basins. However, USIBWC has not taken action, in coordination with federal, state, and local partners, to identify alternatives, cost estimates, funding sources, and time frames for implementing solutions in either watershed. USIBWC officials said without direction from Congress, it does not have specific authorization for stormwater management in the watersheds because the 1944 treaty and accompanying legislation did not authorize it to carry out such projects.

Each minute is pursuant to various statutory  authorizations in the United States. In 1979, IBWC signed Minute 261,  which provides that that the two countries should take timely measures to  prevent any border sanitation problem. The minute also provides that for  each border sanitation problem, IBWC would prepare a minute that would  identify the problem, the course of action for resolution, and a specific  time schedule for implementation.", "Other minutes were executed for sanitation issues in Nogales and  Tijuana, pursuant to various statutory authorizations in the United States.  For the Nogales plant, Minute 206, signed in 1958, approved a jointly  operated and maintained wastewater plant in Arizona based on a Joint  Report by the principal engineers. Minute 227, signed in 1967, provided  for the relocation of the plant to its current location and expanded the  treatment capacity of the plant. Minute 276, signed in 1988, approved a  further increase in the capacity of the plant. For the South Bay plant,  Minute 283, signed in 1990, approved the construction of the South Bay  plant in San Ysidro, California.

The plant   was completed in 1951. An underground pipeline, referred to as the  \u201ctrunkline,\u201d was also constructed to transport the sewage under the  border from Mexico 1.5-miles to the plant for treatment. As the population  grew in both cities, the communities recognized the need for a larger  plant. At the request of the City of Nogales, Arizona, the new plant\u2014with  a treatment capacity of 8.2 million gallons per day according to USIBWC  documents\u2014was constructed 9-miles north of the border, at the  confluence of the Nogales Wash with the Santa Cruz River (see fig. 3).  Construction on the new plant began in 1970 and was completed in 1972.  In 1988, IBWC signed a minute upgrading the plant, adding additional  treatment capacity for Mexican wastewater. Then to comply with more  stringent federal and state regulations, the plant was upgraded in 1992  and 2009. At present, USIBWC manages the plant, which has treatment  capacity for up to 17.2 million gallons of wastewater from Mexico and the  United States per day according to USIBWC documents.", "Wastewater treatment plants collect sewage  from residences and businesses and treat it to  remove pollutants such as sediment, bacteria,  and other materials. There are three types of  treatment at wastewater treatment plants in  the United States. States are required to meet  standards for two of them.   Primary treatment involves physical  processes such as screening and  sedimentation to remove a portion of  pollutants that settle or float.  Secondary treatment augments physical  treatment with biological processes to remove  organic matter. The treatment involves the  use of bacteria to consume waste material.  Secondary treatment, combined with  disinfecting chemicals, such as chlorine, can  reduce about 85 percent of pollutants.  Tertiary treatment involves specialized or  advanced treatment that is specific to the  pollutant. For example, some treatment plants  try to reduce nutrients such as nitrogen and  phosphorus. Tertiary treatment can include  additional filtration, reverse osmosis, or  additional chemical or biological processes.", "The South Bay plant provides secondary treatment for wastewater  generated in Tijuana, Mexico. USIBWC operates the plant. In the  decades, before the plant was built in 1997, untreated sewage reached  the Tijuana River, which flows north from Mexico to San Diego,  California. The river transported raw sewage to the Pacific coast at  Imperial Beach, California, creating a nuisance and public health risk in  the United States. To address the problem, IBWC signed Minute 283 in  1990, which provided the framework for a project to treat wastewater from  Tijuana, Mexico, at a plant located in the United States. Construction  began in 1994. In 1997, the South Bay plant opened with discharge  through an emergency connection to the City of San Diego\u2019s wastewater  treatment facility. The South Bay plant became fully operational in 1999,  providing advanced primary treatment for 25 million gallons of sewage  coming from Mexico daily and discharging treated wastewater 3-miles  offshore in the Pacific Ocean through the South Bay Ocean Outfall, which  is a 3.5-mile-long pipe, according to USIBWC documents.", "The plant was upgraded with secondary treatment facilities in 2010. It is  designed to treat up to 25 million gallons per day of Tijuana\u2019s sewage,  with the ability to treat up to 50 million gallons per day for a short period of  time, according to USIBWC officials. The City of Tijuana also operates  five wastewater treatment plants in Mexico to treat its remaining sewage,  though these plants are not always fully operational. The South Bay  plant\u2019s facilities include five canyon collectors located along the border in  five of the six cross-border canyons. During normal operations, smaller  amounts or \u201clow-flows\u201d of urban runoff and wastewater from Mexico are  diverted by these canyon collectors and conveyed to the plant through  underground pipelines (see fig. 5)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IBWC Minutes Describe Roles, Responsibilities, Costs, and Cost-Sharing Agreements for Operating and Maintaining the Plant", "paragraphs": ["IBWC minutes, with the approval of the U.S. and Mexican governments,  establish each country\u2019s roles and responsibilities, outline the costs of the  Nogales and South Bay plants, and describe the cost-sharing  arrangements between the United States and Mexico for operating and  maintaining the plants.

See appendix II for details of the IBWC  minutes that authorize the construction, management, and operation of  the two plants.", "For the original Nogales plant, the U.S. government authorized the  funding in the Department of State, Justice, Commerce, and the Judiciary  Appropriation Act for 1947 and provided funding with certain conditions,  including that the City of Nogales agreed to furnish the lands or  easements free of cost and that the city operate and maintain the project  once it was completed.", "Under Minute 227, signed in 1967, Mexico agreed to participate in  funding the expansion of the capacity of facilities at the Nogales plant.  This Minute also authorized the relocation of the plant; however, the  Minute provided that Mexico\u2019s share of the construction costs of enlarging  the international sewage treatment facilities would not change if the  United States for domestic reasons constructed the enlarged treatment  plant north of its existing site. Mexico conditioned its approval of the  relocation on the agreement that Mexico not bear any costs associated  with the extension of the IOI pipeline necessary for the relocation,  according to USIBWC officials. Further, under Minute 227, the United  States, Mexico, and the City of Nogales, Arizona, shared the construction  costs of the treatment plant. During the relocation of the plant and  resulting extension of the IOI, the City of Nogales acquired all easements  in land or the land necessary for the relocation and contributed $791,000  for the expanded plant and IOI, according to USIBWC officials. Mexico\u2019s  share was based on the costs of enlarging the treatment plant at the site  used for the initial 1951 plant. Since the City of Nogales, Arizona, wanted  the plant to be located away from the city limits, the additional IOI costs  were not borne by Mexico.", "The second plant was upgraded in 1988, 1992, and 2009. In 1988,  Mexico provided $1 million to pay for the additional capacity built at the  plant, as the total capacity allotted to Mexico after the upgrade was 9.9  million gallons per day, and the City of Nogales, Arizona, was allotted a  total capacity of 4.84 million gallons per day. The United States and the  City of Nogales, Arizona, shared the costs for the 2009 upgrade to the  facility. During the 2009 upgrade, EPA provided a $65 million grant to the  City of Nogales, Arizona; the City of Nogales, Arizona, contributed  $700,000; and USIBWC provided an additional $2 million for the  construction of an ultraviolet disinfection system according to USIBWC  documents.", "For the South Bay plant, the United States and Mexico agreed to  construct the plant under Minute 283 and to share the costs for  construction, operation, and maintenance for the plant under Minute 296.  Congress authorized USIBWC\u2019s participation in 1987 amendments to the  Clean Water Act. The construction cost for the plant was $241.1 million.  The United States contributed $224.6 million\u2014specifically, EPA provided  $127.4 million to USIBWC for costs associated with the construction of  the plant and related infrastructure, $89.2 million to the City of San Diego  and the Corps to construct the South Bay Ocean Outfall, and $8 million to  the Corps for additional environmental work. Mexico contributed $16.8  million, which was the amount that it would have had to pay to construct  and maintain a plant in Mexico. As part of Minute 283, IBWC also built a  diversion infrastructure just south of the border to capture low-volume,  dry-weather flows in the Tijuana River to prevent northbound  transboundary flows into the United States. This diversion system is  operated by Mexican entities and includes pumps and pipelines that send  wastewater to the South Bay plant.", "Minutes also specify cost-sharing arrangements for the ongoing operation  and maintenance of the plants. Under the cost-sharing agreements in  relevant minutes, the Mexican government generally reimburses USIBWC  annually for a portion of the treatment costs at each plant. The  reimbursement rate is annually adjusted based on what it would cost to  treat a similar amount of wastewater in Mexico according to USIBWC  officials. In addition, USIBWC has a separate agreement with the City of  Nogales, Arizona, for the Nogales plant that stipulates reimbursements  for their sewage treatment. These minutes and cost-sharing  arrangements are as follows:", "Cost-Sharing Agreements for the Nogales plant. Under Minute  206, Mexico agreed to pay for some operations and maintenance  costs, based on its proportion of wastewater flows to the Nogales  plant for treatment, at a discounted rate for a predetermined amount  of sewage. IBWC commissioners periodically review this discounted  rate. Specifically, USIBWC assesses the percentage of sewage (up to  9.9 million gallons per day) Mexico sends to the Nogales plant and  adjusts the rate to what it would cost to perform the same service in  Mexico, according to USIBWC officials. Furthermore, the Mexican  government has agreed to pay full U.S. cost for any flow above the  treaty-allotted 9.9 million gallons per day, according to these officials.  Meters located at three sites along the U.S-Mexico border  continuously measure the sewage flow, and if the amount of sewage  treated by the plant exceeds the 9.9 million gallons per day, Mexico is  billed by USIBWC for the full cost of sewage treatment, according to  USIBWC officials. Separately, USIBWC charges a rate for treatment  of the city\u2019s sewage under a Memorandum of Agreement with the City  of Nogales, Arizona.", "Cost-Sharing Agreements for the South Bay plant. Under Minute  296, Mexico agreed to pay for operations and maintenance costs for  the plant based on the treatment of up to 25 million gallons per day.  The pump that diverts Tijuana\u2019s wastewater into the South Bay plant  can pump as much as 29 million gallons per day, and the plant can  treat more than 25 million gallons per day if needed. Similar to the  Nogales plant, USIBWC, on a quarterly basis, bills the Mexican  government a prorated amount for the treatment services based on  the amount of flow. For example, in fiscal year 2018 Mexico paid  USIBWC about $2.4 million for treatment of its wastewater.", "In fiscal year 2018, the plants\u2019 operational and maintenance costs totaled  $4.5 million for the Nogales plant and $15 million for the South Bay plant,  and in that fiscal year, the Mexican government reimbursed USIBWC  $4.4 million for both plants, according to USIBWC documents. In addition,  according to USIBWC officials, the City of Nogales, Arizona is behind in  its payments for the Nogales plant by $3 million, and Mexico owes $3  million, according to officials. USIBWC initially pays for the operations and  maintenance costs at all its facilities, including the two wastewater  treatment plants, and then seeks reimbursement from Mexico and the  City of Nogales, Arizona, for their portions of the operation and  maintenance costs. The operation and maintenance costs for each plant  include the plant\u2019s employees, such as water operators and skilled  technical employees, who manage nonstop operations such as running  the equipment, controlling the processes, and monitoring the facilities.  The Nogales plant employed 17 people as of 2019. USIBWC has used a  third-party contractor (Veolia Water Operating Services) to conduct  operational and maintenance activities at the South Bay plant since 1998,  according to officials. USIBWC Salaries and Expenses budget line item  includes funding for each plant\u2019s operation and maintenance.", "According to federal officials in the United States and Mexico, the  operations and maintenance of wastewater infrastructure in Mexico is an  ongoing challenge. According to these officials, Mexican wastewater  utilities do not have the resources or the long-term technical expertise to  address equipment maintenance problems in a timely manner to prevent  spills. Although NADB has provided financing to wastewater infrastructure  utilities that send wastewater to USIBWC\u2019s Nogales and South Bay  plants, utilities often the lack the resources necessary to adequately  maintain the infrastructure and equipment after the construction loan  ends, according to NADB officials. NADB could condition financing for  every wastewater infrastructure project on capacity to adequately manage  operations and maintenance of the infrastructure, as it has for a few  projects, according to USIBWC and EPA officials. In the United States, as  we reported in January 2016 the U.S. Department of Agriculture includes  as one of its loan conditions the capacity of the wastewater utility to pay  for operations and maintenance of infrastructure.", "USIBWC has identified numerous projects related to operating the plants  or building new infrastructure that remain unfunded under the agency\u2019s  current appropriations level, according to an agency document.

To address  the inadequate wastewater infrastructure in Nogales, Sonora, IBWC  has collaborated with other stakeholders to maintain wastewater  treatment capacity in Mexico. For example, the U.S. State Department  sent a diplomatic note to the Mexican government in February 2019  regarding the failing pumps and asked the Mexican government to  quickly respond and eliminate the discharges that end up at the  Nogales plant. USIBWC officials stated that the Mexican Section of  the IBWC purchased two new pumps, which were expected to arrive  at the pump station in Nogales, Sonora, in late 2019.

The cured-in-place pipe process will address some of the  IOI\u2019s deferred maintenance issues but will not resolve ongoing  disagreements about which entity is responsible for funding annual  maintenance and operations. According to USIBWC officials, the  annual maintenance needs include more than the work to repair the  IOI. For example, lateral pipelines that connect City of Nogales  sewers to the IOI also need to be maintained; occasional breaches in  the pipeline need to be repaired; and vegetation management along  the pipeline is necessary to prevent root intrusion into the pipeline.  USIBWC officials estimated the annual cost for operations and  maintenance, including infrastructure repair and personnel costs, at  about $1.5 million to $2 million.", "IBWC and others have also taken actions to address the pump failures  and pipeline breaks in Tijuana that send polluted flows downstream,  affecting the Tijuana Basin diversion infrastructure and subsequently the  South Bay plant. These actions include the following:", "Negotiating a Binational Tijuana River Spill Notification Protocol.", "In August 2017, IBWC negotiated a notification protocol for raw  sewage discharges into the Tijuana River that may enter the United  States. The protocol was prompted by the February 2017 spill from a  broken pipeline in Mexico of 143 million gallons of sewage- contaminated water that flowed into the Tijuana River. The initial  protocol stated that a formal memorandum of understanding would be  developed at a later date to formalize the protocol; however, the initial  protocol remains in place. According to an USIBWC official, Mexico  has since adhered to the protocol twice by warning USIBWC of  imminent raw sewage flows when pipelines in Tijuana, Mexico,  ruptured. However, in August 2019, USIBWC reported that most of  the transboundary flows were detected by an automated alert system  on the U.S. side of the border that was deployed by USIBWC in  October 2018 to better monitor and detect any transboundary flows.  The system relies on river gage data recorded at the Tijuana River  that is also posted to the USIBWC website.", "Upgrading infrastructure in Mexico. In April 2018, the Department  of State sent a diplomatic note to the Mexican government after  failures in Tijuana\u2019s sanitation infrastructure led to sewage flows on  multiple days in 2017 and 2018. The diplomatic note requested that  the Mexican government take appropriate measures (as outlined in  Minute 283) to stop sewage flows from crossing into the United  States, including making short-term repairs and longer-term upgrades.  According to USIBWC officials, Mexico does not have much funding  for its infrastructure. However, in March 2019, Mexico and EPA,  through NADB, funded the replacement of three segments of the  Poniente Collector in Tijuana, Mexico, to eliminate a key source of  untreated discharges into the Tijuana River in the United States.", "Participating in the Tijuana River Diversion Study. In 2019, NADB  funded the study of alternatives to expand or adapt the diversion  infrastructure in the Tijuana River to identify potential infrastructure  projects (and associated costs) to divert dry-weather flows and  possibly some flows that result from wet weather mixed with  wastewater and raw sewage. The study developed project  alternatives in Mexico, the United States, or both countries that would  reduce the number of days that transboundary flows occur, including  by diverting more wastewater through the South Bay plant to prevent  its release in the United States. The alternatives range in cost from $8  million to $236 million.

However, this agreement is informal, and  IBWC has not taken the necessary steps to formalize the team. Such  steps could include preparing a minute. Specifically, Minute 261 states  that for each border sanitation problem, IBWC is to prepare a minute  identifying: (1) the problem; (2) the conditions which require solution; (3)  specify quality standards that should be applied; (4) the course of action  that should be followed for its solution; and (5) the specific time schedule  for its implementation. According to IBWC officials, the benefit of a  minute is that it functions as a formal agreement between the respective  governments, encouraging them to provide greater support through  funding and other resources to ensure the solutions and projects are  implemented.", "According to USIBWC officials, they also have alternatives to negotiating  a minute, such as issuing a joint report, and a minute may not be  necessary for the countries to formalize their commitment.

Stormwater from the upper watershed flows into  the wash and crosses the border, carrying bacteria and sediment into the  United States. According to IBWC officials, because Nogales, Sonora,  does not have adequate stormwater sewers, Mexican citizens remove  manhole covers to allow stormwater to drain from the streets into the  sanitary sewers during heavy rainstorms. The IOI essentially becomes a  combined sewage system\u2014one in which wastewater and stormwater flow  in the same pipelines\u2014even though it was not designed as such,  according to USIBWC officials. The excess stormwater causes increased  pressure in the IOI that is released when the manholes in the United  States overflow, sending sewage into the streets of Nogales, Arizona. In  July 2018, ADEQ documentation noted that Nogales, Sonora,  experiences frequent flooding during heavy rain events in the summer  and uses the IOI to mitigate flood events, which results in releases of  untreated sewage into the residential and business neighborhoods in the  City of Nogales, Arizona and the Santa Cruz River watershed. For  example, in 2017, Santa Cruz County Health Services and the Arizona  Department of Health Services released public health advisories for  elevated E. coli for the City of Nogales, Arizona, due to untreated sewage  leaking from the IOI. According to one of these advisories, stormflows are  typically high in pollutants that can be harmful to human health such as  bacteria and pathogens.", "Unmanaged stormwater flowing into the Nogales Wash can destabilize  the IOI, which runs inside or below the wash, from the border to the  Nogales plant. Stormwater rushing down the wash erodes and removes  natural and manmade materials covering the pipeline, such as the  cement panels lining the middle portion of the wash (see fig. 7). For  example, in July 2017, flooding in the Nogales Wash eroded the soil  around a manhole in the IOI, partially shearing the pipe and causing  untreated wastewater to flood into the wash and into the streets of  Nogales, Arizona, resulting in elevated levels of E. coli in the wash and  Santa Cruz River. As a result, the Arizona Governor\u2019s Office declared a  State of Emergency in Santa Cruz County and sent a notice of the  Nogales plant\u2019s permit violation to USIBWC.", "To date, USIBWC\u2019s actions have focused on emergency repairs and  cleanup when untreated sewage has leaked from the IOI into the Nogales  Wash and Santa Cruz River. During the July 2017 event, for example, to  prevent further contamination of the wash due to the release of raw  sewage leaking from the broken section of the IOI, USIBWC hired a  contractor to install a bypass system to divert the raw sewage spilling into  the wash to the Nogales plant for treatment. Other stakeholders also took  action. For example, at the request of the Arizona governor\u2019s office, the  Corps stabilized earthen banks along the Nogales Wash that had eroded.  The Arizona Army National Guard and Arizona Department of  Transportation also took part in similar efforts.  In general, the Nogales Wash is not regularly maintained to stabilize the  earthen banks and concrete panels to prevent erosion. According to  USIBWC officials, operations and maintenance of the Nogales Wash and  management of stormwater in the Nogales Wash is a municipal  responsibility and not the responsibility of the IBWC. As a result, USIBWC  has not taken action to manage the Wash to prevent stormwater damage  to the IOI. Instead, it has\u2014as with the example above\u2014sought to bring in  other federal agencies that USIBWC says have authority over domestic  water management.

For  example, USIBWC contracted the Corps to conduct an evaluation to  develop measures to reduce the threat of flooding and alternatives to  reduce potential flood damage in Nogales, Sonora. The study was  completed in 2004. Based on the recommendations in the evaluation,  Nogales, Sonora, and the Mexican federal water agency, constructed 14  dams and detention basins from 2008 through 2015. However, according  to USIBWC officials, the basins that are in Mexico and maintained by the  local utility are full of sediment and have not been cleared because the  local Mexican utility does not have funds to maintain them. In addition,  USIBWC and the U.S. Geological Survey have collaborated on joint  studies of the watershed surrounding Nogales, Sonora, for many years  according to USIBWC officials.

We emphasized that agencies should evaluate a full  range of alternatives to bridge any performance gap and recommended  that Congress require agencies to develop long-term capital plans and  submit them for review. Furthermore, in January 2016, we reported that  asset management planning for water utilities includes key components  such as assessing the current state of their assets (for example pipelines  and treatment plants), incorporating life-cycle costs, and developing a  strategy for the long-term funding of the repair and replacement of their  assets.", "In our review of documents and interviews with USIBWC officials, we  found that the agency incorporates aspects of the key planning principles  in its capital planning and budgeting but has not fully incorporated the  principles. For example, the agency has a strategic plan that identifies its  goals, including a goal to improve the quality of water along the border.  We have stated, along with OMB, the importance of linking capital asset  investments to an organization\u2019s overall mission and long-term strategic  goals. However, in its capital planning and budget process, USIBWC  does not fully assess or identify future needs, as called for in OMB\u2019s key  capital planning principles. Those principles state that a needs  assessment identifies the resources needed to fulfill both immediate  requirements and anticipated future needs, based on the agency\u2019s goals  and objectives.", "According to USIBWC officials, the agency conducts and funds capital  planning on a project-by-project basis because it uses year-end money to  fund studies or evaluations to identify project needs or alternatives.  Specifically, USIBWC engineers identify the need for a project, and the  agency identifies year-end appropriations to pay for a study of that  project. For example, in one case described by a USIBWC official, the  agency contracted with the Corps of Engineers to conduct a study of  USIBWC flood control levees and their condition. The agency used year- end funds in its Salaries and Expenses budget line item to pay for the  study, and USIBWC officials stated that the study has since been the  basis for its request for levee repair and replacement projects.", "In addition, we found that USIBWC conducts alternative evaluations of  potential projects, as directed by OMB\u2019s guidance that states an  evaluation should be conducted of a wide range of alternative approaches  to determine how to bridge performance gaps in capital infrastructure.  According to USIBWC officials, the agency is considering a range of  alternatives and plans to conduct an analysis of costs associated with the  projects, as leading practices for benefit-cost analysis and alternative  comparison suggest. For example, the contractor for the 2019 study of  alternatives to expand or adapt the diversion infrastructure for the South  Bay project has assessed alternatives and costs to reduce the number of  days that transboundary flows cross the border bringing bacteria, trash,  and sediment into the United States. However, this was done for one part  of the water quality problems created by transboundary flows and will not  solve the problems associated with water quality problems created by all  stormwater flows.

Instead USIBWC has  elements of a plan, such as asset management documents for each of its  two wastewater plants that identify key equipment replacement costs and  schedules. The Nogales plant manager provides USIBWC officials with  10-year cost projections for major equipment, which include information  on cyclic maintenance and life-cycle replacements. The operator of the South Bay plant prepares a 5-year plan that assesses the condition of  equipment and recommends repair and replacement. However, neither  plan identifies gaps in infrastructure needed to resolve water quality  problems that are separate from the plants and their normal operation,  such as stormwater problems that destabilize the Nogales plant\u2019s IOI  pipeline and cause polluted water to be diverted around the South Bay  plant. USIBWC states it has no responsibility to do so. As noted above,  USIBWC\u2019s role in addressing certain transboundary stormwater flows and  associated water quality problems is in dispute in ongoing litigation  involving the Santa Cruz and Tijuana River Valley basins.", "Under OMB\u2019s capital planning principles, conducting long-term capital  planning should enable USIBWC to more systematically assess its long- term needs, including its future needs and identify alternative approaches  and costs to address stormwater problems in the watersheds.  Furthermore, a long-term capital plan should identify the capital projects  that USIBWC needs to achieve the strategic goal it seeks to  accomplish\u2014in this case, improvement of water quality along the border.  In February 2007, we reported that a long-term capital plan can include  elements such as (1) a baseline assessment and identification of  performance gaps; (2) justification of spending on proposed new assets;  (3) the basis for selecting proposed assets; and (4) cost schedules and  performance goals. In addition, OMB\u2019s capital planning guidance states  that each capital asset should have an operations and maintenance plan  that outlines the procedures and responsibilities for scheduled preventive  and regular or routine corrective maintenance. Currently, USIBWC has  not comprehensively developed this information into a long-term capital  plan. A long-term capital plan would help USIBWC budget for capital  projects and investments in the watersheds and provide justification for  funds requested for capital investment in future water quality projects.", "OMB Circular A-11 also encourages agencies to use a summary of the  capital plan for budget justification to OMB, congressional authorizations  of projects, and justification for congressional appropriations. In  November 2019, OMB issued a memorandum to federal agencies that  reinforced the need to implement the capital programming guidance in  OMB Circular A-11 that agencies develop, document, and implement a  capital planning process. In its budget process, USIBWC requests  funding for individual capital projects for the budget year in which the  projects are needed. Specifically, for each annual budget cycle,  USIBWC\u2019s Principal Engineers provide information to agency budget  officials on the projects they have identified and funds needed for each  plant. USIBWC budget officials use this information to prepare budget  requests that are then reviewed by the State Department and OMB, and,  ultimately, Congress. According to USIBWC\u2019s Administrative Officer, the  agency previously provided capital needs in an attachment to the budget  requested in OMB Circular A-11.

However, when OMB no longer collected agencies\u2019 information, USIBWC  stopped providing the information in its budget. According to  Department of State budget examiners, USIBWC notifies them of  potential infrastructure projects and funding needs; however, this  information is not included in the agency\u2019s budget request and is  therefore not available to identify funding needs.

(Recommendation 2)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to USIBWC, EPA, and the Departments  of State and Homeland Security for comment. USIBWC provided written  comments, which are reproduced in appendix V. The other three  agencies did not provide written comments on our draft report; however,  they provided technical comments that we incorporated as appropriate.", "In its written comments, USIBWC concurred with our first  recommendation that it work to formalize a binational rapid response  team to address sewage infrastructure failures along the U.S.-Mexico  border. The agency noted that it has held extensive consultations with the  Mexican Section of the IBWC, and once there is agreement on the  designated responsibilities and funding of the team, USIBWC will seek to  formalize the arrangement through a written agreement or exchange of  letters between the U.S. and Mexican Sections, approaches we outlined  in the report. USIBWC also noted that the United States and Mexico have  not agreed upon each country\u2019s share of expenses and that the U.S.  financial contribution is subject to legislative approval and contributions,  including in-kind contributions, from domestic nonfederal entities.", "USIBWC partly concurred with our second recommendation that the U.S.  Commissioner of the IBWC direct staff to conduct long-term capital  planning for the Santa Cruz River Basin and Tijuana River Valley  watersheds. The agency noted that it provided us the long-term capital  planning information previously required by the Office of Management  and Budget and that the practice had been useful. However, the agency  also noted that to the extent our report envisions USIBWC undertaking  long-term capital planning for (1) nonfederal infrastructure; (2)  infrastructure that does not yet exist; and/or (3) infrastructure that the  USIBWC is not yet authorized to construct or maintain, it does not concur.  USIBWC stated that Congress may not view it as the lead agency, and  therefore Congress does not need to provide it with the authorization to  oversee cross-border pollution matters. Regardless of whether Congress  considers USIBWC as the lead agency in resolving transboundary water  quality, the agency is a key player in managing water quality on the  border and has the infrastructure and organization that will be part of the  solution. To date, the agency has been more reactive than proactive in  participating in planning efforts and studies to resolve water quality  problems and has told us that it does not have the authority to do so. Yet,  without the information that USIBWC would generate by comprehensively  assessing its long-term needs, such as through long-term capital planning  efforts, Congress cannot authorize specific work that needs to be done.  We recommended that the agency conduct long-term planning, including  for infrastructure that does not exist and for infrastructure that is not yet  authorized specifically to address this problem. We continue to believe  that USIBWC should recognize its role along the border and, as we  recommended, start planning for it, including by undertaking long-term  capital planning for existing and potential future infrastructure and  identifying alternatives to address the long-standing water quality  problems.", "The agency also commented on our two Matters for Congressional  Consideration in which we said that Congress should consider providing  direction and specific authorization for USIBWC to take action to resolve  long-standing water quality problems associated with transboundary  stormwater flows in the watersheds. In its comments, USIBWC stated that  it partly concurred with the Matters. USIBWC also stated that the phrasing  of the Matters suggests that Congress should assign USIBWC specific  duties and responsibilities, including identifying time frames for a  comprehensive solution of pollution problems associated with  transboundary stormwater flows and binational watershed management.  This is correct. In our report, we highlighted the role USIBWC plays along  the border and the infrastructure USIBWC manages and operates to  address transboundary flows from Mexico. Given the location of the  USIBWC\u2019s wastewater treatment plants, along with its expertise and role  working with Mexico, the agency would need to be centrally involved in  any transboundary solution.", "However, it is incorrect, as USIBWC\u2019s letter further stated, that our  Matters imply that USIBWC would have the lead role in resolving water  quality problems along the border. USIBWC\u2019s letter stated that while the  Matters acknowledge that USIBWC might coordinate with a wide range of  partners, the language implies that Congress would designate USIBWC  as the lead agency. Further, the agency stated that such a designation  may run counter to past and current congressional intent and reasoning,  as evidenced in very recent developments. In our matters, we stated that  Congress should authorize USIBWC to take action to resolve water  quality problems because it is a central actor in managing water and  water quality along the border and because, during the course of our  review, USIBWC stated that it needed specific congressional  authorization to manage stormwater problems and to construct and  maintain new infrastructure. We included the need for USIBWC to  coordinate its action with other agencies because USIBWC would not be  the sole lead actor. We note that USIBWC did not state what its role  would be.", "Moreover, USIBWC stated that Congress may be in the process of  designating EPA as the lead agency in developing major new  infrastructure in the Tijuana Valley watershed to mitigate problems  resulting from transboundary flows from Mexico. USIBWC also cited a  recent bill to show that Congress is considering, consistent with proposals  from California stakeholders, an appropriation request for as much as  $300 million for the EPA to build this infrastructure. The agency stated  that the bill lists USIBWC as one of 11 eligible public entities with which  EPA may coordinate its efforts, as opposed to identifying the USIBWC as  the lead agency. It also stated that the United States-Mexico-Canada  Agreement Implementation Act accompanying this bill explains that EPA\u2019s  designation as the lead agency was premised on Congress\u2019s  determination that EPA has the expertise and experience necessary to  lead and coordinate efforts involving wastewater, stormwater, nonpoint  sources of pollution, and related matters in the Tijuana watershed. At a  minimum, USIBWC will be a key partner with EPA if it is given the  authority to help resolve stormwater quality problems in the Tijuana River  watershed. Yet, as discussed in our report, USIBWC stated it needs  congressional authorization to participate in addressing stormwater  issues along the border. We note that the bill to which USIBWC refers  does not specifically address USIBWC\u2019s authority to develop and  implement stormwater projects near the border. Our report shows that  this authorization is necessary for the agency to take action, whether as a  lead agency or as an eligible partner that may coordinate with others. We  added a discussion of the bill in our report, as well as about the expertise  that EPA and USIBWC have to address transboundary flow problems.  Specifically, we described that according to EPA officials, EPA lacks the  expertise to construct and maintain water infrastructure projects on its  own. Further, EPA officials stated that EPA will need to carry out any  work in the area through contracts with other agencies, as EPA does not  have expertise in operating and maintaining water infrastructure, as  USIBWC does. EPA also noted that USIBWC is one of the only federal  agencies that works across the border because it has consistent  communication and contacts in Mexico.", "Finally, USIBWC stated in its comments that the reasoning for  designating EPA in the bill and the accompanying act as the lead agency  for pollution reduction for the Tijuana River watershed\u2014because of EPA\u2019s  unique qualifications\u2014also applies in any border area, including the  Santa Cruz watershed in Arizona. Again, our report showed that USIBWC  is a central actor in managing water and water quality on the border and  that congressional authorization is needed for USIBWC to help address  transboundary stormwater flows, including identifying alternatives for  solutions, in the Santa Cruz watershed. We did not change our Matters,  but added a discussion in our report of the proposed congressional  legislation to address the water quality problems in Tijuana specifically  and the expertise that EPA and USIBWC each bring to addressing  transboundary flow problems.", "We are sending copies of this report to appropriate congressional  committees; the Commissioner of the U.S. Section of the International  Boundary and Water Commission; the Secretaries of Homeland Security  and State; the Administrator of the EPA; and other interested parties.

At each facility, we interviewed USIBWC officials and toured  each wastewater treatment plant and its associated infrastructure. We  also met with other federal, state, and local government officials and  representatives of non-governmental organizations to discuss USIBWC\u2019s  management and operations of the plant.

For cost-sharing of operational and maintenance expenses at  the plants, we reviewed minutes between USIBWC and the Mexican  Section and a memorandum of agreement between USIBWC and the City  of Nogales, Arizona. We reviewed USIBWC\u2019s budget for fiscal years 2003  through 2019, including appropriated funding information for fiscal years  2003 through 2019. We also met with budget officials at USIBWC and the  Department of State. To determine if these data are reliable, we  interviewed a USIBWC official about the source of the data and reviewed  documentation to determine that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of discussing USIBWC budget and project costs.", "To examine factors, if any, that affect the operation of the two plants and  steps IBWC has taken to address these factors, we reviewed each plant\u2019s  permit from the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, violation  notices, and USIBWC documentation, such as plans for projects to  resolve the violations. We interviewed USIBWC officials about their plans  and projects to resolve any water quality problems at the plants. We also  interviewed Arizona and California state environmental officials  responsible for developing and enforcing the permits, to discuss permit  violations and water quality problems at the plants and actions to resolve  them.", "To examine the extent to which USIBWC has taken steps to address  water quality problems in the two watersheds, including using key capital  planning principles, we reviewed and analyzed IBWC minutes, USIBWC\u2019s  annual financial reports for fiscal years 2015 through 2019, USIBWC\u2019s  most recent strategic plan covering fiscal years 2011 through 2016, the  South Bay plant\u2019s 5-year and Nogales plant\u2019s 10-year equipment  investment plans, and documentation from USIBWC\u2019s citizen forums in  each location.

Numerous metal treatment and  plating facilities operate in Nogales, Sonora, Mexico. These facilities  directly discharge their wastewater, which contains heavy metals such  as chromium, zinc, and nickel, into the city\u2019s sewer system. The heavy  metals are comingled with the other sewage and sent to the Nogales  plant (in Arizona) for treatment. In the United States, similar types of  facilities would be required to pretreat the wastewater to remove  metals and other pollutants before discharging it into the public sewer  system. In the United States, the mechanism used to limit industrial  discharges into a sewer system is a pretreatment program that can  ultimately cause dischargers to be shut off from the system or fined if  they do not limit the industrial contaminants in their discharges to the  system. While a municipal pretreatment program exists in Nogales,  Sonora, it is designed to meet Mexico\u2019s minimum federal  requirements and is insufficient to detect and respond to the dumping  of industrial contaminants when they occur, according to the Arizona  Department of Environmental Quality documentation and officials.  According to U.S. Section of the International Boundary and Water  Commission (USIBWC) officials, the Nogales plant is not designed to  separate out heavy metals during its treatment processes, and as a  result the heavy metals contaminate the plant\u2019s sludge. Furthermore,  due to the presence of heavy metals, USIBWC disposes of the sludge  at a municipal landfill, a process that is more expensive than other  disposal options, which has led to increased operational costs for the  plant. According to USIBWC officials, it would cost about $60 million  to update the Nogales plant to a tertiary treatment system that could  remove the heavy metals from the sludge.", "Deteriorating sewage infrastructure in Mexico. Sewage  infrastructure in the City of Nogales, Sonora, is not adequately  maintained, according to USIBWC officials. As a result, USIBWC  officials told us that the amount of wastewater Nogales, Sonora,  sends exceeds the amount agreed upon in a minute between the two  sections. Although Nogales, Sonora, built a new plant\u2014the Los Alisos  Plant\u2014that can treat 5.5 million gallons per day, wastewater has to be  pumped uphill from Nogales, Sonora, into the plant. After the first year  of operation, the Mexican government could not maintain the plant  due to funding constraints, according to USIBWC officials. The pumps  responsible for delivering the wastewater uphill to the Los Alisos plant  continually break or fail. For example, as of July 2019, only one of the  five pumps at the Los Alisos plant was operational, according to  USIBWC officials. When these pumps fail, Mexico releases the 2  million to 4 million gallons per day of wastewater\u2014which normally  would have been intercepted and sent to the Los Alisos plant\u2014 through the International Outfall Interceptor (IOI) to the Nogales plant.", "Deteriorating infrastructure in the United States. The deteriorating  condition of the IOI has caused untreated sewage to periodically spill  into the Santa Cruz watershed and Nogales Wash. The IOI is over 45  years old, and according to USIBWC officials, the typical lifespan of a  similar pipeline is 50 years. Maintenance has been deferred because  of continuing disagreement between USIBWC and the City of  Nogales, Arizona, regarding which entity owns the pipeline and is  therefore responsible for its maintenance, according to USIBWC  officials. The IOI\u2019s condition continues to worsen and requires a  significant amount of rehabilitation to address structural damage.  Erosion and corrosion are continuously occurring, according to a 2005  assessment of the IOI prepared for the City of Nogales, Arizona.  Specifically, gases released by the sewage corrode the pipeline, and  root intrusion and groundwater cause erosion. According to the 2005  assessment, half of the thickness of the pipe had been eroded and  corroded  For the South Bay plant, the factor that may affect the operations is:  Insufficient sewage infrastructure in Mexico. According to the  2019 study of alternatives to expand or adapt diversion infrastructure,  Tijuana has not built sufficient sewage infrastructure to serve the  area\u2019s increasing population and urbanization, contributing to  transboundary sewage flows. According to USIBWC officials, the city  of Tijuana does not prioritize wastewater issues and is experiencing  exponential population growth and urbanization. As a result, areas of  Tijuana are not connected to the city\u2019s sewer system. A 2017 study  prepared by a Mexican state agency estimated that over $340 million  would be required to fix and develop adequate wastewater treatment  and reuse systems for the city of Tijuana. When there are problems  with Tijuana\u2019s treatment facilities, Tijuana diverts a portion of its  wastewater to be treated at the South Bay plant. If the South Bay  plant is not notified and does not shut down the pump and canyon  collectors, it may receive additional flows. While treating the excess  wastewater does not violate the plant\u2019s National Pollutant Discharge  Elimination System permit, the plant is experiencing an increase in the  number of days that it treats flows above capacity, according to  USIBWC officials. This could eventually cause violations to occur as  the plant is not supposed to operate above capacity for prolonged  periods.", "In addition, USIBWC officials stated that the South Bay plant is not  designed and operated to address some of the wastewater that flows into  the Tijuana River Valley watershed. These wastewater flows are due to:", "Limited Tijuana Basin diversion infrastructure. The Tijuana Basin  diversion system is comprised of Mexican-operated Pump Station  CILA and the South Bay plant\u2019s five canyon collectors. This system  captures dry-weather flows for treatment at the South Bay plant or a  wastewater treatment plant in Mexico. However, it is not designed to  capture high flows that result from pipe breaks or pump failures.  Specifically, the system has a peak capacity of 29 million gallons per  day, while Pump Station CILA can only operate at 23 million gallons  per day. To avoid affecting the South Bay plant\u2019s wastewater  treatment operations, during incidents of high flows, Pump Station  CILA and the canyon collectors are shut off. During these events, the  water bypasses the South Bay wastewater treatment plant and flows  untreated into the Tijuana River and watershed. The Senate  committee report accompanying the Department of State, Foreign  Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2019 required  the USIBWC to submit a report quantifying the total annual volume of  transboundary flows entering the United States from Mexico in the  Tijuana River watershed. USIBWC issued this report in August  2019.", "Lack of maintenance for existing sewage infrastructure in  Mexico. A lack of maintenance for Tijuana\u2019s existing sewage  infrastructure causes excess wastewater flows into the Tijuana River  according to USIBWC officials. For example, in August 2019,  USIBWC reported that on June 19, 2019, nearly 1.9 million gallons of  wastewater were released into the Tijuana River because trash  buildup at one of Tijuana\u2019s pumps caused the pump to fail. In the  last 2 decades, according to a 2019 study, the local Mexican utility  that operates and manages the city\u2019s sewage infrastructure has  invested in expanding the city\u2019s wastewater collection infrastructure to  address direct dischargers or inadequate disposal practices,  according to USIBWC officials. However, the overall system has not  kept pace with the region\u2019s rapid growth, nor has the existing  infrastructure in Mexico received sufficient maintenance. In addition,  the local utility that manages and operates Tijuana\u2019s wastewater  system has a limited number of personnel. The study also reported  that existing personnel were \u201cvery knowledgeable, dedicated, and  creative in their efforts\u201d to maintain and operate the sewage  infrastructure. Nonetheless, Tijuana\u2019s existing sewage pipes  consistently break and its pump stations fail.
