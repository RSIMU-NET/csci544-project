More specifically, four of five component agencies GAO reviewed have assessed the sufficiency of their veterinarian workforce to perform routine activities and have identified current or future concerns. This includes USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services (APHIS), Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), and Agricultural Research Service (ARS); and DOD's Army. Current and future shortages, as well as noncompetitive salaries, were among the concerns identified by these agencies. HHS's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not perform such assessments and did not identify any concerns. In addition, at the department level, USDA and HHS have not assessed their veterinarian workforces across their component agencies, but DOD has a process for doing so. Moreover, there is no governmentwide effort to search for shared solutions, even though 16 of the 24 federal entities that employ veterinarians raised concerns about the sufficiency of this workforce. Further exacerbating these concerns is the number of veterinarians eligible to retire in the near future. GAO's analysis revealed that 27 percent of the veterinarians at APHIS, FSIS, ARS, Army, and FDA will be eligible to retire within 3 years. Efforts to identify the veterinarian workforce needed for a catastrophic event are insufficient. Specifically, agencies' plans lack important elements necessary for continuing essential veterinarian functions during a pandemic, such as identifying which functions must be performed on-site and how they will be carried out if absenteeism reaches 40 percent--the rate predicted at the height of the pandemic and used for planning purposes. In addition, one federal effort to prepare for the intentional introduction of a foreign animal disease is based on the unrealistic assumption that all affected animals will be slaughtered, as the United States has done for smaller outbreaks, making the resulting veterinarian workforce estimates irrelevant. A second effort lacks crucial data, including data on how the disease would spread in wildlife. If wildlife became infected, as they have in the past, response would be greatly complicated and could require more veterinarians and different expertise. Officials from federal and state agencies involved in four recent zoonotic disease outbreaks commonly cited insufficient veterinarian capacity as a workforce challenge. However, 10 of the 17 agencies that GAO interviewed have not assessed their own veterinarian workforce's response to individual outbreaks and are thus missing opportunities to improve future responses. Moreover, none of the entities GAO reviewed has looked across outbreaks to identify common workforce challenges and possible solutions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Veterinarians play a vital role in the defense against animal diseases\u2014 Veterinarians play a vital role in the defense against animal diseases\u2014 whether naturally or intentionally introduced\u2014and these diseases can  whether naturally or intentionally introduced\u2014and these diseases can  cause serious harm to human health and the economy.

Subsequently, the Congress  enacted two pieces of legislation that address these concerns. In 2003, it  enacted the National Veterinary Medical Services Act directing the  Secretary of Agriculture to carry out a program to help repay school loans  for veterinarians who agree to work in areas of need. In August 2008, the  Congress passed the Higher Education Opportunity Act, which has  provisions intended to increase the number of veterinarians in the  workforce.", "The federal government employs more than 3,000 veterinarians. Although  this number represents a small portion of the federal workforce, these  veterinarians play a crucial role in helping to protect people and the  economy from animal diseases. More than 2,900 federal veterinarians  work for component agencies within the Departments of Agriculture  (USDA), Defense (DOD), and Health and Human Services (HHS). The  1,771 veterinarians at USDA have numerous functions, including the  following:    Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) veterinarians help  protect and maintain the health of American livestock and poultry during  production, and monitor wildlife populations for critical endemic and  foreign animal diseases;   Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) veterinarians inspect animals at  slaughter plants to help ensure the safety of meat and poultry products,  and they also oversee the humane treatment of livestock during slaughter;  and   Agricultural Research Service (ARS) veterinarians research critical  endemic and foreign animal diseases.", "DOD employs 841 veterinarians, the majority of whom work for the Army  as active duty veterinarians or as part of the Army\u2019s veterinary reserve  corps.

See  appendix I for a list of veterinarian roles and responsibilities within the  federal government.", "As this list of responsibilities indicates, the federal veterinarian workforce  plays a critical role in ensuring the safety of the U.S. food supply.  However, we testified in 2008 that the staffing levels at FSIS\u2014where  veterinarians play an important role in helping to ensure the safety of our  food supply and the humane treatment of animals during slaughter\u2014have  declined since 1995 despite an increasing budget, and some districts have  experienced high vacancy rates among inspectors. This could impair  enforcement of the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act of 1978 and of food  safety regulations generally. In addition, we have designated the federal  oversight of food safety as a high-risk area of government operations  because the current system is fragmented, causing inconsistent oversight,  ineffective coordination, and inefficient use of resources.", "As with all professions in the federal government, departments and their  component agencies are responsible for hiring and maintaining a  veterinarian workforce sufficient to meet their missions. High-performing  public organizations have found that maintaining a quality workforce  requires them to systematically assess current and future workforce needs  and formulate a long-term strategy to attract, retain, develop, and motivate  employees. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) provides  guidance and leadership intended to help build a high-quality and diverse  federal workforce. Our prior work has identified the need for OPM to use  its leadership position to help departments and agencies recruit and retain  a capable and committed workforce.", "In this context, you asked us to determine the extent to which (1) the  federal government has assessed the sufficiency of its veterinarian  workforce for routine program activities, (2) the federal government has  identified the veterinarian workforce needed during a catastrophic event,  and (3) federal and state agencies encountered veterinarian workforce  challenges during four recent zoonotic outbreaks.", "To address the first objective, we identified and surveyed departments,  component agencies, and other federal entities employing veterinarians to  determine, among other things, the number, salaries, and roles and  responsibilities of veterinarians, as well as the sufficiency of this  workforce. We then selected component agencies within three  departments for further analysis to determine the extent to which they  assessed the sufficiency of their veterinarian workforce. We selected  USDA, DOD, and HHS because these departments employ about 96  percent of federal veterinarians. Within these departments, we focused our  veterinarian workforce assessment review on APHIS, FSIS, Army, and  FDA, because these component agencies employ the most veterinarians.  We also selected ARS for further review because it is USDA\u2019s chief  scientific research agency and conducts research to solve agricultural  problems of high national priority. We interviewed officials involved in  workforce planning, as well as those that carry out program activities such  as veterinarians working in slaughter plants. To address the second  objective, we analyzed agency plans for continuing essential functions  during a pandemic, and compared them with DHS national planning  guidance, which identifies essential elements that federal departments and  agencies should consider. We also reviewed veterinarian workforce  outcomes from DHS\u2019s nationwide effort to assess the nation\u2019s  preparedness for multiple, intentional introductions of foot-and-mouth  disease. We selected a pandemic and intentional foot-and-mouth disease  outbreak because these are two potential catastrophic events the White  House Homeland Security Council has deemed critical for planning  purposes. To address the third objective, we conducted semistructured  interviews with selected officials from 17 federal and state agencies  involved in responding to the following four recent zoonotic outbreaks:    bovine tuberculosis in Michigan: a bacterial disease that spreads from deer    exotic Newcastle disease in California: a highly infectious virus that  spread rapidly throughout poultry;   monkeypox in Wisconsin: a virus not seen in the United States until 2003,  when there was an outbreak in exotic pets and humans; and   West Nile virus in Colorado: a disease that spread rapidly across the  United States, infecting numerous species.", "We focused our review on these outbreaks because they were most  frequently recommended by federal officials as examples of zoonotic  diseases, are still occurring or occurred since 2001, and affected various  types of animals, among other things.

While simple in theory, strategic  planning can be difficult to carry out. Managers must, for example, acquire  accurate information on the workforce, set goals for employee  performance, and develop ways to measure that performance. According  to our previous work, strategic workforce planning should involve certain  key principles. Among these principles is the need to involve top  management, employees, and other stakeholders in developing,  communicating, and implementing a strategic workforce plan. Other  principles include determining the critical skills that will be needed,  developing strategies to address any gaps in these skills, building the  capability needed to address educational and other requirements  important to support workforce planning strategies, and monitoring and  evaluating progress toward workforce goals. However, federal agencies  have for years lacked a strategic approach to workforce management.  Consequently, since 2001, we have identified human capital management  as a high-risk area needing urgent attention and transformation.", "OPM provides information and guidance on a wide range of strategies that  departments and agencies can use to help strategically plan for and  maintain a workforce sufficient to accomplish their missions. This  includes standard retention and recruitment payments, such as  recruitment incentives and student loan repayments. OPM can also  authorize departments to use additional strategies to address workforce  shortage situations should standard strategies prove insufficient. For  example, OPM can approve higher salaries for individual positions in an  occupation if the agency has difficulty staffing a position requiring an  extremely high level of expertise that is critical to the agency\u2019s successful  accomplishment of an important mission.", "In addition to maintaining a workforce sufficient for routine functions,  departments and agencies are directed by the President to ensure they can  carry out essential functions during a \u201ccatastrophic event.\u201d Such a  catastrophic event is any natural or man-made incident, including  terrorism, that results in extraordinary levels of mass casualties, damage,  or disruption severely affecting the population, infrastructure,  environment, economy, national morale, and/or government functions. To  do so, agencies must develop continuity of operation plans for  emergencies that disrupt normal operations. Continuity planning includes  identifying and establishing procedures to ensure vital resources are  safeguarded, available, and accessible to support continuity operations.  Vital resources are personnel, equipment, systems, infrastructures,  supplies, and other assets required to perform an agency\u2019s essential  functions. DHS\u2019s Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)  provides direction to the federal executive branch for developing  continuity plans and programs, including pandemic plans.", "For one type of catastrophic event, a pandemic that severely reduces the  workforce, DHS has developed guidance that identifies specific elements  agencies should consider as they plan to maintain essential services and  functions. FEMA concluded that planning for a pandemic requires a state  of preparedness that goes beyond normal continuity of operations  planning. On March 1, 2006, FEMA first issued guidance to assist  departments and agencies in identifying special considerations for  protecting the health and safety of employees and maintaining essential  functions and services during a pandemic. The Implementation Plan for  the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza recommends that  organizations plan for a 40 percent absenteeism rate at the height of a  pandemic. In addition, it called for department and agency pandemic plans  to be completed by March 31, 2006.", "Departments and agencies must also plan for other events that could place  extraordinary demands on their workforce, such as a catastrophic  outbreak of a foreign animal disease. In December 2003, the President  issued a Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD-8) to establish  national policy to strengthen the preparedness of the United States to  prevent and respond to terrorist attacks, major disasters, and other  emergencies. As part of its efforts to meet HSPD-8, a White House  Homeland Security Council working group developed National Planning  Scenarios for 15 major events, including a biological attack with a foreign  animal disease, foot-and-mouth disease. According to the scenario,  terrorists introduce the disease in several locations and states  simultaneously. The transportation of livestock spreads the contagious  virus to surrounding states and, within 10 days of the attack, more than  half of the states may be affected. Ultimately, almost half the nation\u2019s beef,  dairy, and swine would be affected. These scenarios serve as the basis for  assessing the nation\u2019s preparedness for such an event by defining tasks  that may be required and the capabilities needed governmentwide to  perform these tasks. Although not a prescription for the resources needed  to achieve these capabilities, they are intended to help identify such  resource needs and guide planning efforts. No single jurisdiction or agency  will be expected to perform every task, so the response to a catastrophic  event will require coordination among all levels of government.

Finally, there is no governmentwide assessment of  the veterinarian workforce. Specifically, OPM has not conducted a  governmentwide effort to address current and future veterinarian  shortages identified by component agencies, and efforts by the Congress  to address the national shortage have thus far had minimal impact."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Four of Five Agencies Have Identified Existing and Potential Veterinarian Shortages", "paragraphs": ["APHIS, FSIS, ARS, and Army conduct regular workforce assessments.  While APHIS reported it does not currently have a shortage, it identified a  potential future shortage. FSIS, ARS, and Army have identified both  existing and potential future shortages. FDA does not conduct such  assessments, but officials there told us the veterinarian workforce is  adequate to meet its responsibilities. Our work has shown that agencies  should be held accountable for the ongoing monitoring and refinement of  human capital approaches to recruit and hire a capable and committed  federal workforce.", "APHIS reported that none of its six units that employ veterinarians has  identified a current shortage, but officials told us they are concerned  about the future size and skills of the veterinarian workforce. First, the  agency reported that 30 percent of its veterinarians will be eligible to retire  by the end of fiscal year 2011, potentially creating a serious shortage. This  is consistent with our previous work where we reported that one-third of  federal career employees on board at the end of fiscal year 2007 are  eligible to retire between spring 2008 and 2012. In addition, APHIS is  concerned that it will be unable to maintain an adequate workforce of  veterinary pathologists. This is consistent with a report by the United  States Animal Health Association, which found a shortage of over 40  percent nationwide. An APHIS laboratory director told us that veterinary  pathologists are integral to work conducted in APHIS diagnostic  laboratories, including work on diseases that threaten animal and human  health. For example, APHIS veterinary pathologists work on bovine  spongiform encephalopathy, a fatal degenerative disease\u2014commonly  known as mad cow disease\u2014that has been linked to at least 165 human  deaths worldwide. APHIS also identified a need to maintain a veterinarian  workforce with sufficient expertise to help protect livestock and the  nation\u2019s food supply from foreign animal diseases. We reported in 2005  that many U.S. veterinarians lack the training needed to identify such  diseases, whether naturally or intentionally introduced. Finally, after the  terrorist attacks of 2001, USDA\u2019s responsibilities were broadened to  enhance the ability of the United States to manage domestic incidents. As  such, in addition to being the lead for coordinating any response efforts to  incidents involving an animal disease, APHIS will now also play a  supporting role in incidents not directly related to animal diseases. For  example, APHIS veterinarians may be called upon to assist in ensuring the  safety and security of the commercial food supply or for caring for  livestock stranded in hurricanes and floods. These increased  responsibilities raise concerns about the ability of veterinarians to respond  to multiple, simultaneous events, according to agency officials.", "APHIS has supported training opportunities to help overcome some of  these projected skill gaps. The agency has also set a goal of recruiting at  all veterinary colleges and working with universities to help them include  relevant training in their course offerings. In addition, APHIS uses bonuses  to attract and maintain its veterinarian workforce. During the first 9  months of fiscal year 2008, it provided one retention and one relocation  bonus to veterinarians, totaling $41,654.", "Over the past decade, FSIS has not had a sufficient number of  veterinarians and remains unable to overcome this shortage, according to  FSIS officials. The agency\u2019s goal was to have 1,134 veterinarians on staff in  fiscal year 2008, but it fell short of that by 166 veterinarians, or 15 percent.  Moreover, since fiscal year 2003, the FSIS veterinarian workforce has  decreased by nearly 10 percent\u2014from 1,073 to 968. The majority of these  veterinarians work in slaughter plants. Federal law prohibits slaughtering  livestock or poultry at a plant that prepares the livestock or poultry for  human consumption for use in interstate commerce unless the animals  have been examined by USDA inspectors and requires the humane  slaughtering and handling of livestock at such plants. In implementing  federal law, each slaughter plant is covered by one or more FSIS  veterinarians to, among other things, ensure the safety and quality of meat  and poultry products and the humane treatment of livestock during  slaughter. Agency data from the past 5 years reveal that vacancy rates for  veterinarian positions in slaughter plants vary by location and year, from  no vacancy to as many as 35 percent of the positions vacant.", "FSIS headquarters officials and veterinarians working in slaughter plants  differed on the impact of this shortage. Headquarters officials told us that,  despite the shortage, the agency has been able to meet its food safety and  other responsibilities by redistributing the workforce. For example, in  some cases, FSIS has assigned one veterinarian to several slaughter plants  or assigned only one to plants that previously had two. In contrast, several  veterinarians working in slaughter plants told us that, because of  inadequate staffing, they are not always able to meet their responsibilities  and perform high-quality work. For example, veterinarians told us they  cannot always verify crucial sanitation and security checks of the plant or  promptly log data on animal diseases and welfare.", "In early 2008, veterinarians also told us they did not always have time to  ensure the humane treatment of livestock. Inhumane treatment triggered  an investigation that led to the largest beef recall in U.S. history. More  specifically, in February 2008, the Humane Society of the United States  released videos to the public that documented abuse of cattle awaiting  slaughter at a plant in Chino, California. These alleged abuses, which took  place in the fall of 2007, included electrically shocking nonambulatory  \u201cdowner\u201d cattle, spraying them with high-pressure water hoses, and  ramming them with a forklift in an apparent attempt to force them to rise  for slaughter. These acts are not only cruel, they pose a risk to the safety  of the food supply, because downer animals are known to be at greater  risk for bovine spongiform encephalopathy. FSIS regulations require that  downer cattle be separated to await disposition by an inspector, even if  they become nonambulatory after an inspector has approved the animal  for slaughter during the preslaughter inspection. On February 1, 2008, the  plant voluntarily ceased operations pending investigation by FSIS into the  alleged abuses. On February 17, 2008, the plant announced that it was  voluntarily recalling approximately 143 million pounds of raw and frozen  beef products because of its failure to notify FSIS of the downer cows and  the remote possibility that the beef being recalled could cause adverse  health effects if consumed. The release of the videos by the Humane  Society led congressional committees and USDA to question how such  events could have occurred at a plant in which FSIS inspectors were  assigned. At the request of the Secretary of Agriculture, USDA\u2019s Office of  Inspector General (OIG) is leading a criminal investigation that is ongoing  at the time of this report. In addition, OIG conducted an audit of FSIS\u2019s  controls over preslaughter activities and reported in November 2008 that  controls to demonstrate the sufficiency and competency of FSIS\u2019  personnel resources could be strengthened to minimize the chance that  such events could recur, among other things.", "Veterinarians and other FSIS officials we interviewed told us that, at the  time of the incident, only one veterinarian was assigned to the plant that  was the source of the recall, whereas two had been assigned in past years.  Two veterinarians were needed, according to these officials, because the  plant processed \u201ccull\u201d dairy cows, which are no longer used for milk  production. These cows are generally older and in poorer condition than  other livestock and thus require more frequent veterinary inspection. In  the wake of this incident, FSIS required veterinarians to spend more time  verifying the humane treatment of animals. However, veterinarians told us  that this exacerbated the difficulty of completing their other work. In 2004,  we made recommendations aimed at ensuring that FSIS can make well- informed estimates about the inspection resources\u2014including  veterinarians\u2014needed to enforce the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act of  1978. Specifically, we recommended that FSIS periodically assess  whether the level of resources dedicated to humane handling and  slaughter activities is sufficient, but the agency has yet to demonstrate that  they have done so.", "FSIS officials told us that there are several reasons for the agency\u2019s  ongoing shortage of veterinarians. For example, most veterinarians do not  want to work in the unpleasant environment of a slaughterhouse.  Furthermore, veterinarians are trained to heal animals, but FSIS  veterinarians are hired to oversee the slaughter of animals. The job can  also be physically and emotionally grueling, and many of the plants are in  remote and sometimes undesirable locations. In addition, as a result of  staff shortages, there is little opportunity to take time off for training that  could lead to promotion. Finally, FSIS veterinarians told us that their  salaries do not sufficiently compensate for the working conditions and are  low relative to those of other veterinarians. According to OPM\u2019s Central  Personnel Data File, the mean annual salary for FSIS veterinarians in 2007  was $77,678; in contrast, the mean salary for private-practice veterinarians  was $115,447 in 2007, according to the most recent data from the American  Veterinary Medical Association. In commenting on a draft of this report,  FSIS officials added that there is a lack of public health and food-safety  emphasis in veterinary schools.", "FSIS has taken several steps to address the shortage. For example, it  awarded 35 recruitment bonuses totaling more than $583,000 in the first 9  months of fiscal year 2008. FSIS also has internship programs that have,  according to agency officials, increased awareness and generated interest  in veterinarian work at the agency. For example, over the past 5 years,  FSIS has established agreements with 16 veterinary schools to provide  volunteer training opportunities to veterinary students with an interest in  food safety and public health. In fiscal year 2008, there were 26  participants in the program, compared with only 1 when the program  began in 2003. Two participants have thus far returned to FSIS for full-time  employment after graduation. FSIS also has a paid veterinary student  program that is designed to provide experience directly related to the  student\u2019s educational program and career goals. Since 2002, when FSIS  began tracking this program, 77 students have participated, and 6 have  become full-time employees. In addition, FSIS has sought special hiring  authorities from OPM. For example, in July 2008, the agency was  delegated authority to hire a limited number of retirees at full salary  instead of at the reduced salary required for those with annuity income.  Officials told us they hope this will encourage retired veterinarians to join  FSIS, but, as of the date of this report, no retirees have been hired through  this program. FSIS intends to track the effectiveness of this special hiring  authority. Moreover, FSIS has proposed implementing a demonstration  project that would allow the agency to test a pay system that offers more  competitive salaries to veterinarians, among others. OPM requires that  agencies undertaking such a project provide OPM with an analysis of the  impact of the project results in relation to its objectives. OPM officials told  us the project may be implemented in July 2009. Finally, OPM has in the  past granted FSIS the ability to make immediate job offers to veterinarians  without following prescribed competitive procedures, which can slow the  hiring process. This \u201cdirect-hire authority\u201d expired in 2007 and was not  renewed at that time because, according to FSIS officials, USDA did not  provide the expiration notification to FSIS. We were recently informed  that USDA received approval from OPM on November 25, 2008, for direct  hire for FSIS veterinarians lasting through December 31, 2009. However,  FSIS officials raised concerns about the length of time of the authority,  among other things, stating that it takes 5 to 6 months to renew this  authority.", "ARS employed 57 veterinarians in fiscal year 2008, 12 percent short of its  goal of 65. It has reported similar shortages throughout the last 5 years.  Although veterinarians represent a small share of the ARS workforce  (about 1 percent of more than 4,300 scientists and research technicians),  the agency considers them critical to its mission. According to ARS  officials, a sufficient veterinarian workforce is important to the quality and  breadth of research ARS is able to conduct. For example, ARS would not  have been able to conduct its research on the detection of avian influenza  and development of vaccines against it, or on the transmission of bovine  tuberculosis, without its veterinarians\u2019 skills and experience.", "ARS officials told us it is difficult to attract and retain veterinarians  because the agency requires its research veterinarians and senior program  leaders who are veterinarians to have a Ph.D. in animal sciences or a  related field, as well as a veterinary degree, and there is a limited pool of  candidates for these positions. A recent report by the National Academy of  Sciences identified a declining interest in veterinary research among  veterinary students as a cause of a shortage of Ph.D. veterinarians. In  addition, ARS officials told us the agency cannot compete with many of  the salaries offered in the private sector. In 2007, the mean salary for ARS  veterinarians was $102,081, according to OPM\u2019s Central Personnel Data  File. This is about $28,000 less than the mean salary reported by the  American Veterinary Medical Association for veterinarians with a Ph.D.  working at universities and colleges and about $96,000 less than those  working in industry with similar qualifications, such as at pharmaceutical  companies.", "To address its shortage of Ph.D. veterinarians, ARS provided six  recruitment or retention bonuses to its veterinarians totaling $48,313 in the  first 9 months of fiscal year 2008. The agency also created a tuition  program in 2003, but participation has been limited. Only four individuals  have been hired through the tuition program, and only two remained with  the agency, according to officials. Under this program, ARS hires  veterinarians without a Ph.D. and pays tuition and other educational costs  while they earn this degree. Officials told us that the lack of success is  most likely due to low salaries at ARS. In addition, the agency is reluctant  to use this program because it diverts funding from the hiring of  employees already qualified and ready to work."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Army", "paragraphs": ["The Army reported that it filled its 446 authorized active-duty veterinarian  positions, but that its veterinary reserve corps is not at full strength.

According to the Army\u2019s analysis, the  reserve corps has been at less than full strength since fiscal year 2005.  These veterinarians commit to part-time training and to being deployed to  full-time active duty when needed. The shortage means there is not a  sufficient pool of veterinarians that can be called into active duty as the  need arises. This is a concern, according to the official responsible for  assessing Army veterinarian workforce needs, because the Army\u2019s need  for veterinarian services is increasing due to growing concerns over  bioterrorism, intentional contamination of the food supply, emerging  zoonotic diseases, and due to operational requirements, such as  agricultural reconstruction in Afghanistan and Iraq, among other things.  This official told us that recruitment into the reserves has been a problem  because of the length, frequency, and uncertainty of deployments, which,  in some cases has also resulted in veterinarians losing their jobs or  suffering financial hardships. However, he told us that recent changes to  the reserve corps program\u2014such as decreasing the length of deployment  from 1 year to 180 days, and making additional incentives available to  veterinarians in the reserves\u2014have helped strengthen the capacity of the  veterinary reserve corps.", "Officials also told us they are concerned about a growing need for certain  special veterinary skills. For example, there is an increasing demand for  Army veterinary pathologists, who are essential for interpreting test  results from animals used in drug and vaccine research. The official  responsible for assessing Army veterinarian workforce needs told us the  Army has yet to formally assess this need. Other Army veterinarians  conduct medical intelligence work for DOD\u2019s Defense Intelligence Agency,  where officials told us they are concerned about the difficulty of recruiting  veterinarians with appropriate skills to meet a growing need to, among  other things, collect and analyze data on animal diseases that could be  used in a terrorist attack. Veterinarians are important to such work  because, according to these officials, the majority of diseases considered  to be potential bioterrorism agents are animal diseases that could also  affect humans. They told us that while the agency is working to expand its  workforce capabilities to address bioterrorism, there is a concern that the  growing demand for veterinarian capabilities may outpace the growth of  the Army\u2019s workforce.", "The primary reason for the Army\u2019s success in maintaining its active-duty  veterinarian workforce is a scholarship program, according to the official  responsible for assessing Army veterinarian workforce needs. This  program targets veterinary students and pays their tuition and fees to  veterinary school in exchange for a commitment to (1) serve as a  veterinarian in the Army for 3 years and (2) serve an additional 5 years  either in active duty or in the Army reserve program. In fiscal year 2008,  the Army reported it had 106 qualified applicants for 47 scholarships.  According to the official, the program is successful because it targets  students before they accumulate school-related debt. Veterinary students  graduate with more than $106,000 in debt, on average, according to the  American Veterinary Medical Association. In addition, the funding for this  program is directed specifically by congressional committees, separate  from funds the Army uses to hire veterinarians.", "FDA officials reported that the agency has not assessed the sufficiency of  its veterinarian workforce, but they told us that the workforce is sufficient  to meet its responsibilities. However, a 2007 report by an FDA Advisory  Committee found that FDA cannot fulfill its mission because of an  insufficient scientific workforce. More specifically, the report states that  FDA\u2019s scientific workforce has remained static while its workload has  increased, and that FDA\u2019s Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) is in a  state of crisis. This center employs nearly two-thirds of FDA\u2019s 152  veterinarians and is responsible for ensuring the safety of veterinary drugs  and regulating animal feed, among other things. An author of the report  told us that veterinarians enter FDA employment lacking necessary skills  and experience to examine the wide variety of veterinary products that  require FDA approval and that FDA needs to better train its veterinarians  to review the many diverse products under its jurisdiction. FDA officials  told us the agency is currently undertaking significant reforms to address  fundamental concerns in the report. For example, FDA reported it hired  more than 1,000 scientists in order to build a more robust workforce, and  it created the position of Chief Scientist to improve coordination of  science planning and execution across the agency. However, FDA did not  tell us how these reforms address the identified veterinarian skill gaps.", "Although FDA officials said the veterinarian workforce is sufficient, CVM  officials recently told us that as a result of new obligations, the center  hired 26 veterinarians in 2008 to fill vacancies. This represents a 17  percent increase in FDA\u2019s overall veterinarian workforce in 2008, and it  plans to hire more. The additional staff will enhance FDA\u2019s ability to  review generic animal drug submissions, among other things, according to  these officials. In addition, in commenting on a draft of this report, OPM  informed us that it is currently reviewing a request for direct-hire authority  from FDA to fill veterinary positions. According to OPM, this request is  based on a severe shortage of candidates and it is projected that this  authority may be granted through December 31, 2010. CVM also plans to  develop an internship program for entry-level veterinarians and other  scientists in order to develop a qualified talent pool from which to draw  permanent employees.

Our prior work has  found that top-level management needs to be involved in order for  strategic workforce planning to be effective.", "Although USDA regularly collects veterinarian workforce data from its  component agencies that employ veterinarians, it does not use this  information to assess the sufficiency of the veterinarian workforce  departmentwide. Department officials told us that workforce assessment  is the responsibility of the agencies. Because USDA delegates this  responsibility, it appears to be unaware of the scope of the workforce  problems facing its agencies. For example, in its fiscal year 2007 human  capital management report, USDA reported that its agencies had met or  surpassed certain veterinarian workforce goals but made no mention of  the shortages that FSIS and ARS identified in their workforce reports.  USDA officials agreed that the report did not capture this critical  information and that future reports should address the shortages.", "One result of this lack of department-level involvement is that USDA  agencies compete against one another for veterinarians instead of  following a departmentwide strategy to balance the needs of the agencies.

Indeed, our  analysis shows that veterinarians are more concentrated in lower grade  levels at FSIS than at APHIS (see fig. 1). Moreover, according to OPM\u2019s  Central Personnel Data File, the mean annual salary for veterinarians at  FSIS in 2007 was about $78,000, the lowest among the three key USDA  agencies (see fig. 2).

However, HHS officials said that this effort does not preclude  agencies from assessing their own veterinarian workforce needs and  sharing that information with the department. HHS officials also told us  that because the department is expected to provide veterinary medical  care and support during public health and medical disasters that warrant a  coordinated federal response, it is critical that appropriate veterinary  resources are identified and maintained. Furthermore, these officials told  us that efforts are under way at the component agency level to address the  national veterinary shortage. Specifically, CDC, in collaboration with  Emory University, has developed a residency program designed to provide  comprehensive training in laboratory animal medicine to better prepare  veterinarians for working in laboratory research facilities at CDC and  across the nation.

It has given this responsibility to the  Army, which employs 89 percent of DOD veterinarians, with the remaining  veterinarians working as public health officials for the Air Force. The  Army assesses not only the number and type of veterinarians it will need  but also what will be needed for the other services. For example, Army  veterinarians are routinely assigned to care for working dogs and other  animals at Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine bases. Army veterinarians  also conduct medical intelligence activities at the Defense Intelligence  Agency.

Agencies can use these authorities to hire veterinarians when  standard hiring practices, including the use of recruitment incentives, are  impracticable, less effective, or have been exhausted. In addition, DOD  can provide all of its veterinarians with a $100 per month stipend, as well  as up to an additional $5,000 per year of special pay if they have met the  education and training standards of an American Veterinary Medical  Association-recognized specialty college. There is no similar authority for  USDA veterinarians.", "OPM\u2019s mission is to ensure the federal government has an effective civilian  workforce, but it has not conducted a governmentwide effort to address  current and potential veterinarian shortages, as it has done for other  professions. For certain professions, OPM has initiated governmentwide  direct-hire authority, which allows expediting hiring during a time of  critical need or a severe shortage of candidates. For example, in 2003,  OPM authorized departments to immediately hire doctors, nurses, and  other types of medical professionals without following prescribed  competitive procedures.

OPM raised the entry grade level for  newly hired veterinarians from GS-9 to GS-11 and expanded the  description of the federal veterinarian occupation to include areas of  specialization, such as toxicology and pathology. OPM officials believe this  will help attract more veterinarians into federal service.

The  National Veterinary Medical Services Act enacted in 2003, directs the  Secretary of Agriculture to carry out a program to help veterinarians repay  their school loans when they agree to work in areas of need. Although  USDA is responsible for implementing the act, it has been delayed in doing  so.

With veterinary student debt averaging $106,000 upon  graduation, $1.8 million would cover about 17 students with loans.  Moreover, the program targets veterinarians who already have their degree  and may not have the skill set the federal government is seeking. To be  effective, officials from professional veterinary associations told us, the  program would have to provide guarantees and target students early in  veterinary school.

Importantly, the plan  takes into account the work that veterinarians do at private slaughter  plants. However, it does not address the logistics of how FSIS will work  with industry to ensure veterinarians and other employees are available in  the event of a pandemic so that food production can continue. FSIS  officials told us that they have discussed this logistic with industry and  expect, based on these discussions, that some plants would not be able to  operate during a pandemic, as a result of FSIS or plant personnel  absenteeism. The agency would maintain close communication with  industry during a pandemic in order to determine how best to allocate  available veterinarians and other FSIS inspection personnel so that  slaughter plants could continue to operate. Veterinarians would be  allocated to plants based on considerations such as the location of the  outbreak and the type of slaughter plant affected. For instance, poultry  plants may receive priority consideration because birds can only be  slaughtered at a very specific weight. That is, the equipment for processing  birds is designed for birds of a very specific size, and industry would not  be able to process them if they were permitted to grow too large.  However, such logisitcs are absent from FSIS\u2019s plan, effectively  postponing any decisions until the middle of a crisis.

However, the  plans lack crucial details, such as how the laboratories will continue  operations if absenteeism reaches 40 percent. Specifically, neither of the  plans take into account how the laboratories would continue to conduct  essential functions and services if leadership and essential staff are  unavailable. Agency officials told us they would temporarily suspend  projects to account for increased absenteeism, but there is no mention of  this in the plans; nor is there mention of how the agency will select  projects for suspension or what would trigger suspension. Ensuring a  sufficient veterinarian workforce at these laboratories during a pandemic  is important because veterinarians carry out critical research and must be  available to ensure the proper care of research animals. In addition, NADC  is part of a USDA research complex that is transitioning to joint ARS and  APHIS support services, including veterinary care for research animals.

The first is a long-term national effort that  DHS is coordinating to assess the nation\u2019s preparedness for multiple,  intentional introductions of foot-and-mouth disease. This effort includes  identifying the veterinarian workforce and other capabilities that would be  needed to best respond to such an outbreak. For example, it has identified  the need for 750 veterinarians nationwide to conduct animal health  epidemiological investigations and surveillance. It has also identified the  need for teams of six livestock and six companion animal veterinarians in  each affected state and local jurisdiction to implement disease  containment measures, provide animal welfare, and euthanize and dispose  of animals.", "However, this effort is based on a national planning scenario that USDA  and DHS officials\u2019 say includes an infeasible assumption. The scenario,  developed by a White House Homeland Security Council working group in  2006, involves the mass slaughter of all potentially exposed animals. This  \u201cstamping out\u201d method is the same one the United States has used in the  past for eradicating smaller outbreaks of foreign animal diseases, but  under this scenario, it would result in the slaughter of almost half the  nation\u2019s beef, dairy, and swine. DHS and USDA officials, as well as state  officials who have conducted large-scale foot-and-mouth disease  exercises, consider this stamping out method infeasible because, among  other things, it would lead to serious logistical and environmental  concerns, would not be tolerated by the public, and could wipe out a  viable livestock industry. As a result, DHS and USDA officials told us, any  workforce estimates produced from this effort are not relevant. However,  these officials told us it has helped them better understand the enormity of  the workforce response and the coordination that would be required for  such a catastrophic event.", "DHS and USDA officials told us that to arrive at more relevant workforce  estimates, the United States would have to consider alternatives to  stamping out for outbreaks as large as the one depicted in the national  planning scenario. For example, some countries protect against and  control foot-and-mouth disease using vaccines. There are numerous  reasons the United States has not used this approach, including limitations  to vaccine technology. However USDA, DHS, and state officials recognize  that newer, more promising vaccines may play an important role in  controlling a catastrophic outbreak. DHS officials also told us that they are  looking into revising the Homeland Security Council\u2019s planning scenario to  make it a more useful planning tool.", "For its second effort to identify the veterinarian workforce needed during  a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, DHS has contracted with the  Department of Energy\u2019s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to  create a decision support system that models various foot-and-mouth  disease outbreak scenarios. This effort includes estimating the number  and type of workforce needed for responding to outbreaks, both with and  without vaccination. However, according to the project leader, modeling  efforts could be improved if certain information were available. For  example, in order to model workforce needs for a response that includes  the use of vaccines without subsequent stamping out, known as \u201cvaccinate  to live,\u201d it is important to know what segments of the livestock industry  might use such a strategy, and under what circumstances, and how  animals and animal products would be identified and their movement  tracked. Because the concept of vaccinate to live is new in the United  States, USDA has yet to detail in contingency response plans how it would  employ this concept, according to agency officials. In the absence of such  plans, the project leader, a veterinarian who took part in the response to  the 2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, told us that  she is left to base her modeling assumptions on personal knowledge and  experience, as well as conversations with agency subject matter experts.", "Moreover, data limitations make it difficult for any computer modeling  effort to accurately predict the spread of the disease. Specifically,  modelers must estimate the number and location of animals, as well as  their interaction with other segments of industry, because the United  States does not have a mandatory, national system that identifies the  location and tracks the movement of livestock. Instead, modelers  currently use outdated county-level data from USDA\u2019s National  Agricultural Statistical Survey census, reducing the accuracy of  predictions about the spread of foot-and-mouth disease. Also, without  knowing the exact location of livestock, it is difficult to understand the  interaction between livestock and wildlife. Limited data and information  on the number and movement of wildlife and the susceptibility of wildlife  populations to the virus further complicates matters, according to agency  officials. This is an important gap, since foot-and-mouth disease has been  known to spread from livestock to wildlife in past outbreaks. In fact, the  last time the United States had an outbreak was in California in the 1920s,  when the virus spread from pigs to cattle and black-tailed deer. It took 2  years and the slaughter of 22,000 deer to eradicate the disease from a local  deer population in one national park. In areas where livestock graze  extensively, there is potential for interaction with susceptible species,  such as deer and feral pigs. According to the project leader, as well as  USDA and DHS officials, control and eradication strategies would be  greatly complicated if wildlife became infected and could require more  veterinarians and different expertise. Given the important role wildlife can  play in disease outbreak, officials agree it is important to better  understand the interaction between livestock and wildlife. In fact, new  technologies, such as global positioning systems, have been developed  that can, for example, help determine the number and movement of  animals, making it possible to gather this type of data, according to a  USDA Wildlife Services official. A DHS official told us that, as a first step,  it would be important for those agencies with responsibility for overseeing  the health of humans, wildlife, and livestock to discuss how wildlife data  can be gathered to most accurately model the spread of disease in wildlife."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal and State Agencies Are Missing Important Opportunities to Ensure Efficient Use of Veterinarians During Disease Outbreaks", "paragraphs": ["During four recent zoonotic disease outbreaks, the veterinarian workforce  challenge cited most often by federal and state officials was having too  few veterinarians to control the outbreak while also adequately carrying  out other routine activities. Specifically, officials from 3 of 4 federal  agencies\u2014APHIS, CDC, and Interior\u2019s U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)\u2014 and 9 of 13 state agencies cited this challenge. See table 2 for the 17  agencies that were identified as playing an important role, those that cited  insufficient veterinarian capacity as a challenge, and other details about  these outbreaks.", "Two primary reasons emerged for this insufficient capacity. First,  according to federal and state officials, veterinarian capacity was  insufficient because most of the agencies involved in the four outbreaks  had difficulty recruiting and retaining veterinarians in general. For  example, officials at many of the public health agencies and diagnostic  laboratories we spoke with said that it has been challenging to hire or  retain veterinarians with the specialized qualifications they need\u2014public  health and pathology skills, respectively. According to 2008 survey results  from the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, it  takes most diagnostic laboratories more than 6 months to fill vacancies for  veterinary pathologists. In addition, numerous state agency officials told  us that the salaries they offer are not competitive with those of the federal  or private sectors. Moreover, officials told us that it has been particularly  challenging recruiting veterinarians to work in remote areas or in areas  with a high cost of living.", "Second, in 2002 and 2003 many veterinarians went to California to address  a particularly demanding outbreak of exotic Newcastle disease, limiting  the number of veterinarians available to respond to other outbreaks. The  exotic Newcastle disease outbreak quickly exhausted California\u2019s supply  of veterinarians, both at state agencies and APHIS, because so many  backyard birds\u2014which are kept as a hobby or for personal consumption\u2014 were affected. Responders had to spend valuable time going door-to-door  trying to locate potentially infected birds in densely populated urban  areas. APHIS called in over 1,000 federal, state, and private-sector  veterinarians from outside California to help with the response. But, even  with a task force of over 6,000, it took almost a year to control the  outbreak. Moreover, because so many veterinarians converged on  California, the number available to work on the other three outbreaks\u2014 located in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Colorado\u2014was insufficient,  according to federal and state agency officials. In part because of the  strain on veterinarian resources during the four outbreaks, officials from  16 federal and state agencies expressed concern that they will not have  sufficient veterinarian capacity for multiple outbreaks in the future. FDA  assisted in one of the four outbreaks and was the only agency not to  express concerns about veterinarian capacity. Some federal officials said  that the United States has never been tested with two major outbreaks  occurring at once, such as simultaneous outbreaks of foot-and-mouth  disease and highly pathogenic avian influenza\u2014two highly infectious  foreign animal diseases. They said that should this happen, the effects on  animal and public health could be devastating.", "Federal and state agency officials reported several consequences of this  insufficient veterinarian capacity. Examples are as follows:    Michigan state agency officials told us they had trouble testing enough  cattle during the bovine tuberculosis outbreak. Over a 6-1/2 year period,  veterinarians struggled to test more than a million cows\u2014an average of  more than 3,500 a week\u2014but the state has yet to eradicate the disease.", "Some Michigan officials told us that APHIS and the Michigan Department  of Agriculture did not have enough veterinarians to both respond to bovine  tuberculosis and address other animal diseases, such as E. coli. In fact,  during all four outbreaks, veterinarians at some point had to delay  important work on other diseases, in part because there were not enough  veterinarians.", "During the 2003 West Nile virus outbreak in Colorado, a lack of sufficient  veterinarians to track and control the disease, among other things, may  have allowed the virus to infect more people and animals than it otherwise  would have.", "The volume of work required to control and eventually eradicate exotic  Newcastle disease in California physically and emotionally exhausted  veterinarians to the extent that, once the outbreak was over, they needed  significant time off to recover, further delaying work on routine activities.", "The demanding nature of the exotic Newcastle disease and bovine  tuberculosis outbreaks may have caused some veterinarians to seek  employment elsewhere.", "Despite reports of insufficient veterinarian capacity during these four  outbreaks, the agencies have not taken full advantage of two important  opportunities to learn from past experience. First, 10 of the 17 agencies  have not assessed how well their own veterinarian workforces responded  to individual outbreaks. Our prior work has shown that agencies can  improve response by conducting postoutbreak assessments. One  outcome of such an assessment might be a better understanding of how to  most efficiently use veterinarians. For example, APHIS\u2014one of the  agencies that has performed postoutbreak assessments\u2014found that it had  difficulty locating veterinarians with the specialized expertise needed for  addressing the exotic Newcastle disease outbreak. As a result, APHIS is  developing a national list identifying veterinarians and their credentials to  call upon in the future. In addition, federal and state agencies working on  bovine tuberculosis in Michigan meet periodically to assess what  strategies are working and what they need to change in order to better  control the disease. APHIS also conducts periodic reviews of its efforts  and the state\u2019s efforts to address bovine tuberculosis.", "Moreover, none of the 17 agencies have come together to share their  experiences across the outbreaks in order to identify workforce  challenges that they may have had in common, including veterinarian  workforce challenges. Consequently, the agencies are missing the  opportunity to identify and address challenges they are likely to face in the  future. The majority of the federal and state agency officials we spoke with  agreed that it would be useful for agencies not only to conduct  assessments of their own workforce response but also to periodically meet  to identify common workforce challenges across multiple outbreaks and  discuss strategies for overcoming these challenges. However, some  agencies told us that their veterinarian workforce is already facing heavy  workload demands that make it difficult for them to meet their existing  responsibilities, and thus they have not had time to conduct postoutbreak  assessments.", "Wet Nile virusas recently introdced in  wild ird nd po  potentilly erious  thret to people nd hor.

The nation is facing a growing  shortage of veterinarians, and component agencies and other federal  entities have already identified insufficiencies in their veterinarian  workforces. At FSIS, for example, the veterinarian workforce is finding it  difficult to adequately carry out its responsibilities for ensuring food safety  and the humane treatment of animals. In 2004, we recommended that FSIS  periodically assess whether it has enough inspection resources, including  veterinarians, dedicated to humane handling and slaughter activities, but  the agency has yet to demonstrate that they have done so. Nor has the  federal government conducted the broader assessments and planning  activities necessary to address veterinarian workforce problems at FSIS  and beyond. Unless USDA and HHS conduct departmentwide assessments  of their veterinarian workforces, they will not fully understand the size  and nature of the challenges they face in recruiting and retaining  veterinarians with the appropriate skills. This will leave their component  agencies without a high-level solution to problems they have so far been  unable to solve on their own. Moreover, without a governmentwide effort  to identify shortcomings in veterinarian capabilities, the federal  government may be missing opportunities to find common solutions for  attracting veterinarians into federal service.", "In addition, unless component agencies complete and test their pandemic  plans in keeping with FEMA guidance, they will not be fully prepared to  carry out essential veterinarian functions in the face of high rates of  absenteeism. Until USDA details how responders would control a foot- and-mouth disease outbreak using vaccines, the nation will not have a  complete understanding of the veterinarian workforce needed to control  such an outbreak. Similarly, until more information is gathered on the  spread of foot-and-mouth disease in wildlife, agencies will not be able to  more accurately model the number and type of veterinarians that would be  needed if the disease were to spread beyond livestock. Failure to  understand the workforce needed during a catastrophic event\u2014whether a  pandemic or an attack on the food supply\u2014could unnecessarily increase  the scope and severity of the crisis. Finally, unless component agencies  involved in responding to outbreaks of zoonotic disease regularly review  their own performance and collectively assess opportunities for  improvement, they cannot be assured they are using veterinarians as  efficiently as possible. They are, therefore, more likely to face an  insufficient veterinarian workforce capacity during future outbreaks,  which may cause an unnecessary increase in the severity of the outbreaks  and worsen the threat to public health."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making nine recommendations to improve the ability of the federal  veterinarian workforce to carry out routine activities, prepare for a  catastrophic event, and respond to zoonotic disease outbreaks.", "To help ensure the federal veterinarian workforce is sufficient to meet the  critical responsibilities it carries out on a routine basis, we recommend  that  1.  the Secretary of Agriculture direct FSIS to periodically assess whether  its level of inspection resources dedicated to food safety and humane  slaughter activities is sufficient, and  2.  the Secretary of Agriculture conduct a departmentwide assessment of  USDA\u2019s veterinarian workforce\u2014based, for example, on workforce  assessments by its component agencies\u2014to identify current and future  workforce needs (including training and employee development) and  departmentwide solutions to problems shared by its agencies.

Once  the plans are completed, the HHS Office of Human Resources will look  across the plans to identify opportunities for collaboration with regard to  strategic recruitment, development, and retention. The department also  plans to strengthen its oversight of the operating divisions to ensure that  they are implementing their workforce plans, focusing on those  occupations critical to the success of their missions. While veterinarians  are not currently identified as a department-level Mission Critical  Occupation, largely because they represent less than 1 percent of the HHS  workforce, the department plans to review its Mission Critical  Occupations in the coming year using criteria that are more risk-based.

For the first, we compared pandemic plans from APHIS, FSIS, ARS, Army,  and FDA to guidance the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS)  Federal Emergency Management Agency provided to departments and  agencies for identifying special considerations for maintaining essential  functions and services under such conditions.

Based on this information, we then interviewed  officials from USDA, HHS, Interior, state public health departments, state  agriculture and wildlife agencies, state diagnostic laboratories, and one  county public health agency. We also interviewed other individuals  involved in the outbreaks, including researchers from Northwestern  University, the University of California at Davis, and Western University of  Health Sciences.

In addition, we chose these four  outbreaks for review because of the unique nature of the outbreaks in  these states. Specifically, we selected Michigan as the state for the bovine  tuberculosis review because the ongoing outbreak is the longest outbreak  of this disease in the United States in recent history. We chose California  because it experienced the greatest number of animal infections for the  exotic Newcastle disease outbreak. We selected Wisconsin because it  experienced the most human monkeypox infections. We selected  Colorado for West Nile virus because the number of human infections in  Colorado in 2003 was the highest for a single state. In addition to the  interviews, we also analyzed federal, state, and county documents, such as  after action reports, in order to (1) understand the extent to which  agencies formally assessed the management of their veterinarian  workforces during these outbreaks and (2) identify any workforce-related  challenges and steps agencies took to address these challenges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Agriculture", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Department of Agriculture\u2019s  letter dated January 16, 2009."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.

While we recognize that each  outbreak is unique, this should not preclude USDA from identifying a  plausible scenario or scenarios and detailing how a vaccinate to live  strategy would be carried out in order to enhance preparation,  response, and recovery in a time of crises.  4.  We modified our report to reflect that USDA would like to change their  statement from FSIS has \u201cnever\u201d had a sufficient number of  veterinarians to \u201cover the past decade.\u201d USDA also asserts that our  report says that FSIS has been able to reallocate veterinary resources  sufficient to meet its statutory mandates for food safety and humane  handling of livestock. However, our report only presents this as the  view of FSIS headquarters officials. We raise this point to illustrate  that FSIS headquarters officials and veterinarians working in slaughter  plants differ on the impact of this shortage.  5.  We modified our report to reflect more clearly the relationship  between the events at a Chino, California, plant and the February 2008  beef recall.  6.  USDA commented that that our report emphasizes the incident at a  plant in Chino, California. We raise the point because some  veterinarians told us they did not have time to ensure the humane  treatment of livestock, and this example illustrates inhumane  treatment occurred despite the presence of FSIS inspectors. USDA  further commented that we attribute this incident to having only one  veterinarian. We do not state this in our report. We use this and other  statements about resources to illustrate the need for FSIS to  periodically assess whether the level of resources dedicated to humane  handling and slaughter activities is sufficient. They have yet to do so.  In addition, USDA commented that the USDA Inspector General did  not find systematic problems associated with oversight of humane  handling at slaughter facilities that process cull cows. However, the  Inspector General did conclude that there is inherent vulnerability at  the other plants in the scope of its audit, and that inhumane handling  could occur and not be detected by FSIS inspectors due to lack of  continuous surveillance.  7.  USDA commented that GAO has closed the 2004 recommendation that  FSIS periodically assess whether the level of resources dedicated to  humane handling and slaughter activities is sufficient. We recognize  that FSIS has taken actions in response to a number of  recommendations made in the 2004 report and have documented  implementation of these recommendations. However, with regard to  periodic assessment, we closed this recommendation because enough  time had passed that we considered it unlikely to be implemented. As  our report states, FSIS has yet to demonstrate that it has been  implemented. Based on our current work, we continue to believe that  periodic assessment is needed, and we make a recommendation to that  effect.  8.  We modified our report to include the recent approval of USDA\u2019s  direct-hire authority and noted that USDA has raised some concerns.  9.

HHS commented that a premise of our report is that the control of  zoonotic diseases is solely dependent on the capacity of the  veterinarian workforce. Our report does not state this.

Our report does not identify the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (CDC) as having too few veterinarians to control the 2003  West Nile virus outbreak while also adequately carrying out other  routine activities. However, CDC officials we interviewed who were  involved with the 2003 monkeypox outbreak in Wisconsin told us there  were too few veterinarians during this outbreak.  3.  We modified our report to reflect the new information about the  difficulty the National Institutes of Health has recruiting veterinarians.  4.  Our report states conclusions from the FDA Advisory Committee  report: that FDA \u201ccannot fulfill its mission\u201d because its scientific  workforce has remained static while its workload has increased, and  that FDA\u2019s Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) is \u201cin a state of  crisis.\u201d We discussed with an author of the Advisory Committee report  how that report\u2019s findings specifically related to veterinarians.  Consequently, our report also states that an author of the FDA  Advisory Committee report told us that veterinarians enter FDA  employment lacking necessary skills and experience to examine the  wide variety of veterinary products that require FDA approval and that  FDA needs to better train its veterinarians to review the many diverse  products under its jurisdiction. HHS further stated that CVM has made  great strides in the past few years in assessing its workforce needs and  that the conclusions of the Advisory Committee report are out of date.  Our report identifies several of the efforts CVM has recently  undertaken, such as hiring additional veterinarians and beginning  efforts to analyze the gap between current resources and needs. It also  notes that, according to FDA officials, the agency is undertaking  significant reforms to address fundamental concerns in the 2007  report. However, as our report states, FDA did not tell us how these  efforts address the identified veterinarian skill gap specifically.  5.
