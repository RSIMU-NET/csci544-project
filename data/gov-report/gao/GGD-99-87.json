These reserves are held in trust for policyholders, much like bank deposits are held for depositors. While there are important similarities between insurance companies and other financial intermediaries, there are important differences as well. One difference is that policy reserves are paid out when policyholders experience an insured loss. Thus, policyholders may get back more or less than they paid the insurance company. This is unlike a bank deposit, where bank depositors can expect to get their deposits, plus interest. A similarity between insurance companies and banks is that both use the money they receive to purchase income-earning assets until the money is needed. Furthermore, like banks and securities dealers, insurance companies are regulated to ensure that the money they collect now will be available to meet later obligations. To a large extent, it is the delayed delivery of the contracted product that makes the importance of addressing Year 2000 issues particularly acute in the financial services industry in general and in the insurance industry in particular.", "The Year 2000 problem exists because the data that computers store and process often use only the last two digits to designate the year. On January 1, 2000, such systems may mistake data referring to 2000 as meaning 1900, possibly leading to numerous errors and disruptions in processing. Financial services institutions are especially dependent upon the accurate transmission of electronic information; thus, the systems they use must be readied to correctly process 2000 dates.", "To provide a standard gauge for assessing the progress of federal agencies in becoming prepared for the Year 2000 date change, we issued guidance in 1997. While this Assessment Guide is directed specifically at federal agencies, the stages of Year 2000 preparation and corresponding milestones can generally be applied to all institutions, including private companies. The Assessment Guide discusses issues that are common to nearly all companies, as well as to the federal agencies, and can be used as a general measure of whether a company is on track to being prepared for the Year 2000 date change. Thus, a regulator of financial institutions could use this, or other similar guidance, as general criteria for assessing the state of preparedness of its regulated institutions.", "The Assessment Guide divides the process by which an institution could become Year 2000 compliant into five phases\u2014awareness, assessment, renovation, validation, and implementation. Each of these phases is described in appendix I. The final deadline for becoming ready for 2000 is immovable. Furthermore, since the phases of preparation are sequential, it is important to establish intermediate milestones to help ensure that a company will be able to complete all Year 2000 preparations in time. A schedule for measuring progress toward Year 2000 readiness could allow regulators a degree of comfort concerning the status of their regulated companies. As shown in table 1, the Assessment Guide provides a schedule of suggested completion dates for each of the key phases of Year 2000 conversion.", "Other parties have developed alternative sets of phases and milestones. Subsequent to the issuance of our Assessment Guide, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provided standards that federal agencies are expected to follow. OMB\u2019s milestones begin with the assessment phase, which was to be completed by June 30, 1997, followed by renovation, validation (internal testing), and implementation. All entities are to have completed the implementation phase by March 31, 1999. After that date, entities are to be engaged in testing of business processes and planning for contingencies. Throughout the remainder of this report, actions by insurance regulators are compared to the guidance found in our Assessment Guide.", "Year 2000-related system malfunctions in an insurance company can have serious business interruptions and even solvency implications. Specifically, Year 2000 problems could result in disruptions to processing policyholder payments and investments, insurance claims and payments, annuity payments, and data queries to verify insurance coverage. This means that some policyholders may be unable to obtain policy service, or worse, may be unable to collect on their policies at a time of need. It is also possible that the delivery of health care services could be affected if health insurers cannot readily process claims information.", "Pursuant to the McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945, states exercise primary regulatory jurisdiction over the insurance business. Each state has a department of insurance that, among other things, is responsible for monitoring insurance companies\u2019 solvency. Solvency, in turn, can be affected by operational issues, such as the failure to be ready for 2000.", "Companies that operate and write insurance policies in multiple states comprise much of the nation\u2019s insurance industry. Although an insurance company can conduct business in multiple states, it is incorporated, or chartered, under the laws of a single state, which is referred to as its state of domicile. The regulator in an insurer\u2019s state of domicile represents its primary regulator and is to assume lead responsibility for oversight issues, such as Year 2000 readiness. States where insurers are licensed to operate (but not chartered) generally rely on the companies\u2019 primary regulator to exercise due diligence in overseeing domiciled companies and to voluntarily share information about them."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Role of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners", "paragraphs": ["NAIC is a voluntary association of the heads of each state insurance department, the District of Columbia, and four U.S. territories.

We also visited 17 state insurance departments whose domiciliary companies collectively accounted for 75 percent of insurance sold nationally. In late January 1999, we surveyed these 17 state regulators to obtain an update on their Year 2000 oversight activities, including their efforts to set priorities for reviewing domiciled insurers. Unless otherwise indicated, observations throughout this report regarding state efforts and activities pertain specifically to the 17 states included in our review.

We also used information gathered and knowledge developed by our other teams that had conducted reviews of the Year 2000 preparedness of the banking and securities industries. Finally, we obtained updates on the status of various Year 2000 oversight activities, including conducting examinations that focus specifically on Year 2000 issues (referred to as Year 2000 targeted examinations) and monitoring companies\u2019 actions to test their systems\u2019 readiness.", "To determine the status of the insurance industry\u2019s Year 2000 readiness, we interviewed regulatory officials who were responsible for Year 2000 oversight in the 17 states and reviewed available documentation on the readiness of the industry. To obtain additional insights regarding the readiness of the insurance industry, we interviewed representatives of key rating companies, including A.M. Best Company, Conning and Company, Standard and Poor\u2019s, and Weiss Ratings, Inc., and reviewed their pertinent studies and reports issued in the area. We also spoke with representatives of and reviewed Year 2000-related documents from a few consulting and research firms, including the Gartner Group, which is a business and technology advisory company that conducts research on the global state of Year 2000 readiness, and Electronic Data Systems (EDS), which is a professional services firm that, among other things, assists financial services companies with becoming ready for 2000.", "To obtain industry perspectives regarding Year 2000 issues, particularly those involving potential liability exposures, we spoke with several of the largest property-casualty insurers and trade associations, including the Alliance of American Insurers, American Insurance Association, National Association of Independent Insurers, and National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies. Among other things, we inquired about these entities\u2019 efforts to determine the nature and scope of potential liability exposures related to 2000. Finally, we reviewed available literature on various aspects of the Year 2000 liability exposure issue, reviewed relevant federal legislative proposals, and obtained related opinions from officials of the American Bar Association\u2019s Tort and Insurance Practice Section.", "We did our work in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards between September 1998 and April 1999. We requested comments on a draft of this report from the President and other officials of NAIC. NAIC\u2019s written comments are included in appendix III and discussed near the end of this letter.

Such variations raise a question about the extent to which states can rely on one another\u2019s judgments regarding the preparedness of nondomiciled companies doing business in their states. This would be especially problematic when relying on states where the level of Year 2000 oversight activity is relatively limited or the criteria for assessing readiness may be considered too lax.

Which of these activities each state insurance regulator engaged in, and to what extent, varied. The variation ranged from a few states that had actively promoted insurers\u2019 Year 2000 readiness since mid-1997 to a few states that did little in the area until the latter part of 1998 when they conducted their first surveys. A company identified as being behind at this late date could have more difficulty completing all of the necessary phases of its Year 2000 preparations in time.", "Although they did not initiate Year 2000 oversight actions until 1997, after the time frame suggested in the Assessment Guide for conducting awareness efforts, 2 of the 17 states we visited were comparatively more active than the other 15 in their efforts to ensure that insurance companies become Year 2000 ready. One state regulator stated that it monitored the Year 2000 progress of companies it supervises primarily through quarterly Year 2000 reports that were required since the beginning of 1998 and through targeted Year 2000 examinations that have been conducted since mid-1998. According to state officials, these efforts were conducted by state examiners who had drawn heavily from the expertise, guidance, and training of federal banking regulators.", "Another state regulator also more actively monitored insurers\u2019 Year 2000 readiness, but used a different approach. In 1997, it hired a contractor to assist with developing, administering, and analyzing a comprehensive, technical survey of about 2,000 insurers (both domiciled and nondomiciled) regarding their Year 2000 preparations. State officials explained that companies were assigned risk scores that were based on an analysis of their survey responses along with various financial and operational factors. This state\u2019s regulatory staff, subsequently supplemented by an available pool of about 20 consultants, has been reviewing hundreds of remediation plans for companies identified as having problems with their Year 2000 efforts, working with these companies to develop or refine their plans, and conducting Year 2000 targeted examinations. These consultants were also to be used to assist company management in correcting system problems.", "Other state regulators indicated that they focused primarily on occasional surveys or more limited coverage of Year 2000 plans during regular financial examinations, which are to be conducted every 3 to 5 years. One state regulator said it attempted to consistently inquire about Year 2000 issues during informal conferences with company management. Another state regulator indicated that it was focusing its Year 2000 oversight efforts almost exclusively on conducting surveys of its regulated companies. At the time of our review, this state had administered two Year 2000 surveys that requested companies to generally address a few broad areas, such as the estimated impact of the potential Year 2000 problem on their operations, their conversion plans, and their current status of readiness.", "After experiencing some difficulty administering a survey in 1997, another state regulator said it decided, in early 1998, to conduct targeted Year 2000 examinations in lieu of administering additional surveys or covering the area during regular financial examinations. This state, however, was unable to start its targeted examinations until September 1998. Five of the 17 states we visited did not attempt to develop baseline information on the readiness of their insurance companies until the latter part of 1998, when they conducted their first Year 2000 surveys.", "Because of the fast-approaching Year 2000 deadline and in an attempt to make up for lost time, some state insurance regulators were beginning to intensify their oversight efforts while there was still a possibility of mitigating possible disruptions.

Responses to our survey indicated that state regulators varied in how they assessed and prioritized companies for Year 2000 purposes\u2014that is, they used different sources of information, review criteria, and regulatory actions to handle identified high-priority insurers.", "The information that state insurance regulators obtained from their diverse oversight activities can be characterized by varying degrees of credibility. For example, information obtained from an on-site targeted examination conducted by information specialists would be more credible than information obtained from unverified, self-reported insurer responses to a Year 2000 survey. At the time of our review, the state regulators said they used the following sources of information to prioritize companies in terms of their Year 2000 readiness: survey responses; Year 2000 plans; Year 2000 quarterly reports; regular financial examinations with some questions directed to Year 2000 issues; and, in one case, Year 2000 targeted examinations. Eight of the 17 states we visited (representing 24.5 percent of the total market share) indicated that they used survey responses as their primary means for prioritizing companies. Two state regulators said that they had not yet prioritized their companies for Year 2000 oversight purposes when we conducted our survey in late January 1999, but that they were waiting for additional Year 2000 information from their contractors.", "State regulators also used different criteria to assess and prioritize companies for Year 2000 oversight purposes. The most stringent criteria used by the regulators we visited to identify \u201cpriority 1\u201d companies included those companies not expected to be compliant by January 1999. The least stringent criteria used to identify priority 1 companies included only those companies that were not expected to be Year 2000 compliant by December 1999 and that had not developed a contingency plan. Other criteria were broad and vague, such as criteria that simply described priority 1 companies as those that did not adequately address or allocate resources to Year 2000 preparations. Over half of the states surveyed indicated that priority 1 companies were those that would become compliant after June 1999 or that were still in remediation (i.e., in the process of making system changes to become Year 2000 ready) after December 1998. Some states said they identified as priority 1 companies insurers that did not respond to Year 2000 surveys or that did not have formal Year 2000 plans. A few state regulators noted that they also considered the companies\u2019 market share and overall financial condition when they prioritized companies for Year 2000 oversight purposes.", "As shown in figure 1, 11 percent of the insurance companies domiciled in the states that we surveyed were identified as priority 1 companies for Year 2000 oversight purposes. Appendix IV provides a breakdown, by type, of priority 1 companies relative to total insurance companies. Appendix V provides a breakdown, by size, of priority 1 companies relative to industrywide data.", "Most of the state regulators indicated that they were in the process of conducting targeted Year 2000 examinations for all insurers identified as priority 1 companies.

This question of information reliability can pose a challenge for state regulators that depend on one another for supervisory information on the Year 2000 status of their nondomiciled companies. Another related challenge to state regulators involves industry concerns regarding the confidentiality of information on insurers\u2019 Year 2000 readiness. Finally, the regulators, and ultimately the public, lack a comprehensive framework for fully assessing the status of the insurance industry\u2019s Year 2000 readiness due, in part, to different oversight approaches at the state level.", "Most state regulators we surveyed indicated that they were concerned about the Year 2000 readiness of nondomiciled insurance companies, especially those that do a significant amount of business in their states. The two more active states previously noted said that they were attempting to oversee their nondomiciled insurers in a manner similar to their domiciled insurers. A third state, according to an official, was asking its nondomiciled insurers to confirm whether their projected Year 2000 compliance dates were being met. Most of the remaining states we surveyed said they were relying on the oversight and due diligence of the states of domicile to ensure that their regulated insurers would be Year 2000 ready. For example, a few state regulators said they sent letters to selected state regulators to inquire about the readiness of specific insurers in which they were interested. Other regulators noted that they would depend on informal contacts with the other states, information sharing through NAIC, or the initiative of the states of domicile to alert them about any potential Year 2000 problems involving insurers that do business in their states.", "Industry concerns regarding confidentiality posed a challenge to state regulators that are dependent upon one another for supervisory information on Year 2000 readiness. During the past several months, NAIC, state regulators, and the industry have grappled with how to adequately safeguard potentially proprietary information while facilitating information sharing among regulators, which is critical to overseeing the readiness for the Year 2000 date change within the industry. In February 1999, NAIC finalized a standard form, to be used at the states\u2019 discretion, to facilitate information sharing and protect confidentiality.

These efforts typically took the form of questionnaires to insurers inquiring about their state of preparedness. NAIC began discussing Year 2000 issues in its quarterly national meetings in early 1997. Since that time NAIC indicated that it has used its quarterly meetings as a forum for raising regulator and industry awareness and for sharing information on Year 2000 efforts.

Broadscale tests are to demonstrate whether, after all of the preparations, an entire integrated segment of a financial sector could continue to operate and interact together. Broadscale testing, however, does not cover the potential impact of third-party systems (e.g., those of vendors or infrastructure industries, such as power and communications) that are in some way linked to the institutions nor does it provide information about contingency planning.", "The structure of the securities industry and, to a lesser extent, of the banking industry lends itself to broadscale testing because there is a significant amount of interconnectedness among industry participants (i.e., industry interdependence that is based on extensive transactions and system links between and among companies in a particular industry).

As a result, examinations represent the primary means for insurance regulators to verify the Year 2000 readiness of their companies.", "To validate the progress and status of their regulated institutions, banking regulators rely primarily on examinations targeted directly at issues related to Year 2000 problems. The first round of such examinations began in May 1997. As of April 1999, regulators had completed their second round of targeted examinations. Bank regulators told us that every institution has now been examined twice for Year 2000 progress.

Furthermore, regulators plan to return to or contact institutions where questions on the adequacy of their progress remain. Indeed, OCC plans to complete, by July 1999, a third round of on-site examinations of all institutions for which it has supervisory responsibility.", "The federal banking regulators have also encouraged depository institutions to participate in broadscale testing efforts.

The reviews focused on the firms\u2019 timetables for completing and testing their Year 2000 corrections. Similar reviews were conducted for selected transfer agents and broker-dealers. Firms whose timetable lagged significantly behind SEC\u2019s guidance (e.g., that all corrections be completed by December 31, 1998, reserving 1999 for testing) were given a deficiency letter regarding their delay.", "In addition to SEC examinations, the self-regulatory organizations have conducted ongoing monitoring of their members through telephone contacts. However, unlike banking regulators who said they had conducted examinations of every institution, SEC and the self-regulatory organizations have not examined and do not plan to examine every regulated entity.

In December 1997, NAIC approved the addition of nine questions on Year 2000 preparations to the Financial Examiners Handbook, which is the required audit guide used by insurance examiners in all states. Most states we contacted said they began coverage of their regulated insurance companies during regularly scheduled financial examinations starting in early 1998. However, state insurance regulators require routine financial examinations once every 3 to 5 years. By the beginning of 2000, many companies\u2019 last regular examination would not have included questions on Year 2000 preparedness. Recognizing this Year 2000 oversight limitation, some state regulators said they have begun or are considering incorporating targeted Year 2000 examinations into their validation programs. One state said it began conducting such examinations in mid-1998. Several more state regulators said they began targeted examinations late in 1998, and others indicated they had either just begun or plan to begin targeted examinations during 1999. Three other states we visited were uncertain as to whether targeted examinations were needed. Representatives of 4 of the 17 state insurance departments we visited told us that they did not plan to conduct targeted examinations. Eight states that were conducting or planning to conduct targeted examinations had no plans to examine all domiciled institutions. Instead, they said their goal was to examine only companies believed to pose the greatest risk.

As previously mentioned, banking regulators have set milestones and formally notified banking institutions about when they were expected to have completed certain phases of Year 2000 conversion. Banking regulators have also developed a uniform examination rating system for Year 2000 readiness that they used to help identify when regulatory intervention was warranted. In addition, the banking regulators have included enforcement actions in their Year 2000 supervision program to prompt remedial action by financial institutions that are not making adequate progress. Using these mechanisms, the banking regulators were able to initiate formal actions against some institutions, as early as November 1997, for failing to make adequate progress toward becoming Year 2000 ready.", "SEC recently proposed actions that may be taken if securities market participants are not deemed to be ready for 2000.

Conversely, those seeking coverage for losses are expected to argue that specific Year 2000-related mishaps and their associated losses were unforeseen despite reasonable efforts to prepare for the event, or their losses were so unusual that they were not to be expected.", "Insurance coverage also depends on what event \u201ctriggers\u201d coverage. Under some types of policies, coverage would depend on the point in time that the covered event occurred. For instance, in disputes concerning computer users, sellers, servicers, and manufacturers, there may be questions as to whether the event causing Year 2000-related damages occurred when a system was manufactured or distributed, a system was installed, a Year 2000-related problem was noticed, or damages were incurred. If disputes over insurance coverage are based on trigger issues, the courts may have to decide when coverage was activated for a particular policy. Until these and other questions are addressed in the context of the Year 2000 event, insurers will continue to have difficulties estimating related liabilities.", "Estimating the magnitude of insurers\u2019 exposures due to the Year 2000 event is also difficult because of the variety of issues and litigants that could be involved in potential lawsuits. As Year 2000 disputes emerge, insurance coverage issues will surface as plantiffs and defendants alike try to recoup alleged losses from insurers. Insurance industry observers frequently categorize anticipated Year 2000-related lawsuits into three \u201cwaves\u201d of litigation over: (1) costs to become Year 2000 compliant, (2) losses resulting from Year 2000 problems, and (3) coverage for Year 2000- related losses.

In addition, industry representatives and legal experts agree that lawsuits between insurers and policyholders could result from insurers denying coverage.", "Further complicating the ability of insurers to estimate their exposures for the Year 2000 event are the potential legal costs, including those arising in connection with insurers\u2019 general duty to defend policyholders against liability suits.

Some experts have expressed uncertainty over whether courts will uphold the Year 2000 exclusions due to public policy concerns. Moreover, where such exclusions are upheld, specific coverage questions could remain as courts typically interpret exclusions narrowly. Some insurance and legal professionals also have said that the use of an exclusion could be viewed as evidence that a standard policy without the exclusion was intended to cover losses from a Year 2000 failure. To avoid this risk, some insurers have opted not to use exclusions, emphasizing that their policies have never covered direct Year 2000 losses. Nevertheless, insurance professionals explained that standard policies may cover losses arising in connection with a Year 2000-related mishap that causes an insured event resulting in a loss, such as a fire or an auto accident, irrespective of whether the incident was caused by a Year 2000 glitch. For instance, a standard automobile policy may not cover expenses to fix a car that failed because of a Year 2000 problem, but the policy could cover damages for an accident caused by a Year 2000-related vehicle malfunction.", "Some insurers are also attempting to mitigate their liability exposures through more stringent underwriting practices and educational programs that encourage policyholders to prepare their operations and contingency plans for the Year 2000 event.

Among those actions were NAIC\u2019s August 1997 survey, which was its first attempt to formally notify insurance companies about the Year 2000 problem and to encourage state regulators to take action. Similar actions were taken by banking and securities regulators beginning in 1996.

NAIC also did not issue Year 2000 guidance, including recommended regulatory and industry expectations, until September 1998. At that time, the guidance was disseminated to the state regulators but not necessarily to all insurance companies. Finally, state insurance regulators were generally less prepared than the other financial regulators to pursue formal enforcement actions against identified problem companies due, in part, to the lack of clearly established and well- communicated expectations (e.g., milestone dates for specific phases of the Year 2000 conversion) for insurers.", "State regulators and industry observers report that the insurance industry is in reasonably good condition with respect to Year 2000 readiness.

Ultimately, insurers\u2019 Year 2000-related liability exposures will depend on decisions made to resolve key legal questions and numerous pending legislative initiatives.

However, based on the suggested milestones in our Assessment Guide, as well as our comparison of insurance regulators to other financial regulators, we continue to believe that regulatory efforts to oversee the insurance industry\u2019s Year 2000 readiness began late and have generally been limited. Specifically, the state insurance regulators we visited were less active in their efforts to promote Year 2000 readiness and efforts to validate information on the status of companies\u2019 readiness. They were also less active in planning for and pursuing formal enforcement actions against companies identified as inadequately preparing for Year 2000 and at a high risk of not being ready for the millenium change. In addition, NAIC was generally late in providing information and guidance to state regulators about the appropriate Year 2000 regulatory activities to undertake. Our concern is that, given the time-consuming process of becoming Year 2000 ready, any company identified by regulators at this late date as being behind could have difficulty completing all of the necessary phases of its Year 2000 preparations in time.", "NAIC also stated that much of the data used to develop the draft report was out of date, citing, for example, NAIC\u2019s recent initiative to coordinate a focused review of nationally significant companies. As discussed in the scope and methodology of this report, our noted observations are based on actions taken by state insurance regulators through January 1999. As the Year 2000 deadline approaches, NAIC\u2019s most recent initiatives, such as the focused review of nationally significant companies, may offer a practical approach to ensuring the readiness of the nation\u2019s largest insurance companies. NAIC projected that the first phase of this initiative will be completed by mid-May, with preliminary results to follow. We plan to address the results of this initiative as well as other NAIC and state regulatory actions when we provide you with updated information on the insurance industry\u2019s Year 2000 readiness as requested in your March 11, 1999, letter.", "In addition, NAIC noted that our draft report reflected dates when policies were adopted by NAIC, but did not recognize the many meetings and discussions among regulators, industry, and trade associations that led to the adoption of a policy. In this report, we acknowledged that preliminary meetings to discuss and develop policies provided a mechanism among regulators and the companies involved for raising awareness and promoting a dialogue about important issues, such as preparing for 2000. However, we focused on the date that a policy was formally adopted by NAIC, rather than on the beginning of discussion. Formal adoption of a policy is a more relevant date because it signifies when agreement is reached and actions are expected to commence.", "Finally, NAIC acknowledged that the state insurance regulators have developed different approaches to addressing Year 2000 problems, but NAIC viewed these oversight variations to be a significant advantage for state regulators. In our view, variation in the regulatory oversight of Year 2000 preparations across states is a concern because of the high degree of interdependency required by the state-by-state regulatory system. We found that state regulators depend on each other for the regulation of nondomiciled companies.
