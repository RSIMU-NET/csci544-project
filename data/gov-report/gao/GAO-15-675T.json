Most  agencies agreed with our recommendations or had no comment.", "Software Licensing: An additional area of concern is agencies\u2019  management of their software licenses. We recently reported on federal  agencies\u2019 management of software licenses and determined that better  management was needed to achieve significant savings government- wide. In particular, 22 of the 24 major agencies identified in the Chief  Financial Officers Act of 1990 did not have comprehensive license  policies, and only 2 had comprehensive license inventories. As a result,  agencies\u2019 oversight of software license spending was limited or lacking,  and thus they may miss out on savings. The potential savings could be  significant considering that, in fiscal year 2012, one major federal agency  reported saving approximately $181 million by consolidating its enterprise  license agreements, even though its oversight process was ad hoc.", "We recommended that OMB issue needed guidance to agencies and  made more than 130 recommendations to the agencies to improve their  policies and practices for managing software licenses. OMB disagreed  with the need for guidance. However, without such guidance, agencies  will likely continue to lack the visibility into what needs to be managed.

Both a 2011 executive order and  OMB\u2019s 2012 Digital Government Strategy call for agencies to, among  other things, take steps to ensure they are not paying for unused or  underused mobile devices and services and to move toward an  enterprise-wide model for purchasing these devices and services in order  to reduce costs. However, in May of this year we reported that agencies  need to implement more effective controls on their mobile devices and  services in order to realize potential cost savings. Specifically, most of  the 15 agencies we reviewed did not have an inventory of mobile devices  and associated services that can be used to assess device usage, and  only 1 of the 15 agencies had documented procedures for monitoring  spending by reviewing devices and associated service plans for overuse,  underuse, or zero use. A key reason for these weaknesses was that  agencies took a decentralized approach to managing mobile device  spending. We also noted that OMB had not measured progress toward its  stated goal of achieving financial savings related to mobile devices and  services.", "Highlighting the potential for savings in this area, agencies reported  paying a range of rates per line for various service combinations, from  $21 for 200 voice minutes, unlimited data, and 200 text messages, to  $122 for unlimited voice, data, and text messages. Agencies also paid  different rates for the same bundle of services. For example, for the  unlimited voice, text, and data bundles, agencies paid between $69 and  $122 per month.", "Accordingly, we recommended that the agencies in our review take  actions to improve their inventories and control processes and that OMB  measure and report progress in achieving mobile cost savings.

The self- assessment is to be updated on an annual basis thereafter.", "Additionally, the proposed guidance reiterates OMB\u2019s existing guidance  on PortfolioStat, the IT Dashboard, and the federal data center  consolidation initiative, and expands its existing guidance on TechStat  sessions.

These include  implementing the recently enacted statutory requirements promoting IT  acquisition reform, as well as implementing GAO\u2019s previous  recommendations, such as updating the public version of the IT  Dashboard throughout the year. As noted in that report, from October  2009 through December 2014, we made 737 recommendations to  improve agencies\u2019 management of their IT acquisitions; however, as of  January 2015, only about 23 percent of these had been fully  implemented.", "Also in our high-risk report, we stated that OMB and agencies should  demonstrate measurable government-wide progress in the following key  areas:", "OMB and agencies should, within 4 years, implement at least 80  percent of GAO\u2019s recommendations related to the management of IT  acquisitions and operations.", "Agencies should ensure that a minimum of 80 percent of the  government\u2019s major acquisitions deliver functionality every 12 months.", "Agencies should achieve no less than 80 percent of the planned  PortfolioStat savings and 80 percent of the savings planned for data  center consolidation.", "In summary, with the recent passage of IT reform legislation, the federal  government has an opportunity to improve the transparency and  management of IT acquisition and operations, and strengthen the  authority of CIOs to provide needed direction and oversight. OMB and  federal agencies should expeditiously implement the requirements of the  legislation and continue to implement our previous recommendations. To  help ensure that these improvements are achieved, continued  congressional oversight of OMB\u2019s and agencies\u2019 implementation efforts is  essential.", "Chairmen Hurd and Meadows, Ranking Members Kelly and Connolly,  and Members of the Subcommittees, this completes my prepared  statement.
