Most geoengineering proposals fall into two categories: carbon dioxide removal (CDR), which would remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, and solar radiation management (SRM), which would offset temperature increases by reflecting sunlight back into space. GAO was asked to examine (1) the state of geoengineering science, (2) federal involvement in geoengineering, and (3) the views of experts and federal officials about the extent to which federal laws and international agreements apply to geoengineering, and any governance challenges. GAO examined relevant scientific and policy studies, relevant domestic laws and international agreements, analyzed agency data describing relevant research for fiscal years 2009 and 2010, and interviewed federal officials and selected recognized experts in the field."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Few geoengineering experiments or modeling studies have been conducted, and major uncertainties remain on the efficacy and potential consequences of geoengineering approaches. GAO's review of relevant studies and discussions with selected experts indicated that relatively more laboratory and field research relevant to certain CDR approaches exists, although most of this research was not designed to apply to geoengineering. In contrast, few modeling studies or field experiments have focused on SRM approaches, according to experts and recent studies. Experts identified only one SRM field experiment with published results--a 2009 Russian experiment that injected aerosols into the middle troposphere to measure their reflectivity. Experts, as well as relevant studies, identified several major uncertainties in need of further investigation for CDR and SRM. Federal agencies identified 52 research activities, totaling about $100.9 million, relevant to geoengineering during fiscal years 2009 and 2010. GAO's analysis found that 43 activities, totaling about $99 million, focused either on mitigation strategies or basic science. Most of the research focused on mitigation efforts, such as geological sequestration of CO2, which were identified as relevant to CDR approaches but not designed to address them directly. GAO found that nine activities, totaling about $1.9 million, directly investigated SRM or less conventional CDR approaches. Officials from interagency bodies coordinating federal responses to climate change indicated that their offices have not developed a coordinated strategy, and believe that, due to limited federal investment, it is premature to coordinate geoengineering activities. However, federal officials also noted that a large share of existing federal climate science research could be relevant to geoengineering. Agencies requested roughly $2 billion for such activities in fiscal year 2010. Without a coordinated federal strategy for geoengineering, it is difficult for agencies to determine the extent of relevant research, and policymakers may lack key information to inform subsequent decisions on geoengineering and existing climate science efforts. According to legal experts and federal officials, the extent to which federal laws and international agreements apply to geoengineering is unclear. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has taken steps to regulate one CDR approach and has determined that it has sufficient authority to regulate two other approaches. EPA officials said EPA has not assessed the applicability of other laws because geoengineering research is in its initial stages. Similarly, legal experts and Department of State officials said that, except for three instances, parties to international agreements have not addressed their agreements' applicability to geoengineering, largely due to limited geoengineering activity and awareness of the issue. Legal experts' and officials' views differed on the best approach for international governance, but generally agreed that the federal government should take a coordinated, interagency approach on domestic regulation. Experts and officials also identified governance challenges, such as the need to address liability."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that within the Executive Office of the President, the appropriate entities, such as the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), establish a clear strategy for geoengineering research in the context of the federal response to climate change to ensure a coordinated federal approach.

Furthermore, NRC previously reported that human alterations  of the climate system may increase the possibility of large and abrupt  regional or global climatic events. NRC also found that because abrupt  climate changes of the past have not yet been fully explained, future  abrupt changes cannot be predicted, and climate surprises are to be  expected.", "Ocean acidification is defined by the Royal Society as a decrease in the pH of sea water  due to the uptake of carbon dioxide produced as a result of human activity. or limit the negative effects of climate change\u2014also known as mitigation.

At the same  time, some scientists and nongovernmental organizations have raised  concerns that exploration of geoengineering as a policy option could  further decrease incentives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.", "A September 2009 study from the Royal Society divided most  geoengineering proposals into two main categories: carbon dioxide  removal (CDR) and solar radiation management (SRM). CDR addresses  what scientists currently view as the root cause of climate change by  removing CO For example, one approach to CDR  would be to enhance the biological processes for removal and storage of  CO by microorganisms in the ocean. In contrast, SRM offsets temperature  increases by reflecting a small percentage of the sun\u2019s light back into  space. For example, one SRM approach would be to add reflective  particles to the upper atmosphere to reflect incoming sunlight back into  space. More recently, NRC addressed geoengineering in a series of studies  requested by Congress, collectively titled America\u2019s Climate Choices. In  addressing the subject of geoengineering, NRC utilized the Royal Society\u2019s  definition and categorization of geoengineering approaches, but noted that  there is no consensus regarding the extent to which the term  geoengineering should be applied to various widely accepted practices  that remove CO  According to the Royal Society, CDR would work more slowly than SRM  to reduce global temperatures but, with some exceptions, would involve  fewer potential environmental risks. This is because CDR is intended to  return the climate closer to its preindustrial state by reducing atmospheric  concentrations of CO. In contrast, the study reported that SRM would  begin to reduce temperatures more quickly than CDR, but would create an  artificial and approximate balance between increased atmospheric  greenhouse gas concentrations and reduced sunlight. This artificial state  would introduce additional environmental risks and require long-term  maintenance. Additionally, SRM approaches generally have greater  potential to cause uneven environmental impacts beyond national or  regional boundaries. This creates social, ethical, legal, and political  implications that should be addressed before many of the SRM  technologies are implemented on a large scale, according to the Royal  Society.", "The House Committee on Science and Technology held hearings on  geoengineering science and governance issues, and as part of those  hearings, the committee asked expert witnesses to testify about the extent  of existing geoengineering research and areas where additional study is  needed to better understand geoengineering approaches and their  potential impacts. In March 2010, we provided preliminary observations on  our work to the committee as part of these hearings. Additionally, due to  the interest of the committee and the strategic relevance of this topic, we  have initiated a technology assessment on geoengineering.   Internationally, the European Union has initiated a research program to  study the scientific issues, as well as the policy implications of SRM  geoengineering approaches.  Furthermore, some nongovernmental  organizations have begun to examine the scientific and policy issues  surrounding geoengineering.", "Within this context, you asked us to review geoengineering. Our objectives  were to examine (1) the general state of the science regarding  geoengineering approaches and their potential effects; (2) the extent to  which the federal government is sponsoring or participating in  geoengineering research or deployment; and (3) the views of legal experts  and federal officials about the extent to which federal laws and  international agreements apply to geoengineering activities, and  associated challenges, if any, to geoengineering governance.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed relevant studies from peer- reviewed journals, law reviews, scientific organizations, and  nongovernmental organizations related to geoengineering. We also  selected 10 knowledgeable scientific or policy experts and 8 legal experts  to interview based on criteria, including participation in one of several  expert panels related to geoengineering, the number of articles authored in  peer-reviewed journals or law reviews, and recommendations from other  recognized experts in their respective fields. To determine the extent to  which the federal government is sponsoring or participating in  geoengineering research or deployment, we provided a document defining  geoengineering and describing proposed geoengineering approaches  based on the Royal Society study to officials from the 13 USGCRP- participating agencies, and asked them to identify relevant federal  activities during fiscal years 2009 and 2010 that fit these descriptions.  Because the federal government does not have a formal policy on  geoengineering, we relied on agency officials\u2019 professional judgment to  identify relevant activities. We collected these data through July 2010. We  analyzed the officials\u2019 responses and removed 12 activities that did not  appear related to geoengineering based on the definition we provided.  We then categorized the remaining activities into three broad types: ( 1)  activities related to conventional carbon mitigation efforts that are directly  applicable to a proposed geoengineering approach, although not  designated as such; (2) activities related to improving basic scientific  understanding of earth systems, processes, or technologies that could be  applied generally to geoengineering; and (3) activities designed specifically  to address a proposed geoengineering approach that does not overlap with  a conventional carbon mitigation strategy. In addition, we met with  officials and staff from interagency bodies coordinating federal responses  to climate change, including OSTP, CEQ, and USGCRP, as well as the  Department of Energy (DOE), which coordinates the Climate Change  Technology Program\u2014a multiagency research and development program  for climate change technology. We also reviewed federal laws and  international agreements, interviewed 7 legal experts, and interviewed  officials from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the  Department of State (State) to identify potentially relevant federal laws  and international agreements and discuss how these laws and  international agreements might apply to future geoengineering efforts, and  associated challenges, if any, to geoengineering governance.", "We conducted our work from December 2009 through September 2010 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Until recently, these proposals generally remained outside  the mainstream discussions of climate policy, which focused either on  strategies to reduce emissions or adapt to climate change impacts.  However, there is growing concern among many scientists that the lack of  progress on emissions reductions will lead to gradual increases in  atmospheric concentrations of CO beyond a threshold that could prevent  substantial impacts to human health and environmental systems.  Furthermore, there is also concern about the existence of \u201ctipping points,\u201d  where the earth\u2019s climate system reaches a threshold that unexpectedly  results in abrupt and severe changes. One example would be the rapid  collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet\u2014which would lead to a large and  sudden contribution to sea level rise. These concerns have led to  increased interest in geoengineering as a potential tool to help reduce the  impacts of climate change, although the NRC study noted that few, if any,  individuals are promoting geoengineering as a near-term alternative to  emissions reductions.", "While both CDR and SRM are intended to reduce global temperatures,  there are substantial differences in how CDR and SRM operate on the  climate system, the timescales required for results, and their associated  risks and trade-offs. Consequently, CDR and SRM are often discussed  separately. The Royal Society identified several CDR approaches that  would directly remove CO in the ocean  or on land. Examples of ocean-based CDR approaches include:    Enhanced removal by physical processes. Enhanced  upwelling/downwelling\u2014altering ocean circulation patterns to bring  deep, nutrient rich water to the ocean\u2019s surface (upwelling), to promote  phytoplankton growth\u2014which removes CO-rich water from  the surface of the ocean to the deep-sea (downwelling).", "Enhanced removal by biological processes.

Increasing the reflectivity of the earth\u2019s land  or ocean surfaces through activities such as painting roofs white,  planting more reflective crops or other vegetation, or covering desert  or ocean surfaces with reflective materials.", "According to the NRC and Royal Society studies, geoengineering is one of  several potential tools to limit the impact and consequences of climate  change. However, these studies state that geoengineering is a potential  complement to, rather than a substitute for, sharp reductions in  greenhouse gas emissions. For example, while geoengineering includes a  range of approaches with varying degrees of potential effectiveness and  consequences\u2014no geoengineering approach can provide an easy or risk- free alternative solution to the problem of climate change, according to  the Royal Society study. For example, compared to current CDR  proposals, using SRM to divert incoming sunlight would relatively quickly  produce a cooling effect to counteract the warming influence of increased  atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. However, SRM does not  address the rising atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases  produced by human activity, and therefore would not reduce other serious  climate change impacts such as ocean acidification.", "Furthermore, according to these studies, both CDR and SRM involve  additional environmental risks or other trade-offs. For example, ocean- based CDR approaches, such as ocean fertilization, could have  unanticipated negative impacts on ocean ecosystems. Additionally, the  large-scale deployment of certain land-based CDR approaches, such as  afforestation, land-use management for sequestration, and biomass for  energy or burial, create trade-offs for land use. In general, the Royal  Society study found that compared to CDR, most SRM approaches are  associated with a higher risk of negative environmental effects, such as  negative impacts on regional temperature or precipitation. For example,  one study found that combining a reduction of incoming solar radiation  with high levels of atmospheric CO could have substantial impacts on  regional precipitation\u2014potentially leading to reductions that could create  droughts in some areas. Additionally, the Royal Society study said that  increasing the reflectivity of desert or ocean surfaces could have major  impacts on desert or ocean ecosystems.

Two of the most frequently discussed SRM approaches  are stratospheric aerosol injection and cloud-brightening, according to  many of the scientific experts we spoke with. For stratospheric aerosol  injection, some of the experts said that research to date consisted  primarily of a few modeling analyses. They also said that more work  would need to be done to assess whether this approach could reduce  incoming solar radiation without serious consequences. For example, one  study identified the potential for regional impacts on precipitation\u2014 potentially leading to drought in some areas. Based on our literature  review and interviews with experts, to date only one study has been  published for a field experiment related to SRM technologies\u2014a 2009  Russian experiment that injected aerosols into the middle troposphere to  measure their reflectivity. Similarly, in the case of cloud-brightening,  several experts said that there currently is not enough research to assess  its effectiveness or impacts.

The study emphasized the importance of providing decision  makers with scientific information on a range of available options,  including geoengineering, to limit future climate change and its impacts.  According to this study, this information would help policymakers use  adaptive risk management to update response strategies as new  information on climate change risks and response strategies becomes  available. NRC recommended an integrative, interdisciplinary research  effort to improve understanding of available response options, as well as  of climate change and its impacts. The study indicated that this effort  should be led by a single coordinating body, and NRC identified USGCRP\u2019s  capacity to play a role in such an effort. Similarly, several of the experts  we interviewed recommended that federal geoengineering research should  be an interdisciplinary effort across multiple agencies and led by a  coordinating body, such as OSTP or USGCRP.", "Our recent work offers insights on key considerations for establishing  governmentwide strategies, which could be relevant to a future  geoengineering strategy. Specifically, our review of federal efforts related  to crosscutting issues, such as climate change adaptation and global food  security, highlighted key practices for enhancing collaboration across  agencies. These practices include establishing a commonly accepted  operational definition for relevant activities; leveraging existing resources  to support common outcomes and address identified needs; and  developing mechanisms to monitor, evaluate, and report on results.  Furthermore, our review of DOE\u2019s FutureGen project\u2014a program to help  build the world\u2019s first coal-fired, zero-emissions power plant\u2014identified  important factors to consider when developing a strategy for technology- based research. Specifically, we found that it is important to  comprehensively assess the costs, benefits, and risks of each technological  option and to identify potential overlap between proposed and existing  programs. For example, the NRC study acknowledged the importance of  improving understanding of SRM and its consequences, without replacing  or reducing existing research on climate change science or other  approaches to limiting climate change or adapting to its impacts. As the  study noted, much of the research needed to advance scientific  understanding of SRM, such as studying the climate effects of aerosols and  cloud physics, is also necessary to advance understanding of the climate  system, and could therefore contribute more broadly to climate change  science. Similarly, an OSTP official said that ongoing fundamental  research to investigate the relationship of cloud/aerosol interactions could  also be applied to improve understanding of certain SRM approaches.", "In the absence of a coordinated federal strategy for geoengineering,  decisions about whether a particular research activity is relevant to  geoengineering may not necessarily be consistent across the federal  government. In addition, agencies generally do not collect and share  information on such research activities in the context of geoengineering.  While EPA officials told us that certain agencies, such as EPA, State, and  NOAA, share information about ocean fertilization and direct injection of  CO into deep sub-seabed geological formations as part of a working group  for international regulation of the ocean, a USGCRP official said there is  no working group to share information or coordinate geoengineering  research more broadly, because such an action would require a decision  from the administration to pursue geoengineering research on a larger  scale. However, without a coordinated effort to identify relevant research  and share information across agencies, policymakers and agency officials  may lack key information needed to inform their decisions on  geoengineering research.

Similarly, some of these experts and federal officials said that a general  lack of significant efforts to pursue geoengineering is a contributing factor  to why geoengineering governance has not been pursued further to date.  For example, a State official noted that geoengineering has not received  much attention within international negotiations related to climate change,  and there isn\u2019t enough geoengineering-related activity to drive interest in  expanding international governance at this time.", "Legal experts and State officials had differing views about an international  governance framework for geoengineering. Specifically, several legal  experts recommended including all geoengineering activities with  transboundary impacts in a single comprehensive agreement. Some of  these experts said an existing comprehensive international agreement  could be adapted to address geoengineering. Some of them specifically  identified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  as an appropriate agreement because it addresses climate change and  geoengineering is intended to diminish climate change or its impacts.  Other legal experts said a new international agreement was needed  because of the difficulty reaching consensus within the United Nations  Framework Convention on Climate Change. Experts in favor of a single  comprehensive agreement said that it would be preferable to the  patchwork of existing agreements, which were not designed to address  geoengineering, because these agreements do not create comprehensive  governance frameworks that could be used to address geoengineering.  Additionally, some experts said that certain existing agreements rely on  the parties to regulate activities under their jurisdiction without the  international community\u2019s participation in decision-making, which may  not be the best structure for regulating geoengineering research or  deployment.", "State officials we interviewed said that it would be better to rely on  existing treaties to the extent they are adequate and appropriate and  consider developing new international instruments if needed, since there  is limited knowledge and practice of geoengineering. State officials said  this approach would enable greater rigor and flexibility than trying to  address all geoengineering activities within a single comprehensive  agreement. They cited the London Convention and London Protocol as  examples. While these agreements might not have addressed ocean  fertilization several years ago, the parties took action when ocean  fertilization reached a state of development where an agreed approach to  regulation was considered necessary, and the agreements now  unquestionably address it. In contrast, State officials said that parties to  other agreements have not addressed other geoengineering approaches  because they have not reached a similar stage of development. State  officials said it was hard to imagine a single agreement appropriately  covering geoengineering activities with all potential transboundary effects.  State officials also said that while some countries have called for a broader  inquiry into marine geoengineering more generally under the London  Convention and the London Protocol, the parties deemed those calls  premature at best.", "Legal experts and EPA officials we interviewed generally agreed that the  federal government should take a coordinated, interagency approach to  domestic geoengineering regulation. For example, the legal experts who  spoke about domestic regulation generally agreed that the federal  government should play a role in governing geoengineering research\u2014 either by developing research norms and guidelines or applying existing  regulations and guidelines. One expert noted that it was important that  regulators stay abreast of research on the most mature technologies so  that the regulatory framework would be in place prior to field  experiments. Some experts and EPA officials also agreed that because  there is a wide variety of geoengineering activities, research and regulation  would fall under multiple agencies\u2019 purview and expertise. For example,  one expert said that there should be a coordinated interagency effort led  by OSTP or USGCRP. Another said that the federal government should  focus on a comprehensive policy for climate change, including  geoengineering, and that that policy would determine what new  regulations would be necessary to guide and govern research. EPA and  State officials both said that agencies such as NOAA, NASA, and DOE  should be involved in regulatory discussions due to their jurisdictional or  scientific expertise. As an example, EPA officials noted that the  Interagency Task Force on Carbon Capture and Storage, co-chaired by  DOE and EPA, was created to propose a plan to overcome the barriers to  widespread deployment of these technologies, which include geologic  sequestration. The plan addresses, among other issues, how to coordinate  existing administrative authorities and programs, legal barriers to  deployment, and identifies areas where additional statutory authority may  be necessary.", "Legal experts we interviewed generally agreed that governance for  geoengineering research should be addressed separately from governance  for deployment of geoengineering approaches. For example, experts said  that discussions of governance of deployment were premature, and one  expert cautioned that discussing deployment could raise the level of  controversy surrounding the subject, leading to a general gridlock that  could disrupt discussions about research and lower interest in a  coordinated and transparent approach. Both State and EPA officials cited  the need for further research into geoengineering prior to engaging in  discussions of domestic regulation or a governance framework at the  international level. State officials said that, in practice, the United States  and other countries have already effectively separated geoengineering  research and deployment governance for ocean fertilization under the  London Convention and London Protocol, because the parties decided  that any ocean fertilization activities other than those for legitimate  scientific research should not be allowed at this time.", "However, the legal experts we spoke with also agreed that some type of  regulation of geoengineering field research was necessary in the near  future, particularly for those approaches where large-scale experiments  could have transboundary impacts. According to these experts, any  framework governing research should include several elements, such as  transparency, coordination, flexibility, a review process for experiments,  the use of environmental risk thresholds, and an emphasis on modeling  prior to field studies. A few legal experts said that these elements could  start as voluntary norms and guidelines within the research community  and then evolve into formal regulations prior to field trials. As one expert  said, transparent decision-making and guidelines are necessary to ensure  that research does not pose unacceptable risk to the environment. State  officials said that, generally, the United States supports careful  consideration of research implications rather than a full ban on research.  In addition, they said that some geoengineering research could be fostered  most effectively through international cooperation and coordination rather  than governance, or that domestic regulation is more appropriate than  international regulation.", "Legal experts and EPA and State officials cited other challenges related to  geoengineering governance, particularly for those approaches with uneven  or unintended environmental effects. For example, some legal experts said  that controversy surrounding certain geoengineering approaches, as well  as a lack of understanding and acceptance, could make domestic and  international governance difficult. In addition, State officials said that if  large-scale experiments or activities have unknown consequences or  effects borne by nations other than the nation conducting the experiment  or activity, this could risk undermining existing agreements on climate  change strategies. Furthermore, legal experts and EPA officials agreed  that liability for unintended consequences was an important issue that  would need to be addressed.

While the NRC and Royal  Society have identified geoengineering as a potential tool, what role  geoengineering might play in a domestic and international response  strategy will likely be shaped by resolving unanswered scientific questions  surrounding the technical feasibility, unintended consequences,  effectiveness, cost, and risks associated with each approach. Answers to  these questions will also inform the public debate concerning whether  geoengineering is an acceptable response given the ethical and social  implications of deliberate interventions in the earth\u2019s climate system. The  federal government is already engaging in research that could help address  some of the uncertainties surrounding geoengineering and inform policy  decisions about research priorities.
