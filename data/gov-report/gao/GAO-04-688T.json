Multilateral creditors are having difficulty financing their share of the initiative, even with assistance from donors. Under the existing initiative, many countries are unlikely to achieve their debt relief targets, primarily because their export earnings are likely to be significantly less than projected by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF). In a recently issued report, GAO assessed (1) the projected multilateral development banks' funding shortfall for the existing initiative and (2) the amount of funding, including development assistance, needed to help countries achieve economic growth and debt relief targets. The Treasury, World Bank, and African Development Bank commented that historical export growth rates are not good predictors of the future because significant structural changes are under way in many countries that could lead to greater growth. We consider these historical rates to be a more realistic gauge of future growth because of these countries' reliance on highly volatile primary commodities and other vulnerabilities such as HIV/AIDS."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The three key multilateral development banks we analyzed face a funding shortfall of $7.8 billion in 2003 present value terms, or 54 percent of their total commitment, under the existing HIPC Initiative. The World Bank has the most significant shortfall--$6 billion. The African Development Bank has a gap of about $1.2 billion. Neither has determined how it would close this gap. The Inter-American Development Bank is fully funding its HIPC obligation by reducing its future lending resources to poor countries by $600 million beginning in 2009. We estimate that the cost to the United States, based on its rate of contribution to these banks, could be an additional $1.8 billion. However, the total estimated funding gap is understated because (1) the World Bank does not include costs for four countries for which data are unreliable and (2) all three banks do not include estimates for additional relief that may be required because countries' economies deteriorated after they qualified for debt relief. Even if the $7.8 billion gap is fully financed, we estimate that the 27 countries that have qualified for debt relief may need an additional $375 billion to help them achieve their economic growth and debt relief targets by 2020. This $375 billion consists of $153 billion in expected development assistance, $215 billion to cover lower export earnings, and at least $8 billion in debt relief. Most countries are likely to experience higher debt burdens and lower export earnings than the World Bank and IMF project, leading to an estimated $215 billion shortfall over 18 years. To reach debt targets, we estimate that countries will need between $8 billion and $20 billion, depending on the strategy chosen. Under these strategies, multilateral creditors switch a portion of their loans to grants and/or donors pay countries' debt service that exceeds 5 percent of government revenue. Based on its historical share of donor assistance, the United States may be called upon to contribute about 14 percent of this $375 billion, or approximately $52 billion over 18 years."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the funding of the existing Heavily  Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and the amount of further  assistance needed to help countries achieve economic growth and debt  targets.", "The HIPC Initiative is a joint bilateral and multilateral effort to provide  debt relief to up to 42 poor countries to help them achieve long-term  economic growth and debt sustainability. The current cost for the  initiative is projected at about $41 billion in present value terms, funded  almost equally between bilateral and multilateral creditors. Although the  initiative was launched in 1996, multilateral creditors are still having  difficulty financing their share of the initiative, even with assistance from  donors. GAO and others have reported that the existing initiative is  unlikely to provide sufficient debt relief to achieve long-term debt  sustainability, primarily because export earnings are likely to be  significantly less than projected by the World Bank and the International  Monetary Fund (IMF).", "My remarks will focus on two key areas, as discussed in our recently  released report: (1) the multilateral development banks\u2019 (MDB) projected  funding shortfall for the existing HIPC Initiative and (2) the amount of  funding, including development assistance, needed to help countries  achieve economic growth and debt relief targets.

To determine the amount and timing of funding  shortfalls, we analyzed the banks\u2019 total and annual cost estimates and  funding sources for 34 countries. To determine the amount of funding  needed to achieve economic growth and debt relief targets, we analyzed  World Bank and IMF projections through 2020 for the 27 countries that  have qualified for debt relief thus far, focusing on estimates of key  economic variables including debt stock, debt service, donor assistance,  government revenue, and exports.

In 1999, in response to concerns about the  continuing vulnerability of these countries, the World Bank and the IMF  agreed to enhance the HIPC Initiative by more than doubling the estimated  amount of debt relief and increasing the number of potentially eligible  countries. A major goal of the HIPC Initiative is to provide recipient  countries with a permanent exit from unsustainable debt burdens. To date,  27 poor countries have reached their decision points, and 11 of these have  reached their completion points. In 1996, to help multilateral creditors  meet the cost of the HIPC Initiative, the World Bank established a HIPC  Trust Fund with contributions from member governments and some  multilateral creditors.

Similarly, the U.S.\u2019s potential share decreases by the same percentage,  from $1.2 billion to about $700 million.

According to IaDB officials, the FSO will not  have enough money to lend from 2009 through 2013. To eliminate this  shortfall, donor countries may be asked to provide the necessary funds  through a future replenishment contribution. Assuming that donor  countries agree to close the financing gap, we estimate that the U.S.  government could be asked to contribute about $300 million so that the  FSO can continue lending to poor countries after 2008.

The World  Bank considers existing estimates of the countries\u2019 total debt and  outstanding arrears to be incomplete, subject to significant change, and it  is uncertain when the countries will reach their decision points. Similarly,  the estimated costs of debt relief for three of AfDB\u2019s countries\u2014Liberia,  Somalia, and Sudan\u2014are likely understated due to data reliability  concerns.", "Second, the financing shortfall does not include any additional relief that  may be provided to countries because their economies deteriorated since  they originally qualified for debt relief. Under the enhanced HIPC  Initiative, creditors and donors could provide countries with additional  debt relief above the amounts agreed to at their decision points, referred  to as \u201ctopping up.\u201d This relief could be provided when external factors,  such as movements in currency exchange rates or declines in commodity  prices, cause countries\u2019 economies to deteriorate, thereby affecting their  ability to achieve debt sustainability.

We estimate that  export earnings are more likely to grow at the historical annual average of  3.1 percent per year\u2014less than half the rate the World Bank and IMF  project. Under lower, historical export growth rates, countries are likely to  have lower export earnings and unsustainable debt levels (see table 2). We  estimate the total amount of the potential export earnings shortfall over  the 2003 to 2020 projection period to be $215 billion.", "High export growth rates are unlikely because HIPC countries rely heavily  on primary commodities such as coffee, cotton, and copper for much of  their export revenue. Historically, the prices of these commodities have  fluctuated, often downward, resulting in lower export earnings and  worsening debt indicators. A 2003 World Bank report found that the World  Bank/IMF growth assumptions had been overly optimistic and  recommended more realistic economic forecasts when assessing debt  sustainability.", "Since HIPC countries are assumed to follow their World Bank and IMF  reform programs, any export shortfalls are considered to be caused by  factors outside their control such as weather and natural disasters, lack of  access to foreign markets, or declining commodity prices. Although failure  to follow the reform program could result in the reduction or suspension  of development assistance, export shortfalls due to outside factors would  not be expected to have this result. Therefore, if countries are to achieve  economic growth rates consistent with their development goals, donors  would need to fund the $215 billion shortfall. Without this additional  assistance, countries would grow more slowly, resulting in reduced  imports, lower gross domestic product (GDP), and lower government  revenue.

We estimate  that these countries will require $8.5 to $19.8 billion more to achieve debt  sustainability and debt-service goals. After examining 40 strategies for  providing debt relief, we narrowed our analysis to three specific strategies:  (1) switching the minimum percentage of loans to grants for future  multilateral development assistance for each country to achieve debt  sustainability, (2) paying debt service in excess of 5 percent of  government revenue, and (3) combining strategies (1) and (2). We chose  these strategies because they maximize the number of countries achieving  debt sustainability while minimizing costs to donors. We found that, with  this debt relief, as many as 25 countries could become debt sustainable  and all countries would achieve a debt service-to-revenue ratio below 5  percent over the entire 18-year projection period (see table 3).", "In the first strategy, multilateral creditors switch the minimum percentage  of loans to grants for each country to achieve debt sustainability in 2020.  We estimate that the additional cost of this strategy would be $8.5 billion.  The average percentage of loans switched to grants for all countries under  this strategy would be 33.5 percent. Twelve countries are projected to be  debt sustainable with no further assistance. In addition, 13 countries  would achieve sustainability by switching between 2 percent (Benin) and  96 percent (S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe) of new loans to grants. A total of 25  countries could be debt sustainable by 2020, although only 2 countries  would achieve the 5-percent debt service-to-revenue target over the entire  period.", "The second strategy is aimed at reducing each country\u2019s debt-service  burden. Under this strategy, donors would provide assistance to cover  annual debt service above 5 percent of government revenue. We estimate  that this strategy would cost an additional $12.6 billion to achieve the goal  of 5-percent debt service to revenue for all countries throughout the  projection period. Under this strategy, no additional countries become  debt sustainable other than the 12 that are already projected to be debt  sustainable with no further assistance. While this strategy would free  significant resources for poverty reduction expenditures, it could provide  an incentive for countries to pursue irresponsible borrowing policies. By  guaranteeing that no country would have to pay more than 5 percent of its  revenue in debt service, this strategy would separate the amount of a  country\u2019s borrowing from the amount of its debt repayment. Consequently,  it could encourage countries to borrow more than they are normally able  to repay, increasing the cost to donors and reducing the resources  available for other countries.", "The third strategy combines strategies 1 and 2 to achieve both debt  sustainability and a lower debt-service burden. Under this strategy,  multilateral creditors would first switch the minimum percentage of loans  to grants to achieve debt sustainability, and then donors would pay debt  service in excess of 5 percent of government revenue. We estimate that  this strategy would cost an additional $19.8 billion, including $8.5 billion  for switching loans to grants, and $11.3 billion for reducing debt service to  5 percent of revenue. Under this strategy, 25 countries would achieve debt  sustainability in 2020\u2014that is, 13 countries in addition to the 12 that are  projected to be debt sustainable with no further assistance. All 27  countries would reach the 5-percent debt-service goal for the duration of  the projection period.

This  amount consists of $24 billion, which represents the U.S. share of the $153  billion in expected development assistance projected by the World Bank  and IMF, as well as approximately $28 billion for the increased assistance  to the 27 countries. Historically, the United States has been the largest  contributor to the World Bank and IaDB, and the second largest  contributor to the AfDB, providing between 11 and 50 percent of their  funding.

We found that the higher a  country\u2019s export volatility, the lower its likelihood of achieving debt  sustainability. For example, Honduras has low export volatility, resulting  in little impact on its debt sustainability. In contrast, Rwanda has very high  export volatility, which greatly lowers its probability of achieving debt  sustainability. Since volatility in export earnings reduces countries\u2019  likelihood of achieving debt sustainability, it is also likely to further  increase donors\u2019 cost as countries may require an even greater than  expected level of debt relief to achieve debt sustainability.", "Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, this concludes my prepared  statement.
