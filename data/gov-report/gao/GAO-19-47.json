The RFS generally mandates that transportation fuels\u2014typically gasoline and diesel\u2014sold in the United States contain increasing amounts of biofuels. In addition, the RFS is designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by replacing petroleum-based fuels with biofuels expected to have lower associated greenhouse gas emissions. The most common biofuel currently produced in the United States is corn-starch ethanol, distilled from the sugars in corn. EPA uses RINs associated with biofuels blended with petroleum-based fuels to regulate compliance with the program.", "In 2014, GAO found that refiners' costs for complying with the RFS had increased, and in 2016, GAO found that greenhouse gas emissions are unlikely to be reduced to the extent anticipated because production of advanced biofuels\u2014which reduce greenhouse gas emissions more than corn-starch ethanol\u2014has not kept pace with the yearly increases or the target of 21 billion gallons by 2022 called for by the statute. GAO was asked to review additional issues related to the effects of the RFS.", "This report examines what is known about (1) the effect the RFS has had to date on retail gasoline prices in the United States and (2) the RFS's effect on greenhouse gas emissions and whether the RFS will meet its goals for reducing those emissions. The report also provides information about RINs.", "To address the likely effects of the RFS on gasoline prices, GAO reviewed studies and interviewed experts and industry stakeholders, and conducted a statistical analysis of state ethanol mandates that were similar to the mandates of the RFS. GAO selected the experts based on their published work and recognition in the professional community. GAO selected stakeholders representing a range of perspectives, including stakeholders from the renewable fuels, petroleum, and agricultural industries, as well as from environmental groups.", "Because the RFS was implemented on a nationwide basis at the same time that other factors, such as the global price of crude oil and domestic demand for retail gasoline, were affecting retail gasoline prices across the nation, it is not possible to directly isolate and measure the effect the RFS had on gasoline prices nationwide given data available to GAO. Instead GAO developed and extensively tested an econometric model that estimated the effects on retail gasoline prices of state ethanol mandates. These state mandates are similar to the RFS but were put in place voluntarily by states before the RFS led to widespread ethanol blending in every state. This model estimated how ethanol mandates affected gasoline prices in these five states. These estimates suggest the RFS likely had effects in states that did not have state-wide mandates. These states incrementally blended ethanol because of the increasing volumes of ethanol required to be blended nationally by the RFS.", "Regarding the RFS's effect on greenhouse gas emissions, GAO interviewed 13 experts in government and academia. GAO selected these experts based on their published work, prior GAO work, and recommendations from other experts.", "During the course of the work, GAO gathered information on the topic of RINs through interviews, a review of relevant literature, and prior GAO work.", "GAO makes no recommendations in this report. In commenting on a draft of this report, USDA disagreed with GAO's finding that the RFS has had a limited effect on greenhouse gas emissions, citing research on the effects of ethanol on reducing emissions generally. GAO reported on the specific effects of the RFS on emissions. USDA also criticized GAO's methodology using experts' views. GAO employed that method to reach consensus among those with a range of perspectives. DOE and EPA did not comment on the draft report."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Effect on prices. Evidence from studies, interviews with experts, and GAO's analysis suggest that the nationwide Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) was likely associated with modest gasoline price increases outside of the Midwest and that these price increases may have diminished over time. Variations in these gasoline price effects likely depended, in part, on state-by-state variation in the costs to transport and store ethanol. For example, the Midwest was already producing and blending ethanol when the RFS came into effect, so that region had lower transportation costs and had already invested in necessary storage infrastructure. Other regions began blending ethanol later to meet the RFS's requirements, thereby incurring new transportation and storage infrastructure costs that resulted in gasoline prices that were several cents per gallon higher than they otherwise would have been.", "In addition, experts told GAO that the RFS caused an initial increase in refining investment costs that, over the long term, reduced refining costs for gasoline. Specifically, once all locations had made the infrastructure investments and most gasoline blendstock produced was consistent with blending ethanol then there would be two continuing effects: (1) the transportation and blending costs of ethanol, which would tend to push retail prices higher and depend on the distance traveled and the modes of transport, and (2) the lower cost of producing lower octane blendstock. The former effect might dominate for locations far from the production source of ethanol and for which more costly modes of transport were used, while the lower blendstock costs might dominate for locations close to the production source of ethanol and/or those that have low transportation costs.", "GAO's analysis of the effect that state ethanol mandates had on gasoline prices also showed gasoline price effects that differed in the Midwest and elsewhere. Specifically, during the period GAO studied, when the ethanol mandates in Minnesota and Missouri were in effect, all else remaining equal, retail gasoline prices were lower by about 8 and 5 cents per gallon in these states, respectively, than they would have been without the mandates. In contrast, when the ethanol mandates in Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington were in effect, GAO's model showed that retail gasoline prices were higher by about 8, 2, and 6 cents per gallon, respectively, than they would have been without the ethanol mandates. These results suggest that the RFS likely had gasoline price effects in other states that did not have state-wide ethanol mandates but that incrementally began blending ethanol as a result of increasing RFS requirements that by around 2010 had led to almost all gasoline sold in the United States being blended with 10 percent ethanol.", "Effect on greenhouse gas emissions. Most of the experts GAO interviewed generally agreed that, to date, the RFS has likely had a limited effect, if any, on greenhouse gas emissions. According to the experts and GAO's prior work, the effect has likely been limited for reasons including: (1) the reliance of the RFS to date on conventional corn-starch ethanol, which has a smaller potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared with advanced biofuels, and (2) that most corn-starch ethanol has been produced in plants exempt from emissions reduction requirements, likely limiting reductions early on when plants were less efficient than they are today.", "Further, the RFS is unlikely to meet the greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals envisioned for the program through 2022. Specifically, GAO reported in November 2016 that advanced biofuels, which achieve greater greenhouse gas reductions than conventional corn-starch ethanol, have been uneconomical to produce at the volumes required by the RFS statute so the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has waived most of these requirements (see figure).", "Renewable identification numbers. EPA uses renewable identification numbers (RINs) to regulate industry compliance with RFS requirements for blending biofuels into the nation's transportation fuel supply. In GAO's March 2014 report on petroleum refining, GAO noted that the RFS had increased compliance costs for the domestic petroleum refining industry or individual refiners. GAO reported that corn-based ethanol RIN prices had been low\u2014from 1 to 5 cents per gallon from 2006 through much of 2012\u2014but in 2013, RIN prices increased to over $1.40 per gallon in July before declining to about 20 cents per gallon as of mid-November 2013. Since the March 2014 report, corn-ethanol RIN prices have experienced more periods of volatility. Most experts and stakeholders GAO interviewed recently stated that RINs had either a small effect on prices or no effect on prices, though a few disagreed. Finally, GAO's past work, as well as EPA analysis, has identified several issues of concern with RINs, including possible fraud in the market and concerns about the effect on small refiners, price volatility, and the point of obligation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As part of U.S. efforts to increase energy independence and security and  increase the production of clean, renewable fuels, Congress enacted the  Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005  and 2 years later expanded it in the Energy Independence and Security  Act of 2007 (EISA).

Because so little empirical work has been conducted on the relationship  between prices and the RFS, especially work of a retrospective nature,  we selected some experts specifically because of the relevance of their  published work. We also selected experts who are recognized as experts  in the professional community or among their peers. In addition, we  selected individuals who have expertise or have published work relevant  to lifecycle assessment of greenhouse gas emissions of various biofuels,  or who have published work relevant to the effect of the RFS on  greenhouse gas emissions or biofuel production and use.

We also employed snowball sampling by asking the officials  we interviewed to recommend others who have knowledge about the  effect of the RFS on gasoline prices and greenhouse gas emissions.  Industry stakeholders were selected based on the relevance of their  mission to biofuels and to the RFS. In considering industry stakeholders,  we selected those that would allow us to obtain a wide range of  perspectives on these issues. For example, we selected industry  stakeholders that represent the renewable fuels industry as well as those  that represent the petroleum industry. We also selected industry  stakeholders that represent the farmers who grow the agricultural  products frequently used for biofuels, and we selected those whose  primary focus is on the environment. The views of these stakeholders are  not generalizable to those we did not interview.

This model  enabled us to estimate how ethanol mandates affected gasoline prices in  these five states, and these estimates allow us to infer the effects that the  RFS had in other states that did not have state-wide mandates but that  were incrementally forced to blend ethanol based on RFS requirements.  Specifically, the state-level analysis allowed us to isolate the effect of  ethanol mandates on retail gasoline prices in five states\u2014Hawaii,  Minnesota, Missouri, Oregon, and Washington\u2014by using other states to  control for other factors that influenced retail gasoline prices over  time. These state mandates were put into effect by 2008, at which time  the RFS was requiring relatively low levels of ethanol blending. In doing  this analysis, we used all the states identified as having met the criteria of  having state-wide ethanol blending mandates put into effect no later than  2008. Therefore, these state mandates likely accelerated ethanol  blending in those states during our study period. We conducted a  regression analysis using monthly average after-tax retail gasoline prices  from 49 states and the District of Columbia for 2001 through 2010.", "Our model required data on retail gasoline prices and biofuel policies, as  well as on other factors that might have affected gasoline prices, so that  we could control for these factors and isolate the effects of the state  ethanol mandates.

Retail gasoline consists of two  components\u2014ethanol and blendstock, which is the petroleum-based  gasoline that ethanol is blended with to make retail gasoline. Currently,  blendstock and ethanol are typically transported in different ways.  Blendstock can be shipped via pipeline, which is the most cost-efficient  method of transporting fuel. However, ethanol is more corrosive and  cannot be shipped in pipelines currently used for blendstock; as a result,  it must be transported using costlier methods, such as rail, barge, and  tanker truck.", "Ethanol is produced primarily in the Midwest, where most corn is  produced. According to the studies we reviewed, this means that Midwest  gasoline retailers, being closer to the supply of ethanol, may have been  able to charge consumers lower prices for retail gasoline relative to non- Midwest gasoline retailers because of their lower transportation costs for  ethanol. Similarly, higher transportation costs outside of the Midwest may  have resulted in higher prices of retail gasoline in those regions. Figure 2  illustrates U.S. ethanol production in 2005, before the RFS became  effective.", "In addition, the RFS may also have affected retail gasoline prices by  increasing storage costs in certain regions. Because ethanol is more  corrosive than blendstock, it must be stored differently. According to one  study we reviewed, ethanol was being blended into gasoline in many  locations in the Midwest prior to the establishment of the RFS. As a  result, the Midwest already had the infrastructure needed to store ethanol.  According to another study, in some places outside of the Midwest  ethanol was typically not being blended into gasoline prior to the  establishment of the RFS, and therefore costly infrastructure changes,  such as installing different seals and gaskets in tanks, were needed so  that retailers could store blended gasoline. For example, the California  Energy Commission estimated the costs of such infrastructure changes to  be approximately $60 million in California. Unlike transportation costs, the  costs of infrastructure changes were incurred just once, according to  industry stakeholders we interviewed; therefore the effect of such costs  on retail prices would be expected to have diminished over time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Production Costs", "paragraphs": ["The cost of producing retail gasoline depends in part on the costs of its  two components. The RFS may have affected the costs of blendstock and  ethanol in various ways, and according to the experts we interviewed,  past GAO work, and the studies we reviewed, these costs may have  contributed to changes in gasoline prices.", "Blendstock. The RFS may have initially increased both refiners\u2019  costs to produce blendstock compatible with ethanol blending and the  costs of shipping and storing such blendstock; however, these costs  may have decreased over time. More specifically, the RFS may have  initially increased refiners\u2019 costs because refiners had to change their  configuration to produce a lower octane blendstock to accommodate  ethanol blending. Many experts we interviewed stated that producing  blendstock with a lower octane level required costly changes to  refinery infrastructure and processes. However, according to these  experts and stakeholders, since ethanol is relatively high in octane,  blending ethanol into retail gasoline allows refiners to produce  blendstock with a lower octane level. As a result, according to many of  the experts we interviewed, after the initial investment by refineries to  switch to the lower octane blendstock, refiners could produce that  blendstock at lower cost. This would have led to higher initial costs but  lower long-term costs once infrastructure costs had been capitalized.", "The higher initial cost is consistent with our past work in which we  noted that shipping more types of blendstocks\u2014the result of a  proliferation of blendstocks adopted by states and localities to meet  Clean Air Act standards\u2014increases the costs of shipping and storing  blendstocks at terminals for distribution to retail sellers. As a result,  according to one expert familiar with our past work, as ethanol  blending spread further and further away from the production center in  the Midwest states, there were more types of blendstocks in the  pipeline and storage terminals, which would have increased costs.  This expert said that over the longer run and once ethanol blending  had expanded to encompass the majority of gasoline sold in the  United States, this effect would have disappeared because virtually all  the blendstock flowing through the pipeline and storage system would  be compatible with blending ethanol.", "Ethanol. It is unclear whether the RFS increased or decreased the  cost of ethanol. One source we reviewed indicated that the RFS may  have increased the cost of ethanol by increasing demand for corn,  which would drive up the price of corn. On the other hand, one  expert we spoke to stated that the RFS may have decreased the cost  of ethanol in the long term by providing incentives for producers to  invest in more efficient ethanol production processes, which would  lower production costs over time.", "However, it is unclear what the longer-term effects of ethanol blending on  gasoline prices have been. We believe this is because once all locations  had made the infrastructure investments and most gasoline blendstock  produced was consistent with blending ethanol then there would be two  continuing effects: (1) the transportation and blending costs of ethanol,  which would tend to push retail prices higher and depend on the distance  traveled and the modes of transport, and (2) the lower cost of producing  lower octane blendstock. The former effect might dominate for locations  far from the production source of ethanol and for which more costly  modes of transport were used while the lower blendstock costs might  dominate for locations close to the production source of ethanol, those  that have low transportation costs, or both. However, the data available to  us do not allow us to test this long-term effect."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Our Analysis of State Ethanol Mandates Also Found Gasoline Price Decreases in the Midwest and Increases Elsewhere", "paragraphs": ["We studied the effects of ethanol blending mandates in the five states  that had such mandates prior to and including 2008; these mandates are  similar to but preceded the RFS ethanol blending mandates on retail  gasoline prices. We found that these state mandates were associated  with gasoline price decreases in the two Midwestern states we evaluated  and price increases in three non-Midwestern states. Specifically, during  the period we studied, when the ethanol mandates in Minnesota and  Missouri were in effect, our model estimates that, all else remaining  equal, retail gasoline prices were lower by approximately 8 and 5 cents  per gallon in these states, respectively, than they would have been  without the mandates. By contrast, when the ethanol mandates in Hawaii,  Oregon, and Washington were in effect, our model estimates that, all else  remaining equal, retail gasoline prices were higher by approximately 8, 2,  and 6 cents per gallon in these states, respectively, than they would have  been without the mandates. These results are consistent with what  other studies and experts found about the effects of blending ethanol with  gasoline.", "Our model provides an indicator of the types of effects that the RFS likely  had on retail gasoline prices as the increasing ethanol blending targets of  the RFS began to push ethanol into more gasoline markets. Specifically,  we can infer from the model that the RFS was associated with a modest  gasoline price decrease in Midwest states. According to one expert  familiar with our analysis and with the blendstock pipeline and storage  system, expanding the volumes of lower octane feedstocks to the  Midwest states would have the effect of reducing refining production costs  because refiners serving the Midwest could do larger runs of lower octane  blendstock and therefore benefit from economies of scale in refining runs.  In addition, this would also have the effect of reducing pipeline and  storage costs for blendstocks because larger volumes of lower octane  blendstock could be shipped northward from the refining center in the  Gulf of Mexico states to the Midwest. Larger volumes of uniform blendstock during pipeline shipping reduce costs compared to smaller  shipments because different blendstocks intermix at the point they  interface in a pipeline, and these mixed blendstocks either have to be  downgraded and sold for less or pulled out entirely and re-refined to meet  existing fuel standards. Conversely, we can infer from the model that  the RFS was associated with modest gasoline price increases in states  further from the Midwest producers as increasing ethanol targets caused  those states to begin blending ethanol for the first time and for which  more refining capacity had to convert to produce lower octane feedstock  and ship it to more locations, thereby initially raising refining, pipeline, and  storage costs as discussed previously in this report.", "The results of our analysis are also generally consistent with other work  that examined the effects of different state ethanol-blending requirements  on gasoline prices. For example, some states and localities started  blending ethanol before the RFS made it effectively mandatory when  these states and localities banned MTBE, an additive that increased the  oxygen content of the fuel. When MTBE was banned, ethanol was  typically added in its place. The one peer-reviewed study we identified  that estimated the effects of the MTBE ban on gasoline prices found that  in locations required to blend ethanol because of state MTBE bans, retail  gasoline prices increased by 3 to 6 cents per gallon in non-Midwestern  states, with larger price increases during times of high ethanol prices  relative to crude oil prices. This study also found that retail gasoline prices  in the Midwest may not have changed.", "While our own analysis, other studies we reviewed, and experts we spoke  to cannot estimate precise price effects of the RFS on retail gasoline, we  believe that collectively the evidence points to likely effects that varied by  geographic region and that as RFS blending requirements rose and more  and more non-Midwestern states and localities adopted ethanol blending,  it is likely they saw modest increases in retail gasoline prices on the order  of several cents per gallon. Conversely, as more and more states and  localities blended ethanol and more refiners began producing larger runs  of lower octane blendstock, the costs of acquiring this blendstock likely  fell, and because Midwestern states had very low transportation costs for  ethanol, their gasoline prices likely fell."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The RFS Has Likely Had a Limited Effect on Greenhouse Gas Emissions to Date and Is Unlikely to Meet Its Future Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Goals", "paragraphs": ["Most of the experts we interviewed generally agreed that to date the RFS  has likely had a limited effect, if any, on greenhouse gas emissions.

Specifically, the experts commenting on the topic were roughly  evenly split between increases or decreases in greenhouse gas  emissions, with some saying there were negligible effects. Experts we  interviewed said that the effect that the RFS has had on greenhouse gas  emissions is difficult to assess precisely because it involves complex  factors that are challenging to quantify, including the lifecycle emissions  associated with biofuel use.", "The RFS\u2019s reliance on corn-starch ethanol to fill biofuel mandates has  limited the ability of the RFS to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Specifically, as we reported in November 2016, most of the biofuel  blended to date has been conventional corn-starch ethanol, which has a  smaller potential to achieve greenhouse gas reductions compared with  advanced biofuels. Because of this, several experts we interviewed for  the November 2016 report raised concerns about the extent to which the  RFS has achieved its design of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.", "Furthermore, because the RFS has not been responsible for all of the  ethanol used in the United States since the program took effect, not all  greenhouse gas reductions associated with ethanol use have been the  result of the RFS. More specifically, most experts agreed that ethanol use  was historically driven, in part, by favorable market conditions and other  policies, including state biofuel mandates, ethanol tax credits, and the  phaseout of MTBE as an oxygenate for gasoline. Most experts we  interviewed said they believed that the RFS had some effect on biofuel  production by creating a guaranteed market for biofuels. Although  experts\u2019 views differed on the amount of ethanol that would have been  produced without the RFS, most of them said that ethanol production  capacity would likely be lower today if the RFS had not helped to  establish markets. For example, four experts and one industry  stakeholder representative that we interviewed hypothesized that if the  RFS were repealed, refiners would continue to blend ethanol into fuel,  although two experts and one stakeholder representative acknowledged  that less ethanol would probably be blended without the RFS. In contrast,  one expert indicated that the RFS provides a safety net for the ethanol  industry but that this safety net may not be needed anymore.", "In addition, according to EPA officials, the vast majority of the corn-starch  ethanol used to date has been produced by so-called grandfathered  plants\u2014plants in operation or under construction before a certain date\u2014 that have been exempt from RFS emissions reductions requirements.  The grandfathered plants have likely limited the ability of the RFS to  achieve greenhouse gas emissions reductions, but this effect has likely  changed over time. Early on, when a higher percentage of grandfathered  ethanol plants used coal as an energy source and had older technologies,  EPA estimates indicated that ethanol from such plants produced more  greenhouse gas emissions than petroleum-based gasoline. However,  most of the experts we interviewed told us that over time grandfathered  plants have upgraded technology to remain economically competitive and  have converted to natural gas as an energy source, resulting in industry- wide efficiency improvements that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  These experts indicated that such upgraded plants do not likely have  significantly different emissions than the newer plants subject to RFS  emissions reductions requirements. Little quantitative information is  available to compare the difference between greenhouse gas emissions  associated with grandfathered plants and those associated newer plants.", "Finally, experts we interviewed disagreed on whether ethanol produced  today generally complies with the RFS statutory requirement to reduce  lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent relative to those of  petroleum-based gasoline, which affects the extent to which the RFS has  influenced greenhouse gas emissions. Of the 11 experts commenting on  the topic, approximately half said that ethanol produced today likely met  the 20 percent RFS greenhouse gas reduction requirement. Most of these  experts pointed to recent lifecycle analysis studies. Recent studies have  found that, relative to petroleum-based gasoline, corn-starch ethanol  could reduce lifecycle emissions by 19 to 48 percent. While there are  limitations and uncertainty associated with all lifecycle analyses, most  experts we interviewed said that the models used for lifecycle analyses  have improved over time and can provide reasonably accurate estimates  of certain components of direct lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, such  as emissions associated with the energy used for farming and for  producing the biofuel in a plant.", "Of the roughly half of experts who said that corn-starch ethanol likely  does not meet the RFS greenhouse gas reduction requirements, almost  all pointed to the potential for indirect emissions associated with biofuel  production and use. Indirect emissions are complex to estimate and a  source of uncertainty in lifecycle estimates, but including them could  offset emissions reductions. These indirect emissions can be produced as  the result of broad economic changes associated with increased biofuel  use, including the following:  Indirect land use change. Indirect land use change occurs when  using agricultural land to grow biofuel feedstocks causes the  conversion of previously nonagricultural lands in the United States  and elsewhere in the world to maintain world agricultural production of  food, feed, and fiber.", "Fuel market effects. Though difficult to quantify, expanded biofuel  use may lead to an unintended increase in the global use of  transportation fuel and more greenhouse gas emissions, according to  most of the experts saying that corn-starch ethanol does not meet  greenhouse gas reduction requirements.

We  found in another November 2016 report that the shortfall was the result of  high production costs, despite years of federal and private R&D efforts.  With regard to future advanced biofuel production, most experts we  interviewed for the November 2016 report told us that such production  cannot achieve the statutory targets of 21 billion gallons by 2022 because  the investments and development required to make these fuels more  cost-effective, even in the longer run, were unlikely in the investment  climate at the time.

The number  of RINs that an obligated party must submit to EPA is proportional to the  volume of gasoline and diesel fuel that it produces or imports and  depends on the volumes of biofuel that must be blended with  transportation fuels during the following calendar year as set by EPA. In  accordance with EPA guidelines, a biofuel producer or importer assigns a  unique RIN to a gallon of biofuel at the point of production or importation.  When biofuels change ownership (e.g., are sold by a producer to a  blender), the RINs generally transfer with the fuels.", "When a gallon of biofuel is blended or supplied for retail sale, the RIN is  separated from the fuel and may be used by the obligated party to  demonstrate compliance with the RFS or may be traded, sold, or held for  use in the following year. Some vertically integrated refiners own blending  operations, so they generate RINs that they can use to demonstrate  compliance because they also blend their own fuel. Other refiners do not  blend their own fuel and must purchase RINs to demonstrate compliance.  The latter are called merchant refiners. Since biofuels supply and demand  can vary over time and across regions, a market has developed for  trading RINs. If a supplier has already met its required share and has  supplied surplus biofuels for a particular biofuel category, it can sell the  extra RINs to another entity or it can hold on to the RINs for future use.

However, in 2013, prices for these RINs increased  to over $1.40 per gallon in July before declining to about 20 cents per  gallon as of mid-November.", "Several stakeholders told us at the time that this increase in RIN prices  was primarily due to RFS requirements exceeding the capability of the  transportation fuel infrastructure to distribute and the fleet of vehicles to  use biofuels, a situation referred to as the blend wall. EPA officials told us  at the time that high corn prices, which made ethanol more expensive  relative to gasoline, also contributed to higher RIN prices during this  period. A refiner we spoke with at the time attributed the decline in RIN  prices in the second half of 2013 to EPA\u2019s statements expressing its  desire to address the blend wall. In our report, we noted that while the  RFS applies to all refiners in the same way, the effect of the rise in RIN  prices may depend on each refiner\u2019s situation.

One expert stated that this is because  ethanol prices have become tied with biodiesel prices since the RFS has  required levels above the 10 percent blend wall. EPA officials agreed that  once the 10 percent blend wall was reached, ethanol RIN prices have  often risen to the price of biodiesel RIN prices. More specifically, biodiesel  RIN prices are strongly affected by expectations about whether the  biodiesel tax credit will be allowed to expire, which has often happened.  In fact, EPA has at times explicitly taken the existence of the biodiesel tax  credit into account when making rulings related to the RFS. As a result,  both biodiesel RIN prices and ethanol RIN prices experience volatility. In  general, ethanol RIN prices have closely tracked biodiesel RIN prices for  the last 5 years.", "As we noted in our March 2014 report on petroleum refining, prices for  RINs reflect several factors, including the cost of renewable fuels  compared with the petroleum fuels they displace and the stringency of  annual blending requirements.

These experts argued that in a perfectly competitive fuel  market, the blendstock refiners increase the price of blendstock because  they know that they will need to pay for the RINs. At the same time, the  retail gasoline blenders are able to save costs related to ethanol because  of the value they receive for selling the RINs. In practice, according to  experts, the market may not be perfectly competitive, so it is possible that  RINs add from 1 to 10 cents to the retail price of gasoline in some parts of  the country.

As we reported in our November 2016 report on  the RFS, some experts we spoke with at the time identified reducing  RIN fraud and price volatility as a federal action that could  incrementally encourage investment in advanced biofuels.  Specifically, these experts said that a lack of transparency in the RIN  trading market has led to an increased risk of fraud and increased  volatility of RIN prices. Because RINs are essentially numbers in a  computerized account, there have been opportunities for fraud, such  as double counting RINs or generating RINs for biofuels that do not  exist. For example, in our March 2014 report on petroleum refining  we reported that EPA had issued several notices of violation alleging  that five companies generated invalid RINs without producing  qualifying renewable fuels. EPA officials told us that, since that time,  EPA has made additional notices of violation, although many pertain  to actions taken prior to March 2014.", "Since the start of the RFS, EPA has alleged that approximately  382,524,480 RINs are invalid. Furthermore, obligated parties that  inadvertently purchase fraudulent RINs lose the money spent to  purchase them, must purchase additional RINs to meet their  obligations, and face additional costs. This has a disproportionate  effect on small refiners, according to our November 2016 report.  Whereas large obligated parties\u2014in particular, vertically integrated  refiners that typically own blending operations\u2014can generate RINs by  blending fuel, small refiners do not blend fuel, must purchase their  RINs on the market to meet their obligations, and are therefore more  likely to be adversely affected by fraudulent RINs.", "To address concerns over these issues, EPA established an in-house  trading system called the EPA Moderated Transaction System  (EMTS). EPA officials believe that this system provides significant  capabilities over prior reporting tools used to implement the RFS,  allowing enforcement to more quickly identify potential RFS violations  versus entry errors that were common with pre-EMTS RFS reporting.  EPA officials also informed us of a voluntary quality assurance  program intended to provide obligated parties a program to ensure  that RINs entering commerce are valid. However, EPA has  maintained that verifying the authenticity of RINs is the duty of  obligated parties.", "Distribution of compliance costs. In our March 2014 report on  petroleum refining, we reported that, according to EPA, refiners  experience the same compliance costs regardless of whether they are  vertically integrated refiners or merchant refiners that purchase RINs  for compliance. However, we also reported that the views of several  stakeholders differed from EPA\u2019s. In that regard, in a 2011 study, the  Department of Energy reported that the degree to which a small  refiner can actively blend refinery production with biofuels could  contribute greatly to the economic hardship incurred from complying  with the RFS. We noted that, while the RFS applies to all refiners in  the same way, effects of rising or falling RIN prices may vary  depending on each refiner\u2019s situation. According to several  stakeholders we interviewed at the time, RFS compliance had been  most difficult for merchant refiners, because they did not blend their  own fuel and had to purchase RINs from others, increasing their costs  of compliance.", "Price volatility. Similarly, according to the experts we interviewed for  our November 2016 report on the RFS, price volatility in RIN  markets had adversely affected small refiners in particular and led to  uncertainty among investors. While most RINs are bought and sold  through private contracts registered with the EMTS, as we mentioned  previously, RINs are also traded in markets. Some experts that we  interviewed for the November 2016 report told us that price volatility  may have been due, in part, to nonobligated parties speculating in  these markets. Such price fluctuations introduced uncertainty for small  refiners about the costs of compliance with the RFS because they had  to purchase their RINs on the market.", "Placement of the point of obligation. In our November 2016 report  on the RFS, we reported that according to some experts, blenders  should be the obligated parties instead of importers and refiners.  According to some of these experts, when EPA designed the RFS, it  placed the obligation for compliance on the relatively small number of  refiners and importers rather than on the relatively large number of  downstream blenders in order to minimize the number of obligated  parties to be regulated and make the program easier to administer.", "However, these experts told us that obligating refiners and importers  has not worked to incentivize investors to expand infrastructure to  accommodate higher ethanol blends. One expert we spoke with  stated that because blenders are either retailers or sell to retailers,  blenders would be better situated to pass RIN savings along to  consumers. This in turn might encourage demand for higher ethanol  blends and incentivize infrastructure expansion. Some experts told us  at the time that EPA should make RIN market trading more open and  transparent like other commodity markets, which could reduce the  potential for fraudulent RIN activities and reduce RIN price volatility.", "EPA has taken some actions to address these issues. Specifically, EPA  officials we interviewed for this report told us that EPA publishes a variety  of aggregated information on its website each month to promote market  transparency, including RIN generation and use, available RINs, RIN  prices and trade volumes, RIN holdings, and small refinery exemption  information. According to these officials, EPA also requires all RIN trades  to be entered into EMTS from both the buy and sell sides, and only  finalizes a transaction in the system if the buy and sell sides match. EPA  officials said that transparency of aggregated RIN data helps the market  function more efficiently and minimizes price volatility; however, they  acknowledged that many factors contribute to RIN prices and RIN price  changes, and it is impossible to attribute such changes to any single  factor. Furthermore, according to EPA officials, the memorandum of  understanding on RIN market manipulation that EPA has entered into  with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission will also help make RIN  markets more open and transparent.

USDA  asserts that scientific research shows significant effects on greenhouse  gas emissions from blending ethanol into the nation\u2019s fuel supply, based  on the greenhouse gas benefits of ethanol produced using current  technologies relative to gasoline. The objective of our work was to  address the effect to date on greenhouse gas emissions that has been  specifically attributable to the RFS, not whether blending ethanol into the  nation\u2019s fuel supply has effects on greenhouse gas emissions. We report  that the RFS is not the only reason that ethanol is used in the fuel supply,  and that ethanol would have been produced and used in the United  States, even without the RFS. For example, as we noted in the report,  ethanol blended into gasoline provides benefits as an oxygenate, to  prevent air pollution from carbon monoxide and ozone; as an octane  booster, to prevent early ignition, or \u201cengine knock;\u201d and as an extender  of gasoline stocks. As a result, not all greenhouse gas reductions  associated with ethanol use have been the result of the RFS. Drawing  conclusions about the broader impact of ethanol on emissions generally  was not our objective and is not appropriate for a report examining the  impact of the RFS.", "Second, USDA criticized our methodology, which reported experts\u2019 views  on the effect of the RFS on greenhouse gas emissions. USDA stated that  this methodology, by design, could not arrive at a consensus and did not  synthesize the latest research. We chose our methodology, which relied  on expert views supplemented by relevant reported research, because of  its ability to yield more extensive, informative, and supportable answers to  our objective than a narrower literature review, as suggested by USDA.  More specifically, we reviewed much of the literature on this subject, and  used the literature, along with referrals from other experts and  recommendations from the National Academy of Sciences for prior GAO  work, to assist in selecting experts whose expertise included knowledge  of the relevant and most recent research on the issue. We selected  respected experts representing all perspectives to span the disciplines  required to answer our objective and to guard against drawing biased  conclusions. Those experts were aware of all research, even that with  conclusions contrary to their own. The studies that USDA cites do not  represent a wide range of perspectives; they represent the views of a few  studies focused specifically on the lifecycle emissions of ethanol. In  addition, as we indicate, the perspectives we obtained from industry  stakeholders were not used to support our findings on the effects of the  RFS on greenhouse gas emissions, as USDA implies. Rather,  stakeholders\u2019 views were used to inform some of our examples and  corroborate some aspects of the experts\u2019 views\u2014we attribute information  to the stakeholders in these instances. The consensus we found among  experts representing diverse perspectives was that the RFS has likely  had a limited effect on greenhouse gas emissions to date and that the  program is unlikely to meet its future greenhouse gas emissions reduction  goals.", "Third, USDA commented that our conclusion that the RFS likely had  modest impacts on gasoline prices should be augmented by a discussion  of the volatility of gasoline prices. USDA\u2019s comments appear to imply that  the changes in prices we found are even smaller or less impactful on  consumers because overall gasoline prices are themselves volatile. This  is not an accurate interpretation of what we found. For example,  increased prices in non-Midwest states represent additional expenditures  on gasoline and consequent reductions in other household spending.

This suggests nationwide factors explain much of  the variation in retail gasoline prices across states over time. The  available data are not sufficiently rich to allow us to reliably disentangle  the separate effects on retail gasoline prices of various nationwide  factors, such as, perhaps, changes in crude oil prices, demand for  gasoline, and the roll-out of the RFS.
