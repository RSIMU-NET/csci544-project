In response, the Department of Energy (DOE) began a cleanup program. In 2000, GAO reported that DOE faced significant challenges in cleaning up the site and that it was doubtful that the cleanup would be completed as scheduled by 2010 and within the $1.3 billion cost projection. GAO was asked to determine (1) the amount of money DOE has spent on the site, the purposes for which it was spent, and the estimated total costs for the site; (2) the status of DOE cleanup efforts; and (3) the challenges GAO previously identified that continue to be issues for DOE."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["From fiscal year 1988 through 2003, DOE spent $823 million (in 2002 dollars) at the Paducah site. Of this total, DOE spent about $372 million (45 percent) for a host of operations activities, including general maintenance and security; $298 million (36 percent) for actions to clean up contamination and waste; and $153 million (19 percent) for studies to assess the extent of contamination and determine what cleanup actions were needed. DOE currently projects that the cleanup will take until 2019 and cost almost $1.6 billion to complete--9 years and about $300 million more than DOE's earlier projection. The $1.6 billion, however, does not include the cost of other DOE activities required at the site after the plant ceases operations, including final decontamination and decommissioning of the plant and longterm environmental monitoring. DOE estimates these activities will cost almost $5 billion and bring DOE's total costs at the site, including the $823 million already spent, to over $7 billion through 2070 (in 2002 dollars). DOE has made some progress in cleaning up contamination and waste at Paducah, but much of the work remains to be done. For example, while DOE has removed about 4,500 tons of scrap metal, almost 50,000 tons of contaminated scrap metal remain. Similarly, while DOE's pilot test of a new technology for removing the hazardous chemical trichloroethene (TCE) from groundwater at the site had promising results--removing about 99 percent of the TCE in the test zone--the technology will not be fully implemented for more than a year. Two of the four challenges GAO identified in 2000--DOE's plans to use untested technology and questionable assumptions that funding for the cleanup would increase--no longer pose the impediment to the cleanup they once did. Two others--uncertainty over the scope of the cleanup and difficulty obtaining timely stakeholder agreement on the cleanup approach--are the principal challenges that remain. First, the actual scope of the cleanup is not yet known. As a result, any additional cleanup actions, the costs of those actions, and the time frame for DOE to implement them are also unknown. Second, DOE and the regulators--the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Kentucky--have had difficulty agreeing on an overall cleanup approach, as well as on the details of specific projects. Over time, these disagreements have undermined trust and damaged the parties' working relationship. After involving EPA and Kentucky early in the cleanup planning process, as it has done successfully at other sites, DOE officials discontinued this approach early in 2001, due in part to concerns about the growing cleanup scope, associated costs, and that the planned actions were excessive in relation to the risk. The result was an almost 2-year dispute that delayed progress. This poor working relationship has also prevented the parties from quickly reaching agreement on the technical details of specific projects. Unless DOE and the regulators can reach and maintain agreement on key aspects of the cleanup and quickly resolve technical differences, progress at Paducah could continue to be plagued by delays."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The federal government\u2019s uranium enrichment plant at Paducah, Kentucky,  has a long history of contamination problems.  The plant, which enriches  uranium for commercial nuclear power plants, is located on about 3,500  acres in western Kentucky and continues to operate under a lease to a  private company, the United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC).  Plant  operations have contaminated the site over time with radioactive and  hazardous substances, including technetium-99 (a radioactive fission  product), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), uranium, and volatile organic  compounds such as trichloroethene (TCE).  In 1988, after contaminated  groundwater was found in nearby residents\u2019 wells, a sitewide review  identified contaminated surface water and soils within and outside the site.   As a result, the Department of Energy (DOE) began a cleanup program to  identify and remove these hazards.  DOE\u2019s Office of Environmental  Management has overall responsibility for the site cleanup being performed  by its contractor, Bechtel Jacobs.  Other stakeholders include the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Commonwealth of  Kentucky (Kentucky), both of which have regulatory responsibilities and  participate in cleanup decisions.", "In April 2000, prompted by continuing congressional concerns, we reported  that DOE faced significant challenges in cleaning up the Paducah site.   These challenges included (1) the planned use of unproven technologies to  treat TCE contamination; (2) assumptions that annual federal funding for  the cleanup would increase; (3) uncertainties about the nature, extent, and  sources of the contamination to be cleaned up; and (4) optimistic  assumptions about reaching timely agreement with both EPA and state  regulators on issues such as cleanup levels, strategies, and priorities that  could affect DOE\u2019s ability to meet its milestones.  Given these challenges,  we stated that it was uncertain that the cleanup could be completed as  scheduled by 2010 and within the $1.3 billion cost projection, which  excluded other DOE activities such as the final decommissioning and  decontamination of the uranium enrichment plant.", "As directed by the conference report for DOE\u2019s 2003 appropriations, and  because of the Committees\u2019 ongoing concerns regarding the limited  progress in cleaning up the site, this report discusses (1) the amount of  money DOE has spent on the Paducah site, the purposes for which the  money has been spent, and the estimated total costs for the site; (2) the  status of DOE efforts to clean up the contamination at the site; and (3)  those challenges we previously identified that continue to be issues for  DOE.  We provided preliminary observations on these issues during our  testimony at a hearing held in Paducah, Kentucky, on December 6, 2003.", "In conducting our work, we met with DOE and contractor officials;  reviewed agency documents involving expenditures, cleanup schedules  and scope, and cleanup challenges; and visited the Paducah site.

The plant\u2014formerly operated by DOE and now  operated by USEC\u2014enriches uranium for commercial nuclear power  reactors.  Since it began operations in 1952, the Paducah plant has  processed, or enriched, more than a million tons of uranium.", "Plant operations over time have introduced to the site radioactive and  hazardous chemical wastes, including technetium-99, PCBs, uranium, and  volatile organic compounds such as TCE.  In past years, a cleaning solvent  containing TCE\u2014much like that previously used by dry cleaners\u2014was  used to degrease parts and equipment.  In the plant\u2019s more than half a  century of operations, these various waste materials have contaminated  the area\u2019s groundwater, surface water, soils, and air.", "The Paducah site cleanup is funded primarily through the Uranium  Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund, which was  established by the Energy Policy Act of 1992.  The fund receives money  from both annual federal appropriations and assessments on commercial  utilities.  Through fiscal year 2003, the Paducah site had received from the  fund annual cleanup amounts ranging from $35.9 million to $97.2 million.", "The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability  Act of 1980, as amended (CERCLA), governs the cleanup of sites placed on  the National Priorities List\u2014EPA\u2019s list of contaminated sites designated as  highest priority for cleanup. Paducah was placed on the list in 1994.  CERCLA provides broad federal authority to respond directly to releases or  threatened releases of hazardous substances that may endanger public  health or the environment. It stresses the importance of permanent cleanup  remedies and innovative treatment technologies, and it encourages citizen  participation in deciding on how sites should be cleaned up. The Resource  Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended, also comes into play  in governing the Paducah cleanup. While CERCLA generally deals with  cleaning up inactive and abandoned hazardous waste sites, this act  generally governs the safe management and disposal of the huge amounts  of hazardous or other solid wastes that are generated nationwide and are  currently destined for disposal or recycling. The act permits states, rather  than EPA, to assume primary responsibility for implementing its  requirements.", "At Paducah, the key documents governing the cleanup are a federal facility  agreement, the site management plan, and the life cycle baseline.  The  federal facility agreement\u2014among DOE, EPA, and Kentucky\u2014coordinates  the requirements of both CERCLA and the Resource Conservation and  Recovery Act for cleanup activities at Paducah and governs the cleanup.   Under this agreement, the parties developed a site management plan that  lays out DOE\u2019s approach for the cleanup and includes near- and long-term  milestones and projected activities for the site. This plan is updated  annually by DOE and approved by EPA and Kentucky.  DOE also uses a life  cycle baseline to manage the cleanup.  The life cycle baseline contains  detailed information on cleanup projects, cost estimates, and time frames  for completion and is updated frequently by DOE\u2019s contractor to reflect the  evolving nature of the cleanup process.  For this report, we examined the  May 2003 and November 2003 versions of the site management plan and the  September 2002 version of the life cycle baseline.", "DOE\u2019s Office of Environmental Management is responsible for the cleanup  at Paducah, including characterizing, treating, and disposing of waste and  contamination identified during site cleanup.

The two-phase approach consists of a series of early  cleanup actions and studies while the uranium enrichment plant is in  operation and a second series of actions to be implemented after the plant  ceases operations.  The primary objectives of the first phase are to prevent  on- and off-site human exposure\u2014including exposure of plant workers\u2014to  unacceptable risks, and to complete cleanup actions that provide the  greatest opportunity for reducing risks.  The second phase will include final  decontamination and decommissioning of the plant and associated  infrastructure, and an evaluation of the entire site to (1) determine the  effectiveness of cleanup actions taken in phase I; (2) assess residual risks;  and (3) determine what, if any, additional cleanup actions are needed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE Has Spent $823 Million at the Paducah Site; However, Billions of Dollars Will Be Required to Complete DOE Activities at the Site", "paragraphs": ["From fiscal year 1988 through fiscal year 2003, DOE has spent $823 million  (in 2002 dollars) for cleanup and related activities at Paducah.

As figure 2  shows, 45 percent was spent on base operations, 36 percent on actions  taken to clean up contamination and remove waste, and 19 percent on  assessments.", "However, for the past three fiscal years, the percentage of expenditures on  remedial and removal actions has increased to about half of all funds  expended.   This increase can be attributed to increased overall funding for  the cleanup and a smaller percentage of funds being spent on assessments.   Nevertheless, the percentages spent on cleanup and related activities at  Paducah through fiscal year 2003 are similar to those DOE\u2019s Office of  Environmental Management found for all of its cleanup programs: only  about one-third of the environmental management program budget goes  toward actual cleanup and risk reduction work, with the remainder going  to maintenance, fixed costs, and miscellaneous activities, contributing to a  lack of risk reduction and raising costs for DOE\u2019s cleanups.  As a result,  DOE has since begun to implement accelerated cleanup plans at Paducah  and other sites.", "DOE\u2019s current estimate for completing the cleanup at Paducah is almost  $1.6 billion\u2014a $300 million increase over its 2000 estimate\u2014and the  completion date has moved from 2010 to 2019.  The cost increase is due in  part to an expanded project scope since 2000\u2014for example, the inclusion  of DMSAs not previously considered part of the cleanup\u2014as well as  millions of dollars for site operations for each of the nine additional years  of cleanup.  However, according to DOE\u2019s site manager, DOE has not yet  revised its life cycle baseline to reflect the scope changes under the  proposed accelerated cleanup approach and DOE may be able to reduce  the cost of the cleanup.  For example, DOE\u2019s life cycle baseline currently  includes the cost of excavating five burial grounds at a cost of about $550  million, but DOE\u2019s draft site management plan calls only for capping the  burial grounds unless further study indicates that the contamination from  the burial grounds poses a risk above acceptable levels.", "However, the $1.6 billion cleanup estimate does not represent DOE\u2019s total  responsibilities at the site. In addition to cleaning up the contamination  from past activities at the site, DOE will (1) build and operate a facility to  convert more than 38,000 cylinders of depleted uranium hexafluoride  stored at the site to a more stable form; (2) carry out final  decontamination and decommissioning of the uranium enrichment plant  and associated infrastructure once USEC ceases plant operations; and (3)  perform long-term environmental monitoring at the site, which includes  activities such as monitoring groundwater and surface water for residual  contamination.  According to DOE estimates, completing these activities  will cost almost $5 billion in 2002 dollars.  This will bring the total cost of  DOE activities at the site, including remaining cleanup costs and the $823  million already spent, to over $7 billion, in 2002 dollars.

In  spring 2004, DOE will conduct a study to investigate the second largest  TCE source at the site and determine what additional actions are  necessary.  In addition to its actions to address major TCE sources, DOE  has pumped from the ground and treated about 710 million gallons of  groundwater from the contaminated groundwater plumes since our 2000  report to remove TCE and technetium-99 and prevent off-site  contamination.

Since then, several technologies have been evaluated for  treating groundwater for TCE contamination at Paducah, including  permeable treatment barriers and six-phase heating.  According to DOE  officials, removing TCE is the most difficult cleanup task at Paducah.   Specifically, TCE is difficult to treat when it has mixed with groundwater  and soil\u2014it migrates to the bottom of the aquifer making it difficult to  access, and because it dissolves slowly in water, it can contaminate large  quantities of groundwater for long periods of time.  Permeable treatment  barriers, which DOE assumed in 2000 would be the primary treatment  strategy for addressing contaminated groundwater, could not be effectively  installed at Paducah, according to DOE officials, because of unfavorable  soil conditions and potential high costs to maintain the technology.", "Furthermore, such technologies only deal with the contaminated  groundwater plume, not the source of the contamination.  However, DOE  has made progress in testing six-phase heating for removing TCE from the  groundwater and soil at Paducah.  In the six-phase heating process,  electricity is applied to steel rods that have been drilled into the ground to  heat the soil.  When the soil is hot enough that the TCE and groundwater  begin to boil, the resulting vapor is collected and condensed and then  filtered to remove the TCE.  DOE officials told us the results of the test  exceeded their expectations, and their preliminary review of the test  results concluded that the technology should be considered for full-scale  implementation.  DOE officials state that they have submitted a proposed  plan to the regulators for approval and plan to begin full-scale  implementation in 2006.  The officials added that unless problems are  encountered when the process is fully implemented, DOE should be able to  remove the majority of the TCE source.", "In 2000, we also reported that assumptions about future increases in  federal funding for the Paducah cleanup could affect DOE\u2019s ability to meet  cleanup milestones and that, if the planned increases did not occur, the  cleanup could be delayed and costs could increase.  DOE had estimated  that, as the cleanup progressed, its funding would increase from $78 million  in fiscal year 2001 to $307 million in fiscal year 2008.  We now believe these  assumptions were unrealistic considering that funding levels for the  cleanup during the seven fiscal years prior to 2001 averaged only $43  million annually.  Since 2000, DOE has revised its annual funding  assumptions to reflect more consistent and appropriate funding levels.   Currently, DOE estimates its annual funding needs at about $100 million.   DOE\u2019s contractor official for finance stated that annual funding of $100  million is sufficient to complete the cleanup given the scope of work and  the 2019 end date proposed in its fiscal year 2004 draft site management  plan.  In addition, actual annual funding for the Paducah cleanup has  increased significantly in recent years.  In fact, in fiscal year 2003, Congress  appropriated more than DOE\u2019s $100 million request.  However, if cleanup  cost estimates increase, or appropriations for the cleanup are not  maintained at their current level, funding could resurface as a challenge."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Uncertainty Regarding the Scope of DOE\u2019s Cleanup Remains a Challenge", "paragraphs": ["In 2000, we also reported that uncertainties about the contamination yet to  be cleaned up could result in increased cleanup costs.  These uncertainties  remain a challenge, in part, for DOE because its fiscal year 2004 draft site  management plan does not clearly define the entire scope and time frame  for completing the cleanup.  For phase I of the cleanup, DOE has identified  a series of early actions for five of the seven cleanup categories.  Some of  these actions are currently under way, and DOE plans to have them all  completed by 2019.  DOE plans to study the effectiveness of phase I actions  as they are completed.  Phase II of the cleanup will include the final  decontamination and decommissioning of the USEC plant and a  comprehensive sitewide assessment that will evaluate the effectiveness of  all cleanup actions conducted in phase I and assess the need for additional  cleanup actions. For example, DOE\u2019s planning assumption is to cover the  12 burial grounds with soil caps during phase I as a waste management  measure and then monitor the burial grounds to assess the effectiveness of  the caps in containing the waste.  If DOE finds that contamination from  these sites poses an unacceptable risk, DOE may need to excavate some of  the burial grounds, at a cost of about $110 million each, during phase II.   Additionally, since DOE does not plan to remove the foundations and soil  underlying the 17 unused buildings and other structures to be  decontaminated and decommissioned during phase I, additional cleanup  actions may be necessary during phase II if the soil is found to be  contaminated.", "DOE has also not yet determined when phase II will begin.  DOE\u2019s draft site  management plan calls for phase II to begin once the USEC plant ceases  operations.  USEC has recently announced that the plant will operate until  about 2010.  However, DOE\u2019s site manager stated that several options  exist.  For example, rather than begin phase II in 2010, DOE could decide to  postpone the comprehensive sitewide assessment and some phase II  cleanup actions until DOE has completed all of phase I.  Alternatively, DOE  could decide to start final decontamination and decommissioning shortly  after the plant ceases operations in approximately 2010 and conduct phase  II activities concurrently with phase I cleanup actions.  If DOE selects this  option, increases in annual funding would be needed to conduct both  phases of the cleanup simultaneously.  Until DOE decides when phase II  will begin, any additional necessary actions, the costs of those actions, and  the time frame for DOE to implement them are not known."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE, Kentucky, and EPA Have Continued to Have Great Difficulty Agreeing on a Cleanup Approach", "paragraphs": ["In our 2000 report, we stated that DOE\u2019s assumptions about the timely  achievement of regulatory and stakeholder agreement on cleanup levels,  strategies, and priorities were optimistic because the regulators had  already disagreed with some of DOE\u2019s proposed approaches and had not  reached agreement on several contentious issues.  Since then, DOE and the  regulators have continued to have difficulty agreeing on an overall cleanup  approach and individual projects.  As table 2 shows, the draft fiscal year  2004 site management plan is only the latest of several cleanup plans  proposed for the site since 1999, all of which have differed significantly in  terms of costs, scope, and time frames for cleanup and were intended as  solutions to problems at the site.  According to DOE\u2019s site manager, DOE  has revised its plans for Paducah to incorporate additional scope and  ensure that the requirements of the two statutes that govern the cleanup  were met.  On the other hand, EPA and Kentucky officials told us that these  frequent changes have frustrated them and undermined their confidence  that DOE would adhere to an agreed-to plan and achieve progress in  cleaning up the site.  As a result, their working relationship has  deteriorated, slowing cleanup progress.", "The most significant example of the parties\u2019 inability to reach and maintain  agreement has been a dispute over the fiscal year 2001 site management  plan that lasted from June 2001 to April 2003 and slowed overall cleanup  progress.  The dispute began when DOE headquarters decided they could  no longer support the site management plan assumptions.  According to  Kentucky officials, this site management plan was developed  collaboratively by high-level officials from DOE, EPA, and Kentucky who  agreed on an overall cleanup approach.  In addition, a midlevel working  group was developed, called the Core Team, with representatives from  DOE, EPA, and Kentucky who examined the technical requirements to plan  individual projects.  These two groups identified a number of cleanup  actions for implementation, and the parties successfully agreed on the  fiscal year 2001 site management plan.  However, as a result of the  increased cleanup scope identified by the Core Team, the resulting increase  in costs, and DOE\u2019s Top-to-Bottom Review, DOE headquarters questioned  whether the planned cleanup actions were excessive in relation to the risk  to human health and the environment and requested additional time from  the regulators to further review the site management plan.  The regulators  denied the request.  Because of its continuing concerns that the planned  cleanup actions were excessive, DOE subsequently discontinued this  collaborative approach, removed decision-making authority from the Core  Team, and reduced the regulators\u2019 role to reviewing DOE\u2019s proposals.   According to Kentucky officials, DOE also limited communication between  DOE technical staff and the regulators.", "While DOE and Kentucky have made some progress in addressing near- term cleanup impediments, the three parties continue to have difficulty in  reaching agreement on the overall approach.  DOE and Kentucky signed a  letter of intent in August 2003, followed in October 2003 by an agreed order  that resolved all outstanding Kentucky environmental compliance  violations pending against the department.  The letter of intent also  commits the two parties to promote an accelerated cleanup of the site,  which is reflected in the draft fiscal year 2004 site management plan.   Nevertheless, according to DOE\u2019s site manager, DOE and the regulators are  still negotiating the fiscal year 2004 site management plan, submitted by  DOE on November 15, 2003.  In February 2004, DOE received and  responded to formal comments from EPA and Kentucky, and submitted a  second draft of the site management plan to the regulators for review.  It is  uncertain when the 2004 site management plan, which was to be  implemented during fiscal year 2004, will be finalized.  Furthermore, as  discussed earlier, many more decisions about the cleanup\u2019s scope and  DOE\u2019s approach will require agreement by the three parties throughout the  life of DOE\u2019s cleanup efforts.  Early involvement by all three parties could  be helpful in avoiding similar lengthy and unproductive cycles of  negotiations over the annual site management plans in the future.", "Involving the regulators early in planning the overall cleanup approach and  specific projects has been a key element of DOE\u2019s good working  relationship with regulators at other DOE sites.  For example, at Rocky  Flats in Colorado, DOE involves the regulators when updating the site  management plan and developing individual projects.  This allows  concerns to be communicated and addressed early in the process.   According to officials at Colorado\u2019s Department of Public Health and  Environment, this has reduced the amount of time needed for regulatory  reviews, since the number of \u201ccomment and revise, comment and revise\u201d  cycles has been reduced.  Colorado state officials also told us that a  successful working relationship requires up front and continual  communication beyond just reviewing already developed documents and  proposals.  Additionally, they stated that a consultative process is an  evolving process and must be worked through in good faith by all parties.", "Both EPA and Kentucky officials believe that their early involvement would  aid cleanup progress at Paducah, such as early involvement in developing  the annually submitted site management plan.  EPA and Kentucky officials  told us that they have been frustrated by their exclusion from the planning  process for both the overall cleanup approach and specific projects and  feel that the current process is more time-consuming than if they were  involved early in the process.  Not being involved in the planning process  reduces their role to reviewing DOE\u2019s project proposals and making  comments on those proposals.  Comments on proposals often necessitate  more than one revision cycle.  Multiple revisions can cause schedule  changes and delays because DOE\u2019s schedule for each project assumes only  one revision to respond to regulators\u2019 comments.  At a December 6, 2003,  hearing before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources in  Paducah, the Secretary of Kentucky\u2019s Natural Resources and  Environmental Protection agency encouraged all parties to revisit the Core  Team approach.  He urged that a collaborative team be created and  empowered to work effectively toward meaningful action.   However,  DOE\u2019s site manager cautioned that such an approach would not necessarily  hasten decision making, but agreed that early discussion of technical  details could possibly help improve formal submission of DOE cleanup  proposals to the regulators.", "The poor working relationship between DOE and the regulators has also  prevented them from quickly reaching agreement on technical details of  specific projects.  According to Kentucky officials, DOE proposed using  existing data about the north-south diversion ditch\u2014a major wastewater  conduit from the plant\u2014to determine whether soil from the ditch could be  disposed of in an on-site landfill.  However, Kentucky\u2019s response to DOE\u2019s  proposal was that these data were not sufficient because the samples were  not representative of all the areas where waste entered the ditch.  It took  DOE and Kentucky 5 months to agree on a sampling plan.  Similarly, DOE  and Kentucky disagreed over whether available data demonstrated that the  risk reduction to be obtained by installing sedimentation basins was  significant enough to warrant their installation.  In 2000, DOE planned to  install two sedimentation basins at a cost of $4 million each, but the state  wanted four basins.  Currently, DOE\u2019s position is that it does not believe  that available data indicates any sedimentation basins are needed, but has  agreed to collect additional data and install basins if new information  warrants it.  DOE and Kentucky are still negotiating the amount and type of  data required to determine whether the basins are needed.", "As the cleanup progresses and individual projects are designed and  implemented, DOE and the regulators will continue to have to reach  agreement on the specifics of these projects.  Given the past technical  disagreements and the vast scope of work remaining at Paducah, additional  technical issues such as those experienced with the north-south diversion  ditch and the sedimentation basins are likely to arise in the future.   However, DOE and the regulators do not currently use any mechanisms  such as external technical peer reviews to assist them in resolving  technical disputes in a timely manner.  A 1997 National Academy of  Sciences report on the use of peer review by DOE\u2019s Office of Science and  Technology cited several benefits of using such reviews to help resolve  technical disagreements that could apply to Paducah.  According to the  report, peer reviews   provide an effective way to increase the technical quality of projects,  thereby enhancing the credibility of project decisions;   add confidence that those decisions are based on the best scientific and  technical information available; and   introduce independent experts to a project who can recognize  previously unrecognized technical strengths and weaknesses, challenge  the status quo, and identify ways to improve the project that may have  been overlooked.", "DOE and EPA officials told us that they believe the use of peer reviews  could help resolve technical disagreements at the site.  Kentucky officials  told us that while they believe such reviews have value, they would not  want the results of a review to usurp the state\u2019s regulatory decision-making  authority."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["While some progress has been made in cleaning up the site and addressing  previously identified challenges, DOE still faces significant challenges in  completing the cleanup at Paducah.

During two visits to the Paducah site, we interviewed the  representative from Bechtel Jacobs responsible for finance, reviewed  expenditure and project data from 1988 through 2003, and estimated out- year expenditures.  Specifically, we obtained and analyzed historic and  estimated expenditures for the major expenditure categories of the  cleanup\u2014remedial and removal actions, environmental risk assessments,  base operations, and their subcomponents\u2014as well as cost estimates for  other activities required to close the site, including final decontamination  and decommissioning of the uranium enrichment process plant, and long- term environmental monitoring at the site.  We reported all 1998-2003  expenditures in 2002 dollars.  To assess the reliability of the DOE cost  information, we interviewed Bechtel Jacobs staff responsible for the  databases containing the data that were provided.
