However,  USDA officials did not provide documentation or other information  supporting such agency-level corrective actions and efforts. Rather, as  discussed in our report, FNS provides technical assistance and support to  the states to help them improve payment accuracy and requires them to  develop state-level corrective actions.

We acknowledge that  given the unique circumstances across federal agencies concerning  improper payments, OMB guidance provides some flexibility for how  agencies are to measure the effectiveness of their corrective actions.

While we acknowledge that OMB guidance does not explicitly require  agencies to demonstrate the impact corrective actions have on the  corresponding root causes of improper payments, agencies are required  to analyze the root causes of improper payments and develop corrective  actions to reduce improper payments. As such, we clarified this portion of  our recommendation to indicate that HHS\u2019s process should clearly  demonstrate the effect corrective actions have on reducing improper  payments, to better align with the purpose of corrective action plans. We  also made this revision to our recommendations to USDA, Education, and  SSA.", "In its written comments, VA stated that PSAS supported improper  payments statutory requirements by completing annual audit reviews,  identifying root causes, and developing a national program action plan to  reduce improper payments. VA also stated that PSAS reduced improper  payments from 39.7 percent in fiscal year 2018 to 2.1 percent in fiscal  year 2019 and continues to make improvements through enhanced audit  reviews and consultation with PSAS sites.", "In its written comments, SSA stated that it concurs with our  recommendation and will determine the most cost-effective strategies to  remediate the underlying causes of payment errors and monitor,  measure, and revise the strategies as needed. The actions SSA  described, if implemented effectively, would address our  recommendation.", "In emailed comments, the Assistant Director of Treasury\u2019s Risk and  Control Group neither concurred nor disagreed with our  recommendations. In regard to our recommendation to update its strategy  for addressing root causes of EITC improper payments, Treasury stated  that each year it indicates in its corrective action plan that IRS will  continue to work with Treasury to develop legislative proposals that will  improve refundable credit compliance and reduce erroneous payments.  Treasury also stated that its fiscal year 2020 budget request included two  legislative proposals that may improve refundable credit compliance and  reduce erroneous payments and that both proposals have been in the  President\u2019s Budget for several years now. We acknowledge these  legislative proposals in our report, and note that although Treasury has  made certain legislative proposals, it has not made proposals to  specifically help address EITC eligibility criteria issues. Additionally, as  noted in the report, Treasury\u2019s strategy does not include identifying and  proposing additional legislative changes needed to help reduce EITC  improper payments. Therefore, we continue to believe that our  recommendation to Treasury is valid to help ensure that Treasury  addresses EITC eligibility issues, which Treasury identifies as the primary  root cause for EITC improper payments.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the  Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Education, the Secretary of  Health and Human Services, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary  of Veterans Affairs, the Commissioner of the Social Security  Administration, and other interested parties.
