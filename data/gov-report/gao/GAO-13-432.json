By delaying the start of product development, the  program increased the amount of technical knowledge it plans to  achieve prior to committing to development. Additionally, the program  is leveraging competition among contractors during the technology  development phase, which we reported in April 2012 increases  technical innovation. Program management officials stated they  have already seen benefits from this competition. For example, they  stated they have a better understanding of the program\u2019s progress,  performance possibilities for the missile, and risks associated with  those possibilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MDA Continues Risky Acquisition Strategies for Six Other Programs, Some Already Resulting in Cost and Schedule Disruptions", "paragraphs": ["Despite significant cost and schedule disruptions resulting from elevated  acquisition risks in the Aegis BMD SM-3 Block IB, GMD, and THAAD  programs, MDA continues to follow high risk acquisition strategies for its  Aegis Ashore, PTSS, and Targets and Countermeasures programs. We  reported in April 2012 that the Aegis BMD SM-3 Block IB, GMD, and  THAAD programs discovered problems during developmental testing\u2014 and after production had begun\u2014which delayed planned deliveries to the  warfighter, increased costs, and affected MDA\u2019s supplier base. In  addition, for the Aegis BMD SM-3 Block IB and GMD programs, these  issues also affected the performance of delivered missiles and created  pressure to keep producing to avoid work stoppages even when problems  were discovered in testing. In fiscal year 2012, the SM-3 Block IB and  GMD programs continued to work on the issues that disrupted their  production, but the THAAD program was able to overcome most of its  issues. The Aegis Ashore and PTSS programs are also undertaking high  risk acquisition strategies that include premature commitments to  production that could result in schedule delays, cost increases, and  performance shortfalls. Additionally, the Targets and Countermeasures  acquisition strategy is adding risk to an upcoming major operational flight  test because it is planning to use undemonstrated targets in this complex  and costly test involving multiple MDA systems.", "In 2012, the Aegis BMD SM-3 Block IB was able to partially overcome the  production and testing issues exacerbated by its concurrent development  and production strategy. MDA prematurely began purchasing SM-3 Block  IB missiles beyond the number needed for developmental testing in 2010.  In 2011, developmental issues arose when the program experienced a  failure in its first developmental flight test and an anomaly in a separate  SM-3 Block IA flight test, in a component common with the SM-3 Block  IB. As a result, production was disrupted when MDA slowed production of  the SM-3 Block IB interceptors and reduced planned quantities from 46 to  14. In 2012, the program was able to successfully conduct two flight tests  which allowed the program to address some of the production issues by  demonstrating a fix made to address one of the 2011 flight test issues.  However, development issues continue to delay the program\u2019s fiscal year  2012 schedule and production. For example, MDA experienced further  difficulties completing testing of a new maneuvering component\u2014 contributing to delays for a third flight test needed to validate the SM-3  Block IB capability and also subsequently delaying a production decision  for certain components from December 2012 to February 2013.", "In order to avoid further disruptions to the production line, the program  plans to award the next production contract for some missile components  needed for the next order of 29 SM-3 Block IB missiles in February  2013\u2014before the third flight test can verify the most recent software  modifications. The program then plans to award the contract to complete  this order upon conducting a successful flight test planned for the third  quarter of fiscal year 2013.The program is at risk for costly retrofits,  additional delays and further production disruptions if issues are  discovered during this flight test.", "The GMD program continues to have production delays and cost  increases intensified by its concurrent development and production  strategy. In order to meet a presidential directive to field a limited  capability to defend the United States, MDA simultaneously developed,  produced and fielded the GMD system. In 2004, the agency fielded five  GMD interceptors configured with the program\u2019s initial kill vehicle design  referred to as the Capability Enhancement-I (CE-I) prior to completing  development and testing. Although MDA had not yet fully completed  development or demonstrated the full capability of these initial  interceptors, in 2004 it committed to another highly concurrent acquisition  strategy to develop, produce, and field additional interceptors with an  upgraded kill vehicle known as the Capability Enhancement-II (CE-II).  MDA proceeded to concurrently develop, manufacture and deliver 12 of  these interceptors before halting manufacturing and delivery of  interceptors due to a second flight test failure in December 2010. To  address the causes of the failure, the program redesigned a component  in the kill vehicle\u2019s guidance system and is also planning to implement  some changes to the firmware associated with it. MDA planned to  conduct two flight tests in 2012 to demonstrate the new design and  resume manufacturing the interceptors. While the program was unable to  conduct either test as planned, MDA conducted the first resolution test in  January 2013, a non-intercept test, known as Control Test Vehicle-01.", "While initial indications are that all components worked as intended, at  the time of this review, analysis was ongoing.", "We reported in April 2012 that the discovery of the design problem while  production was already under way increased MDA costs to demonstrate  and fix CE-II capability from approximately $236 million to over $1.2  billion. This cost increase was due to the added costs of additional flight  tests including the costs of the target and test-range, investigating the  failure, developing failure resolutions, and fixing the already delivered CE- II missiles. Costs continue to grow because MDA has had to further delay  the next CE-II intercept test originally planned for fiscal year 2012.  Moreover, at the time of this review, the next CE-II intercept test date is  yet to be determined as MDA is considering various options, including  adding another flight test.", "As we reported in April 2012, problems encountered while THAAD was  concurrently designing and producing interceptors led to slower delivery  rates of interceptors for the first and second THAAD batteries. During  fiscal year 2011 after several years\u2019 delay, 11 of the expected 50  operational interceptors were delivered. In fiscal year 2012, after a 15- month delay and increased costs, the program was able to deliver the  remainder of the interceptors needed for the first two batteries after  completing necessary testing of a safety device.", "The Aegis Ashore program, as we reported in April 2012, initiated product  development and established cost, schedule, and performance baselines  prior to completing the preliminary design review. Further, we reported  that this sequencing increased technical risks and the possibility of cost  growth by committing to product development with less technical  knowledge than recommended by acquisition best practices and without  ensuring that requirements were defined, feasible, and achievable within  cost and schedule constraints. In addition, the program committed to buy  components necessary for manufacturing prior to conducting flight tests  to confirm the system worked as intended. As a result, any design  modifications identified through testing would need to be retrofitted to  produced items at additional cost. However, the MDA Director stated in  March 2012 that the Aegis Ashore development is low risk because of its  similarity to the sea-based Aegis BMD. Nonetheless, this concurrent  acquisition plan means that knowledge gained from flight tests cannot be  used to guide the construction of Aegis Ashore installations or the  procurement of components for operational use.", "The PTSS program approved its third acquisition strategy in October  2012, and continues to include several important aspects of sound  acquisition practices, such as competition and short development time  frames. However, it also contains overlap between development and  production. The PTSS program plans to finalize the satellite design,  select a manufacturer, and commit to producing components for the next  two operational satellites\u2014all while a laboratory team develops and  manufactures the first two satellites. This approach will not enable  decision makers to fully benefit from the knowledge about the design to  be gained from on-orbit testing of the laboratory-built satellites before  committing to the next industry-built satellites. Also, these first four  satellites will be operational satellites, forming part of the operational nine  satellite constellation until they are replaced between 2025 and 2027. As  a result, if on-orbit testing reveals the need for hardware changes, the  program may face cost increases to implement changes, and the  operational constellation may face performance shortfalls as it will not  fully benefit from those changes until the initial four satellites are  replaced.", "MDA\u2019s first use of a new target in its upcoming major operational flight  test is adding risk to that test.

The  risk of this test is higher than it would otherwise be because MDA is using  newly designed medium-range targets for the first time instead of first  demonstrating them in a less complex and expensive scenario. Using  these new targets puts this major test at risk of not being able to obtain  key information should the targets not perform as expected.  Developmental issues with this new medium-range target as well as  identification of new software requirements have already contributed to  delaying the test, which was originally planned for the fourth quarter of  fiscal year 2012 and is now planned for the fourth quarter of fiscal year  2013."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Challenge: Ensure Program Baselines Support Oversight", "paragraphs": ["While MDA made substantial improvements to the clarity of its reported  cost and schedule baselines in fiscal year 2012, the information  underlying these baselines is not yet sufficiently reliable.

We reported in March 2011 that MDA\u2019s schedule  and resource baselines had several issues with clarity that limited their  usefulness for oversight such as only reporting portions of life cycle  costs. In that report, we recommended that MDA provide more detailed  explanations and definitions of information included in the resource  baselines, label cost estimates to reflect the content reported and explain  any exclusions, and include all sunk costs in all of its cost estimates and  baselines. MDA concurred with two of these recommendations but stated  that it did not intend to include sunk costs into its unit costs for Targets  and Countermeasures because, based on the extensive reuse of  previous missile components in the targets program, including all sunk  costs would not reflect MDA program costs accurately. Congress, in the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, added more  detailed requirements for the contents of MDA\u2019s acquisition baselines.", "MDA addressed many issues affecting the clarity, consistency, and  completeness of information reported in its BAR baselines by  reporting the full range of life cycle costs borne by MDA in the 2012  BAR resource baselines; defining more clearly what costs are presented in the resource  baselines and also noting and explaining when costs were excluded  from the estimates; and  including costs already incurred in the unit cost for Targets and  Countermeasures so they were more complete.", "In its 2012 BAR, MDA also addressed issues with its schedule baseline  identified in our March 2011 report. For example, we found the BAR  lacked a comprehensive list of planned deliveries and did not report major  changes in planned dates for deliveries. Further, we recommended that  the Secretary of Defense should ensure that MDA, as part of its  acquisition baseline, include (1) a comprehensive list of actual versus  planned quantities of assets that are or were to be delivered each fiscal  year and (2) a report on variances of these quantities by fiscal year and  the reasons for these differences. As a new addition to its 2012 BAR,  MDA addressed this first recommendation by adding a separate delivery  table that provides more detailed information on deliveries and  inventories. However, we are not yet able to assess significant changes  to all of the planned delivery dates reported in the 2012 BAR because this  was the first year that the information was reported in this format.", "To provide further insight into its reported baselines, MDA also added a  list of significant decisions made or events that occurred in the past  year\u2014either internal or external to the program\u2014that affected program  progress or baseline reporting. The agency also explained how these  decisions or events affected each program. For example, DOD reduced  AN/TPY-2 radar quantities which shortened the time to complete radar  deliveries. These changes are reflected in the schedule baseline and the  increase in unit costs.

One of the issues with the reliability of these estimates is that they are not  comprehensive because they do not include costs from military services  in reported life cycle costs for its programs. Until MDA\u2019s baselines are  based on reliable information and are comprehensive, they will not be  useful for decision makers to understand progress.", "Although MDA has plans in place, it has made little progress improving  the quality of its cost estimates that support its resource baseline since  we made a recommendation to improve these estimates in our March  2011 report. In that report, we assessed MDA\u2019s life cycle cost estimates  using the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide. This guide is  based on best practices in cost estimating and identifies key criteria for  establishing high quality cost estimates. Our review found that the  estimates we assessed were not comprehensive, lacked documentation,  were not completely accurate, or were not sufficiently credible. For  example, the MDA documentation lacked sufficient evidence to be  considered a high-quality cost estimate.", "In June 2012, MDA completed an internal Cost Estimating Handbook,  largely based on our guide, which, if implemented, could help address  nearly all the shortfalls we identified in 2011. According to MDA\u2019s Director  of Operations, the agency is also assembling an independent cost group  to carry out the processes outlined in its handbook. Because the  handbook was only recently completed, it is too early to assess whether  the quality of MDA\u2019s cost estimates has improved.", "According to our guide, completing and documenting an independent cost  assessment is a key criteria for establishing reliable cost estimates. While  DOD major defense acquisition programs must obtain an independent  cost estimate before advancing through certain major milestones, MDA  has been exempted from these requirements. Nevertheless, DOD has  conducted independent cost estimates for early versions of the Aegis  BMD program, and for portions of the Space Tracking and Surveillance  System, GMD, and THAAD programs. In addition, the Office of the  Director for Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation is currently  completing an independent cost estimate for PTSS that is planned to be  released in the spring of 2013. According to officials from the Office of the  Director for Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation, assessments  have also been completed for the Aegis BMD program elements as part  of a cost estimate for U.S. missile defense in Europe that has not yet  been released. Once these estimates are released, we will review the  Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation Office\u2019s findings related to  them. Independent cost estimates for additional MDA elements will further  improve the credibility of MDA\u2019s estimates.", "In addition, according to our guide, the cost estimate should be  comprehensive. Comprehensive estimates include both government and  contractor costs of the program over its full life cycle, from inception of the  program through design, development, deployment, and operation and  support to retirement. The agency made improvements to its resource  baselines to include all of the life cycle costs funded by MDA from  development through retirement of the program. However, the baselines  do not include the operation and support costs funded by the individual  military services. MDA officials told us in 2011 that they do not consider  military service operation and sustainment funds to be part of a baseline  because the services\u2014not MDA\u2014execute the funds. We recognize that  the services execute these funds; however, they are part of the program\u2019s  life cycle costs. It is unclear what percentage these costs are in the case  of MDA elements because these estimates have not been reported,  however for other programs outside of MDA they can be significant. By  not including military service costs, the life cycle costs for some MDA  programs could be significantly understated.", "Similarly, in our July 2012 report, we used our Schedule Assessment  Guide to assess five MDA program element schedules that support the  baselines. We reported that none fully met the best practices identified in  the guide. Some schedules had major deficiencies. While our analysis  of these five programs cannot be generalized to apply to all MDA  programs, these results are nevertheless significant because a reliable  schedule is one key factor that indicates a program is likely to achieve its  planned outcomes. The Department of Defense concurred with our  recommendations and MDA programs have taken some actions to  improve their schedules. However, MDA has not yet had time to fully  address our recommendations.

As a result, MDA\u2019s baseline reports are not useful  for tracking longer term progress. In contrast, DOD reports longer term  progress for its other major defense acquisition programs. When we  sought to make a longer-term comparison of the latest 2012 unit cost and  schedule estimates against the original baselines set in 2010, we found  that such a calculation could not be made in many instances because the  content of the baselines had been adjusted from year to year in such a  way that the baselines were no longer comparable. For example, a  substantial amount of new program activities and costs were added to the  reported baseline or work activities and costs were moved out of the cost  or schedule baseline and placed into other baselines. In addition, there  were instances where calculating a one-year change provided no insight  into program progress because of these baseline adjustments. Specifics  follow on Aegis Ashore, GMD, and Targets and Countermeasures.", "As we reported in April 2012, the instability of content in the Aegis Ashore  program\u2019s resource baseline obscures our assessment of the program\u2019s  progress. MDA prematurely set the baseline before program  requirements were understood and before the acquisition strategy was  firm. The program established its baseline for product development for  the Romania and Hawaii facilities in June 2010 with a total cost estimate  of $813 million. However 3 days later, when the program submitted this  baseline to Congress in the 2010 BAR, it increased the total cost estimate  by 19 percent, to $966 million. Since that time, the program has added a  significant amount of content to the resource baseline to respond to  acquisition strategy changes and requirements that were added after the  baseline was set. Because of these adjustments, from the time the total  estimated cost for Aegis Ashore in Romania and Hawaii was first  approved in June 2010 at $813 million, it has nearly doubled to its  estimate of $1.6 billion reported in the February 2012 BAR. These major  adjustments in program content made it impossible to understand annual  or longer-term program progress.", "These adjustments also affected the schedule baseline for Aegis Ashore.  For example, many new activities were added to the baseline in 2012. In  addition, comparing the estimated dates for scheduled activities listed in  the 2012 BAR to the dates baselined in the 2010 BAR is impossible in  some cases because activities from the 2010 BAR were split into multiple  events, renamed, or eliminated all together in the 2012 BAR. MDA also  redistributed planned activities from the Aegis Ashore schedule baselines  into several other Aegis BMD schedule baselines. For example, activities  related to software for Aegis Ashore were moved from the Aegis Ashore  baseline and were split up and added to two other baselines for the  second generation and modernized Aegis weapon systems software.  Rearranging content made tracking the progress of these activities  against the prior year and original baseline very difficult and in some  cases impossible. As a result, appendix III contains a limited schedule  assessment of near-term and long-term progress based on activities we  were able to track in the BAR.", "GMD is moving activities and costs from a currently reported baseline to  one that will be reported in the future, thereby obscuring cost growth. The  GMD program\u2019s current baseline represents activities and associated  costs needed to achieve an initial defense of the United States. Although  the program planned to report a new baseline in the 2013 BAR for its next  set of capabilities, it has delayed reporting this baseline by at least one  year.", "Despite significant technical problems, production disruptions and the  addition of previously unplanned and costly work in its current efforts, the  GMD total cost estimate as reported in the resource baseline has  decreased from 2010 to 2012. We reported last year that GMD had a  flight test failure in 2010 which revealed design problems, halted  production, and increased costs to demonstrate the CE-II from $236  million to about $1.2 billion. This cost increase includes retrofit costs to  already-delivered CE-II interceptors. Instead of increasing, the total costs  reported in the BAR resource baseline have decreased because the  program moved activities from out of its reported baseline. By moving  these activities, MDA used the funds that were freed up for failure  resolution efforts instead. In addition, because the baseline for its next  set of capabilities will be defined after these activities have already been  added to it, the additional cost for these activities will not be identifiable.  The full extent of actual cost growth may never be determined or visible  for decision makers for either baseline because of this adjustment.", "MDA removed activities and costs from its Targets and Countermeasures  resource baselines, making it impossible to assess longer term progress.", "For example, costs for common target components, such as re-entry  vehicles and associated objects, which were previously included in the  baselines for medium-range and intermediate-range targets, were  removed and redirected into a separate, newly created baseline for  common components. In addition, the agency also changed the way it  calculated its targets baselines by removing support costs and adding  costs incurred in previous years. While the agency adjusted the  accounting rules retroactively for the 2011 BAR to enable direct cost  comparisons with the 2012 BAR, it is not possible to compare the 2012  BAR baselines with the original baselines set in the 2010 BAR for any of  the targets."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Challenge: Developing and Deploying U.S. Missile Defense in Europe", "paragraphs": ["Developing and deploying new missile defense systems in Europe to aid  in defense of Europe and the United States is a highly complex effort.

Concurrency entails proceeding into product development before  technologies are mature or into production before a significant amount of  independent testing has confirmed that the product works as intended.  Such schedules can lead to premature purchases of systems that impair  operational readiness and may result in problems that require extensive  retrofits, redesigns, and cost increases. A key challenge, therefore, facing  DOD is managing individual system acquisitions to keep them  synchronized with the planned time frames of the overall U.S. missile  defense capability planned in Europe. MDA still needs to deliver some of  the capability planned for the first phase of the U.S. missile defense in  Europe and is grappling with delays to some systems and/or capabilities  planned in each of the next three major deployments.

MDA officials stated they are  working to resolve this issue.", "For Phase 3, some battle management and Aegis capabilities are  currently projected to be delayed and the initial launch of a planned  satellite sensor system\u2014PTSS\u2014is delayed.", "For Phase 4, deployment of the SM-3 Block IIB missile is delayed  from 2020 to 2022, and full operational capability of PTSS is delayed  to no sooner than 2023.", "A key challenge for both the Director of MDA and the warfighter is  understanding the capabilities and the limitations of the systems MDA is  deploying before they are deployed, particularly given the rapid pace of  development. A critical step in this effort is to have the tools\u2014which are  the models and simulations\u2014to perform these integrated and complex  assessments. According to MDA\u2019s Fiscal Year 2012 President\u2019s Budget  Submission, models and simulations are critical to understanding BMDS  operational performance because assessing performance through flight  tests alone is prohibitively expensive and can be affected by safety and  test range constraints. Models and simulations, on the other hand, can be  much less costly and are inherently not subject to the same safety and  test range constraints. However, we have previously reported that MDA  has struggled to develop these tools.", "In August 2009, U.S. Strategic Command and the BMDS Operational  Test Agency jointly informed MDA of a number of system-level limitations  in MDA\u2019s modeling and simulation program that adversely affected their  ability to assess BMDS performance. Since that time, we have reported  that MDA has had difficulty developing its models and simulations to the  point where it can assess operational performance. Over the past few  years, the agency adopted different approaches to try to resolve issues  with its modeling and simulation.", "MDA continues to have difficulty credibly assessing operational  performance using models and simulations. MDA declared the first phase  of U.S. missile defense in Europe operational in December 2011, but did  so without the benefit of all planned supporting data because of problems  with a key modeling and simulation event. MDA officials and officials from  the Operational Test Agency determined that there were too many issues  with the models and simulations in the event for it to be useful for  determining operational effectiveness for the planned configuration.", "More broadly, in their independent 2012 assessments, both the Director,  Operational Test and Evaluation and the BMDS Operational Test Agency  reported a lack of confidence in MDA\u2019s ability to completely and credibly  model BMDS performance using existing models. Once a model or  simulation is deemed credible, it can be used to explore the various  operational conditions and reveal both the capabilities and limitations of  the actual system. Without a full understanding of the capabilities and  limitations of the first phase of U.S. missile defense in Europe, it is difficult  for the warfighter and MDA to understand how the system will work in a  real event or to develop solutions to problems that may arise with the  systems and capabilities that have been delivered.", "MDA recently committed to a new approach in its modeling and  simulation program that officials stated could put them on a path to  credibly model individual programs and system-level BMDS performance  by 2017. To accomplish this, MDA is replacing the two existing simulation  frameworks used for ground testing and performance assessments with  one framework. By using one framework, the agency anticipates data  quality improvements through consistent representations of the threat, the  environment, and communications at the system level. Without  implementing these changes, MDA officials told us their ability to credibly  model BMDS performance by the 2017 time frame, in time to assess the  third phase of U.S. missile defense in Europe, is not possible.", "MDA program officials told us that the next major assessment of U.S.  missile defense in Europe for the 2015 deployment will continue to have  many of the existing shortfalls. As a result, MDA is pursuing initiatives to  improve confidence in the realism of its models in the near term. One of  the agency\u2019s new initiatives involves identifying more areas in the models  where credibility can be certified by the BMDS Operational Test Agency.  A second initiative is focused on resolving the limitations identified jointly  by the Operational Test Agency and U.S. Strategic Command.

At the same time, for over a decade,  MDA has provided Congress with very limited insight into cost and  schedule growth for individual elements. While baseline reporting is more  complete and comprehensive, the fact remains there is no way to track  cost and schedule growth over time using those baselines. This makes it  difficult for Congress to hold MDA accountable and to consider the  wisdom of continuing high risk efforts. Since its inception, MDA has been  operating in an environment of working under tight time frames for  delivering capabilities\u2014first with a presidential directive in 2002 and then  with a presidential announcement in 2009 on U.S. missile defense in  Europe. Although pressure remains to develop and field systems to meet  set time frames and increased threats, we have also reached a critical  juncture in our nation\u2019s ability to afford spending limited funds to fix  problems created by a high risk acquisition strategy.", "GAO has made recommendations over the years aimed at addressing  many of these challenges. We have noted several in this report that have  not yet been acted on. As the new MDA Director works to address the  challenges we have identified, fully implementing two prior  recommendations in particular could prove beneficial. First, our 2009  recommendation to reconsider the testing and validation schedules of  ballistic missile defense systems and ensure they are synchronized with  the development, manufacturing and fielding schedules so that items are  not manufactured for fielding before their performance has been validated  through testing could help reduce the risk of production disruptions.  Second, our 2012 recommendation to make adjustments to acquisition  schedules to reduce concurrency could help reduce the acquisition risks  in the U.S. missile defense in Europe.", "Going forward, as Congress and DOD decide in which new missile  defense programs to invest, they may lack a full understanding of the  cost, technical feasibility, and operational requirements for those  proposed new programs. Performing a robust analysis of alternatives,  while not required of MDA, could be a proactive and beneficial step to  laying a sound basis for determining which systems to pursue. Similarly,  as MDA delivers increasingly complex missile defense systems, it is  critical that it successfully conduct upcoming complex operational flight  tests and gather necessary performance data. Reducing the risks tied to  the first use of new types of targets in less critical tests before they are  used in a major test could help put these programs on a better path to  succeed. Finally, until MDA\u2019s baselines have comprehensive cost  information and are stabilized, the progress of MDA\u2019s individual  acquisitions cannot be assessed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to strengthen investment decisions, place the chosen  investments on a sound acquisition footing, provide a better means of  tracking investment progress, and improve the management and  transparency of the U.S. missile defense approach in Europe, we  recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct MDA\u2019s new Director to  take the following four actions:  1.  Undertake robust alternatives analyses for new major missile defense  efforts currently underway, including the SM-3 Block IIB, and before  embarking on any other major new missile defense programs. In  particular, such analyses should consider a broad range of  alternatives.  2.  Add risk reduction non-intercept flight tests for each new type of target  missiles developed.  3.  Include in its resource baseline cost estimates all life cycle costs,  specifically the operations and support costs, from the military  services in order to provide decision makers with the full costs of  ballistic missile defense systems.  4.  Stabilize the acquisition baselines, so that meaningful comparisons  can be made over time that support oversight of those acquisitions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD provided written comments on a draft of this report. These  comments are reprinted in appendix XI. DOD also provided technical  comments, which were incorporated as appropriate.", "DOD concurred with two of our four recommendations and partially  concurred with the remaining two. DOD concurred with our first  recommendation to undertake robust alternatives analyses for new major  missile defense efforts currently underway and before embarking on any  other major new missile defense programs. However, in its response,  DOD stated that MDA currently performs studies and reviews that provide  outcomes similar to analyses of alternatives formally conducted by other  agencies. While we recognize in our report that MDA performed some  limited analyses that considered alternatives for its newer programs, we  also found that these reviews cannot be considered robust analyses of  alternatives, in part, because the range of alternatives considered were  too narrow. Without a sufficient comparison of alternatives and focus on  technical and other risks, alternatives analyses may identify solutions that  are not feasible and decision makers may approve programs based on  limited knowledge. While many factors can affect cost and schedule  outcomes, we reported in September 2009 that programs that had a  limited assessment of alternatives tended to have poorer outcomes than  those that had more robust analyses of alternatives. A robust analysis of  alternatives can also help ensure that key DOD and congressional  decision makers understand why the chosen system was selected in  order to prioritize limited investment dollars to achieve a balanced BMDS  portfolio. As MDA conducts additional alternatives analyses for new  programs, it is important that they be robust, comparing the costs,  performance, effectiveness, and risks of a broad range of alternatives.", "DOD partially concurred with our second recommendation to conduct risk  reduction non-intercept flight tests for each new type of target missile  developed. In its response, DOD agreed that non-intercept flight tests  may be conducted for each new type of target--but not necessarily on  each individual target developed. DOD stated that the decision to perform  a non-intercept target test must be balanced against cost, schedule, and  programmatic impacts. In addition, DOD stated that MDA\u2019s qualification  tests for key target components and proven quality control processes  gave the confidence necessary for the agency to plan for and launch  targets for the first time as part of a system-level flight test. However,  while there may be exceptions that would need to occur when there is a  critical warfighter need, in general, we remain concerned about the use of  undemonstrated targets during complex, expensive tests. These tests  remain critical to both MDA\u2019s development efforts and to independent  assessors of missile defense performance because they are needed to  demonstrate critical BMDS functions. Whenever possible, we believe  MDA should avoid using undemonstrated targets, particularly for costly  and complex major operational tests, because they add significant risks to  those tests.", "DOD partially concurred with our third recommendation for MDA to  include in its BMDS Accountability Report baselines the full program life  cycle costs, including operations and support costs from military services.  While DOD agreed that decision makers should have insight into the full  life cycle costs of DOD programs, it did not identify how the full life-cycle  costs could be reported to decision makers. DOD further stated that the  BMDS Accountability Report should only include content for which MDA  is responsible and that it did not consider the BMDS Accountability Report  an appropriate forum for including military services operation and support  costs for BMDS elements. However, good budgeting requires that the full  costs of a project be considered when making decisions to provide  resources and, therefore, both DOD and Congress would benefit from a  comprehensive understanding of the full costs of MDA\u2019s acquisition  programs. DOD has reported full operation and support costs to  Congress for major defense acquisition programs where one military  service is leading the development of an acquisition planned to be  operated by many military services. Limiting the baseline reporting for  MDA acquisition programs to only MDA reported costs therefore  precludes a full understanding of DOD\u2019s acquisition commitments,  particularly the resource demands on the military services that will  operate and maintain the planned missile defense weapon systems.  Because MDA already reports the estimated acquisition costs and some  of the operation and support costs for the acquisitions in the annual  BMDS Accountability Report, we believe that annual document to be the  most appropriate way to report the full costs to Congress. We also  continue to believe that including these costs in that report will aid both  departmental and congressional decision makers as they make difficult  choices of where to invest limited resources.", "DOD also concurred with our fourth recommendation to stabilize MDA\u2019s  acquisition baselines so that meaningful comparisons can be made over  time. DOD stated in its response that MDA\u2019s 2013 BMDS Accountability  Report would contain both a one-year comparison between the current  program baselines and the previously reported baselines as well as  provide a longer-term comparison to the initial program baselines, when  appropriate. DOD further stated that it is necessary to recognize that  BMDS baselines change to respond to evolving requirements provided by  other organizations and leaders, from the warfighters to the President, to  counter changing threats. Finally, DOD stated that the MDA Director has  authority to make these adjustments, within departmental guidelines. Our  recommendation is not designed to limit the authority of the MDA Director  to adjust baselines or prevent adjusting baselines when appropriate. As  we reported in March 2005, a new baseline serves an important  management control purpose when program goals are no longer  achievable, because it presents an important perspective on the  programs current status and acquisition strategy. Our recommendation  to stabilize acquisition baselines is designed to address the issues we  found that are within MDA\u2019s control, such as prematurely setting  baselines and decisions to move reported content between various  program baselines. In order for MDA to effectively report longer-term  progress of its acquisitions and provide necessary transparency to  Congress, it will be critical for MDA to address these issues.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense and to  the Director of MDA.

For these programs, we reviewed  documentation of Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and Department of  Defense (DOD) reviews that program management officials considered  similar to an analysis of alternatives, and compared this documentation to  acquisition best practices for analysis of alternatives and DOD acquisition  guidance.

We interviewed officials in MDA\u2019s  Acquisitions Directorate about how the agency is establishing and  managing its internal baselines. We also met with MDA officials in the  Operations Directorate to discuss their progress in adopting cost  estimating best practices based on our Cost Guide. We reviewed  findings from our July 2012 report, which compared MDA program  schedules to best practices in schedule development. In addition, we  examined DOD acquisition policy to discern how other major defense  acquisition programs are required to report baselines and measure  program progress. To gauge MDA element cost and schedule progress,  we compared the resource and schedule baselines as presented in the  2012 BAR to the 2010 baselines presented in the June 2010 BAR. In  order to present consistent cost comparisons for unit costs calculated in  different years, there were instances where it was necessary to convert  unit costs from base year 2010 dollars to base year 2011 dollars. We  performed these conversions using indexes published by the Office of the  Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) in the National Defense Budget  Estimates for Fiscal Year 2011, commonly referred to as the \u201cGreen  Book.\u201d The results of our reviews are presented in detail in the element  appendixes of this report and are also integrated into our findings, as  appropriate.

In October  2012, the program was able to resume accepting deliveries. Some of the  fixes to the issues from the September 2011 failed test are planned to be  demonstrated in the next flight test planned during fiscal year 2013.", "In the past year, the program identified the root cause of the September  2011 flight test failure and incorporated fixes. The failure review team  traced the cause of the failure to an abnormal performance of the third  stage rocket motor during thrust pulses, which control the final maneuvers  of the missile. To address this issue, the program developed a new  version of the second generation Aegis weapons system to control the  amount of time between the pulses. According to the Aegis program  office, these changes will have minimal consequences on missile  performance and ship operations. Although the program successfully re- conducted the failed flight test in May 2012, it did so prior to implementing  the software modifications and altered the scenario to avoid the  malfunction. The program tested the modification in a February 2013  flight test. While the intercept was successful, a thorough assessment of  the test has not yet been issued.", "The program also determined the root cause of the anomaly in the April  2011 SM-3 Block IA flight test. MDA determined that it was caused by a  component of the third stage rocket motor that is common to both the SM- 3 Block IA and SM-3 Block IB missiles. After performing a redesign of the  component that caused the anomaly, the program was able to  successfully flight test this new design in June 2012.", "In addition to verifying these fixes, the program demonstrated important  new capabilities during its two successful fiscal year 2012 SM-3 Block IB  flight tests. Its May 2012 flight test was the first intercept of a short-range  ballistic missile target by the SM-3 Block IB with the second-generation  Aegis BMD weapon system software. The test successfully demonstrated  the capability to assess the success or failure of the intercept in real time,  and gave the program additional insight into the improved capability of the  missile to track and identify objects in space.

The concurrency arose because MDA  prematurely ordered more SM-3 Block IB missiles than needed for  development before completing developmental qualification of a key  component and before confirming the missile worked as intended in flight  testing. Qualification is a step in development in which a component\u2019s  performance is tested in a variety of expected conditions it may  operationally encounter. Qualification of components is normally  completed prior to conducting developmental flight tests and before  beginning production of missiles beyond the number needed for  developmental testing. We made a recommendation in our February 2010  report intended to address this concurrency risk.", "Since that report, as developmental issues arose, MDA had to restructure  both its production and test plans. For example, MDA was forced to  reduce planned SM-3 Block IB quantities from 34 to 25 in fiscal year  2011, to free up funding needed to redesign the TDACS. Then, following  the failure of the first SM-3 Block IB flight test in 2011, MDA established a  new program baseline, and requested an additional $149 million, in part  to investigate the failure, and to implement and assess necessary  modifications. MDA also reduced the 2012 procurement from 46 to 14  missiles, delayed key production milestones by a year or more, and  slowed delivery of SM-3 Block IB missiles already in production,  accepting only missiles necessary for testing until modifications were  validated. While this decision reduced the effects of the ongoing  development issues, MDA\u2019s premature commitment to quantities beyond  those needed for testing had other consequences. Slowing down the  acceptance of SM-3 Block IB deliveries and reducing near-term  production resulted in the need for additional investments to sustain  suppliers of various SM-3 Block IB components. Additionally, once again  the agency needed to extend the production of SM-3 Block IA missiles by  purchasing 14 additional SM-3 Block IAs (a missile that shares many  components with the SM-3 Block IB). MDA originally planned to end the  production of SM-3 Block IAs in 2009 as production of the SM-3 Block IB  began. However, it has needed to extend production three times in 2010,  2011 and 2012 in order to bridge the production gaps. To date, MDA has  contracted for 55 more SM-3 Block IA missiles than originally planned.", "The TDACS qualification was completed in February 2013 after many  delays and additional cost. As we reported in April 2012, MDA only  partially completed qualification testing of this component before  conducting the first unsuccessful SM-3 Block IB developmental flight test  in September 2011. During 2012, the program experienced multiple  issues completing TDACS qualification tests, including a failure in  October. MDA is still determining the cause of the failure. According to  program documentation, this investigation is expected to cost $27.5  million. Although completion of qualification testing had previously been  delayed over a year to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, the recent  issues further delayed the completion to February 2013.", "These qualification issues are contributing to further cost growth, delays  to the third flight test and preventing completion of the manufacturing  readiness review. After the 2011 flight test failure occurred, MDA  originally committed to completing three flight tests and a manufacturing  readiness review prior to making a long lead production decision. The  long lead decision begins the purchase of materials and components that  must be procured earlier in order to maintain a planned production  schedule. While the agency successfully completed two of those flight  tests in 2012, it postponed the third, called FTM-19, to the third quarter of  fiscal year 2013. The program estimates that this delay will cost the  program an additional $16.7 million. MDA also held its manufacturing  readiness review for the next procurement request in May 2012. This  review demonstrated that the manufacturing processes were mature for  most of the SM-3 Block IB components and demonstrated readiness for a  manufacturing rate of two missiles per month. However, the program  could not complete the review due to delays with the TDACS qualification.  TDACS qualification issues have also contributed to delays for a long  lead materiel production decision from December 2012 to February 2013,  at an additional $19 million.", "In order to avoid further disruptions to the production line, MDA plans to  award the next production contract for some components of 29 additional  missiles in February 2013\u2014before the third flight test can verify the most  recent software modifications. According to program documentation,  delaying this decision further until after the next flight test\u2014currently  slated for the third quarter of fiscal year 2013\u2014could result in a  production gap, requiring additional funding to maintain the industrial line.  The program plans to award the contract for up to 29 whole missiles after  the successful performance in the third quarter of fiscal year 2013 flight  test.

However, subsequent MDA analyses demonstrated that  the Romania site was not a good location from a flight path standpoint  for defending the United States with the SM-3 Block IIB; and  the Poland site may require the development of the ability to launch  the interceptor earlier\u2014during the boost phase of the threat missile\u2014 to be useful for defense of the United States.", "MDA technical analysis in 2012 concluded that a ship-based SM-3 Block  IIB in the North Sea is a better location for U.S. homeland defense and it  does not require launch during boost capabilities.

The PTSS satellites  are designed to view ballistic missiles as they fly above the earth\u2019s  horizon. To accomplish this, the satellites will orbit the earth at an altitude  of approximately 930 miles above the earth\u2019s surface. Consequently, the  satellites will pass within the region of one of the earth\u2019s radiation belts  where fast moving protons and electrons can penetrate and damage  sensitive satellite equipment. The Space Tracking and Surveillance  System demonstration satellites currently operate in a similarly high  radiation environment at an altitude of approximately 840 miles and, as  we have previously reported, have experienced multiple problems as a  result. Although program officials anticipate these problems to  occasionally occur and have successfully recovered from all prior  incidents, radiation events have affected the Space Tracking and  Surveillance System satellites\u2019 availability and contributed to an 11-month  delay completing initial check-out for the satellites to reach full capability  after launch. Recently, the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration launched the Van Allen Probes, a space program led by  the same laboratory leading the PTSS design efforts, to explore the  Earth\u2019s radiation belts. These probes may collect data that could help  design PTSS components to protect them against radiation damage. The  Van Allen Probes recently discovered a previously unknown, additional  radiation belt, indicating a more dynamic radiation environment than  previously thought.", "Recognizing the high radiation challenge, the PTSS program is seeking to  develop ways to minimize the effects of radiation damage to components.  While most of PTSS\u2019s technologies are mature, some of the technologies  with less maturity are major components of the satellite\u2019s design. These  technologies have low levels of maturity, in part, because they require  radiation protection at levels that have not yet been demonstrated for  those specific technologies. The program has added the development of  these critical technologies to its high risk list, such as the star tracker, a  component of the guidance and control system that uses stars to track its  orientation, and the focal plane array, a component of the optical payload  that locates and tracks enemy missiles. While some of these technologies  are in early development, the program has undertaken risk reduction  plans to focus development of these technologies. Because these  technologies are critical, if they require additional development for  radiation protection beyond what is already planned, the program could  experience delays, a reduction in system performance, or a reduction in  the satellites\u2019 planned mission life.", "The program expects that over time, the satellites will have some  reduction to their initial performance because it plans to operate satellites  longer than their planned 5-year mission life. During the mission life, the  PTSS satellites are expected to perform the designed functions to  effectively meet the system\u2019s performance requirements. After that 5-year  period, there will be a growing likelihood that operational performance will  be reduced.

However, it  won\u2019t launch replacement satellites for the first two satellites until 2025\u2014 nearly 8 years after they were put in orbit. In fact, all of the satellites in the  constellation will be operated beyond their planned mission life with an  average 8 years in orbit and in some cases, as long as 9.5 years.  Historically, several DOD space systems have continued to operate  several years beyond their planned mission life. For example, the Global  Positioning System Block IIA satellites were designed to last an average  7.5 years but have actually lasted about twice as long. This is largely  because satellites are typically designed with high levels of redundancy  and other reliability measures that ensure performance over a period of  time.", "For PTSS, employing a strategy of leaving satellites in orbit for 8 years  rather than only 5 years will, in the long term, mean that MDA will  purchase, produce, and launch about 16 fewer satellites through 2040 at  a cost savings of several billion dollars. However, it also adds  performance risk for the warfighter. Although other DOD space programs  have planned for satellites to operate past their planned mission life, they  usually wait until they have some on-orbit performance data from  demonstration or similar previous satellites. The PTSS strategy, however,  is based solely on pre-launch engineering and design analysis with  assumptions that may or may not prove to be accurate. For example, the  program estimates satellite reliability to gradually decrease over time  assuming that random failures may occur, but components are not likely  to prematurely wear out. However, if radiation risks do materialize,  satellite components are much more likely to prematurely wear out. Also,  program officials stated they plan to include fewer redundant measures  than prior space systems to reduce cost, weight, power consumption, and  design complexity.

MDA added  this test as a risk reduction exercise for its planned operational test. While  the E-LRALT target performed successfully, the test experienced a minor  delay from September to October 2012 when the new target was unable  to meet the readiness reviews for the original test deadlines.

MDA plans to use its new eMRBM  target for the first time for two of the five targets during this operational  test rather than using it first in a simpler and less costly risk reduction  flight test. Risk reduction flight tests are normally conducted the first time  a system, such as a new target, is tested in order to confirm that it works  before adding other test objectives.

However, the approach soon proved more costly and more  time-consuming than expected. Responding to congressional concern  about these problems and our 2008 recommendations, MDA revised its  acquisition approach in 2009, seeking to increase competition by  returning to a multiple contract strategy with as many as four prime  contractors\u2014one for each separate target class. Shortly after, attempts to  competitively award the first contract were canceled because the bids  received were more expensive than anticipated. MDA completed a  competitive award for an intermediate-range target in 2011 but otherwise  continued to rely heavily on Lockheed Martin for new target types. For  example, in 2011, MDA awarded three new task orders to its prime  contractor for eMRBM targets, a more specialized medium-range target  that will be procured in fewer quantities, and for re-entry vehicles that are  interchangeable among multiple targets.", "MDA is now using parts of both approaches by using its prime contractor  to keep some commonality among new targets it develops, and by issuing  some competitive solicitations for other targets.

In addition, MDA  has continued to pursue additional competitive awards in fiscal years  2012 and 2013. MDA awarded a contract in October 2012 for the first two  intercontinental ballistic missiles needed for future flight tests, and,  according to a program official, also expects to award a contract for a new  medium-range target in April 2013.

Non-recurring costs include the cost to design and develop a target  configuration. Average unit cost is the sum of manufacturing costs for  targets using research, development, test, and evaluation funding divided  by the number of targets delivered. The agency reports that it uses these  nonstandard unit costs because targets are modified to meet specific  threat representations and are consumed in testing.

Non-recurring costs  increased because design issues with the air launch system and  additional testing requirements were added to the program after it  experienced development issues. The average unit cost increased solely  due to a reduction in the quantity which eliminated the opportunity to  purchase them more efficiently. The quantity decreased from 11 to 5  targets between the 2011 and 2012 BARs because the latest agency  testing plan increased the number of intermediate-range targets and  reduced the number of medium-range targets.
