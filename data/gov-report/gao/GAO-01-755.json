From 1991 through 1999, the annual number of reported cases of Lyme disease increased by 72 percent. Although Lyme disease has been reported in 49 states and the District of Columbia, 9 states, mainly in the eastern part of the country, account for 92 percent of the nationally reported cases.

Carriers of Borrelia burgdorferi include the deer tick in the upper Midwest and Northeast and the western black-legged tick on the Pacific Coast, two areas where Lyme disease is considered to be endemic. Lyme disease symptoms generally appear 7 to 14 days after transmission, but this period may range from 3 to 30 days. Manifestations include musculoskeletal, nervous system, or cardiovascular irregularities that are not attributable to any other cause. However, some individuals may have no recognized illness or manifest only nonspecific symptoms, such as fever, headache, fatigue, and muscle pain.

Using surveillance data, CDC conducted epidemiological and ecological studies of disease and tick distribution for many areas of the United States. CDC\u2019s research focused on those areas in which Lyme disease is highly endemic, but some activities were conducted in areas in which Lyme disease may be emerging. For example, CDC conducted research in the south central United States to investigate the emergence of a disease similar to Lyme disease.

For example, it has developed a diagnostic test that can differentiate between those infected with Lyme disease and those who previously would have tested positive because they had been immunized with the Lyme disease vaccine. In addition, because ticks may carry more than one disease, NIH has supported research on the co-infection of Lyme disease patients with Babesia and Ehrlichia. NIAMS has also supported research on diagnostics and has developed a DNA-based diagnostic test for Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium responsible for Lyme disease.", "NIH has also supported research on the treatment of Lyme disease, with an emphasis on chronic Lyme disease. In 1996, NIAID scientists initiated research to identify the clinical characteristics of both acute and chronic Lyme disease. The same year, NIAID entered into a contract to determine the efficacy of antibiotic treatment of chronic Lyme disease. The treatment component of this study was terminated after a scheduled review at the end of fiscal year 2000 because of a finding of \u201cno observed difference\u201d in self-reported improvement between the treatment and the control groups.

One of these was a recommendation by the Senate Appropriations Committee to establish a pediatric Lyme disease program at NIAID\u2019s Clinical Studies Unit at NIH\u2019s Bethesda, Maryland, hospital. According to NIH, because of the invasive nature of the diagnostic tests required as part of the study planned at that facility, it was determined that including pediatric patients would not be appropriate. The second recommendation that NIH did not fully address, also by the Senate Appropriations Committee, was to consider funding a center in the Midwest or Southwest to conduct clinical trials of treatments that would otherwise not be tested. NIH officials told us that they convened a workshop intended to develop information for physicians on the diagnosis of, and therapy for, Lyme disease and issued a request-for- application for research on the diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease.

The only definite confirmation of Lyme disease is the identification of Borrelia burgdorferi from a cultured sample. Although specimens can be biopsied, the procedure is invasive and requires a specific growth medium and observation period, making it impractical for most clinicians. In part because of these disadvantages, the CDC-organized Second National Conference on the Serologic Diagnosis of Lyme Disease, in 1995, recommended a two-step approach for the laboratory confirmation of Lyme disease. It consists of a sensitive Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay or indirect fluorescent-antibody test followed by a more specific Western Blot test. These tests measure the body\u2019s immune response, but they do not directly detect the bacterium. As a result, vaccination, antibiotic use, co-infection, residual antibodies, and duration since the tick bite all can affect the accuracy of the tests. Even among those patients with a history of tick bite, the characteristic rash, and other characteristic symptoms, only about 30 percent are positive in the first weeks of infection using the CDC-recommended two-step approach.

The trial seeks a comprehensive clinical, microbiological, and immunological assessment of patients who have suspected chronic Lyme disease despite previous therapy with intravenous antibiotics.

The study at Stony Brook examines how well antibiotics work in reducing fatigue symptoms in patients with post-Lyme disease syndrome. For this study, the data have been collected and are being analyzed. The New England Medical Center study examined the safety and efficacy of two antibiotics for the treatment of patients with suspected chronic Lyme disease who may or may not test positive for Lyme disease on diagnostic tests. In November 2000, a Data Safety and Monitoring Board, an independent monitoring group of doctors and researchers, unanimously recommended that NIAID terminate the treatment component of the study. This was suggested because a planned interim analysis showed no statistically significant difference between the placebo and the treatment groups, and NIAID agreed. NIAID has extended the contract for 1.5 years, with additional funding, so that the investigators can continue to follow the study\u2019s patients to monitor their health status and to obtain additional information that, in the future, could help to determine the underlying cause of chronic Lyme disease."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Recommendations Made to CDC and NIH Lyme Disease Programs", "paragraphs": ["The following tables provide expert recommendations and congressional appropriations committees\u2019 recommendations made to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Lyme disease programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments From the Department of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}], "fastfact": []}
