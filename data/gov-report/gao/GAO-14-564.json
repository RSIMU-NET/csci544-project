The majority of individuals with spina bifida live well into  adulthood with proper treatment.", "As reported in our prior work, a longitudinal study conducted by the Air  Force found increased incidence of spina bifida in the children of  servicemembers exposed to herbicides, including Agent Orange, in  Vietnam. Subsequently, Congress passed legislation, commonly known  as the Agent Orange Benefits Act, to provide for the special needs of  veterans\u2019 children born with spina bifida that possibly resulted from the  exposure of one or both parents to herbicides during active service in  Vietnam. This legislation authorized VA to provide certain health care  benefits and other benefits (including a monthly monetary allowance)  effective January 1, 1997. Additional legislation expanded these benefits,  and, as of October 10, 2008, health care benefits were no longer limited  to health care services and supplies directly associated with the spina  bifida condition.

We further analyzed claims data for outpatient procedures  reimbursed in fiscal year 2013 for spina bifida beneficiaries to identify  examples of the types of services commonly received by beneficiaries,  using the most recent available data. To identify these examples, we  obtained the counts for outpatient procedure codes that were reimbursed  in fiscal year 2013 from VHA, listed by frequency, and we grouped  individual codes by type of service or supply. To identify examples of the  reasons and the types of services for which claims were denied, we  reviewed a sample of 10 denied outpatient claims from fiscal year 2013,  selected for a variety of denial reasons and service types.

VHA officials told us that, beginning with the fiscal year 2014 audit, staff  from CBOPC\u2019s Quality/Corrective Action Program are responsible for  overseeing the status of audit follow-up activities, including working with  relevant staff responsible for implementing any corrective actions.", "According to VHA officials, these staff are responsible for determining the  extent of documentation necessary for audit follow-up activities. Officials  also stated that these staff store any documentation in non-networked  files. This can render audit follow-up documentation inaccessible to other  VHA officials who may need it. Further, although staff maintain  information on the status of actions taken to implement audit findings and  the individuals responsible for implementing them, they do not maintain  information on estimated or actual completion dates for audit follow-up  activities. There also is no documentation of interactions with staff or  interim steps taken to ensure that follow-up activities are completed as  planned. For example, officials told us that for one of the identified  actions, there would be monthly follow-ups until the action is complete;  however, there is no documentation to indicate that this interim follow-up  is taking place. According to VHA officials, one reason for the lack of  written guidance on completing and documenting audit follow-up activities  is that their audit follow-up process is new; they anticipate having written  guidance drafted by August 2014.", "Federal internal control standards state that internal controls should be  documented and all documentation should be properly managed and   These standards also  maintained, and readily available for examination.state that agencies should have policies and procedures for ensuring that  the findings of audits and other reviews are promptly resolved. VHA\u2019s lack  of written guidance for audit follow-up activities places VHA at increased  risk that these internal control activities may not be performed, may be  performed inconsistently, or may not be continued when knowledgeable  employees leave. This can lead to unreliable monitoring of the spina  bifida claims process, including the inability to ensure that all necessary  audit follow-up activities are completed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The legislation that created VA\u2019s spina bifida benefits charged VHA with  serving the needs of a very vulnerable population. Given the lack of data  on the prevalence of spina bifida in the children of veterans, and concerns  from stakeholder organizations that potentially eligible individuals may not  be aware of available benefits under the spina bifida program,  stakeholder organizations are uniquely positioned to assist VHA in  communicating information on spina bifida benefits. By not conducting  outreach with key stakeholders, VHA may be missing important  opportunities to increase awareness among potentially eligible  individuals, and ultimately to help these individuals obtain the benefits to  which they may be entitled.", "In addition, without written guidance for audit follow-up activities related to  the spina bifida claims process, VHA cannot be assured that these  activities have been successfully completed or that the corrective actions  and recommendations outlined in audit reports have been appropriately  implemented. The lack of written guidance puts VHA at increased risk  that these activities may be inconsistently performed\u2014or not performed at  all\u2014if there are personnel changes. By developing written guidance for  documenting these activities in a manner consistent with federal internal  control standards, VHA would have greater assurance that audit follow-up  activities are consistently completed, thereby helping to ensure that spina  bifida beneficiaries\u2019 health care claims continue to be accurately  processed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve awareness of the spina bifida program\u2019s health care benefits  among potentially eligible individuals and to help them obtain the benefits  to which they may be entitled, we recommend that the Acting Secretary of  Veterans Affairs direct the Acting Under Secretary for Health to conduct  outreach with key stakeholder groups regarding the program and its  benefits.", "To help ensure continued accurate claims processing, we recommend  that the Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs direct the Acting Under  Secretary for Health to develop written guidance, consistent with federal  internal control standards, for completing and documenting the status of  follow-up activities for the spina bifida program\u2019s claims audits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to VA for comment.
