Hurricanes Katrina and Rita destroyed homes and displaced millions of individuals. In the wake of these natural disasters, FEMA faced the challenge of providing assistance quickly and with minimal \"red tape,\" while having sufficient controls to provide assurance that benefits were paid only to eligible individuals and households. In response to this challenge, FEMA provided $2,000 in IHP payments to affected households via its Expedited Assistance (EA) program. Victims who received EA may qualify for up to $26,200 in IHP assistance. As of mid-December 2005, IHP payments totaled about $5.4 billion, with $2.3 billion provided in the form of EA. These payments were made via checks, electronic fund transfers, and a small number of debit cards. GAO's testimony will provide the results to date related to whether (1) controls are in place and operating effectively to limit EA to qualified applicants, (2) indications exist of fraud and abuse in the application for and receipt of EA and other payments, and (3) controls are in place and operating effectively over debit cards to prevent duplicate EA payments and improper usage."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["We identified significant flaws in the process for registering disaster victims that leave the federal government vulnerable to fraud and abuse of EA payments. For Internet applications, limited automated controls were in place to verify a registrant's identity. However, we found no independent verification of the identity of registrants who registered for disaster assistance over the telephone. To demonstrate the vulnerability inherent in the call-in applications, we used falsified identities, bogus addresses, and fabricated disaster stories to register for IHP. We also found that FEMA's automated system frequently identified potentially fraudulent registrations, such as multiple registrations with identical social security numbers (SSN) but different addresses. However, the manual process used to review these registrations did not prevent EA and other payments from being issued. Other control weaknesses include the lack of any validation of damaged property addresses for both Internet and telephone registrations. Given the weak or non existent controls, it is not surprising that our data mining and investigations to date show the potential for substantial fraud and abuse of EA. Thousands of registrants misused SSNs, i.e., used SSNs that were never issued or belonged to deceased or other individuals. Our case study investigations of several hundred registrations also indicate significant misuse of SSNs and the use of bogus damaged property addresses. For example, our visits to over 200 of the case study damaged properties in Texas and Louisiana showed that at least 80 of these properties were bogus--including vacant lots and nonexistent apartments. We found that FEMA also made duplicate EA payments to about 5,000 of the nearly 11,000 debit card recipients--once through the distribution of debit cards and again by check or electronic funds transfer. We found that while debit cards were used predominantly to obtain cash, food, clothing, and personal necessities, a small number were used for adult entertainment, bail bond services and weapons purchase, which do not appear to be items or services that are essential to satisfy disaster related essential needs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss our ongoing forensic audit and  related investigations of assistance provided to individuals and households  related to hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The Individuals and Households  Program (IHP), a major component of the federal disaster response efforts  established under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency  Assistance Act (Stafford Act), is designed to provide financial assistance  to individuals and households who, as a direct result of a major disaster,  have necessary expenses and serious needs that cannot be met through  other means. As of mid-December 2005, the Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA) had distributed nearly $5.4 billion in IHP  assistance on more than 1.4 million registrations. Hurricanes Katrina and  Rita destroyed homes and displaced individuals across the gulf coast  region. In the wake of these massive natural disasters, FEMA faced the  formidable challenge of providing at least some initial assistance to over a  million registrants quickly with minimal \u201cred tape,\u201d while having sufficient  controls in place to provide assurance that benefits were paid only to  eligible individuals and households.", "Disaster relief covered by IHP includes temporary housing assistance, real  and personal property repair and replacement, and other necessary  expenses related to a disaster. IHP assistance is generally delivered after  an inspection has been conducted to verify the extent of loss and  determine eligibility. Because of the tremendous devastation caused by  hurricanes Katrina and Rita, FEMA activated expedited assistance to  provide fast track money\u2014in the form of $2,000 in expedited assistance  payments\u2014to eligible disaster victims to help with immediate, emergency  needs of food, shelter, clothing, and personal necessities. This swift  response was vital in helping victims of hurricanes Katrina and Rita.  FEMA specified that expedited assistance payments were to be provided  only to individuals and households who, as a result of hurricanes Katrina  and Rita, were displaced from their predisaster primary residences and  were in need of shelter. Typically a household can only receive one  expedited assistance payment. Exceptions are made in situations where  household members are displaced to separate locations, in which case  more than one member of the household may be eligible for payments.  FEMA provided expedited assistance payments related to hurricanes  Katrina and Rita predominantly through electronic funds transfer (EFT)  and checks sent to the registrants\u2019 current addresses. In addition, FEMA  provided a limited amount of expedited assistance via debit cards  distributed at three locations in Texas.", "As of mid-December 2005, FEMA data showed that the agency had  delivered 44 percent ($2.3 billion) of the $5.4 billion in IHP aid through  expedited assistance to hurricanes Katrina and Rita registrants across at  least 175 counties in 4 different states. Almost $1.6 billion went to  individuals with damaged addresses in Louisiana, more than $400 million  to individuals in Texas, and over $300 million to individuals in Alabama  and Mississippi. Registrants determined to be eligible for expedited  assistance may also be eligible to receive additional IHP payments up to  the overall IHP cap of $26,200.", "Our current audit and investigation is being performed under the statutory  authority given to the Comptroller General of the United States. Our audit  and investigation is conducted under the premise that while the federal  government needs to provide swift and compassionate assistance to the  victims of natural disasters, public confidence in an effective disaster  relief program that takes all possible steps to minimize fraud, waste, and  abuse needs to be preserved. Today, we will summarize the results from  our ongoing forensic audit and related investigations of the IHP program.", "This testimony will provide the results of our work related to whether (1)  controls are in place and operating effectively to limit expedited assistance  to qualified registrants, (2) indications exist of fraud and abuse in the  registration for and receipt of expedited assistance and other payments,  and (3) controls are in place and operating effectively over debit cards to  prevent duplicate payments and improper usage. We plan to issue a  detailed report with recommendations on the results of our audit.", "Thus far, our work has focused primarily on the IHP registration process  because individuals whose registrations are approved have access to  expedited assistance payments and subsequently the full range of IHP  benefits. To assess the design of controls, we performed walkthroughs of  FEMA\u2019s processes for accepting registrations and awarding expedited  assistance funds. To determine whether indications existed of fraud and  abuse in expedited assistance and other disbursements, we provided  FEMA data to the Social Security Administration (SSA) to verify against  their records of valid social security numbers (SSNs), and reviewed the  FEMA database of IHP registrations for other anomalies using data mining  techniques. To determine whether registrations resulted in potentially  fraudulent or improper payments, we selected a nonrepresentative  selection of 248 registrations from our data mining results for further  investigations. The 248 registrations represented 20 case studies\u2014some  involving multiple registrants\u2014that we linked together through identical  names, SSNs, damaged addresses and/or current addresses. Our analysis  of potentially fraudulent use of SSNs and other data mining efforts are  ongoing, and we plan to report on additional results in the future. For  purposes of this testimony, we did not conduct sufficient work to project  the magnitude of potentially fraudulent and improper IHP payments. We  also proactively tested the adequacy of controls over the registration  process for disaster assistance by submitting claims for relief using  falsified identities, bogus addresses, and fabricated disaster stories. These  tests were performed before FEMA provided us any information related to  the processes used to screen IHP registrations and preclude some  fraudulent registrations. Additional details on our scope and  methodologies are included in appendix I.", "In the course of our work, we made numerous written requests for key  documents and sets of data related to the IHP, most dating back to  October 2005. While FEMA officials promptly satisfied one key part of our  request\u2014databases of IHP registrants and payments\u2014the majority of what  we requested has not been provided. On January 18, 2006, the Department  of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of General Counsel did provide us  with well less than half of the documents that were requested. While the  database and other data provided by FEMA enabled us to design  procedures to test the effectiveness of FEMA\u2019s system of internal controls,  it did not enable us to fully determine the root causes of weak or non- existent controls and formulate detailed recommendations. For example,  as will be discussed later, FEMA and the DHS had not provided us  documentation to enable us to conclusively determine the reason that  FEMA submitted some registrations, and did not submit other  registrations, to identity validation prior to issuing expedited assistance  payments.", "We conducted our audit and investigations from October 2005 through  January 2006. Except for restrictions discussed previously related to the  limitations that DHS placed on the scope on our audit work, we conducted  our audit work in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards and conducted investigative work in accordance with  the standards prescribed by the President\u2019s Council on Integrity and  Efficiency. Our findings today focus primarily on the results to date from  of our data mining and investigative techniques."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FEMA\u2019s Controls to Prevent Potentially Fraudulent Payments Were Not Effective", "paragraphs": ["We found weak or nonexistent controls in the process that FEMA used to  review disaster registrations and approve assistance payments that leave  the federal government vulnerable to fraud and abuse. In the critical  aftermath of hurricanes Katrina and Rita, FEMA moved swiftly to  distribute expedited assistance payments to allow disaster victims to  mitigate and overcome the effects of the disasters. In this context, the  establishment of an effective control environment was a significant  challenge. Specifically, we found that FEMA had implemented some  controls prior to the disaster to provide automated validation of the  identity of registrants who applied for assistance via the Internet. Our  work thus far indicates that this resulted in FEMA rejecting some  registrants who provided names and SSNs that did not pass the validation  test. However, FEMA did not implement the same preventive controls for  those who applied via the telephone. Our use of fictitious names, bogus  addresses, and fabricated disaster stories to obtain expedited assistance  payments from FEMA demonstrated the ease with which expedited  assistance could be obtained by providing false information over the  telephone. Because expedited assistance is a gateway to further IHP  payments (up to $26,200 per registration), approval for expedited  assistance payments potentially exposes FEMA, and the federal  government, to more fraud and abuse related to temporary housing, home  repair and replacement, and other needs assistance."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Pressure to Swiftly Deliver Aid Led to Approval of Expedited Assistance Payments with Minimal Verification", "paragraphs": ["During the course of our audit and investigation, FEMA officials stated  that they did not verify whether registrants had insurance and whether  registrants were unable to live in their home prior to approving expedited  assistance payments. According to FEMA officials, the unprecedented  scale of the two disasters and the need to move quickly to mitigate their  impact led FEMA to implement expedited assistance. Expedited  assistance differs from the traditional way of delivering disaster assistance  in that it calls for FEMA to provide assistance without requiring proof of  losses and verifying the extent of such losses. Consequently, FEMA  implemented limited controls to verify eligibility for the initial expedited  assistance payments. According to FEMA officials, these controls were  restricted to determining whether the damaged residence was in the  disaster area and limited validation of the identity of registrants who used  the Internet. Registrants who FEMA thought met these qualifications  based on their limited assessments were deemed eligible for expedited  assistance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA Did Not Validate Identity of Registrants Who Applied for Assistance via Telephone", "paragraphs": ["FEMA implemented different procedures when processing disaster  registrations submitted via the Internet and telephone calls. Of the more  than 2.5 million registrations recorded in FEMA\u2019s database, i.e.,  registrations that were successfully recorded\u201460 percent (more than 1.5  million) were exempt from any identity verification because they were  submitted via the telephone. Prior to sending out expedited assistance  payments, FEMA did not have procedures in place for Internet or  telephone registrations that screened out registrations where the alleged  damaged address was a bogus address. The lack of identity verification for  telephone registrations and any address validation exposed the  government to fraud and abuse of the IHP program.", "For registrations taken through FEMA\u2019s Web site, registrants were  required to first provide a name, SSN, and date of birth. This information  was immediately provided (in electronic format) to a FEMA contractor to  compare against existing publicly available records. While registrants were  waiting on the Internet, the FEMA contractor took steps to verify  registrants\u2019 identities. The verification steps involved confirming that the  SSN matched with a SSN in public records, that the name and SSN  combination matched with an identity registered in public records, and  that the SSN was not associated with a deceased individual. The FEMA  contractor was responsible for blocking any registrations for which any of  these three conditions was not met. Additionally, registrants who passed  the first gate had to provide answers to a number of questions aimed at  further corroborating the registrants\u2019 identities. Registrants who were  rejected via the Internet were advised to contact FEMA via telephone. Our  audit and investigative work indicated that this verification process helped  deter obviously fraudulent Internet registrations using false names and  SSNs. However, FEMA kept no record of the names, SSNs, and other  information related to the rejected registrations, and no record of the  reasons that the FEMA contractor blocked the registration from going  forward. FEMA acknowledged that it was conceivable that individuals  who were rejected because of false information submitted via the Internet  could get expedited assistance payments by providing the same false  information over the telephone.", "Although the identity verification process appeared to have worked for  most Internet registrations, it did not identify a small number of  registrations with invalid SSNs. According to information we received  from the SSA, nearly 60 Internet registrants who received FEMA payments  provided SSNs that were never issued or belonged to individuals who were  deceased prior to the hurricanes. Results indicate that these individuals  may have passed the verification process because public records used to  verify registrants\u2019 identities were flawed. For example, one credit history  we obtained indicated that a registrant had established a credit history  using an invalid SSN.", "Unlike the Internet process, FEMA did not verify the identity of telephone  registrants who accounted for over 60 percent of disaster registrations  recorded in FEMA\u2019s system. For registrants who registered only via  telephone, or registrants who called FEMA subsequent to being denied on  the Internet, FEMA did not have controls in place to verify that the SSN  had been issued, that the SSN matched with the name, that the SSN did  not belong to a deceased individual, or whether the registrants had been  rejected on prior Internet registrations. Because the identity of telephone  registrants was not subjected to basic verification, FEMA did not have any  independent assurance that registrants did not falsify information to  obtain disaster assistance. According to FEMA officials, FEMA had a  request in place to modify its computer system to allow for identity  verification for telephone registrations similar to those used for the  Internet. FEMA also represented to us that due to budget constraints and  other considerations, the change was not implemented in time to respond  to hurricanes Katrina and Rita. However, to date we have not received  documentation to validate these representations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Control Weaknesses Enabled GAO to Obtain $2,000 Expedited Assistance Checks", "paragraphs": ["The lack of identity verification of phone registrants prior to disbursing  funds makes FEMA vulnerable to authorizing expedited assistance  payments based on fraudulent information submitted by registrants. Prior  to obtaining information on the control procedures FEMA used to  authorize expedited assistance payments, we tested the controls by  attempting to register for disaster relief through two portals: (1) the  Internet via FEMA\u2019s Web site and (2) telephone calls to FEMA. For both  portals, we tested FEMA\u2019s controls by providing falsified identities and  bogus addresses. In all instances, FEMA\u2019s Web site did not allow us to  successfully finalize our registrations. Instead, the Web site indicated that  there were problems with our registrations and advised us to contact the  FEMA toll-free numbers if we thought that we were eligible for assistance.  This is consistent with FEMA\u2019s representation that Internet registrations  were compared against third-party information to verify identities.", "Our investigative work also confirmed that the lack of similar controls  over telephone registrations exposed FEMA to fraud and abuse.  Specifically, in instances where we submitted via the telephone the same  exact information that had been rejected on the Internet, i.e., falsified  identities and bogus addresses, the information was accepted as valid.  Subsequently, the claims were processed and $2,000 expedited assistance  checks were issued. Figure 1 provides an example of an expedited  assistance check provided to GAO.", "Additional case study investigations, which we discuss later, further  demonstrated that individuals not affected by the disasters could easily  provide false information to obtain expedited assistance and other IHP  payments from FEMA. Convictions obtained by the Department of Justice  also show that others have exploited these control weaknesses and  received expedited assistance payments. For example, one individual in a  College Station, Texas relief center pleaded guilty to false claims and mail  fraud charges related to IHP and expedited assistance.

About  10 days later, the same individual submitted at least 7 additional  registrations claiming 7 different disaster addresses, 2 of which we were  able to confirm belonged to the individual and may be rental properties  that the individual owns.

Finally, unlike the guidance provided to other IHP registrants, at  the time FEMA distributed the debit cards, FEMA did not provide  instructions informing them that the funds on their cards must be used for  appropriate purposes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Debit Cards Issued to Individuals Providing Invalid Social Security Numbers", "paragraphs": ["As discussed previously, FEMA did not verify the identity of individuals  and/or households who submitted disaster registrations over the  telephone. This weakness occurred in the debit card program as well.  FEMA required the completion of a disaster registration prior to a  household or individual being able to receive a debit card. According to  FEMA officials, registrants at the three centers applied for assistance via  the telephone and Internet. Therefore, to the extent that registrations for  the debit card were taken over the telephone, FEMA did not subject the  identity of the registrants to a verification process. Consequently, we  identified 50 debit cards issued to registrants listing SSNs that the SSA had  no record of issuing, and 12 cards issued to registrants using SSNs  belonging to deceased individuals. For example, one registrant used an  invalid SSN to receive a $2,000 debit card and used about $500 of that  money to pay prior traffic violations to reinstate a driver\u2019s license. In  another case, a registrant used the SSN of an individual who died in 1995  to receive a $2,000 debit card. FEMA subsequently deposited an additional  $7,554 in IHP payments to that debit card account for additional claims  submitted by that individual. This registrant withdrew most of the $9,554  deposited into the debit card account by obtaining ATM cash withdrawals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Thousands of Debit Card Recipients Received Multiple Expedited Assistance Payments", "paragraphs": ["Based on a comparison of FEMA\u2019s IHP payments and the list of debit card  recipients, we found that over 5,000 of the 11,000 debit card recipients  received more than one $2,000 expedited assistance payment because they  received a debit card and another form of payment (check or EFT).  According to FEMA officials, they were aware that several individuals had  already registered for IHP assistance and that some payments had already  been made prior to issuance of a debit card. However, FEMA officials  stated that individuals in the three shelters in Texas would not have access  to their home addresses or bank accounts and therefore needed  immediate assistance in the form of debit cards. Our review of FEMA data  disproved FEMA\u2019s belief that only a few individuals who received debit  cards also received other disaster assistance payments. Instead,  thousands, or nearly half, of the individuals who received debit cards also  received checks or EFTs that were made several days after the debit cards  had been issued. The result was that FEMA paid more than $10 million  dollars in duplicate expedited assistance payments to individuals who had  already received their $2,000 of expedited assistance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA Debit Card Transactions", "paragraphs": ["In general, once FEMA receives a disaster registration, FEMA sends a  package containing IHP information and detailed instructions, including  instructions on how to follow up on benefits, how to appeal if denied  benefits, and the proper use of IHP payments. However, FMS and FEMA  officials informed us that FEMA did not specifically provide instructions  on how the debit cards should only be used for necessary expenses and  serious needs related to the disasters at the same time the debit cards  were distributed. We found that in isolated instances, debit cards were  used for adult entertainment, to purchase weapons, and for purchases at a  massage parlor that had been previously raided by local police for  prostitution.", "Our analysis of debit card transaction data provided by JP Morgan Chase  found that the debit cards were used predominantly to obtain cash which  did not allow us to determine how the money was actually used. The  majority of the remaining transactions was associated with purchases of  food, clothing, and personal necessities. Figure 3 shows a breakdown of  the types of purchases made by cardholders.", "We found that in isolated instances, debit cards were used to purchase  goods and services that did not appear to meet serious disaster related  needs as defined by the regulations. In this regard, FEMA regulation  provides that IHP assistance be used for housing-related needs and items  or services that are essential to a registrant\u2019s ability to overcome disaster  related hardship.

Based on our work to date, we believe that more can be done to  prevent fraud through validation of identities and damage addresses and  enhanced use of automated system verification intended to prevent  fraudulent disbursements. Once fraudulent registrations are made and  money is disbursed, detecting and pursuing those who committed fraud in  a comprehensive manner is more costly and may not result in recoveries.  Further, many of those fraudulently registered in the FEMA system  already received expedited assistance and will likely receive more money,  as each registrant can receive as much as $26,200 per registration.", "Another key element to preventing fraud in the future is to ensure there  are consequences for those that commit fraud. For the fraud cases that we  are investigating, we plan to refer them to the Katrina Fraud Task Force  for further investigation and, where appropriate, prosecution. We believe  that prosecution of individuals who have obtained disaster relief payments  through fraudulent means will send a message for future disasters that  there are consequences for defrauding the government.", "Madam Chairman and Members of the Committee, this concludes my  statement.

We reviewed the Stafford  Act, Pub. L. 93-288, the implementing regulations, and FEMA\u2019s instructions  to disaster registrants available via the Internet. In addition, to proactively  test controls in place, we applied for assistance using falsified identities,  bogus addresses, and fictitious disaster stories to determine if IHP  payments could be obtained based on fraudulent information. Because of  several key unanswered requests for documentation from the Department  of Homeland Security (DHS), information needed to fully assess the  expedited assistance program was limited. For example, FEMA and DHS  had not provided us documentation to enable us to conclusively determine  the reason that FEMA submitted some registrations, and did not submit  other registrations, to identity validation prior to issuing expedited  assistance payments. Consequently, our work was limited to our analysis  of the FEMA databases, investigations we conducted, data widely  available to the public via the Internet, and information FEMA officials  orally provided to us.", "To determine the magnitude and characteristics of IHP payments, we  obtained the FEMA IHP database as of December 2005. We validated that  the database was complete and reliable by comparing the total  disbursements against reports FEMA provided to the Senate  Appropriations Committee on Katrina/Rita disbursements. We summarized  the amounts of IHP provided by type of assistance and by location of  disaster address.", "To determine whether indications existed of fraud and abuse in expedited  assistance and other disbursements, we provided FEMA data to the Social  Security Administration (SSA) to verify against their records of valid social  security numbers (SSNs). We also used data mining and forensic audit  techniques to identify registrations containing obviously false data, such as  multiple registrations containing the same name, same current or damaged  address, but different SSNs, and registrations containing duplicate  information, such as duplicate names and SSNs. To determine whether  registrations from our data mining resulted in potentially fraudulent and/or  improper payments, we used a nonrepresentative selection of 248  registrations representing 20 case studies (case studies included multiple  individuals and registrations) for further investigation. We restricted our  case studies to registrations that received payments as of mid-December  2005, and noted that some registrants within our case studies also  submitted additional registrations\u2014for which they may receive future  payments. We also identified instances where groups of registrants may  have been involved in schemes to defraud FEMA. We found these schemes  because the registrants provided the same SSNs, last names, current  addresses, and/or damaged addresses on their registrations. Our macro  analysis of potentially fraudulent use of SSNs and other data mining are  ongoing, and we plan to report additional results at a future date. For  purposes of this testimony, we did not conduct sufficient work to project  the magnitude of potentially fraudulent and improper payments of IHP. We  also visited over 200 of the claimed damaged addresses related to our case  studies to determine whether or not the addresses were valid.", "To assess the types of purchases made with FEMA debit cards distributed  at relief centers, we reviewed a database of transactions provided by JP  Morgan Chase, the administrating bank for the debit cards. SSA also  assisted us to compare cardholder data with SSA records to determine  whether registrants receiving debit cards had provided valid identities. We  performed data mining on debit card transactions to identify purchases  that did not appear to be indicative of necessary expenses as defined by  the Stafford Act\u2019s implementing regulations. Finally, we validated specific  transactions identified in the database by obtaining information on actual  items purchased from the vendors.", "In the course of our work, we made numerous written requests for key  documents and sets of data related to the IHP, most dating back to  October 2005. While FEMA officials promptly complied with one key part  of our request\u2014that is FEMA made available databases of IHP registrants  and payments\u2014the majority of items requested have not been provided.  On January 18, 2006, the Department of Homeland Security Office of  General Counsel provided us with well less than half of the documents  that were requested. For example, FEMA and the DHS had not provided us  documentation to enable us to conclusively determine the reason that  FEMA submitted some registrations, and did not submit other  registrations, to identity validation prior to issuing expedited assistance  payments. While the database and other data provided by FEMA enabled  us to design procedures to test the effectiveness of the FEMA\u2019s system of  internal controls, it did not enable us to comprehensively determine the  root causes of weak or non-existent controls.", "During the course of our audit work, we identified multiple cases of  potential fraud. For cases that we investigated and found significant  evidence of fraudulent activity, we plan to refer our cases directly to the  Hurricane Katrina Fraud Task Force. Except for scope limitations due to a  lack of documentation provided by DHS, we performed our work from  October 2005 through January 2006 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards and quality standards for investigations as  set forth by the President\u2019s Council on Integrity and Efficiency.", "This is a work of the U.S. government and is not subject to copyright protection in the  United States.
