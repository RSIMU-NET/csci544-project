As you well know, collecting delinquent debt has historically presented major challenges for federal agencies. It is with this backdrop that the Congress, with a key role played by this Subcommittee, passed the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA). Among other things, DCIA requires agencies to (1) notify the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) of debts delinquent over 180 days for purposes of administrative offset against any amounts that might otherwise be due to those persons or entities, and (2) refer such debts to Treasury for centralized collection action known as cross-servicing. In addition, to facilitate debt collection, the act authorizes agencies to administratively garnish the wages of delinquent debtors.", "While my testimony today is limited primarily to our work related to RHS and FSA, our audit results are based on a larger body of work, on which I testified before this Subcommittee on October 10, 2001. That work assessed the progress of selected agencies in referring debt for administrative offset and cross-servicing and in implementing certain other key provisions of DCIA\u2014administrative wage garnishment (AWG) and the debtor bar provision. In preparation for this testimony, we reviewed the Department of Agriculture\u2019s (Agriculture) response to this Subcommittee\u2019s October 16, 2001, letter containing questions concerning the agencies\u2019 progress in referring delinquent debt to Treasury\u2019s Financial Management Service (FMS) and mitigating any barriers to complete and timely referrals. This updating work was done in accordance with U.S. generally accepted government auditing standards.", "Today, I will discuss (1) difficulties RHS and FSA have experienced identifying and referring eligible debts to FMS, (2) obstacles that have hampered their prompt referral of eligible debts, and (3) whether exclusions from referral requirements were consistent with established criteria. In addition, my testimony will cover Agriculture\u2019s actions and plans in context with information dealing with the extent to which eight other large Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies and FMS use or plan to use AWG to collect delinquent federal non-tax debt.", "First, a few overall comments about DCIA implementation. We testified before this Subcommittee in June 2000 that, although DCIA was enacted in April 1996, the act\u2019s cross-servicing provision still had not been fully implemented. We emphasized that on a governmentwide basis, the vast majority of reported debt delinquent over 180 days was being excluded by agencies from referral requirements under exclusions allowed by DCIA or Treasury. However, we cautioned that the reliability of the amounts reported as excluded was not being independently verified. We also stressed that agencies were not promptly referring all eligible debts to FMS. The picture left with your Subcommittee was that agency implementation would have to improve vastly if the debt collection benefits of DCIA were to be more fully realized.", "On the other hand, I am pleased to report that FMS, in partnership with agencies, is making steady progress in collecting delinquent federal non- tax debt through the Treasury Offset Program (TOP). As you know, TOP is a mandatory governmentwide debt collection program that compares delinquent debtor data to certain federal payment data. Agencies are required to refer eligible delinquent debt to TOP as soon as it is 180 days delinquent, but may, at their discretion, refer it sooner. When a delinquent debtor record matches a payment record, TOP recovers all or a portion of the delinquent debt by offsetting some or all of the federal payment scheduled to be issued to the debtor. During each of the last 3 years, FMS has reported collecting over $1 billion of such debt with TOP by offsetting tax refund payments. Tax refund offsets have been FMS\u2019 most effective means of debt collection and collections have increased, in part, as a result of systems changes the agency implemented. For example, the TOP system can offset against both the primary and secondary taxpayer, where the previous tax refund system could only offset against the primary taxpayer. In addition, the TOP system can accept new debts or increased debt balances all during the year, whereas the previous tax refund system could only accept them at the beginning of the tax season.", "While there has been important progress, our follow-up work at selected agencies, including Agriculture, over the past several months has not allayed our concerns about the priority agencies have placed on implementing DCIA. As I will highlight today, Agriculture has not yet taken effective actions to ensure that all eligible delinquent debt is promptly referred to FMS for collection action. For example,   As of September 30, 2000, RHS reported that it had referred to TOP $201 million of direct single-family-housing (SFH) loans but had not referred any amounts to FMS for cross-servicing, primarily due to systems limitations. According to RHS officials, the agency will refer 100 to 200 loans a month to FMS until the systems limitations are rectified. Also, RHS\u2019 reported delinquent direct SFH loans eligible for TOP might have been understated by about $348 million because it did not report all amounts that were due and payable.", "FSA did not have an adequate process or sufficient controls to adequately identify and report direct farm loans eligible for referral to FMS as of September 30, 2000. In addition, a large portion of the approximately $400 million of delinquent direct farm loans that became eligible for TOP during calendar year 2000 likely was not promptly referred because the agency refers debts to TOP only once annually, during December. Further, FSA did not refer co-debtors for the $934 million of delinquent farm loans previously referred to TOP because of systems limitations that had existed for years. Moreover, the agency had referred only $38 million of direct farm loans to FMS for cross-servicing because it suspended cross- servicing referrals pending development and implementation of its new cross-servicing policy. According to an Agriculture official, the first referral to FMS under this new policy was made in September 2001.", "RHS and FSA have not referred to FMS for collection action any losses on their guaranteed SFH and farm loans, respectively, even though through September 30, 2000, they have experienced losses of about $132 million and about $293 million, respectively, on such loans since the enactment of DCIA.", "Also, Agriculture and other agencies still have not utilized AWG as authorized by DCIA to collect delinquent non-tax debt even though experts have testified before this Subcommittee that AWG can potentially be an extremely powerful debt collection tool.", "As stated in my testimony on October 10, 2001, if the government is going to make significant progress in collecting the billions of dollars of delinquent non-tax debt, expedient and effective implementation of the debt collection provisions of DCIA must be given a high priority by agencies. This has not been the case at the agencies we reviewed. In many cases, the agencies continue to show extended milestones for needed corrective actions years in the future, even though substantial amounts of eligible delinquent debt have still not been referred."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "RHS\u2019 Direct Single- Family-Housing Loan Program", "paragraphs": ["RHS administers a direct SFH loan program to help low-income individuals or households purchase homes in rural areas.

Consequently, we were not able to determine whether the agency\u2019s exclusion of $182 million of delinquent debt was based on relevant legislative and regulatory criteria. FMS officials told us that it is their expectation that agencies would retain the applicable data needed to justify not referring delinquent debt for collection action.

Essentially, the system does not contain sufficient data to differentiate loans eligible for cross-servicing from those that are not. Although RHS plans system enhancements for the third quarter of fiscal year 2002, which the agency believes will facilitate loan identification for cross-servicing, RHS officials advised us that relatively few referrals to FMS will likely be made in the near term. While we were performing our fieldwork, RHS began an interim process to manually identify such loans eligible for cross-servicing. According to RHS\u2019 debt referral plan, because the interim process is tedious and labor intensive, only about 100 to 200 loans were to be referred per month to Treasury, beginning in May 2001. RHS officials said that all direct SFH loans eligible for TOP will have to be reviewed for cross-servicing eligibility. RHS reported 23,032 direct SFH loans eligible for TOP as of September 30, 2000.

Treasury officials told us that Treasury had not approved the request, either formally or informally, and stated that Treasury discouraged RHS from making the request, which was not submitted to Treasury until November 2000. Treasury formally denied RHS\u2019 exemption request for the direct SFH loan program on May 14, 2001.

Certain types of debts were automatically excluded from referral without any review for eligibility. In other cases, FSA\u2019s Program Loan Accounting System did not contain information from the detailed loan files located at the FSA field offices that would be key to determining eligibility for referral. In addition, FSA did not have any monitoring or review procedures in place to help ensure that FSA personnel routinely updated the detailed debt files. Consequently, amounts of direct farm loans FSA reported to Treasury as eligible for referral were not accurate.", "Excluded amounts for bankruptcy, forbearance/appeals, foreclosure, and Department of Justice (DOJ)/litigation totaled about $694 million, or about 95 percent of the $732 million that was excluded from referral to FMS for TOP and cross-servicing. Of this amount, $295 million was for DOJ/litigation and was comprised of judgment debts. According to FSA officials, deficiency judgments\u2014court judgments requiring payment of a sum certain to the United States\u2014are eligible for TOP and should be referred to FMS. However, FSA\u2019s Finance Office in St. Louis automatically excluded all judgment debts for direct farm loans from referral to FMS because automated system limitations precluded staff from identifying deficiency judgments. Our inquiries caused FSA officials to initiate a special project in May 2001 to identify all deficiency judgment debts for direct farm loans so that such debts could be referred to FMS.", "Determinations as to whether direct farm loans are in bankruptcy, forbearance/appeals, or foreclosure and, therefore, excluded from referral to FMS, are made by FSA personnel in numerous FSA field offices across the country. Personnel in the FSA field offices we visited did not routinely update the eligibility status of farm loans in FSA\u2019s Program Loan Accounting System, as was evident by the selected excluded loans we reviewed. Using statistical sampling, we selected and reviewed supporting documents to determine whether farm loans that selected FSA field offices in California, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas had excluded from referral to FMS were consistent with established criteria dealing with bankruptcy, forbearance/appeals, foreclosure, and DOJ/litigation. Based on the results of our sample, we estimate that about 575, or approximately one-half of the excluded loans in the four selected states, had been inappropriately placed in exclusion categories by FSA as of September 30, 2000. Because of these numerous errors, we did not test other reported exclusions from referral to FMS for cross-servicing, such as loans being internally offset.", "One of the most frequently identified inappropriate exclusions pertained to amounts discharged in bankruptcy, which should not have been included in delinquent debt. Fifty-two bankruptcies that we reviewed as part of our sample had been discharged in bankruptcy court prior to September 30, 2000. In fact, many had been discharged several years prior to that date. For example, one loan with a balance due of about $325,000 was reported as a delinquent debt over 180 days and excluded from referral requirements because of bankruptcy. However, a review of the loan file at the FSA field office showed that a bankruptcy court discharged the debt in 1986 and, therefore, the debt should not have been included in either the delinquent debt or exclusion amounts reported to Treasury as of September 30, 2000.", "According to Farm Loan Managers in some of the FSA field offices we visited, they have not written off many direct farm loans discharged in bankruptcy because making new loans has been a higher-priority use of their resources. In addition, FSA did not provide sufficient oversight to help ensure that field office personnel adequately tracked the status of discharged bankruptcies and updated the loan files and debt records in the Program Loan Accounting System. Also, it is important to note that delays in promptly writing off discharged bankruptcies not only distort the TROR for debt management and credit policy purposes, but also distort key financial indicators such as receivables, total delinquencies, and loan loss data. This makes the information misleading for budget and management decisions and oversight. Aside from erroneously inflating reported receivables and delinquent loans, failure to process loan write-offs delays reporting closed-out debt amounts to the Internal Revenue Service as income to the debtor."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Referrals of Direct Farm Loans for Cross-Servicing Suspended", "paragraphs": ["As previously mentioned, only $38 million of direct farm loans were reported by FSA as having been referred for cross-servicing because the agency suspended such referrals in April 2000 pending development and implementation of a new policy to refer to FMS for cross-servicing only debts where the 6-year statute of limitations has not expired. FSA issued revised guidelines in July 2001 to incorporate the 6-year statute of limitations, and the agency is now reviewing loans at over 1,000 FSA field offices to determine eligibility for referral to Treasury under the new policy. According to an Agriculture official, the first referral to FMS under this new policy was made in September 2001.", "According to FSA officials, FSA decided to adopt the new policy because it believed that FMS informed them that accounts for which the 6-year statute of limitations had expired should not be referred for cross- servicing. However, FMS officials told us that FMS had not provided such guidance to FSA.

However, FSA\u2019s automated loan system cannot record more than one debtor because the system modifications necessary to accept Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TINs) for multiple debtors have not been made. According to an FSA official, the need to have co-debtor information in the system to facilitate debt collection was initially determined in 1986. However, we were told that to date, higher-priority systems projects have precluded FSA from completing the necessary systems enhancements to allow the system to accept more than one TIN per debt. In other words, although FSA recognized years ago the need to take action, the agency has not considered this to be a high enough priority.

Consequently, a large portion of the $400 million of debt likely was not promptly referred when it became eligible.

Thus, the old adage that \u201ctime is money\u201d is very relevant for referrals of debts to FMS for collection action.
