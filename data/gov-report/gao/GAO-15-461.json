Training DOD UAS pilots, most of whom are in the Army or the Air Force, is an integral part of DOD's strategy to accomplish its mission. Senate Report 113-176 included a provision that GAO review DOD's efforts to train UAS pilots.", "This report examines, among other things, the extent to which the Army and the Air Force (1) face challenges ensuring that their UAS pilots complete required training and (2) have taken steps to ensure they have sufficient numbers of UAS instructors. GAO analyzed DOD guidance on training UAS pilots, distributed a questionnaire to Army and Air Force headquarters and units, examined nongeneralizeable training records of seven Air Force UAS units selected because they have the same mission requirements, and interviewed DOD officials. GAO also conducted 18 focus groups with active duty UAS pilots who were selected based on rank and other factors. The results of the questionnaire and focus groups are not generalizable."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Army and the Air Force face challenges ensuring that the pilots who remotely operate their unmanned aerial systems (UAS) complete their required training. Specifically, a March 2015 Army review showed that most pilots in certain Army units did not complete fundamental training tasks in fiscal year 2014\u2014a finding that GAO corroborated through discussions with pilots in focus groups and unit responses to questionnaires. In addition, Army unit status reports do not require UAS pilot training information, and as a result, the Army does not know the full extent to which pilots have been trained and are therefore ready to be deployed. In addition, Air Force training records from a nongeneralizeable sample of seven UAS units showed that, on average, 35 percent of the pilots in these units completed the training for all of their required missions. Pilots in all of the seven focus groups GAO conducted with Air Force UAS pilots stated that they could not conduct training in units because their units had shortages of UAS pilots.GAO found similar shortages of UAS pilots in April 2014 and in particular, GAO found that the Air Force operated below its crew ratio, which is a metric used to determine the number of pilots needed in units. At that time, GAO made four recommendations including that the Air Force update its update crew ratio. The Air Force concurred with these recommendations and has taken actions, or has actions underway. For example, an Air Force Headquarters official stated that, in February 2015, the Air Force completed the first phase of a three-phase personnel requirements study on the crew ratio and expects to update the crew ratio in 2015. However, at this time, the Air Force has not fully implemented any of the recommendations.", "The Army and the Air Force are taking actions to increase the number of UAS instructors, but the Army has not fully addressed the risks associated with using less experienced instructors and the Air Force faces instructor shortages. In order to increase the number of its instructors in response to an increase in the number of UAS units, the Army waived course prerequisites for about 40 percent of the UAS pilots attending the course to become instructor pilots from the beginning of fiscal year 2013 through February 2015.The Army originally established these prerequisites\u2014such as a minimum number of flight hours\u2014for UAS pilots volunteering to become instructors to help ensure that instructors were fully trained and ready to instruct UAS pilots. The Army has taken some steps to mitigate the potential risks of using less proficient UAS instructors. For example, beginning in fiscal year 2015, the Army no longer grants waivers for course prerequisites related to proficiency. However, the Army can continue to grant waivers for additional course prerequisites related to experience. As a result, the Army risks that its UAS pilots may not be receiving the highest caliber of training needed to prepare them to successfully perform UAS missions. Furthermore, as of March 2015, the Air Force had staffed its UAS training squadrons at Holloman Air Force Base at 63 percent of its planned staffing levels. This shortage is a key reason that the Air Force has shortages of UAS pilots across the Air Force, according to an Air Force headquarters official. The Air Force is studying the personnel requirements for its school and expects to report the results of this study by spring 2016."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends, among other things, that the Army require unit status reports to include information on the readiness levels of UAS pilots; and the Army take additional steps to mitigate potential risks posed by its waiver of course prerequisites related to experience for pilots attending the course to become instructors.

In its Unmanned Systems Integrated Roadmap  FY2013-2038 report, DOD highlighted the importance of developing a  comprehensive UAS training strategy to guide the myriad DOD UAS  training efforts across all systems, and to help ensure effective and  efficient training of UAS pilots. The Defense Science Board reported that  training was an integral part of DOD\u2019s strategy to accomplish its mission,  and stated that military proficiency is dependent on the weapon system  and on the warfighters who operate them and ignoring training is a waste  of these resources.", "UAS pilot training is a topic of interest to members of Congress and about  which we have recently reported. In March 2010, we found that DOD had  not developed a strategy to resolve challenges that affect the ability of the  Air Force and the Army to train personnel for UAS operations.  Consequently, we recommended that DOD develop a results-oriented  strategy to address these training challenges, which included limited  access to restricted air space and limited opportunities to conduct joint  training, and DOD concurred with our recommendation. More recently,  the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 required the  Secretary of the Air Force and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force to report  on the education, training, and promotion rates of Air Force UAS pilots.  Furthermore, in April 2014, we found that Air Force UAS pilot shortages  have had a negative effect on training for those pilots. Specifically, we  found that the Air Force had operated below its optimum number of UAS  pilots in each unit; had not developed a minimum number of pilots per  unit; had not tailored its approach to recruiting and retaining UAS pilots,  and had not considered the viability of using personnel other than officers,  such as enlisted or civilians, as UAS pilots. We recommended that the Air  Force update the optimum number of UAS pilots (i.e., a crew ratio);  establish a minimum crew ratio; develop a recruiting and retention  strategy; and evaluate the viability of using enlisted or civilian personnel  as UAS pilots. The Air Force generally concurred with our  recommendations. Since we issued our report in April 2014, the Air Force  has taken some actions to implement these recommendations, but has  not fully implemented any of them. In appendix I, we provide further  details on the findings of our April 2014 report, our recommendations, and  Air Force actions taken in response to our recommendations.", "A committee report accompanying a bill for the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 included a provision for us to  review DOD\u2019s training for UAS pilots. This report evaluates the extent to  which (1) the Army and the Air Force face challenges, if any, in ensuring  that their UAS pilots complete their required training; (2) the Army and the  Air Force have taken steps to ensure they have a sufficient number of  UAS pilot instructors; and (3) the Office of the Secretary of Defense and  the military services coordinate on training UAS pilots.", "We focused our review on Army and Air Force UAS pilot training  programs in our first two objectives because these services have  significantly more UAS pilots than the Navy and the Marine Corps. For  our first objective, we reviewed documents that outline training  requirements for UAS pilots in the Army and the Air Force, including the  Army\u2019s UAS Commander\u2019s Guide and Aircrew Training Manual and the  Air Force\u2019s Ready Aircrew Program Tasking Memorandum. In addition,  we assessed the services\u2019 UAS pilot training programs using a set of core  characteristics that constitute a strategic training program that we  previously developed for assessing strategic training and development  efforts in the federal government. These characteristics include  leadership commitment and communication as well as effective resource  allocation. To identify the extent to which the military services incorporate  these core characteristics in their training programs and face challenges  in ensuring that their UAS pilots complete their required training, we  developed a questionnaire based on these characteristics and on the  services\u2019 UAS training programs. We distributed the questionnaire to  each of the service\u2019s headquarters, training commands, and operational  commands. To include diverse UAS unit perspectives, we also randomly  selected a nongeneralizable sample of 14 UAS units in each of the  services based on factors including aircraft types flown in the UAS unit  and geographical location of the unit. We distributed the questionnaire to  the commanders of the selected units. We attained an 85 percent  response rate for the questionnaires. We analyzed responses we  obtained from each of the questionnaires, and compared the perspectives  we collected to the GAO criteria. We also reviewed a March 2015 Army  Training and Doctrine Command review that evaluated continuation  training for Army UAS units.  In addition, we reviewed continuation  training requirements included in the Air Force\u2019s 2014 Ready Aircrew  Program Tasking Memorandum. We compared these requirements to  fiscal year 2014 training data for all seven of Creech Air Force Base\u2019s  MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper units that have the same mission  requirements outlined in this memorandum. Fiscal year 2014 is the most  recent year for which the data were available. The results from these  units are not generalizable to other UAS units or fiscal years.", "For our second objective, we reviewed the Army UAS instructor course  prerequisites that provide requirements for instructors regarding their  rank, the number of hours they have flown a UAS, and other factors. We  compared these course prerequisites to the most recent Army  documentation on UAS operators who attended the Army school to  become an instructor in fiscal year 2013, fiscal year 2014, and October  2014 to February 2015, to identify the extent to which instructors met  these course prerequisites during that time period. We also compared Air  Force documentation on the actual numbers of Air Force UAS pilots in Air  Force UAS assignments to the Air Force planned number of positions for  UAS pilots. In addition, we compared the actual numbers of Air Force  UAS instructor pilots at the formal training unit at Holloman Air Force  Base to the Air Force planned number of positions at the formal training  unit. In addition, we visited UAS units at five bases: Ft. Huachuca, AZ; Ft.  Hood, TX; Holloman Air Force Base, NM; Creech Air Force Base, NV;  and Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, NC. We selected the locations  on the basis of several factors including the type and size of UAS flown in  the unit; missions of the unit; whether or not the unit is deployed (we did  not meet with units who were deployed); number of UAS pilots in the unit;  the major command of the unit; and location of the unit. At each  instillation, we met with unit commanders and other leaders to discuss  their views about training UAS pilots. We also conducted 18 focus groups  with active-duty UAS pilots at these locations to gain their perspectives on  their services\u2019 UAS training efforts.  To select specific UAS pilots to  participate in our focus groups, we worked with officials at each of the  instillations to develop a diverse group of active-duty UAS pilots. To  obtain a variety of perspectives, we selected UAS pilots with varying  amounts of experience flying UASs and additional duties in their units.  The opinions of UAS pilots we obtained during our focus groups are not  generalizable to the populations of all UAS pilots. We also interviewed the  Director of Training at the Army\u2019s initial qualification school at Fort  Huachuca, and officials at Army Headquarters and the Wing Commander,  Operations Group and UAS unit commanders at the Air Force\u2019s formal  training unit at Holloman Air Force Base.", "For our third objective, we assessed the extent to which the Office of the  Secretary of Defense and the military services coordinate on training UAS  pilots using key practices for enhancing and sustaining collaboration  among federal agencies that we previously developed. These key  practices include defining and articulating a common outcome for  coordinated efforts and establishing mutually reinforcing or joint  strategies. We assessed the department\u2019s actions using seven of the  eight key practices. We excluded one key practice related to reinforcing  individual accountability for collaborative efforts through performance  management systems. Evaluating this practice involves assessing the  extent to which agencies set expectations for senior executives for  collaboration within and across organizational boundaries in their  individual performance plans. We did not include this key practice in our  review because many of the officials who oversee UAS pilot training in  the services are military members, and the military does not establish  individual performance plans for its servicemembers. To identify the  extent to which the DOD organizations applied these key practices, we  analyzed documentation such as guidelines for a UAS training strategy  that the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Readiness provided to the RAND Corporation, and interviewed officials  from the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Readiness and knowledgeable offices within each military service. We  compared this information to the key practices to determine the extent to  which the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Readiness and the military services coordinate and collaborate with one  another to train UAS pilots. We assessed the reliability of the data used to  directly support findings in the development of this report by reviewing  related documentation and interviewing agency officials knowledgeable  about the data. Specifically, we assessed the reliability of the Air Force\u2019s  fiscal year 2014 data on continuation training completed by seven UAS  units at Creech Air Force Base to fulfill requirements laid out in the Air  Combat Command Ready Aircrew Program Tasking Memorandum, the  Army\u2019s fiscal year 2013 to February 2015 data on waivers granted to UAS  pilots attending the UAS school to become instructors, and March 2015  data on the Air Force\u2019s current UAS pilot staffing levels and staffing levels  at the formal training unit. We determined that these data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. We provide further  details on our scope and methodology in appendix II.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2014 to May 2015 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

For  example, group 1 UAS weigh 20 pounds or less whereas group 5 UAS  weigh more than 1,320 pounds. Servicemembers who operate the  larger and more capable UAS, in group 3 or above, are either manned- aircraft pilots or pilots specializing in flying UAS and are to receive 4 or  more months of training to prepare them to fly UAS.

During this phase, the Army  teaches its pilots to launch and recover a UAS, conduct  reconnaissance and surveillance, and participate in a field training  exercise.

Training and Doctrine Command assessed the level of unit readiness  associated with the amount of training these units completed using the  Army\u2019s unit training proficiency system specified in Army Pamphlet 220-1,  Defense Readiness Reporting System-Army Procedures. This system  includes a four-tiered rating system ranging from T-1 to T-4. In this  system a T-1 rating indicates the highest level of unit training proficiency,  whereas T-3 and T-4 ratings indicate that the unit is untrained on one or  more of the mission essential tasks that the unit was designed to perform  in an operational environment. Using this system to assess the 65  Shadow units that were not deployed, Training and Doctrine Command  found that 1 unit was rated at T-1, 3 units were rated at T-2, and 61 units  were rated at T-3 or T-4. In addition, Training and Doctrine Command  found that 11 of the 13 deployed units were rated T-1 and the other 2  deployed Shadow units were rated T-2, and both of the units at the UAS  training school were rated at T-1 (see table 2).", "Army Training and Doctrine Command found a number of factors led to  UAS pilots in Army Shadow units not completing training in their units in  fiscal year 2014. For example, the review found that UAS units organized  under infantry brigades have a particular challenge completing training in  their units because the unit commanders and leadership overseeing  these brigades may not be fully aware of the UAS units\u2019 training  requirements. In addition, the review found that a number of warrant  officers were not qualified and current on the units\u2019 aircraft that they were  assigned to oversee. The review included recommendations that the  Army plans to implement to increase emphasis on training in UAS units,  to provide training on UAS training to unit commanders, and to establish a  system to report UAS training readiness on periodic unit status reports.

In particular, pilots in  all eight of the focus groups we conducted with Army UAS pilots stated  that they cannot complete training in their units. For example, a pilot in  one of our focus groups stated that during his 3 years as a UAS pilot, he  had been regularly tasked to complete non-training-related activities, and  as a result he completed a total of 36 training flight hours even though the  requirement is 24 flight hours per year. Further, we administered a  questionnaire to various offices within each military service and five of the  six Army UAS units that responded indicated that their units faced  challenges completing training in their units. For example, one unit  respondent stated that Army UAS units rarely have the time to meet their  training requirements. A second unit respondent stated that Army UAS  units are taxed trying to maintain proper training in units and have little  time to progress into proficient pilots due to training equipment and  resource constraints. A third respondent stated that training in units is  very limited due to competing priorities, including being consistently  tasked by Army Forces Command to train other units, which prevents  their unit from training their own UAS operators. In addition, four of the six  Army UAS units that responded stated that the Army provides too little  funding for the training that takes place in units to help ensure that this  training achieves the Army goals for that training.", "Further, focus groups we conducted with Army UAS pilots and some  Army officials indicated that leadership of larger non-aviation units that  oversee Army UAS units may not fully understand the training needs for  Army UAS pilots. Specifically, pilots in seven of the eight focus groups  that we conducted with Army UAS pilots stated that leadership of larger  non-aviation units that oversee their UAS units do not understand UAS  pilot training. Moreover, four of the six units that responded to our  questionnaire indicated that leadership of larger non-aviation units that  oversee Army UAS units lacks understanding of UAS unit training needs.

In addition, Creech Air Force Base officials stated that  UAS pilots perform one to two of their required missions regularly based  on operational needs, which also allows them to fulfill training  requirements for those missions. However, due to shortages of UAS  pilots and high workloads some pilots do not complete training  requirements for their other five to six missions. As of March 2015, the Air  Force has staffed the UAS pilot career field at 83 percent of the total  number of UAS pilots that the Air Force believes are necessary to sustain  current UAS operations and training. We conducted focus groups with  seven groups of Air Force UAS pilots and pilots in all these groups stated  that they could not conduct continuation training because their units were  understaffed. In addition, Air Force headquarters officials stated that they  think the current number of UAS pilots that the Air Force has approved for  its UAS units is not enough to accomplish the workload of UAS units. As  a result, workloads for Air Force UAS units are high, and in January 2015,  the Secretary of the Air Force stated that on average Air Force UAS pilots  fly 6 days in a row and work 13- to 14-hour days.", "In April 2014, we found that the Air Force had shortages of UAS pilots  and we made multiple recommendations to address these shortages. In  particular, we found that the Air Force had operated below its optimum  crew ratio, which is a metric used to determine the personnel needs for  Air Force aviation units, and that the Air Force had not tailored its  recruiting and retention strategy to align with the specific needs and  challenges of UAS pilots. We made four recommendations related to  these findings including that the Air Force update crew ratios for UAS  units to help ensure that the Air Force establishes a more accurate  understanding of the required number of UAS pilots needed in its units  and that the Air Force develop a recruiting and retention strategy that is  tailored to the specific needs and challenges of UAS pilots to help ensure  that the Air Force can meet and retain required staffing levels to meet its  mission.", "The Air Force concurred with these recommendations and has taken  some actions but has not yet fully implemented them. Specifically, a  headquarters Air Force official stated that, in February 2015, the Air Force  completed the first phase of a three-phase personnel requirements study  designed to update the UAS unit crew ratio. The headquarters official also  stated that Air Force senior leaders are reviewing the results of the first  phase of the study and expect to update the UAS unit crew ratio by  summer 2015. In addition, in fiscal year 2014, the Air Force began using  a new process that provides the Air Force with greater flexibility to assign  cadets who were preparing to join the Air Force. Under this process, the  cadets are assigned to various Air Force careers, which enabled the Air  Force to meet its quota for the number of cadets who graduate from Air  Force officer schools and agree to serve as UAS pilots. Further, in  January 2015, the Air Force more than doubled the Assignment Incentive  Pay for UAS pilots who are reaching the end of their 6-year service  commitment to $1500 a month. As noted above, the Air Force continues  to face a shortage of UAS pilots, but fully implementing our April 2014  recommendations would better position the Air Force to address these  shortages.

The Army  significantly increased the number of UAS units and UAS pilots in recent  years, and as a result many lack the experience and proficiency needed  to be an instructor, according to officials from the Army Aviation Center of  Excellence. To address this shortage and accommodate the need for  more instructors, the Army began to waive course prerequisites for the  UAS instructor course so that it could enable these less experienced and  less proficient UAS pilots to become instructors, according to officials  from the Army Aviation Center of Excellence.", "Army Aviation Center of Excellence officials also stated that the instructor  course prerequisites are important because they help ensure that the  UAS pilots the Army trains to become instructors are the most  experienced and most proficient pilots and can successfully train other  UAS pilots. One of the officials also stated that the Army would prefer not  to grant waivers to any UAS pilot attending the course so that the pilots  who become instructors would be experienced and able to share their  experiences with the pilots they train. In contrast, pilots with less  experience may not be able to refer to and use more varied experiences  during instructional time with UAS pilots and thus may not be as prepared  to successfully train other UAS pilots to perform at the highest levels of  proficiency.", "The instructor course prerequisites include a minimum rank, a minimum  number of flying hours piloting a UAS, whether a pilot has completed their  readiness level training, and whether a pilot has recently completed  certain flying tasks\u2014known as currency. For example, the Army course  prerequisites specify that pilots attending the course to become an  instructor for the MQ-1C Gray Eagle should (1) hold the enlisted rank of  sergeant (E-5), (2) have flown a UAS for a minimum of 200 hours, (3) be  designated at readiness level one, and (4) be current in their experience,  specifically by having flown a UAS within the last 60 days.", "According to an official from the Aviation Center of Excellence, a pilot\u2019s  battalion commander and the commander of the UAS school are  responsible for approving requests to waive these course prerequisites.  Following their approval, a pilot\u2019s unit commander assesses the pilot\u2019s  potential to successfully complete the instructor training and fulfill duties  required of instructors. The Army waived the instructor course  prerequisites for about 40 percent of the UAS pilots attending the course  from the beginning of fiscal year 2013 through February 2015.  Specifically, the Army waived one or more of these course prerequisites  for 38 percent of the pilots who attended the course in fiscal year 2013,  48 percent of the pilots who attended the course in fiscal year 2014, and  23 percent of the pilots who attended the course from October 2014  through February 2015 (see table 3).", "The Army has taken some steps to mitigate the potential risks of using  less proficient instructors. Specifically, Army Aviation Center of  Excellence officials stated that in fiscal year 2015, the Army stopped  waiving the instructor course prerequisites that UAS pilots be designated  at readiness level one and that pilots be current in their experience flying  a UAS. In addition, prior to fiscal year 2015, the Army had provided  remedial training to pilots who had not met these two course  prerequisites. The Army\u2019s action to stop allowing waivers for these two  course prerequisites helps to ensure that the pilots it allows to become  instructors meet the minimum UAS flying proficiency course prerequisites.", "However, the Army has not fully addressed the potential risks of using  less proficient and less experienced instructors. Although the Army  reduced the number of waivers granted so far in fiscal year 2015 by no  longer waiving the course prerequisites related to minimum proficiency,  the Army can continue to grant waivers for the course prerequisites  related to experience, including that UAS pilots have a minimum number  of flying hours in a UAS and hold the minimum enlisted rank of sergeant.  In addition, the Army has not provided additional preparation to address  the gap in experience for the instructors who have completed the  instructor course nor does it have plans to address this gap in experience  for those pilots who will attend the course in the future.", "Within a strategic training and development process, one core practice  calls for agencies to provide appropriate resources for their training  programs, and that agency leaders should consistently demonstrate that  they support and value continuous learning. Army officials have stated  that experienced instructors are central to providing successful  continuous learning to its UAS pilots, and in that regard are important  resources in training programs. However, the Army faces risks that by  training with less experienced instructors, Army UAS pilots may not be  receiving the highest caliber of training needed to prepare them to be able  to successfully perform UAS missions in the future. In addition, though  the Army expects to face shortages of experienced and proficient UAS  pilots through fiscal year 2019, the Army has not fully addressed the  potential risks of training with less experienced pilots, such as by  providing additional preparation for current and future instructors who do  not meet one or more course prerequisites related to experience to  enhance their ability to successfully provide training."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Air Force Has Taken Action to Address Shortages of Instructors at Its UAS Formal Training Unit", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force has taken action to address shortages of instructors at its  UAS formal training unit at Holloman Air Force Base.

In addition, the Air Force and the Army have  published UAS strategies that outline their services\u2019 plans to develop,  organize and incorporate the use of UAS into their missions, which is  consistent with the practice of reinforcing agency accountability for  collaborative efforts with plans and reports. However, the Air Force and  Army strategies do not address if or how the services will coordinate with  one another on UAS pilot training. Further, we also found that the actions  that the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Readiness)  and the services had taken were not fully consistent with these key  practices. See table 4 for a description of these key practices, a  description of DOD actions, and our assessment.", "In addition, officials from three of the four military service headquarters  offices who responded to our questionnaire expressed limited support for  further coordination with the other services on UAS pilot training. For  example, headquarters officials from the Army and the Air Force stated  that they did not anticipate any additional benefit to coordinating with the  other services on UAS pilot training. Further, headquarters officials from  the Army and the Navy stated that they did not foresee any other benefits  from coordinating with the other services on UAS pilot training because  their services fly different UAS with different missions.", "Moreover, DOD has not yet issued a UAS training strategy that  addresses if and how the services should coordinate with one another to  share information on training UAS pilots. In 2010, we found that DOD had  commenced initiatives to address training challenges, but had not  developed a results-oriented strategy to prioritize and synchronize these  efforts. We recommended that DOD establish a UAS training strategy to  comprehensively resolve challenges that affect the ability of the Air Force  and the Army to train personnel for UAS operations and DOD concurred  with our recommendation. The Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary  of Defense (Readiness) engaged the RAND Corporation to draft a UAS  training strategy and provided RAND with guidelines about the content  and purpose of the strategy. However, these guidelines do not discuss if  or how the services should coordinate on UAS pilot training.

For example,  1 Army UAS unit stated that coordinating training with other services  could help shorten the amount of time they spend acclimating to other  services once deployed and would allow for an easier transition to  working together during missions. Additionally, another Army UAS unit  stated that they were unable to train because of a poorly written certificate  of authorization, which is the document that requires approval by the  Federal Aviation Administration before the services can fly their UAS in  the National Airspace System. Further, the unit stated that they could  have avoided a temporary halt in training and benefited from reaching out  to the Air Force for guidance on this process rather than the unit spending  time developing their own system.

In addition, without taking additional  steps to mitigate the potential risks of using less experienced instructors,  the Army may be unable to ensure that the training these instructors  provide will result in highly skilled future UAS pilots. Finally, it is important  that DOD identify ways to achieve its missions more efficiently and  effectively. It is encouraging that the Office of the Deputy Assistant  Secretary of Defense (Readiness) and the services coordinate on UAS  pilot training in some areas such as the Air Force and the Army training  all Marine Corps UAS pilots and the Air Force and the Army publishing  UAS strategies.

These characteristics include  leadership commitment and communication; effective resource allocation;  and continuous performance improvement. To develop these  characteristics in 2004, we consulted government officials and experts in  the private sector, academia, and nonprofit organizations; examined laws  and regulations related to training and development in the federal  government; and reviewed the sizeable body of literature on training and  development issues, including previous GAO products on a range of  human capital topics.", "To identify the extent to which the military services applied these  principles in their training programs, we developed a questionnaire based  on these characteristics and on the services\u2019 UAS training programs.

To select specific  UAS pilots to participate in our focus groups, we worked with officials at  each of the instillations to develop a diverse group of active-duty UAS  pilots. To obtain a variety of perspectives, we selected UAS pilots with  various amounts of experience flying UASs and additional duties in their  units. To help ensure an open discussion in the groups, we organized  them by rank and met with groups of similar rank. We also met with some  groups of instructor pilots separately. These groups typically consisted of  six to nine UAS pilots.", "We used content analysis to analyze detailed notes from each focus  group to identify themes that participants expressed across all or most of  the groups.

We assessed the department\u2019s actions using  seven of the eight key practices from our prior report. We excluded one  key practice related to reinforcing individual accountability for  collaborative efforts through performance management systems.  Evaluating this practice involves assessing the extent to which agencies  set expectations for senior executives for collaboration within and across  organizational boundaries in their individual performance plans. We did  not include this key practice in our review because many of the officials  who oversee UAS pilot training in the services are military members and  the military does not establish individual performance plans for its  servicemembers. We reviewed our adaptation with officials from the  Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness. These  officials agreed that these practices were relevant to our review. The  seven key practices that we assessed in our review were: (1) defining and  articulating a common outcome; (2) establishing mutually reinforcing or  joint strategies; (3) identifying and addressing needs by leveraging  resources; (4) agreeing on roles and responsibilities; (5) establishing  compatible policies, procedures, and other means to operate across  agency boundaries; (6) developing mechanisms to monitor, evaluate, and  report on results; and (7) reinforcing agency accountability for  collaborative efforts through agency plans and reports.", "To identify the extent to which the DOD organizations applied these  practices, we analyzed documentation related to coordination on UAS  pilot training that we obtained from a variety of DOD offices. For example,  we analyzed guidelines for a UAS training strategy that the Office of the  Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness provided to the  RAND Corporation; a draft UAS training strategy developed by the RAND  Corporation; UAS strategies that the Army and Air Force issued; and  documentation that shows that the Air Force and Army train all Marine  Corps UAS pilots. In addition, we analyzed responses we obtained from  each of the questionnaires we administered and focused on questions  related to coordination among the services. Further, we collected  additional information in interviews with officials from the Office of the  Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness, the UAS Task  Force, and knowledgeable officials within each military service. We then  compared the information we collected from these sources to the key  practices that help enhance and sustain coordination that we previously  developed to determine the extent to which the Office of the Deputy  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness and the military services  coordinate to train UAS pilots.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2014 to May 2015 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comment from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Lori Atkinson (Assistant Director),  James P.
