Specifically, to provide  information about the ownership characteristics and geographic distribution  of payment recipients and determine the dollar amount of direct payments  made for farms with qualifying acreage, we obtained USDA data indicating  the number, amount, and recipient for direct payments made from program  years 2003 through 2011\u2014that is, from the program\u2019s first full year of  operation through the most recent year for which complete program data  are available. We also obtained and analyzed data detailing the acreage  of qualifying farms and the planting history for each farm for which direct  payments were made and other records pertaining to the share of  payments received by various individuals and entities. In particular, we  obtained data from USDA\u2019s compliance share file that indicates how a  producer\u2014whether an individual or an entity\u2014is involved and whether they  own a particular farm field or area of land for which direct payments were  made. Producers report they either (1) own and operate the farm (\u201cowner- operators\u201d), (2) operate but do not own the farm (\u201ctenants\u201d), or (3) are an  owner of the farm (\u201cother owners\u201d). To assess the reliability of USDA\u2019s  data, we (1) performed electronic testing of required data elements, (2)  reviewed existing information about the data and the system that produced  them, and (3) interviewed agency officials knowledgeable about the data.  We found these data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report. To examine whether direct payments are aligned with principles  significant to integrity, effectiveness, and efficiency in farm bill programs,  we reviewed our previous work in the area\u2014in particular our March 2011  report on overlap and duplication of federal programs, which discussed  observations regarding direct payments. We also reviewed our April 2012  report, which reviewed our recent work on farm bill programs and identified  the principles and associated key questions. These principles may not  represent all potential principles that could be considered. We collected  additional data where possible to determine how circumstances regarding  direct payments may have changed more recently and evaluated direct  payments according to the principles identified in our earlier work. We  spoke with officials in FSA headquarters, state, and county offices who are  responsible for ensuring that direct payment recipients meet requirements  for such payments. We also visited five selected FSA county offices located  in Arizona and Louisiana. We selected these county offices because FSA  data showed a relatively high number of end-of-year reviews of farming  operations in these counties. In addition, some of these counties had  experienced high levels of residential growth in recent years. During our  visits, we reviewed case files, including those of farming operations that  had undergone or were undergoing end-of-year reviews, and observed  some of these farms.

USDA, through its Commodity Credit  Corporation (CCC), calculates direct payments using a formula that  factors in \u201cbase acres,\u201d a measure of a farm\u2019s crop production history  based on the number of acres planted on the farm during certain past  years. The term base acres refers to a farm\u2019s average planted acreage of  specific crops during those years; the term does not refer to specific  physical acres on that farm. The direct payment formula uses a fixed  percentage of the average number of acres planted on the farm from  1998 through 2001 and multiplies that number by the farm\u2019s historical  crop yield and a statutorily fixed payment rate. The percentage and  payment rates for each crop are specified in legislation, commonly  referred to as farm bills, passed by Congress roughly every 5 years. For  2009 through 2011, this percentage was set at 83 percent; for 2012, it  was set at 85 percent. Figure 1 illustrates the process for calculating a  producer\u2019s direct payment.", "Through this system, a producer\u2019s direct payments are based on the  historical production of a particular crop. Moreover, producers have  almost complete flexibility in deciding which crops to plant, and they  receive payments as long as they meet eligibility criteria, even if they  decide to plant different crops or not plant crops at all. In years in which  they do not plant, however, the farm bill requires that the relevant land be  maintained in accordance with sound agricultural practices. For example,  producers must take steps to minimize the growth of weeds on the land.  Producers also are required to report planting information each year on  forms called acreage reports. The United States has classified direct  payments as meeting World Trade Organization rules for nontrade  distorting payments; direct payments are not tied to specific production or  prices, and they are generally deemed not to distort international  agricultural markets.", "After learning of instances where farm payments were made to  individuals not involved in farming, Congress enacted the Agricultural  Reconciliation Act of 1987, commonly referred to as the Farm Program  Payments Integrity Act. The act, among other measures, sets eligibility  criteria to ensure that only individuals and entities \u201cactively engaged in  farming\u201d receive certain farm program payments. Specifically, according  to the 2008 Farm Bill, direct payments, Average Crop Revenue Election  (ACRE), and counter-cyclical payment recipients are required to be  actively engaged in farming. FSA is responsible for ensuring that direct  payment recipients meet program eligibility criteria. FSA carries out this  responsibility through its headquarters office, 50 state offices, and  approximately 2,200 county offices. Producers file with their local FSA  county office a farm operating plan in which they document the number of  recipients qualifying for payments, the name of each payment recipient,  and each recipient\u2019s role in the farming operation and share of profits and  losses. Producers must update this plan when a change in their operation  occurs, such as a change in the farm\u2019s ownership.", "FSA reviews these plans to determine, among other things, the number of  recipients who qualify for payments and whether they are actively engaged  in farming. To be considered actively engaged in farming, an individual  recipient must make significant contributions to the farming operation in two  areas: (1) capital, land, or equipment and (2) personal labor or active  personal management. An entity, such as a corporation, limited  partnership, or trust is generally considered actively engaged in farming if  the entity separately makes a significant contribution of capital, land, or  equipment, and its members collectively make a significant contribution of  personal labor or active personal management to a farming operation. In  2010, FSA issued a rule stating that members of a legal entity are excepted  from the requirement to make contributions of active personal labor or  active person management if (1) at least 50 percent of the interest is held  by members that are providing active personal labor or active personal  management and (2) total payments, including direct payments, counter- cyclical payments, and ACRE payments are less than or equal to one  \u201cpayment limitation\u201d\u2014a statutorily set limit on the value of the payment  made to the producer(s). FSA\u2019s regulations define active personal  management to include such tasks as arranging financing for the operation,  supervising the planting and harvesting of crops, and marketing crops. For  both individuals and entities, their contributions to the farming operation  must also be commensurate with their share of the farming operation\u2019s  profits or losses.", "To help oversee direct payments, FSA monitors farm operations\u2019 land  usage through producers\u2019 acreage reports, and at the end of the year it  conducts a detailed review of a sample of farm operating plans.  Specifically, FSA field offices compare selected plans against supporting  documentation to help monitor whether farming operations were  conducted in accordance with their plans. These end-of-year reviews  include an assessment of whether payment recipients met program  requirements. FSA selects its sample of farming operations for these  reviews on the basis of, among other criteria, the restructuring or  formation of a farming operation in the past year and the number of  farming operations in which an individual or legal entity is involved.  According to FSA officials, the selection process emphasizes farm  operations involving six or more producers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Varied Producers, Who Are Geographically Concentrated, Received More Than $46 Billion in Direct Payments from 2003 through 2011", "paragraphs": ["From 2003 through 2011, USDA made more than $46 billion in direct  payments, which was concentrated among certain counties, among  recipients located within 100 miles of farms qualifying for payments, and  among certain types of producers.

Production flexibility contract payments, the precursors to  direct payments, were established after a period in the early 1990s of  relatively low farm income. In August 2011, however, USDA reported that  all three measures of farm-sector earnings\u2014net farm income, net cash  income, and the value of the farm sector\u2019s production of goods and  services from farming versus its outlays to nonfarm sectors (i.e., \u201cnet  value added\u201d) were forecast to rise more than 20 percent in 2011 over  recent historical highs or near-highs.

In July 2003, we  testified before the House Committee on Ways and Means about the  need to improve the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of  government programs, policies, and activities and to undertake a  fundamental reassessment of what government does and how it does it.We stated that this undertaking would require looking at current federal  programs in terms of their goals and results and determining whether  (1) other approaches might succeed in achieving the goal, (2) taxpayers  are getting a good \u201creturn on investment\u201d from the program, and (3) the  program\u2019s priority is higher or lower today given the nation\u2019s evolving  challenges and fiscal constraints.

For example,  in June 2009, USDA\u2019s Economic Research Service reported that the  primary economic effects of direct payments are increases in producers\u2019  incomes and land values. In this way, direct payments may compound  challenges for beginning farmers. We reported in September 2007 that  beginning farmers face multiple challenges, including a need for funds to  purchase farmland. In this regard, an increase in the price of land as a  result of direct payments\u2014or other farm program subsidies\u2014may  potentially raise the amount of debt beginning farmers need to incur to  buy their own farm or additional farmland.", "During the course of our work, we identified cases where direct payments  support recipients who FSA officials said own farmland that would not be  economically viable in the absence of these payments. For example, in 1  county, 190 farms were fallow\u2014they did not grow any crop of any type\u2014 for 5 consecutive years, and producers claimed payments for these  farms. According to FSA county officials, these recipients are unable to  profitably farm their land or lease it to other producers because the land is  of poor quality and lacks access to irrigation. Another FSA county official  from another state said that the producers associated with the 32 farms in  that county that were fallow for 5 consecutive years were generally  unable to obtain financing for their farming operations and could not  profitably farm their land. Nevertheless, these landowners remain eligible  for direct payments under a provision of the 2008 Farm Bill known as the  \u201clandowner exemption.\u201d Under this exemption, landowners can remain eligible for direct payments as long as the landowners\u2019 interest in their  acreage depends directly on the output of that acreage. In practice,  therefore, landowners can remain eligible if they (1) operate the land  themselves, (2) lease the land for a rent that depends on the production  of a crop, or (3) do not lease or operate the land and therefore receive no  production-related revenue from it. In practice, however, it appears the  landowner exemption allows landowners to receive payments for land  that is no longer economically viable for farming. Direct payments may  have less potential than other farm programs to distort prices and  production, but economic distortions can nonetheless result from these  payments. Furthermore, a trade-off exists between being less market  distorting\u2014as direct payments are considered to be\u2014and targeting  benefits to adjust to need."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Oversight of Direct Payments Is Weak", "paragraphs": ["During the course of our work, we identified several concerns with regard  to FSA\u2019s oversight of direct payments: FSA has not developed a  systematic process to report on acreage that may no longer be usable for  agriculture and therefore ineligible for direct payments; FSA conducts  relatively few end-of-year reviews and generally does not complete these  reviews within expected time frames; and FSA has not kept data on  enforcement.", "FSA has not systematically reported or corroborated the extent to which  land may no longer be eligible for direct payments because it has been  converted to nonfarm uses. The 2008 Farm Bill instructed the Secretary  of Agriculture to establish procedures to identify such land and each year,  to \u201censure, to the maximum extent practicable, that payments are  received only by producers,\u201d submit to Congress a report describing the  results of USDA\u2019s actions to identify and reduce base acres for land that  has been subdivided and developed for nonfarm use. The 2008 Farm Bill  uses base acres to determine direct payments, Average Crop Revenue  Election (ACRE) payments, and counter-cyclical payments. FSA issued  its first report in response to this mandate in September 2011, covering  2009 and 2010. According to this report, about 190,000 acres\u2014about  129,000 in 2009 and 61,000 in 2010\u2014were converted to nonfarm use  during this period. However, the report noted that these estimates were  likely low, stating that USDA\u2019s periodic Natural Resources Inventory  estimated that an average of 440,000 cropland acres were converted to  nonfarm uses annually from 1982 through 2007.", "FSA\u2019s report had several methodological limitations that we identified. For  example, FSA relied exclusively on surveying the 50 FSA state offices for  information on such conversions. It did not use or corroborate the state  offices\u2019 results with other possible sources of information, including  geospatial information on land use gathered by USDA\u2019s National  Agriculture Imagery Program, which provides geospatial imagery data to  support FSA compliance activities. FSA also did not provide its state  offices with guidance for collecting information on such conversions. As a  result, these offices, and their associated county offices, used a variety of  methods to collect this information. For example, FSA officials in one  county office said they identified base acreage reductions by consulting   In another case, FSA county  records of County Committee meetings. office officials said they used Base Acreage Yield Adjustment reports to  identify base acreage that was already permanently reduced, and Out of  Balance Tracts reports to identify other base acreage that may signal the  need for a base acreage reduction.and consequently unsystematic process, FSA may have  underrepresented the extent to which land may no longer be eligible for  direct payments because it has been converted to nonfarm uses in its  required report to Congress.", "As a result of these varying methods  FSA headquarters officials said that, because in the past they were not  required to report land converted from agriculture to residential or other  nonfarm use, they had not systematically tried to track such land. They  also stated that because producers, including direct payment recipients,  are required to report planting information each year and certify the  accuracy of this information, FSA has been able to identify land subject to  base acre reductions manually through such reports. These officials  stated that FSA relied on such manual records to report on land that was  converted to nonfarm uses in its September 2011 mandated report, and it  has begun compiling data for the next report, covering 2011, using the  same methodology. However, these officials noted that in October 2011  FSA updated its data collection systems to compile the mandated report  covering 2012 base acre reductions through a computerized tracking  system. This system includes a reporting code to identify whether the  base acre reduction was made because land was converted to nonfarm  uses, including residential or commercial uses.", "All of the FSA county officials we spoke with said that geospatial imagery  was very helpful in identifying land that may no longer be usable for  agriculture, and some noted this was particularly so as budget constraints  have precluded more frequent on-site farm inspections. For example,  some of these officials spoke of instances where they knew from  geospatial imagery that land had been converted from agricultural use,  and the producer had not informed FSA. Nevertheless, officials said, the  National Agriculture Imagery Program did not provide such imagery  regularly and they received updated imagery only every few years,  limiting their ability to identify land that may no longer be usable for  agriculture\u2014and therefore ineligible for direct payments. An imagery  program official stated that the program had received inconsistent funding  since its establishment in 2002. As a result, this official said, in 2008 the  office began collecting imagery data in 3-year cycles rather than annually,  as would meet program needs. The official stated that three USDA  agencies and the Department of the Interior are funding the  approximately $40-million-per-year effort. The official added that the  imagery program\u2019s own requirements and FSA\u2019s needs continue to call  for collecting and reporting data annually, but funding constraints  preclude the program from doing so.", "FSA\u2019s detailed end-of-year reviews, in which FSA officials assess  whether direct payment recipients met program requirements, such as  being actively engaged in farming, have key weaknesses. Specifically,  FSA conducts relatively few end-of-year reviews, and generally does not  complete these reviews within expected time frames.", "FSA guidance states that the purpose of end-of-year reviews is to  maintain the integrity of payment limitation and payment eligibility  provisions by verifying that farming operations were carried out as  producers reported on their farm operating plans. One such provision for  direct payments is that all payment recipients be actively engaged in  farming, which, according to the 2008 Farm Bill, generally includes  making a \u201csignificant contribution\u201d that is at risk and commensurate with  the recipient\u2019s share of profits and losses from the farming operation.  Recipients of payments under ACRE and counter-cyclical payment  programs also are required to be \u201cactively engaged\u201d in farming. According  to FSA officials, to verify the extent to which producers\u2019 contributions  meet these, as well as other, eligibility requirements, FSA selects a  judgmental sample of farming operations for review on the basis of,  among other criteria, (1) whether the operation has undergone an  organizational change in the past year by, for example, adding another  entity or partner to the operation and (2) whether the operation receives  payments above a certain threshold. FSA officials said that their selection  process for end-of-year reviews is designed to direct limited resources  toward categories of recipients among whom officials most expect to find  wrongdoing such as fraud or other deliberate misrepresentation of a  farming operation. These officials explained that the recipient categories  emphasized for review include joint operations, particularly those  comprising three or more entities, because such operations offer more  potential and incentive for partners to exaggerate their contributions.", "Producers in farming operations selected for end-of-year review must  provide documentation to verify that the information they report on their  farm operating plan, including their contributions of land, capital,  equipment, labor, and management, is accurate. By reviewing such  documentation, FSA officials can determine whether the contributions, in  terms of risk and share of profits and losses, made by each participant in  a farming operation match the contributions reported for that participant  on the farm operating plan. FSA officials said that end-of-year reviews are  a key means of identifying potentially improper payments. In addition,  some FSA county officials said end-of-year reviews were useful in  identifying irregularities and fraud and cited cases in their experience  where producers returned direct payments determined to have been  erroneously disbursed. Nonetheless, we identified two key weaknesses in  FSA\u2019s end-of-year review process.", "First, FSA selects relatively few cases for annual end-of-year review. Our  analysis of FSA data showed that in 2008 and 2009, FSA selected for  review 0.04 percent of farming operations receiving direct payments. By  comparison, for fiscal year 2010, the Internal Revenue Service selected  at least 0.7 percent of taxpayers, from every income level\u2014an average of  1.1 percent of all taxpayers\u2014for examination. According to FSA  headquarters officials, they would like to select additional cases for  review, but the selection rate is relatively small because the reviews are  resource intensive. Increasing budget constraints and USDA\u2019s  announced plans to close some of FSA\u2019s 2,200 county offices and reduce  field staffing may further limit the number of cases for review the agency  can select in the future. These officials said that, because of resource  constraints, they select the sample according to categories of recipients  where they most expect to find wrongdoing, and waive categories of  recipients, such as landowners and spouses among whom they least  expect to find misrepresentation. However, we found that when FSA  waives reviews for some of the cases selected, the agency does not  replace them with reviews of other cases, as we recommended in April  2004. At the time, we reported that FSA was not reviewing a valid  sample of farm operating plans to reasonably assess the overall level of  compliance because its selection methodology did not replace waived  cases, resulting in a smaller sample size that might have affected the  validity of the sample results. In response to our recommendation, FSA  reduced the number of compliance reviews it waived each year but did  not act to replace reviews that were waived with new cases. FSA  continues to select a small sample of cases for review: in 2008 and 2009,  respectively, 23 and 154, or just under 6 and 13 percent, of selected  cases were waived, further decreasing the number of farming operations  reviewed.", "Second, FSA often completes end-of-year reviews late with respect to its  own expected time frames. According to an FSA official in charge of  selecting cases and monitoring the end-of-year review process, FSA  headquarters generally selects cases for review within the first 6 months  of the following year and generally expects county office staff to perform  their assigned reviews within a year of receiving the cases selected. As  of September 2011, however, 271 of 380 pending reviews for 2008  (71 percent) were more than 6 months past the expected 18-month  completion time frame, which includes the selection, assignment, and  conducting of these reviews. In May 2012, FSA reported that as of  February 2012, nearly 24 percent of pending reviews for 2008 were still  incomplete. Table 1 summarizes the status of end-of-year reviews for  2008 and 2009, as of September 2011 and February 2012.", "In addition, in February 2012 FSA reported that county offices in three  states\u2014California, Louisiana, and Mississippi\u2014had not completed some  of their 2006 or 2007 end-of-year reviews. FSA officials said they do not  regularly collect data on the number of end-of-year reviews completed  and pending. FSA officials also said that taking corrective action against  payment recipients becomes more difficult as reviews are delayed. For  example, with the passage of time, it is more difficult for FSA to collect  evidence of potential misrepresentation or fraud, as well as for producers  to provide the requested documentation. Furthermore, according to FSA  officials, completed end-of-year reviews are needed for USDA\u2019s Office of  Inspector General (OIG) to investigate cases of potential fraud or other  illegal activity.", "Federal internal control standards call for agencies to obtain, maintain,  and use relevant, reliable, and timely information for program oversight  and decision making, as well as for measuring progress toward meeting  agency performance goals. In addition, the Office of Management and  Budget directs agency managers to take timely and effective action to  correct internal control deficiencies. Furthermore, FSA\u2019s handbook on  determining eligibility for farm program payments states that \u201cetecting  schemes, fraudulent representations, and other equally serious actions of  persons and legal entities to circumvent payment eligibility and payment  limitation provisions is essential for producer compliance.\u201d The issues  we identified in FSA\u2019s end-of-year compliance review process leave the  agency with a less effective management oversight tool. For example, in  light of these problems, FSA is less able to identify potential fraud, waste,  and abuse; avert potentially improper payments; and enforce farm bill  provisions and related implementing regulations.", "USDA does not have data to demonstrate that it is using available  enforcement mechanisms against payment recipients found to have  misrepresented their farming operation so as to increase their direct  payments improperly, and the agency generally has not centrally tracked  data on such cases of misrepresentation. Specifically, when asked, FSA  officials were unable to provide the number of direct payment cases FSA  has referred to OIG for further investigation and potential prosecution by  U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices, but according to FSA officials, the number of such  cases has been small. For example, regarding potential fraud, FSA  officials cited only one case that was currently under active litigation. FSA  state offices are required to report any known or suspected violations of  criminal statutes to OIG for investigation, but according to OIG officials,  their investigators will pursue cases of potential fraud only if they  anticipate a \u201cgood outcome,\u201d that is, a successful prosecution. The  potential amount of funds to be recovered is another consideration.  According to FSA officials, the number of cases accepted for investigation  varies by region. For example, according to these officials, in regions with  significant drug crime, such as southern Texas, U.S. Attorneys give  priority to drug cases and accept virtually no farm program cases. This  situation notwithstanding, OIG and FSA officials said that FSA offices in  Texas refer very few compliance and payment limitation cases to OIG.  According to OIG officials, depending on the circumstances, FSA may be  able to take administrative action against a producer in an attempt to  recover inappropriately disbursed funds even if the producer is not  prosecuted by state or federal authorities for violations of law, by following  its own procedures or consulting with the Office of General Counsel.  However, both OIG and FSA officials said that, in cases of alleged fraud,  the payment recipient may not be subject to additional enforcement  mechanisms unless prosecuted and convicted. FSA regulations provide  that any producer found to have committed fraud may be debarred from  receiving further payments for up to 5 years.provide that any producer found to have engaged in misrepresentation  may be debarred from receiving further payments for up to 2 years.  However, if FSA does not maintain comprehensive data on payment  recipients that may have misrepresented their farming operation,  including by name of producers, it is unclear how it can consistently  pursue and recover improper payments.", "FSA headquarters officials stated that most payment recipients are  honest and comply with direct payment eligibility requirements, and that  the level of enforcement is appropriate. However, the officials could not  provide data on compliance. Some FSA county officials expressed  concerns about discouraging producers from farming, should the  producer be debarred from receiving further payments. They also said  that they can and do recover improper payments from producers without  pursuing potential prosecution. However, FSA\u2019s reluctance to pursue  these cases and enforcement mechanisms could encourage some  producers to engage in and profit from submitting false information with  little fear of being caught or punished.", "Moreover, FSA officials acknowledged that the agency lacks  comprehensive data on its enforcement actions. Specifically, FSA officials  said that the agency does not keep a centralized, national database or list  of direct payment recipients found to be at fault for misrepresentation,  including recipients convicted of fraud, debarred from future payments,  referred to OIG for investigation, or found by county or state FSA offices  to have received improper payments by misrepresenting their farming  operation\u2014including in cases in which these payments were later  recouped. FSA does, however, maintain data at the national level on  payments it reduced because it determined a certain producer was  ineligible before making the payment. According to these data, in 2011  FSA reduced payments to certain direct payment recipients by almost  $20 million for not being actively engaged in farming; by more than  $89 million for exceeding payment limitations; by over $37 million for  exceeding income limitations; and by $3,393 for fraud. Table 2  summarizes the amount of these reduced payments for 2010 and 2011.", "Under the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002, as amended,  federal agencies are required to estimate the level of improper payments  in their programs. In November 2011 USDA reported that its error rate  for making direct and counter-cyclical payments was 0.05 percent, which  was below its 2010 error rate of 0.96 percent and below its target of 0.40  percent. However, because USDA does not keep comprehensive data  on its enforcement actions or the amount of money it recovers after  improper disbursements are made, the level of improper payments  reported by FSA for the direct payments program may be understated."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Direct payments allow producers flexibility in the type and amount of  crops to plant by making payments based on historical production trends,  rather than current production. However, the fiscal health of our nation,  recent and expected high national budget deficits, and pressures to  reduce federal spending mean that every federal dollar should be  scrutinized to ensure it is spent efficiently and for the most worthwhile  purposes. Maintaining a safety net for farmers is worthwhile, but during  times of record-high crop prices and farm incomes, providing payments  that do not align with principles significant to integrity, effectiveness, and  efficiency in farm bill programs raises questions about the continued need  for direct payments. In a March 2011 report, we and others proposed  options to reduce or eliminate direct payments.", "FSA monitors land usage and conducts a detailed review of a sample of  farm operating plans at the end of the year to help oversee direct  payments and other farm programs, including ACRE and counter-cyclical  payments, which require payment recipients to be actively engaged in  farming. There have been proposals to eliminate direct payments, but as  long as they remain in effect, it is worth noting several weaknesses  concerning FSA\u2019s oversight of these programs that our work identified.  First, because FSA does not have a systematic process to identify land  that may no longer be usable for agriculture and therefore eligible for  direct payments\u2014or ACRE or counter-cyclical payments\u2014FSA\u2019s reports  to Congress may underreport the extent to which land may no longer be  eligible for these payments. Second, because FSA does not regularly  update the geospatial imagery FSA county offices use to corroborate that  direct payments are made only for lands usable for agriculture, FSA could  potentially be making payments to individuals and entities that should not  be receiving them. Third, because FSA\u2019s process for selecting and  performing end-of-year reviews has key weaknesses, FSA is less able to  identify potential fraud, waste, and abuse; avert potentially improper  payments; and enforce farm bill provisions and related implementing  regulations. We acknowledge the budget constraints that, according to  FSA officials, make the case for a judgmental sample and limit the  number of end-of-year reviews FSA conducts. However, similarly to what  we reported in April 2004\u2014that FSA was not reviewing a valid sample of  farm operating plans to reasonably assess the overall level of  compliance\u2014FSA continues to select a small sample of cases to review  and does not complete reviews in a timely manner, exposing the agency  and taxpayers to potential waste, fraud, and abuse of taxpayer dollars.", "While FSA officials state that most producers are honest and comply with  eligibility requirements, it is in the interest of all producers, as well as  taxpayers, to maintain the integrity of direct payments and other farm  program payments. FSA regulations provide enforcement mechanisms  for producers found to have engaged in misrepresentation or to have  committed fraud, but FSA does not maintain comprehensive data on  payment recipients that have misrepresented their farming operation,  including data by producer name. As a result, it is unclear how  consistently FSA has pursued and recovered improper payments. In sum,  as a result of FSA\u2019s decision to not pursue a more comprehensive  oversight process\u2014including maintaining comprehensive data on  misrepresentation and tracking the referral of cases for enforcement\u2014the  number and value of improper payments and program fraud may be  underrepresented."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["In light of the need to identify potential savings in the federal budget and  questions about the continued need for direct payments, Congress should  consider eliminating or reducing these payments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that direct payments, while they remain in effect, and  other farm programs, including ACRE and counter-cyclical payments, are  made in a manner consistent with farm bill provisions and related  implementing regulations, and to minimize the potential for improper  payments, we recommend that the Secretary of Agriculture direct the  Administrator of the Farm Service Agency to take the following four  actions:", "Develop and implement a systematic process to report on land that  may no longer be usable for agriculture, as required for annual  reporting to Congress.", "Ensure the more timely and consistent regular collection and  distribution of geospatial imagery needed to corroborate that  payments are only made for lands usable for agriculture.", "Consider options within given budget constraints to improve FSA\u2019s  end-of-year reviews by selecting a larger sample of cases to review  and ensuring that these reviews are completed in a timely manner.", "Maintain comprehensive data on misrepresentation and enforcement  actions taken nationwide, as needed for management oversight and  reporting purposes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to USDA for review and comment. In  written comments, which are reproduced in appendix VII, USDA generally  agreed with two of our recommendations and disagreed with two others.  USDA also noted our Matter for Congressional Consideration to eliminate  or reduce direct payments, stating that the President\u2019s financial year 2013  budget recommended eliminating direct payments while maintaining a  strong safety net for farmers.", "Regarding our first recommendation that USDA develop and implement a  systematic process to report on land that may no longer be usable for  agriculture, as required for annual reporting to Congress, USDA  disagreed, stating that it considers its current process to be adequate.  Among other points, USDA noted that it already selects a statistical  sample of producers for spot checking to determine that all land reported  as cropland remained in cropland status for the year the spot check was  conducted. Nevertheless, as discussed in this report, only about 2,000  producers\u2500and potentially 0.13 percent of the approximately 1.6 million  producers receiving direct payments\u2500could be selected for annual spot  checks. Further, in a September 2011 report in response to a  congressional mandate USDA stated that its estimates of base acres  converted to nonfarm uses in 2009 and 2010 were likely understated. We  also note, as discussed in the report, that USDA\u2019s current procedures to  collect these data are subject to methodological limitations and  inconsistencies in how its field offices collect these data. For example,  USDA relied exclusively on surveying the 50 FSA state offices for  information on such conversions, and did not use or corroborate the state  offices\u2019 results with other possible sources of information, such as  geospatial imagery. USDA also did not provide its state offices with  guidance for collecting information on such conversions. As a result,  these offices, and their associated county offices, used a variety of  methods to collect this information. Given this very small sample and the  department\u2019s likely underestimation of the extent of conversions to  nonfarm uses, we maintain that development of an improved process is  needed for identifying land that may no longer be usable for agriculture.  For added clarity, we revised the report to make clear that USDA uses a  statistical sample and that its field offices may spot-check other producers  if there are concerns. In addition, USDA noted that the 2008 Farm Bill,  among other sources requires producers to file acreage reports on all  cropland on the farm. In response to USDA\u2019s comment, we added  clarifying language to the report to identify the sources that USDA cites as  requiring such reporting.", "Regarding the second recommendation that USDA ensure the more  timely and consistent collection and distribution of geospatial imagery  needed to corroborate that payments are only made for lands usable for  agriculture, USDA stated that it agrees that geospatial imagery is a useful  tool to identify land use changes. It also said, however, that its ability to  update this imagery more frequently would require increased funding from  Congress. As discussed in the report, USDA already leverages resources  from other agencies, such as the Department of the Interior, to help cover  the costs of collecting this imagery. Further opportunities may exist to do  so. In addition, USDA could consider options to reallocate more funding  to geospatial imagery within its existing budget resources.", "Regarding the third recommendation that USDA consider options within  given budget constraints to improve FSA\u2019s end-of-year reviews by selecting  a larger sample of cases to review and ensuring that these reviews are  completed in a timely manner, USDA disagreed. USDA stated that it  concurs that timely, high-quality end-of-year reviews are important;  however, it also stated that its current practices already meet this standard.  According to USDA, in the early 1990\u2019s its Office of Inspector General  determined that a judgmental sample completed in USDA headquarters  was the most consistent and beneficial in terms of detecting problematic  issues and potential compliance problems. In addition, USDA said that, in  consideration of efficiency, FSA has made a targeted selection and  devoted its limited resources to identifying farming operations considered  most likely to have potential payment eligibility and payment limitation  compliance issues. However, as discussed in our report, USDA selects  very few cases for end-of-year reviews. For example, in 2008 and 2009,  only 0.04 percent of operations receiving direct payments were selected. In  addition, as noted in the report, these reviews were often not done in a  timely fashion as measured by USDA\u2019s own time frames. For example, as  of September 2011, 271, or 71 percent, of 380 pending reviews for 2008  were more than 6 months past USDA\u2019s expected completion date. Given  this very small sample and the lack of timeliness associated with many of  these reviews, we continue to believe that USDA should consider options  to increase the number and improve the timeliness of these reviews. To  eliminate potential confusion about FSA\u2019s use of a judgmental sample, we  revised our third recommendation by removing the words \u201cthe quantity and  quality\u201d from an earlier draft to clarify our emphasis on improving the scope  and timeliness of these reviews.", "Regarding the fourth recommendation that USDA maintain  comprehensive data on misrepresentation and enforcement actions taken  nationwide as needed for management oversight and reporting purposes,  USDA agreed and stated there is value in maintaining data on  misrepresentation and enforcement actions. It stated that the  development of such a capability has been planned for a number of years  but that other projects, such as the implementation of the 2008 Farm Bill  and the development and implementation of a robust process for verifying  producer compliance with adjusted gross income limits have taken  precedence. We understand that USDA has many competing priorities,  but its decision to not pursue a more comprehensive oversight process\u2014 including maintaining comprehensive data on misrepresentation and  tracking the referral of cases for enforcement\u2014means the number and  value of improper payments and program fraud may be  underrepresented.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Agriculture,  appropriate congressional committees, and other interested parties.

Specifically, to provide information about the geographic distribution and  ownership characteristics of payment recipients and to determine the  dollar amount of direct payments made for land with qualifying acreage,  we obtained disaggregated data from USDA\u2019s Farm Service Agency  (FSA) indicating the number, amount, and payee for direct payments  made from program years 2003 through 2011\u2014that is, from the  program\u2019s first full year of operation through the most recent year for  which complete program data are available. In particular, we reviewed  the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (2008 Farm Bill) to  determine which crops are eligible for direct payments and determined  that we would include barley, canola, corn, cotton (upland), crambe, flax,  mustard, oats, peanuts, rapeseed, rice, safflower, sesame, sorghum,  soybeans, sunflower, and wheat in our analysis. Further, we reviewed  and evaluated USDA documents for collecting data from direct payment  recipients regarding land usage, in particular the Farm Operating Plan for  Payment Eligibility Review for individuals and entities, to identify  appropriate data elements for use in our analyses. In particular, we  obtained data from USDA\u2019s compliance share file that indicates how  producers\u2014whether individuals or entities\u2014are involved and whether  they own a particular farm field or area of land for which direct payments  were made. Producers report they either (1) own and operate the farm  (\u201cowner-operators\u201d), (2) operate but do not own the farm (\u201ctenants\u201d), or (3)  are an owner of the farm (\u201cother owners\u201d). We also obtained  disaggregated USDA data indicating the number of base acres and  planting history for each farm for which direct payments were made.  When analyzing direct payments spending, we assigned a payment  according to its program year; that is, the year in which the payment was  associated with since it is possible for payments to be made after the end  of the program year for which they are made.", "USDA does not collect the zip codes of farms with which direct payment  are associated. We therefore obtained data for the centroid point\u2014the  geometric center\u2014of the county in which the farm resides and calculated  the distance from it to the centroid point of the payment recipient\u2019s zip  code. In addition, USDA provided reliable address files for payees from  2008 through 2011. USDA data do not differentiate between the  program\u2019s base acres and a farm\u2019s other acres, and producers report one  aggregated number of acres for each crop planted. To determine the  relative percentage of base acres planted with the base acre crops, we  compared the acreage of a farm planted in a particular crop with its base  acres of that crop. Because a producer may plant 100 percent of the  farm\u2019s base acres in any crop, plus a portion of additional acres on the  farm that exceeds the base acre amount, more than 100 percent of base  acres may be planted in a certain crop. We assessed the reliability of  USDA\u2019s data by (1) performing electronic testing of required data  elements, (2) reviewing existing information about the data and the  system that produced them, and (3) interviewing agency officials  knowledgeable about the data. We determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. We used geographic  information system (\u201cGIS\u201d) software to map selected results of our  quantitative analyses. We also interviewed FSA officials regarding the  results of our data analysis; these officials indicated that they generally  found these results to be credible.", "To examine whether direct payments are aligned with principles  significant to integrity, effectiveness, and efficiency in farm bill programs,  we reviewed our past work, particularly more recent work that identifies  relevant principles to consider for farm bill reauthorization. These  principles are relevance, distinctiveness, targeting, affordability,  effectiveness, and oversight. The resulting principles and associated key  questions may not represent all potential principles that could be  considered. We collected additional data where possible to determine  how circumstances regarding direct payments may have changed more  recently and evaluated direct payments according to the principles  identified for in our earlier work. We also reviewed our March 2011 report,  which discussed observations regarding direct payments. In applying the  identified principles to direct payments, we considered information on the  program\u2019s original purpose; its potential, if any, to duplicate payments  under other programs; who benefits from the program; the nation\u2019s deficit  and debt challenges; the program\u2019s potential, if any, to have unintended  consequences; and program oversight measures taken by FSA.  However, based on our past work, we believe these principles to be  significant to integrity, effectiveness, and efficiency in farm bill programs  since 2003, when much of the 2002 Farm Bill was implemented. Further,  USDA\u2019s Office of Inspector General shares this point of view and issued a  companion report to our report using the same principles and based on its  own past work for this time frame.", "In Arizona, we visited FSA county offices in Maricopa, Pima, and Pinal counties. In  Louisiana, we visited FSA county offices in Madison, Morehouse, and Richland parishes. planted with crops in recent years, and/or (3) the county is experiencing  rapid urban development. The information gathered at these locations  cannot be generalized to the experience of all FSA county offices.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2011 to June 2012 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Principles Significant to the Integrity, Effectiveness, and Efficiency of Farm Bill Programs", "paragraphs": ["In April 2012 we identified certain principles as applicable to Congress\u2019s  deliberations for the 2012 Farm Bill and significant to the integrity,  effectiveness, and efficiency in farm bill programs, such as direct  payments. Specifically, we identified these principles to be relevance,  distinctiveness, targeting, affordability, effectiveness, and oversight. Key  questions associated with these principles are shown below. Our list of  principles may not represent all potential principles that could be  considered.  1.  Relevance: Does the program concern an issue of national interest?", "Is the program consistent with current statutes and international  agreements? Have the domestic and international food and  agriculture sectors changed significantly, or are they expected to  change, in ways that affect the program\u2019s purpose?  2.  Distinctiveness: Is the program unique and free from overlap or  duplication with other programs? Is it well coordinated with similar  programs?  3.  Targeting: Is the program\u2019s distribution of benefits consistent with  contemporary assessments of need?  4.  Affordability: Is the program affordable, given the nation\u2019s severe  budgetary constraints? Is it using the most efficient, cost-effective  approaches?  5.  Effectiveness: Are program goals clear, with a direct connection to  policies, resource allocations, and actions? Does the program  demonstrate measurable progress toward its goals? Is it generally  free of unintended consequences, including ecological, social or  economic effects? Does the program allow for adjustments to  changes in markets?  6.  Oversight: Does the program have mechanisms, such as internal  controls, to monitor compliance and help minimize fraud, waste, and  abuse in areas where these are most likely to occur?"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Ownership Characteristics of Land for Which Direct Payments Were Made", "paragraphs": ["Data from USDA\u2019s compliance share file indicate how producers\u2014 whether individuals or entities\u2014are involved and whether they own a  particular farm field or area of land for which direct payments were made.
