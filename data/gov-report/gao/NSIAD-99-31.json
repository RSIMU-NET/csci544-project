In recent years, the Army has taken steps to operate these facilities in a more business-like manner, including generating revenues from their output to support their operations. The number of these facilities has been reduced and the size of their workloads and staffs have declined significantly. This reflects the downsizing that began in the late 1980s following the end of the Cold War and the trend toward greater reliance on the private sector to meet many of the Army\u2019s needs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Army Depots and Arsenals", "paragraphs": ["The Army relies on both the public and the private sectors to meet its maintenance, overhaul, repair, and ordnance manufacturing needs.

Before the depots were established, some maintenance and repair work was performed at the Army\u2019s supply depots and arsenals and some was performed by the private sector. However, before 1941 much of the equipment in use was either repaired in the field or discarded. Depot workload can be classified into two major categories: end items and reparable secondary items. End items are the Army\u2019s ground combat systems, communications systems, and helicopters. Secondary items include various assemblies and subassemblies of major end items, including helicopter rotor blades, circuit cards, pumps, and transmissions. Several depots, particularly Tobyhanna, also do some manufacturing, but generally for small quantities of individual items needed in support of depot overhaul and repair programs.", "In 1976, 10 depots performed depot maintenance in the continental United States. By 1988 that number had been reduced to eight as a result of downsizing following the Vietnam War. Between 1989 and 1995, Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission decisions resulted in the closure of three more depots and the ongoing realignment of two others. At the end of fiscal year 1998, the 5 Army depots employed about 11,200 civilians, a 48-percent reduction from the 21,500 in fiscal year 1989. In fiscal year 1998, the depots received revenues of about $1.4 billion. Since the mid-1980s, depots have generally not been able to hire new government civilian employees because of personnel ceilings and, therefore, have used contractor personnel to supplement their workforce as necessary to meet workload requirements.", "Like the other services, operations of the Army depots are guided by legislative requirements. Section 2464 of title 10 provides for a Department of Defense (DOD)-maintained core logistics capability that is to be government-owned and -operated and that is sufficient to ensure the technical competence and resources necessary for an effective and timely response to a mobilization or other national emergency. Section 2466 prohibits the use of more than 50 percent of the funds made available in a fiscal year for depot-level maintenance and repair to contract for the performance of the work by nonfederal personnel. Section 2460 defines depot-level maintenance and repair. Section 2469 provides that DOD-performed depot-level maintenance and repair workloads valued at $3 million or more cannot be changed to contractor performance without the use of competitive procedures for competitions among public and private sector entities. A related provision in section 2470 provides that depot-level activities are eligible to compete for depot-level maintenance and repair workloads."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Arsenals", "paragraphs": ["The Army\u2019s two remaining manufacturing arsenals were established in the 1800s to provide a primary manufacturing source for the military\u2019s guns and other war-fighting equipment. Subsequently, in 1920, the Congress enacted the Arsenal Act, codified in its current form at 10 U.S.C. 4532. It requires that the Army have its supplies made in U.S. factories or arsenals provided they can produce the supplies on an economic basis. It also provides that the Secretary of the Army may abolish an arsenal considered unnecessary. It appears that the act was intended to keep government-owned arsenals from becoming idle and to preserve their existing capabilities to the extent the capabilities are considered necessary for the national defense. The Army implements the act by determining, prior to issuing a solicitation to industry, whether it is more economical to make a particular item using the manufacturing capacity of a U.S. factory or arsenal or to buy the item from a private sector source. Only if the Army decides to acquire the item from the private sector is a solicitation issued.", "As the domestic arms industry has developed, the Army has acquired from industry a greater portion of the supplies that in earlier years had been furnished by arsenals. Following World War II, the Army operated six major manufacturing arsenals. Since 1977, only two remain in operation.Table 1.1 provides information on the six post-World War II arsenals, including operating periods and major product lines.", "Today the two arsenals manufacture or remanufacture a variety of weapons and weapon component parts, including towed howitzers, gun mounts, and gun tubes. At the end of fiscal year 1998, the Rock Island and Watervliet facilities employed a total of about 2,430 civilians, a 46-percent reduction from a total of about 4,500 employees at the end of fiscal  year 1989.

The services reimburse the working capital fund with revenues earned by the depots and arsenals for completed work based on hourly labor rates that are intended to recover operating costs, including material, labor, and overhead expenses. While Army depots and arsenals are primarily focused on providing the fighting forces with required equipment to support readiness objectives, the industrial fund was intended to optimize productivity and operational efficiencies. Army industrial activities are supposed to operate in a business-like manner, but they are expected to break even and to generate neither profits nor losses. Nonetheless, these military facilities may sometimes find it difficult to follow business like practices. For example, Army requirements may make it necessary to maintain capability to perform certain industrial operations even though it would not seem economical\u2014from a business perspective\u2014to do so. Systems with older technology must be maintained even though acquiring repair parts becomes more difficult and expensive. If military customers need products that are inefficient to produce, the depots and arsenals must produce them anyway.", "To compensate the depots and arsenals for the cost of maintaining underutilized capacity that might be needed in the future, these activities receive supplemental funding in the operations and maintenance appropriation under an account entitled \u201cunderutilized plant capacity.\u201d As shown in table 1.2, funding of this account has been reduced in recent years. Army officials stated that the reduction was made to fund other higher priority programs; however, they stated that in future years, this trend would likely be reversed.", "The Army Materiel Command (AMC) and its subordinate commands hold semiannual workload conferences to review, analyze, document, and assign work to the five depots. In contrast, the arsenals actively market their capabilities to DOD program management offices to identify potential customers. Despite differences in how they obtain their work, depots and arsenals are alike in how they set rates for their work. The process they use begins about 18 months prior to the start of the fiscal year in which maintenance and manufacturing will be performed. Depot and arsenal managers propose hourly rates to recover operating costs based on the anticipated level of future workload requirements, but rates are ultimately determined at the Department of Army and DOD levels.", "Rate setting is an iterative process that begins with the industrial activities and the Industrial Operations Command (IOC), a subordinate command under AMC. After they reach agreement, the proposed rates, which are included in consolidated depot and arsenal budgets, are forwarded for review up the chain of command. These commands frequently revise the rates initially requested by IOC based on past performance and other evolving workload and staffing information. When rates are reduced, the industrial activities must find ways to cut costs or increase workload to end the year with the desired financial outcome, which is usually to have a cumulative zero net operating result. However, even if the proposed rates are approved without modification, the performing industrial activity can end the year in better or worse financial shape than originally anticipated, depending on whether or not actual costs and workload are as anticipated. This can necessitate a rate increase in a subsequent year to offset the losses of a prior year, or a rate reduction to offset profits.", "Depots and arsenals employ direct labor workers who charge time to finite job taskings, earning revenue for the business. In addition, they employ a number of indirect workers, such as shop supervisors and parts expediters, whose time cannot be related to a finite job order but nevertheless support the depot maintenance and arsenal manufacturing process. Likewise, the industrial facilities also employ a variety of general and administrative overhead personnel such as production managers, technical specialists, financial managers, personnel officers, logisticians, contracting officers, computer programmers, and computer operators.While the time spent by these two categories of overhead personnel is difficult to relate to a finite job order, their costs are nevertheless reflected in the overall rates charged by the industrial activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Depot Command and Management Structures", "paragraphs": ["AMC is responsible for management control and oversight of the Army\u2019s industrial facilities.

That began to change in November 1997, when under a pilot program, management responsibility for workloading and overseeing work at the Tobyhanna Army Depot was transferred to the Communications-Electronics Command, the depot\u2019s major customer. The Army completed the transfer of operational command and control for the Tobyhanna depot in October 1998 and plans to complete transfer of management responsibilities for the other depots in October 1999. Each depot will be aligned with its major customer, which is also the coordinating inventory control point for the depot\u2019s products. Table 1.3 summarizes the upcoming management relationship for each Army depot and lists its principal workloads.", "Upon completion of the transfers of management responsibilities for depots, the IOC workforce will be reduced by about 280 positions out of a current staff level of about 1,400 personnel at the end of fiscal year 1998. The gaining commands will not get additional manpower positions. AMC is assuming that the gaining commands will be able to take on these added responsibilities with no increase in staff. These reductions are in addition to the 1,720 personnel reductions that IOC previously planned to make within the individual depots during fiscal years 1998 and 1999\u2014many of which were put on hold because of section 364 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998. Section 364 prohibits the Army from initiating a reduction in force at five Army depots participating in the demonstration and testing of the Army Workload and Performance System (AWPS) until after the Secretary of the Army certifies to the Congress that AWPS is fully operational. It exempts reductions undertaken to implement 1995 BRAC decisions.", "Current plans call for the arsenals to remain under the management and control of IOC. Also, the arsenals are not currently precluded by  section 364 from reducing their workforce. Accordingly, to adjust the workforce to more accurately reflect the current workload, the two arsenals are in the process of reducing their workforce by a total of over 300 positions out of 2,700.", "Figure 1.1 shows the locations of the Army\u2019s industrial facilities and each major command to be responsible for management control and oversight."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Assessment of Changes in Staffing Requirements", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, several audit reports have highlighted the Army\u2019s inability to support its personnel requirements on the basis of analytically based workload forecasts.

In several more recent audits, the Army Audit Agency recommended declaration of a material weakness in relating personnel requirements to workload and budget. In DOD\u2019s fiscal year 1997 Annual Statement of Assurance on Management Controls, DOD noted a material weakness in its manpower requirements determination system. It noted that the current system for manpower requirements determination lacked the ability to link workload, manpower requirements, and dollars. Thus, the Army was not capable of rationally predicting future civilian manpower requirements based on workload. As a result, managers at all levels did not have the information they needed to improve work performance, improve organizational efficiency, and determine and support staffing needs, manpower budgets, and personnel reductions.", "In response to concerns about its workforce planning, the Army has sought to implement a two-pronged approach to evaluating its workforce requirements. This includes implementing a 12-step methodology analysis and developing an automated system for depots, arsenals, and ammunition plants that is referred to as AWPS. In February 1998, we reported that the Army had developed this corrective action plan to resolve its material weakness but that it might have difficulty achieving the expected completion date.", "The 12-step methodology, adopted by the Army in April 1996, is a largely manual process that provides a snapshot of personnel requirements designed to link personnel requirements to workload at various headquarters commands and organizations. The methodology includes analyses of missions and functions, opportunities to improve processes, workload drivers, workforce options (including civilian versus using military personnel and contracting versus using in-house personnel), and organizational structure. It also looks for ways to consolidate and create more effective use of indirect and overhead personnel assigned to Army industrial activities.

The contractor concluded that a computer-based system developed by the Naval Sea Logistics Center, Pacific, for use in naval shipyards provided the greatest potential for documenting personnel requirements at Army industrial activities. Consequently, in March 1996, the Army provided funding to a support contractor and the Navy to develop and implement a modified version of the Navy\u2019s computer-based process at Army maintenance depots to support the maintenance function.", "The AWPS system is designed to facilitate evaluation of what-if questions, including workload and personnel requirements analyses.

However, our work indicates that the Army\u2019s plan for reducing staff levels at its depots was developed primarily in response to affordability concerns and was intended to lower the hourly rates depots charge their customers. The plan was not supported by a detailed comparison of planned workload and related personnel requirements. Army officials stated that incorporation of the 12-step process into AWPS will help the Army address affordability while directly linking manpower to funded workload, assuming that the Army ensures accuracy and reliability of AWPS data input, both by the planners and via the shop floor.", "In July 1996, as part of its review of proposed rates, AMC headquarters determined that the hourly rates proposed by the Army depots for maintenance work in fiscal year 1998 were generally unaffordable. It concluded that depot customers could not afford to purchase the work they needed.

Unlike the other depots where IOC set a lower rate, IOC set the rate at the Red River depot higher than depot officials requested. However, the rate set was still not high enough to cover estimated costs at that depot. An IOC official stated that if the Red River depot had charged its customers based on the estimated costs of operations at that facility, including recovery of previous operating losses, the composite rate would have been over  $174 per hour in fiscal year 1998. Having made the decision to reduce the rates through staffing cuts, what remained to be done was to develop a depot staff reduction plan.

We analyzed these factors and determined that (1) the direct labor requirements were based on unproven productivity assumptions, (2) the overhead personnel requirements were based on an imprecise ratio analysis, and (3) unrealistic quantities of overtime were factored into the analysis.  Table 2.2 shows the number of positions originally scheduled for elimination at each depot for fiscal years 1998 and 1999.", "To determine and justify the number of required direct labor employees, IOC divided the total anticipated workload (measured in direct labor hours) by a productive workyear factor. This factor represents the amount of work a direct labor employee is estimated to be able to accomplish in  1 fiscal year. IOC used a variety of assumptions to support its position that the number of depot personnel could be reduced. IOC\u2019s analysis used productive factors that are substantially higher than either the DOD productive workyear standard or the historical average achieved in the recent past by Army depots. For example, IOC\u2019s analysis assumed that each Corpus Christi depot direct labor employee would accomplish 1,694 hours of billable time, not including paid overtime hours, in a workyear. However, while DOD\u2019s productive workyear standard for direct labor depot maintenance employees is 1,615 hours per person, the Corpus Christi depot direct labor employees averaged a reported 1,460 hours of billable time in fiscal year 1997 and 1,528 hours in fiscal year 1996. By using the higher productivity level, the IOC analysis showed the Corpus Christi depot would need 14 percent fewer employees, based on the change in this factor. Table 2.3 provides a comparison of IOC\u2019s worker productivity assumptions for each depot and the actual reported productivity levels for fiscal year 1997.", "While the DOD productive workyear standard assumes that each direct labor worker will achieve 1,615 hours of billable time each year, the depots have been unable to achieve this goal. Several factors affect this productivity level. First, due to workforce seniority, Corpus Christi depot workers have recently reported using an average of 196 hours of paid annual leave per year. This is higher than the reported 175 hours of annual leave used on average at all Army activities as well as the reported 167-hour average annual leave used at other government agencies. In addition, Corpus Christi depot employees used a reported average of about 112 hours of sick leave per year\u2014more sick leave than they earn in a given year and about 50 percent higher than other Army, DOD, and government activities. The reported Army-wide average sick leave use was 73 hours; the DOD average, 78 hours; and the governmentwide average,  74 hours. Several depot management officials commented that while they monitor sick leave usage, it has increased partly as a result of the older workforce and partly as a result of the Federal Employees Family Friendly Leave Act, Public Law 103-338, October 22, 1994, which allows the use of sick leave to care for family members and for bereavement purposes. Second, because most depot employees at the Corpus Christi and Red River depots are working a compressed work schedule of four 10-hour workdays, they receive 100 hours of paid holiday leave per year. In contrast, a government employee who works a 5-day 8-hour workweek, receives 80 hours of paid holiday leave per year. Third, the depots\u2019 direct labor workers charge varying amounts of overhead (nonbillable) time for training, shop cleanup, job administration, temporary supervision, certain union activities, and other indirect activities. In fiscal year 1997, direct labor workers\u2019 charges to overhead job orders ranged from a reported average of 125 hours at the Letterkenny depot to 205 hours at the Corpus Christi depot."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overhead Labor Requirements Based on Questionable Ratio Analysis", "paragraphs": ["To determine and justify the number of required overhead employees, IOC used a ratio analysis that essentially allowed a specified percentage of overhead employees for each direct labor worker.

IOC developed its methodology and the ratios based on actual direct and overhead employee ratios for a private-sector firm tasked with operating a government-owned, contractor-operated Army ammunition plant.", "Different ratios were assigned based on the number of functions each depot organization performs\u2014such as maintenance, ammunition storage, or base operation support. The IOC ratio analysis assumed that for every 100 direct labor employees, a single-function depot organization could have no more than 40 overhead personnel, a dual-function depot organization no more than 50 overhead personnel, and a three-function depot organization no more than 60 overhead personnel. Table 2.4 provides a summary of ratios IOC used to determine the number of overhead employees.", "A number of concerns have been raised about the use of these ratios. For example, in 1997 the then Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Logistics) stated that the use of such ratios may provide only marginal utility in identifying potentially excess employees and inefficient depot operations. He noted that ratio analysis may not consider the value of productivity enhancements that result from the acquisition of increasingly sophisticated technology to accomplish depot missions, which in turn causes direct labor requirements to decrease, while the overhead labor requirements increase. Depot officials similarly noted that technology enhancements over the past few years have significantly reduced direct labor requirements, while sometimes increasing overhead in the depots, particularly when training and maintenance costs increase.

Using overtime could provide a cushion against workload shortages, as opposed to a short-term alternative of hiring people to cover unanticipated increases in workloads; however, to plan for average overtime rates of up to 15.8 percent appears to be beyond the norm for such types of activities, particularly when unplanned requirements could drive the overtime usage substantially above the levels that were planned. For example, we compared the 1997 Bureau of Labor Statistics durable goods manufacturing work week, including overtime, which averaged about  42.8 hours, with comparable data for Corpus Christi and noted that a 15.8-percent overtime figure corresponds to a 46.3 hour work week, while 30 and 50 percent overtime figures correspond to workweeks of 52 and  60 hours, respectively."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Attempted Implementation of the Staff Reduction Plan at Corpus Christi Depot Proved Chaotic and Had Unintended Consequences", "paragraphs": ["AMC efforts to implement its planned reductions at its Corpus Christi depot proved to be extremely chaotic and resulted in unintended consequences.

In commenting on a draft of this report, DOD officials stated that this situation was caused by a variety of factors, including lack of access to Navy managed parts, lack of experience with some Navy-unique systems, and the fact that Navy helicopters were in worse physical condition than most comparable Army helicopters being inducted for overhaul work. Cumulative financial losses on the completed overhaul and repair of 29 Navy Seahawk helicopters are estimated at about $40.1 million, and total reported losses on completed Navy helicopters exceed $80 million.", "Recognizing these problems, the Army has implemented a process reengineering plan to reduce the average repair cycle from the current  515 days to 300 days. As previously noted, the Navy is considering shifting repair work to field teams at Navy units. Since Navy work is about 30 percent of Corpus Christi\u2019s workload, the depot could lose 400 to  500 direct labor positions and increase its estimated future operating rates by about $20 per hour. Similarly, time charged against the overhaul of the T-53 engines used on the Huey helicopter was about 52,000 direct labor hours for 60 engines, compared to the projected goal of about  23,000 hours.

Workers in seven different workload combination areas were involved in the program and received training in multiple skill areas. In the rubber and plastics forming skill area, cross-trained workers got a pay raise in addition to the satisfaction of knowing they were multi-skilled and more valuable employees. Maintenance facility managers said that the added flexibility of multi-skilling allowed them to use a limited number of workers more cost effectively and to be more responsive to emerging requirements.

At a minimum, the plan should include requirements and milestones for effectively downsizing the remaining depot infrastructure, as needed, and an assessment of the overall impact from competing plans and initiatives that advocate increased use of private sector firms and regional repair facilities for depot-level workloads.", "If a decision is made to retain in-house capabilities, we also recommend that the Secretary of the Army develop a long-term strategy, with shorter term milestones for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of Army industrial facilities, that would, at a minimum, include those recommendations stated in chapters 2 through 4 of this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD concurred with each of our recommendations and discussed actions it has completed, underway, or planned as appropriate for each recommendation.
